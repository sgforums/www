            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Rat</span></strong> people are so charming and attractive they are always surrounded by friends and admirers. They can also be lone tumbleweeds, seldom making lasting friendships. Known as Perfectionists, they never want to lose face. It takes an understanding friend to get them to "put on the dancing plumes." Rat people have vivid imagination and are known for creating extraordinarily magic moments in time. Not surprisingly, the sensitive Rats have the gift of insight and clairvoyance, so you better watch out what you think around them! Rats enjoy being leaders and pacesetters and usually enjoy extraordinary success in life.<br><br>Famous RAT people: Richard Nixon, Shakespeare, Prince Charles, Julia Child, Louis Armstrong, Prince Andrew, Andrew Lloyd-Webber, Kathleen Battle, Albert Finney<br><br>METAL RAT<br>Jan 31, 1900 to Feb 18, 1901<br>Jan 28, 1960 to Feb 14, 1961<br><br>If ten people are deserted on a desert island, one of them will lead everyone to safety and that person will undoubtedly be the decisive clear-thinking Metal Rat. This is a natural born leader who inspires everyone through unparalleled leadership! Quite the visionary, the idealistic Rat will see cathedrals in the middle of the desert and make believers out of non-believers. He or she has all the traits necessary to win and keep friends, charm, sincerity, trustworthiness, as well as a sense of humor and grand adventure. The enormously capable Metal Rats are very successful in their career, with financial rewards keeping them forever in clover. When it comes to love, Metal Rats' hearts tend to be a bit brittle because they have been wounded by past love affairs. However, when the Rats finally find the right person, they will do all they can to pursue love, using every means at their disposal. Love becomes a high priority.<br><br>WATER RAT<br>Feb 18, 1912 to Feb 5, 1913<br>Feb 15, 1972 to Feb 2, 1973<br><br>When water rats talk, people listen. Commanding and eloquent, always the center of attention, the Water Rats also have a soft side that endears them to the world. When the world needs, Water Rats are there. Humanitarian fighters against hunger, illness, sadness, they try to bring happiness to others through their compassionate endeavors and smiling warmth. When the world wants a friend, it's the loyal and sincere Water Rat which draws them in. The Water Rat has a successful career but money-wise, it's pretty much middle of the road. Changing free-spending ways could lead to financial security if they are willing to make the effort. Their natural charisma attracts members of the opposite sex like wildfire, but Water Rats often don't set their standards high enough and are quite indiscriminate in seeking love affairs, until they finally settle down later in life. Once this happens, they advance pretty far exhibiting oodles of charm with their loved ones.<br><br>WOOD RAT<br>Feb 5, 1924 to Jan 23, 1925<br>Feb 2, 1984 to Feb 19, 1985<br><br>Wood rats don't care about firecrackers and whiz-bam-boom special effects. Still waters run very deep! Somewhat introverted and shy in social gatherings, Wood Rats nevertheless make a big impact when it comes to career, finance, and entrepreneurial projects. A big ego keeps this one focused on the big picture, talking only when necessary to make the next move. The enterprising Wood Rat knows and lives the rules in human dynamics: compromise, flexibility, "playing it by ear," the Golden Rule, and generosity. In the Love Boat, don't expect the Wood Rat to whisper a lot of sweet nothings; again, still waters run deep. They don't need words, they ACT their love, showering affection, kindness, and respect on their loved ones, who love them in return.<br><br>FIRE RAT<br>Jan 24, 1936 to Feb 10, 1937<br>Feb 19, 1996 to Feb 6, 1997<br><br>With bon mots and sparking wordplay, the witty Fire Rat engages in spirited discussions and debates on all matters of intellectual inquiry. These free spirits like to find their own way in life and resent well-meaning friends who suggest other ways of doing things. They are independent, that's all, certainly not stubborn, and this independence leads Fire Rats to pursue adventure over status quo, competition over coasting, and persistence over giving up. Free spirits are naturally attracted to other free spirits who approach love with interdependence, never clinging or cloying. Fire Rats are like Flamenco dancers, passion exploding with sensuality. Ardent lovers for sure, Fire Rats are deeply devoted to friends, family, and loved ones.<br><br>EARTH RAT<br>Feb 10, 1948 to Jan 28, 1949<br>Feb 7 , 2008 to Jan 25, 2009<br><br>The early years of the Earth Rat's career seemed like nothing but burning the midnight oil at the time. But in retrospect, the strong work ethic, discipline, caution, and long hours are what led to their current life of abundance for themselves and their families. Today there is more time to enjoy the fruits of their labor and to do the things they put off for too long. Life is filled with weekend escapades, longer excursions, and membership in the Unofficial Adventurer's Club, which requires its "members" to live life to its fullest. One very fulfilling area of their lives is Love &amp; Romance, hearts and flowers all the time. Earth Rats are very dependable souls and always attentive towards the needs of their loved ones. Together, they share a love that will last for all the moons of their lives.</div>

Despite their kindness, they can be extremely short-tempered. The rage of Tigers is terrible to behold but it also gives them the adrenaline needed for the sublimest of bravery. The Tiger is also a deep thinker and can make the most astonishing intellectual connections, with great mental agility. On the negative side, they tend to be suspicious and a bit self-centered, OK selfish, and indecisive. Above everything, however, the Tiger stands as a supreme emblem of protection over human life, admirable always.<br><br>Famous TIGER people: Sun Yat-Sen, Jiang Zemin, Ho Chih Minh,Princess Anne, General Charles de Gaulle, Charles Lindbergh, Beethoven, Queen Beatrix, King Juan Carlos I, Jonas Salk, Queen<br><br>METAL TIGER<br>Feb 17, 1950 to Feb 5, 1951<br>Feb 14, 2010 to Feb 2, 2011<br><br>When opportunity knocks, Metal Tigers open the door.

Luckily for everyone else, they realize that life is a two-way street and they do their best to bring out the best in others, doing so with great warmth and kindness. Earth Tigers make loyal friends and are remembered for their thoughtful ways. Financially, they're so-so. No, not bad, just so-so, unless they happen to be extremely business oriented then it's OK. When it comes to love and relationships, Earth Tigers are typical passionate Tigers. While not great romantics (sometimes they'd rather be off working while spouses stay home waiting), they certainly are faithful. In the long run, relationships do work out, and the couple's happiness is definitely worth waiting for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rabbit</strong></span> people love to play under the moonlight. Quite fanciful, they respond to the power and beauty of nature and are always being pulled one way and the other to examine what they find. They are the luckiest of all twelve signs! But, it's more a result of "the harder I work, the luckier I get" than taking crazy chances. They are cautious, conservative, bright, and have a good head for business. Supremely pleasant to have around, these affectionate, naturally shy peacemakers seldom ever lose their temper. They sometimes appear to be singing the blues because of a natural but short-lived tendency towards despondency. Rabbits always inspire deep admiration and trust.<br><br>Famous RABBIT people: Hu Shih, Hu Yao-Bang, Kim Young Sam, Sally Ride, Leonardo Di Caprio, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Arturo Toscanini, Leontyne Price, Clare Boothe Luce, Tiger Woods.<br><br>METAL RABBIT Horoscope<br>Feb 6, 1951 to Jan 26, 1952<br>Feb 3, 2011 to Jan 22, 2012<br><br>Metal Rabbits make a very big deal about the true lasting values of life. To them, fame is ephemeral but reputation is forever. They are the background movers and shakers, never seeking the limelight themselves but always paving the way for others to become successful. Among Metal Rabbits you may find the book agents, the art critics, teachers, political campaigners and the great organizers. Although too conservative to catapult themselves onto the map, the successful people who have made it because of them are legends. Though not social butterflies, Metal Rabbits are very likable and have tons of friends because of their sincerity and unabashed kindness. Financially, they need to be more conservative! A speculative nature makes them venture into risky territory. If they don't watch their pockets, they're in big time trouble. Love Life, on the other hand, is nearly perfect. The very caring ways of the Metal Rabbit lead them to experience poetically quiet and at the same time exquisitely intense relationships.<br><br>WATER RABBIT<br>Jan 29, 1903 to Feb 15, 1904<br>Jan 25, 1963 to Feb 12, 1964<br><br>High on a mountain bluff, the Water Rabbit enjoys the immensity of solitude. Like typical Rabbits, the Water Rabbit is quiet, but don't let this fool you. Water Rabbits are always STRONG silent types. Beneath the passive reserve lies a smoldering ember ready to enjoy life to the fullest extent possible. In solitude there is peace, spirit, nature, strength, music, and a strong philosophical current that keeps anchor in the soul of Water Rabbit. The Neon and Glitter People truly admire the Water Rabbits for their individuality, not unlike that of the lone rugged cowboy seen against jagged mountain peaks. Water Rabbits make friends easily, but have a tendency to be too trusting. Gullibility is not a safe trait to have! Water Rabbits are happy to find creative outlets through their very fulfilling careers. Their determination to rise to the top makes them well regarded in their fields. When it comes to making money, it's "easy come, easy go" - money just slips through their fingers and Rabbits gasp with bewilderment, "Where did it go?" Time to find a good financial advisor. "Easy come, easy go" is also the mantra of their love lives. Falling in love too easily leads to heartbreak. Once they learn to hold back and find true love, they throw away romantic interludes for love everlasting.<br><br>WOOD RABBIT<br>Feb 14, 1915 to Feb 2, 1916<br>Feb 11, 1975 to Jan 30, 1976<br><br>From the time Wood Rabbits were small children delighting in Story Time, Wood Rabbits have pursued knowledge. Charming conversationalists, they regale others with anecdotal glimpses into literature, history, and current events. They are lifelong members of the Legendary Rendezvous for People in the Arts and are frequenters of bookstores, libraries, and halls of academia. Their innate cunning makes them superb players not only in the game of chess but the game of life. No wrong moves allowed! Wood Rabbits are alert to new experiences, hang-loose philosophically, and very generous to friends and love ones. But, here's some good advice to Wood Rabbits everywhere! Find a good financial advisor. You might think it's hip to be The Big Spender, but, hey, look at it this way, what are you going to do on that rainy day? Hmmmmm? A little frugality will do you a world of good. Love Life for the Wood Rabbit is filled with rapturous sweetness, so incredibly generous in affection, it puts the partner's head in a spin. Fireplace cuddles are the way of life.<br><br>FIRE RABBIT<br>Feb 2, 1927 to Jan 22, 1928<br>Jan 29, 1987 to Feb 16, 1988<br><br>The Fire Rabbits stand out from the crowd of other Rabbits. You might expect Rabbits to be passive, quiet, and loners. Not so, the Fire Rabbits. These extroverts are leaders of the pack! Fire Rabbits intuitively sense the right way to bring out the best in themselves and other people. They are brave creatures, thirsty for life. Others eagerly follow them because of the promise of adventure and great fun, and they are never disappointed. Visionary explorers, Fire Rabbits inspire others to see beyond the surface. Unlike other Rabbits, Fire Rabbits have the potential to be truly rich. Enormously capable and hardworking, Fire Rabbits can achieve great things others cannot match. Captains in charge of their lives, they experience smooth sailing in their careers. The multifaceted Fire Rabbits experience great versatility in their lives. Their interests can range from Agatha Christie to bungee jumping, from caviar to enchiladas, from snowskiing to Scrabble. Speaking of Scrabble, spell Love: L-O-V-E is very kind to Fire Rabbits. Excellent lovers, they rapturously charm their partners with cozy fireplaces, affectionate hugs, and, most of all, undying support and loyalty.<br><br>EARTH RABBIT<br>Feb 19, 1939 to Feb 7, 1940<br>Feb 16, 1999 to Feb 4, 2000<br><br>In the middle of the night, the Earth Rabbit has light bulbs flashing, ideas and lots of them. At daybreak, this entrepreneurial Rabbit guided by inspiration, ventures into unknown territory and starts new projects, programs, and activities, rounding up enthusiastic people willing to back him/her all the way. Earth Rabbits are pioneers and we offer a standing ovation for the many wonderful innovations they develop. Only thing is, as hardworking and serious about their work as they certainly are, they get bored easily - the grass is always greener somewhere else. Consequently, they want to find bigger and bigger work and job hop from one place to another, sometimes not following through on prior commitments. Financial life suffers in the process. They really have trouble handling their finances. They don't have trouble with Love, however. Hearth and home symbolize love without end for the loving Earth Rabbits. Attention to the relationship and growth as a couple are important priorities. As a result, love is always bubbling over with the afterglow of warmth and affection.</div>

Soaring high into the serene heavens, they can be stubborn, passionate, excitable, honest, and brave, wear purple and walk barefoot in public fountains. They listen to their own drummer, thank you very much, while the rest of the world stands in amazement. People always admire their individuality and feisty personality. Dragons are capable of doing great work for mankind and they inspire trust in almost everyone. The Dragon symbolizes life and growth and is said to bring the five blessings: harmony, virtue, riches, fulfillment and longevity.<br><br>Famous Dragon People: Ringo Starr, Edward Heath, Dr. Seuss, John Lennon, Harold Wilson, Helen Keller, Pearl S.

Everything these Dragons touch turns to gold. They hold top positions of responsibility in their careers and are revered for their pearls of wisdom and dynamic leadership. The Metal Dragon, you see, has always had the "right stuff" to make it big, ambition, unflagging enthusiasm, supreme confidence, intelligence, and the quirky creativity necessary to make a beautiful life. Life is beautiful, no worries for the Metal Dragon, who is one of the few who experience the freedom of true security. Love and Romance are anointed, too, by "the touch." Both male and female Metal Dragons make good lovers. The Male is very expressive and needs to be the major focus of attention for his loved one. The female spends hours lost in romantic daydreams about idyllic love affairs, slow dancing under moonlight nights, intoxicated by the headiness of champagne. Love, too, is smooth sailing for these Dragons.<br><br>WATER DRAGON<br>Jan 27, 1952 to Feb 13, 1953<br>Jan 23, 2012 to Feb 9, 2013<br><br>One thing about being on top of a pedestal is the likelihood of falling off. Well, not so the Water Dragon! Born with a silver spoon in their mouth and the proverbial Midas Touch, life is magical and filled with treasures. Around every turn, luck just seems to fall in their laps. To paraphrase a popular saying, it's really because the harder they work, the luckier they get. Passionate about their work, their determination and visionary zeal lead them to expect, and receive, both personal and monetary awards. Their big secret is having just the right combination of right-brained creativity and left-brained intelligence, a sense of humor, and being open to the concept of Serendipity. Water Dragons also sit on a pedestal when it comes to Love, especially the male who likes, in essence, to be fed peeled white grapes by admiring loved ones. Both male and female Water Dragons are very attractive and very sexy to their partners and Love and Marriage always comes with the butterflies in the stomach feeling.<br><br>WOOD DRAGON<br>Feb 16, 1904 to Feb 3, 1905<br>Feb 13, 1964 to Feb 1, 1965<br><br>Dragons are majestic creatures. These Dragons are the chivalrous knights and guardian angels of life, generous with their friendship, compassionate, even heroic, in their deeds. Showing great tolerance towards others, they move easily among all social strata and travel extensively, opening their minds to new things. Brave as matadors, their courageous lives are truly inspiring. Natural curiosity leads Wood Dragons to pursue very interesting career paths. The dichotomy is they are successful human beings but not all that successful in their careers, despite all the help they get from friends and mentors. Fortune comes to them anyway! Now, as you know, the chances of winning the lottery are pretty slim, but Wood Dragons just might do it. Rainy days or sunny, good fortune seems to shine on these money magnets, just like magic. The Wood Dragon is steady as a rock when it comes to Love &amp; Relationships. They just don't believe in love at first sight. To them, love, relationships, and marriage follow a progressive course, evolving naturally and slowly out of friendship. Once the love bug catches them, their love is deep and passionate. The Wood Dragon partner is loving and supportive of the loved one's needs and love is never taken for granted.<br><br>FIRE DRAGON<br>Feb 3, 1916 to Jan 22, 1917<br>Jan 31, 1976 to Feb 17, 1977<br><br>Downright electrifying, Fire Dragons breathe vigor and power. These natural leaders smile at adversity, turn complainers into optimists, and lead lives as inspired as a Beethoven Sonata. They are square shooters in dealing with individuals and are often called upon to mediate disputes. Because they care so much about people, Fire Dragons like to support charitable causes and bring friends together for elegant evening soirees. These Dragons are fired with ambition, unflagging enthusiasm, and intelligence and enjoy most impressive careers as a result. Despite all the money they make, Finance is a big question mark. Money is easy come easy go. Until they control their spending habits, money will just go flying in the wind. Romantics at heart, Fire Dragons can't help playing Matchmaker. They're pretty lucky, too! As for themselves, they ooze charisma and never need anyone to fix them up. Successful in love, often placed on pedestals, Fire Dragons are attractive and have fire in the belly. The opposite sex feels very secure.<br><br>EARTH DRAGON<br>Jan 23, 1928 to Feb 9, 1929<br>Feb 17, 1988 to Feb 5, 1989<br><br>If you make friends with the Earth Dragon, you have a friend for life! Friendship is a big-time commitment which they show through uncommon kindness, caring, and giving spirit. When youngsters, Earth Dragons are valued by their teachers and playmates and when older, by their superiors, colleagues, and social circle. It's no wonder! Hardworking and talented, these well-rounded Dragons have a lively imagination which transforms the atmosphere. They are able to do many things well and receive many accolades during their very successful careers and good money to boot. These Dragons are wildly impulsive in money matters. If they see it, they buy it. When they buy it, it's out of sight out of mind, forgotten in the toy box. Not too late to change these wasteful spending habits, you know! Like most Dragons, those of the Earth don't like to rush Love. They like doing what comes naturally, steady rhythm, beginning from friendship and igniting into the exhilaration of falling in love when it's time. Earth Dragons want long-lasting relationships, not tumbling tumble weeds. After the male dragon has gotten over his playboy stage, he is the biggest convert of all to the joys of the everlasting Relationship.</div>

The Snake is so intense and passionate, just as likely to take out the castanets as to climb mountains of snow. Snake year people are charming and romantic, often planning delightful hideaway surprises. Possessing tremendous wisdom, they are deep, quiet thinkers, calm by nature, but most intense. They often get involved in great causes, bigger than life, and often serve as mentors to the young. To paraphrase Confucius, they have a kind of inner beauty that arises, hovers, then comes to nest.

Their farsighted nature has led them to predict what it takes to have a successful life and do what it takes to make it happen. Talent, personality, intelligence, compassion, these are just a few of the Metal Snake's outstanding attributes. Not afraid of having their noses to the grindstone, they've had their share of long weary days and tidal wave exhaustion. Their careers took off like gangbusters. Life is easier now, and Metal Snakes are proud of their many accomplishments. Their strong sense of responsibility and dedication to work has led to financial fortune, fulfillment, and security for themselves and their family. The Metal Snake is a Snake Charmer when it comes to love. Metal Snakes have no trouble attracting the opposite sex who are generous with their love, gifts, and spoiling kindnesses.

They are the practical, useful, dependable people of earth who are tinged with enough imagination themselves to make life very interesting indeed. Water Snakes exude warmth and never lack for friends, who are always invigorated by the Snakes' boundless optimism and playfulness. Water Snakes possess a wealth of sterling attributes that bring career success within their grasp - eventually. From small to big, they are always moving up in their career ladder and sooner or later, they will reach the top. Financial life is not great, but not bad, bulls and bears always striving for even balance. Water Snakes take great care of their relationships with friends and they make excellent companions to while away the hours. Love Life is somewhat of a teeter-totter, going up, coming down, gradually striking a healthy balance. Eventually, they find someone to love who will fully commit to them in return. Once this happens, setbacks will be a thing of the past.<br><br>WOOD SNAKE<br>Feb 4, 1905 to Jan 24, 1906<br>Feb 2, 1965 to Jan 20, 1966<br><br>Wood Snakes dream of success, fame, and fortune, but without really having the wherewithal to make things happen. Even though they are strongly career minded, they have trouble making goals and too many opportunities pass them by. Dreams of better jobs lead them into changing positions several times through their working years. Despite it all, life is good for the Wood Snake. They generally have good fortune and they have "abundance" through other means, such as good health, wonderful friends, strength of character, an elegant lifestyle, and resilient spirit. What about Romance? Hmmmm? Of all creatures, Wood Snakes are most in need of knowing how to tango (as in,"it takes two"to do so!). Relationships always have cracks. Snakes have to learn how to give a little and how to hold back in order to accommodate the needs of the partner as well as themselves. A stubborn streak and a tendency towards self-absorption make communication difficult. Through the cracks, flowers grow and when they do, Wood Snakes are very responsible and sensual lovers and beautiful to behold.<br><br>FIRE SNAKE<br>Jan 23, 1917 to Feb 10, 1918<br>Feb 18, 1977 to Feb 6, 1978<br><br>The Fire Snake is like a meteor in the sky, brilliant and alive. With spellbinding eloquence, the Snake converses with conviction on a broad range of topics, but realizes that good conversation lies as much in the listening as the talking. The Snake does both very well, raising communication to a very high and elegant art. People love to be in the company of this very graceful Fire Snake, who is always pleasant, provocative, humorous, and quick witted. With split second reflexes, they are constantly conceiving new ideas and coming up with new schemes. This entrepreneurial spirit makes headlines and the Fire Snake is much admired. Because of their ambition, perseverance, and infinite patience, and wise financial moves made early in life, their fortunes grow steadily. By the time middle age arrives, financial fortune is truly theirs. Relationships follow the same path, through faithfulness, perseverance, and willingness to make relationships really work, the future is always bright.<br><br>EARTH SNAKE<br>Feb 10, 1929 to Jan 29, 1930<br>Feb 6, 1989 to Jan 26, 1990<br><br>Before we get to the good things, let's get this out of the way: The Earth Snake can be, in a word, snaky. Seductive and alluring, they can wrap their prey in a clever web almost impossible to escape. Their disarming manner has its charms but can backfire, when people run like crazy for blessed relief. But, oh, my, how Earth Snakes can shine. Their inborn magnetism, quick response to the needy, and unaffected love for their fellow men compel support from high and low alike. People generally gravitate towards these very graceful creatures who are citizens of the world, as much at home on the tennis court as in a museum or taking part in a street festival. Earth Snakes do well in school and lead a privileged life throughout their later career years. Golden years promise good financial fortune. In the Romance &amp; Relationship Department, Snakes are not at all snaky, in fact they are a bit too cautious, afraid that if they give their love away, they won't get it back. Nonsense! Once the love bug bites, they are very ingenuous and imaginative in keeping the romantic flame burning.</div>

Have you ever seen a wild horse on the beach, with flying mane and flaring nostrils, every muscle bursting with life and je ne sais quois? Without a doubt, the Horse is the standard for grace, strength, rhythm and nobility. They have an amazing capacity for hard work. As a result, they know great success and financial security in their lifetimes. Often quite ostentatious, they enjoy being with large crowds and always seek out the grand and magnificent. They need people and have a weakness for those of the opposite sex. You can often find Horses at concerts, music festivals, and the Super Bowls of life.<br><br>Famous Horse People: Duke of Windsor, Princess Margaret, Billy Graham, Igor Stravinsky, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Haydn, Barbra Streisand, Nelson Mandela, Anwar Sadat, Neil Armstrong<br><br>METAL HORSE<br>Jan 30, 1930 to Feb 16, 1931<br>Jan 27, 1990 to Feb 14, 1991<br><br>From evening clothes to blue jeans, from the opera to country and western, the Metal Horse is the epitome of a chameleon. Twisting and turning to new experiences, these Horses will go wherever adventure beckons, always bursting with enthusiasm for their very active and productive life. Because of this, their social circle includes some of the most interesting people with opposing and refreshing points of view. Conversation is a high art. Their natural intuition keeps them in lively sync with people they meet. Metal Horses are also very talented people, whether it be in sports, managing the bottom line, or dancing their own interpretation of hip hop. They are most resourceful; if they don't know about a subject, they find the time to learn about it. They never have to lose precious time worrying about what might have been. Although they are very serious and responsible workers and have successful careers, they experience a volatile financial life, up and down, up and down. Although they certainly never have to go begging, they need to exercise financial restraint to keep their lives on a stable course. Love life for the Metal Horse is fine in every respect. They make loyal and understanding partners and they receive the best in return!<br><br>WATER HORSE<br>Feb 15, 1942 to Feb 4, 1943<br>Feb 12, 2002 to Jan 31, 2003<br><br>Philosophical, with tongue firmly in cheek, the cheerful Water Horses are open to the ironies of life. Their sense of humor permits them to laugh at things they can't control. With infinite patience, they know that most problems are really quite small in the scheme of things. (Traffic jams? No problem!) and they try not to let their own personal feelings get in the way. Like all Horses, those of the Water persuasion are very career minded with a high sense of responsibility and accountability. Their years are filled with many hardworking days and nights. Careers are filled with both storm clouds and tropical tradewinds - Horses simply flow with the wind. Because of wise choices, they experience a pretty stable financial fortune in later years, sometimes with unexpected results. Stability is also a big time word when it comes to Love. Love is like the many splendored thing described in song. For them, love means eternity. When they pledge undying loyalty, devotion, tenderness, and caring, they mean it. A partnership is always built on a strong foundation and, like a masterpiece, is designed for life everlasting.<br><br>WOOD HORSE<br>Feb 3, 1954 to Jan 23, 1955<br><br>The Wood Horse is a magnificent creature, full of dignity and proud bearing.

Under tense deadlines, Wood Horses rear up with conviction and passion and make quick decisions with split-second reflexes. Their judgement is always on the mark. Wood Horses work hard -- they play hard. They make a lot of money -- they spend a lot of money. Generous to a fault, they conceive grand wonderful ways of having fun and always invite friends to raise a toast to memory-making. In Love Life, every day becomes a memory maker, filled with treasures of the mind and spirit.

The will and the spirit of the Fire Horse cannot be broken. This Horse goes through life with philosophical patience and the ability to bounce back from adversity no matter how dire the circumstances. In times of solitude, Fire Horses also have an insatiable need for intellectual stimulation and they satisfy their curiosity for learning through reading, listening, conversing, and travel abroad. Fire Horses make inspiring leaders, revered and respected. They encourage their subordinates with kindness and just the right degree of strictness and work well with people in all stations of life. Financial rewards fall in the middle ground, not too bad, not terrific, but always comfortable. Being in love with the Fire Horse brings pure rapture. These noble Horses are generous with their love, with hugs and kisses. Loved ones always know where they stand because Fire Horses demonstrate every day through their actions the love they feel deep within. Each day is a soft and tender love poem.<br><br>EARTH HORSE<br>Feb 11, 1918 to Jan 31, 1919<br>Feb 7, 1978 to Jan 27, 1979<br><br>With head held high, the mighty Earth Horse never has to apologize, never has the pangs of a guilty conscience gnawing away the very soul. The life of the Earth Horse passes all scrutiny. Earth Horses are elegant, spirited, and adventurous creatures. Poetry in motion! Earth Horses are among the most generous and caring of friends, tolerant of their friends' shortcomings, never judging, never showing cynicism. They blend the right balance of sympathy and empathy. As faithful and unwavering as the Horses are in their devotion to friends, it is important to tell you that they are never weaklings or martyrs. Their inherent dignity and pride demand honor and admiration. Earth Horses appreciate the good things of life and because of their dedication to their careers, have the financial resources to keep life on a steady keel. When it comes to Love &amp; Relationships, life for the Earth Horse is exceedingly sad and dreary without love. The Earth Horse will go the extra length to please their partners. They love wild and romantic weekends and traditional whisperings of sweet nothings. They pass a happy life, their blood coursing with life bursting cadence.</div>

The Metal Goat paints a canvas filled with blacks and grays, as well as brilliant splashes of reds and yellows. Like gypsies, these easy-going artistic souls passionately explore life, from one pursuit to another. Their sense of responsibility and a nagging practical streak, however, keep them anchored enough so that things never get out of hand. The Metal Goat is full of confidence and very career minded, but despite the best of intentions and best-laid plans, they experience plenty of ups and downs. The good thing is they can usually make a turnaround. Now, about money! The expression "so-so" best expresses the state of their financial fortune. When it's good, it's very good, but whenever Goats give in to a gambling nature, they can lose it all in a flash. Word to Metal Goats: Watch out! When it comes to Love &amp; Relationships, the Metal Goat falls in love over and over again, too often confusing physical sexual love with the real thing. Until Goats get control over their lusting ways, relationships won't last very long once the honeymoon is over.<br><br>WATER GOAT<br>Feb 5, 1943 to Jan 24, 1944<br>Feb 1, 2003 to Jan 21, 2004<br><br>Sometimes in life you meet somebody so remarkable, you want to shout it to the world. The very charming Water Goat is such a person. The surefooted Water Goat is irresistibly appealing, the sort of person you might spend happy moments with seeing elephants in cloud formations, while lazing about on the beach. Or, on the other hand, discussing politics and current affairs with conviction and clever repartee. Living life with courage is a tall order, but this the goat does with unerring strength and beauty. The Water goat is also a remarkable leader, smart and capable, never giving up long or short range goals. Luckily, these Goats don't encounter much difficulty at all in careers, but they sure do with money. Financial life is pretty volatile, but thank goodness, their spouses know how to make money. Which leads us to the important area of Love &amp; Relationships. Water Goats like to be taken care of, pampered without having to do too much in return. They like assertive partners who make all the arrangements. Of course, there are partners who are perfect for them, the ones who give without expecting anything in return. Quite a pair! This symbiotic relationship has its share of romantic escapades and tender moments but must be on guard against becoming lop-sided in the give and take department.<br><br>WOOD GOAT<br>Jan 24, 1955 to Feb 11, 1956<br><br>The successful Wood Goat has the horsepower of an optimist and the emergency brakes of a pessimist. The Wood Goat has a burning ambition that keeps his or her career path always moving upwards towards the mountain top. They are multi-talented jugglers, excelling in whatever endeavors they pursue. Super organizers, they can solve even the toughest of problems. Because of their laser focus, they always generate results. Financial Life is not too bad either! They have the opportunity to make really big money and must constantly be on guard not to let opportunities pass them by. In the Love &amp; Relationships arena, Wood Goats are blessed. Many divorces are caused by the marriage of two people who are in love with themselves. This won't happen with Wood Goats, who love their partners more than life itself. They take great pains to please their loved ones, who, however, may not ever hear whispered sweet nothings from their Goats. The Wood Goats, you see, don't wear their feelings on their sleeve. It's hard for them to talk about love but easy for them to show it. And show it they do, with countless acts of kindness and courtesy! This relationship will be filled with love of the most abiding kind.<br><br>FIRE GOAT<br>Feb 13, 1907 to Feb 1, 1908<br>Feb 9, 1967 to Jan 29, 1968<br><br>Nary a cantankerous bone in the Fire Goat's body. Their lives are filled with laughter, giggles, and fun surprises. The Fire Goat possesses an unusual combination of traits of the introvert and extrovert. Thoroughly enjoying their own company, they relish solitude but also thoroughly enjoy the companionship of others. They exude such warmth and energy, people naturally gravitate to them, while respecting their needs for privacy. Straightforward in all their dealings with people, Fire Goats show sublime kindness because they know every person they meet is facing a difficult battle. Courageous under fire, Fire Goats realize they need to make big changes to banish the many obstacles that stand in their way. For instance, they do not experience a smooth-sailing career. When something turns bad, Fire Goats have to persevere to make turnarounds, and they do just that. Financial fortune peaks in middle age, but the Fire Goat has to be careful to make that fortune last way into the autumn and winter of life, or else! But, oh my, do Fire Goat ever experience good fortune when it comes to Love! Mama mia! Affectionate, loving, and passionate, they never part from their loved ones without loving words because they realize they might be their last. Every day is living poetry!<br><br>EARTH GOAT<br>Feb 1, 1919 to Feb 19, 1920<br>Jan 28, 1979 to Feb 15, 1980<br><br>Earth Goats are like dancing daffodils, moving with kinetic exuberance and joy. Like all Goats, these creatures are wonderful to socialize with, you just can't help loving their friendly ways and enthusiasm for living. They make lemonade out of lemons, velvet out of porcupines, and find serendipity everywhere. All their friends and colleagues get caught up with this passion. As you can imagine, they make the best of traveling companions. Earth Goats are honorable in all their dealings; they roll up their sleeves and do whatever it is that must be done. They know true contentment because they can think of yesterday without regret and tomorrow without fear. Earth Goats love good books and spend many happy hours seeking treasures in used bookstores. This serious nature also applies to their college years and careers, which they pursue with utmost dedication, hard work, and diligence. At some point in later life, they are rewarded with unexpected financial fortune. What a cozy twosome the Earth Goat makes with a love partner. Relationships are filled with exquisite warmth, gentleness, and tenderness, with magical threads of sensuality taking them on beautiful carpet rides.</div>

And Monkeys know the meaning of hard work! What fun the metal monkey is to be around! You can talk about anything under the moon, but beware: they can be pretty persuasive, so stand your ground.

They are very well liked and always get a lot of help from others with their projects. They are in love with Love and Love Affairs and need to control the wandering eye.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rooster</strong></span> is often seen as the original strong silent type, not unlike the Humphrey Bogart and Greto Garbo prototypes. Most people consider them quite eccentric. Sad to say, relationships with other people are often strained. They are quite moody and can be too outspoken. They are often self-centered, but can be quite brave when the situation calls for it. On the other hand, Rooster People are quite talented and capable. They are always devoted to their work and have a reputation for being the hardest of workers. Rooster People are deep thinkers and are pioneers in spirit. They can experience the greatest of joy in complete solitude. Even though often alone, they rarely experience loneliness. Instead, they enjoy their own company and feel solitude helps them in their quest after knowledge.<br><br>Famous Rooster people: Suharto, Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov, D. H. Lawrence, John Glenn, Emperor Akihito, Yoko Ono, Eudora Welty, Bette Midler<br><br>METAL ROOSTER<br>Feb 8, 1921 to Jan 27, 1922<br>Feb 5, 1981 to Jan 24, 1982<br><br>Sometimes this one walks around with its head in the cumulus clouds, higher than the stars. You see, this rooster struts around with peacock feathers and they never ever ruffle. So much arrogance can make it hard to get along with others, especially when the Rooster is also intolerant of those who are less talented and a bit slower than normal. On the other hand, the Metal Rooster is extraordinarily talented. Of all twelve Zodiac signs, this one is probably the most high-minded of them all, with a very clean line of thought. The Metal Roosters can distinguish right from wrong very clearly and it doesn't matter which direction they pursue, they always wind up going the right way. If they confront a maze, or big problem, they will immediately see a solution because of their analytical, logical way of thinking. Through their perseverance, any hurricane becomes an orderly thing of beauty, just like that! When it's time for romance, the male Metal Rooster has no trouble at all, love just abounds; the female has a tendency to keep to herself, making connections less freely, but lastingly when they happen.<br><br>WATER ROOSTER<br>Jan 26, 1933 to Feb 13, 1934<br>Jan 23, 1993 to Feb 9, 1994<br><br>Whispered sweet nothings lead to trouble for this one! Oh, my! Their very soft hearts relish love and the heartbreaking poetry of love trysts. They pamper their senses with indulgences and when they're not looking, they sink into a love trap more powerful than quicksand. Their relationships will last forever because they take very good care of their other half. They have a love for life, too, and want to right every wrong. Their idealism will lead them to become involved in life, oftentimes through political action or volunteer work, and they work hard to make life problem-free, for themselves and others. The Water Rooster is very intelligent, with quick reflexes, and has inexhaustible energy. For one thing, this Rooster rations its energy, in a leisurely, never hurried manner, taking all the time necessary to make decisions, rationally and analytically, whether it comes to business, friendship, or love relationship.<br><br>WOOD ROOSTER<br>Feb 13, 1945 to Feb 1, 1946<br>Feb 9, 2005 to Jan 28, 2006<br><br>You can often find the Wood Rooster behind the scenes or in solitary activities. They love bookshops with strong espresso and offbeat music groups, particularly modern jazz or chamber work. They are reserved but at the same time can be quite sociable, too, when the occasion calls for it, always considerate, gentle, and easy going, always liking to please others. They can quickly overcome bad feelings. No one ever feels threatened by their company. On a bad day, the Wood Rooster can be so mild-mannered, it's easy to ignore them. But on a good day -- and there are many good days -- they are proud and very articulate in expressing their views. In fact, their quiet exterior belies an intense talent in persuading others to their point of view. People are amazed they can talk so much! Most days, Wood Roosters depend on others way too much. The most important thing Wood Roosters MUST do is to develop an independent streak, to look inside themselves for strength; their careers, financial life, relationships, and very happiness depends on this!<br><br>FIRE ROOSTER<br>Jan 31, 1957 to Feb 17, 1958<br><br>Fire Roosters have adrenaline coursing through their veins! These self-promoters enjoy jumping the goal posts and therefore engage in competition of all kinds. When there's a target to pursue, enemy to conquer, and goal to achieve, they know how to make big things happen. Big magnificent things do happen in career and finances, such as having a fulfilling cozy security. These are influential, powerful people always trustworthy, and the world stands up and salutes! In the dance of love, Roosters need to learn it takes two to tango. Very adept at making Romance sizzle like wildfire, the male Rooster nevertheless occasionally encounters problems in getting his message understood. Sandpaper friction results, they argue and two egos wind up getting hurt, but not for long. They always manage to work it out somehow. What will help in the future is to fully understand that your partner's needs are just as important to your partner as your own needs are important to you. With work, your tango of love can become the most passionate and ultimate love dance.<br><br>EARTH ROOSTER<br>Jan 22, 1909 to Feb 9, 1910<br>Feb 17, 1969 to Feb 5, 1970<br><br>The Earth Rooster epitomizes the very essence of one of Robert Browning's most popular poems, "Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be." Despite early adversity and rough times, their philosophical bent has led them to expect and therefore to achieve the good life. They have a very analytical way of looking at problems and they can pierce the most daunting of tasks with utmost efficiency. With saint-like patience, they are consistent in everything they do and always answer to their own counsel, which hasn't failed them yet. As a result, their careers are forever anchored in smooth sailing, and as life passes, they will know peace, abundance, and complete fulfillment. The same goes for their love life. There are difficulties at the very beginning but as time goes by, they understand each other perfectly, and receive "the best" love has to offer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Dog</strong></span> people are loyal and honest and obedient, guardians of the house at night. They can be counted on to keep secrets and for always doing the right thing. They can be emotionally distant and do not mix well in social gatherings where they are often seen as wallflowers. They do better with one-on-one relationships and find happiness in the happiness they bring to others, such as finding the most perfect gifts for their friends. While it is true that they have sharp tongues and are a bit stubborn and eccentric, in a work situation they tend to work very well with other people. What is more, they always seem to have money and make excellent leaders. Because of their high moral stance, they are inspiring beyond measure.<br><br>Famous Dog People: Chiang Chin-Kuo, Zhou En-Lai, Lee Teng-Hui, Benjamin Franklin, Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley,Jacques Cousteau, King Carl XVI Gustaf, Yitzhak Rabin, Golda Meir, Mother Teresa, Jane Goodall, Prime Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien<br><br>METAL DOG<br>Feb 10, 1910 to Jan 29, 1911<br>Feb 6, 1970 to Jan 26, 1971<br><br>This one takes a very conservative approach to every aspect of life, somewhat coasting along looking at the scenery with dreams and goals unrealized but the spirit always fulfilled. Ferdinand the Bull is their Poster Boy; they always stop to smell the flowers. Nothing wrong with this, but it's important to find a balance so there aren't so many unfinished tasks. Ironically, they tend to be materialistic, but don't have the patience necessary to acquire big ticket items and major success is illusory. But like gypsies, they move with the wind, taking what comes, with noble chin held high, always finding in life a kind of beauty which does indeed sustain them very much. They make very good friends, loyal to the bone, always finding delightful ways to help others. Friends always know where they stand because of their directness and frank manner. The Love &amp; Romance Department usually finds a very handsome male and a beautiful female, each incredibly attractive to the other and sincerity reigns in their communication. The Metal Dog doesn't like to take too many chances, preferring conservative and traditional ways of romance. Sometimes, they become virtual love slaves, a little too passive for their own good.

Handling the ins and outs of human relations is so easy for them! They know how to smooth over any personal situation with their kind, honest, easy-going nature. Always empathetic, always rational, their ability to play Devil's Advocate helps open up whole new ways of approaching problems and finding solutions. Their views on life are expansive because of an ingrained wanderlust which has taken and will continue to take them to exotic locales about the globe. They adapt like chameleons to new environments and new people and their lives are all-encompassing, full of rich adventure. Financial and career success comes to the Water Dogs later in life -- just watch these late bloomers burst open! Regarding their love life, when it comes to dating and romance, their temperature ranges from hot to cold, from one extreme to another. Sometimes they want a commitment, other times they run Geronimo. But, when true love finally comes, and it will, they have it made. Their relationships are filled with good honest communication and genuine kindness and total caring for their partner. Marriage will be as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar.<br><br>WOOD DOG<br>Feb 14, 1934 to Feb 3, 1935<br>Feb 10, 1994 to Jan 30, 1995<br><br>Whatever Wood Dog wants, Wood Dog gets. When they set a goal, they doggedly pursue the right course of action, no matter what obstacles are in the way, and always finish as winners. They accomplish great things and enjoy most fulfilling careers and educational quests. Pursuing the right course of action is a constant theme in their lives, be it dealings with other people, the expression of their strong sense of justice and sense of ethics and morality. They protest wrong! They cry out at injustice! They want to always correct the wrongs of life. They are very strict on themselves and although expecting the best from others, they never alienate or come across as "holier than thou" because of their very generous personalities. Their lives are heroic and they are very deserving of others' trust and respect. Wood Dogs deal with Romance the same way as they do their career, nothing less than an all-out effort to win the object of their affection. Do they win? You better believe it!<br><br>FIRE DOG<br>Feb 2, 1946 to Jan 21, 1947<br>Jan 29, 2006 to Feb 17, 2007<br><br>Right off the bat, let's say that Fire Dogs are very attractive! Not only themselves but all the people surrounding them are life's beautiful people. Their natural inclination is to conveniently turn an eye away from perversity. They view all of life through rose-colored glasses. Grays and beiges lead to momentary confusion. They don't know how to deal with adversity and when confronting a mountain, will walk all around the foothills for hours before even getting started. This person's life is filled with dichotomy. On the one hand, they know that hard work and effort will make things happen, but they sometimes accept the status quo. They dream of a bright future but wind up chasing windmills. And despite an overabundance of energy, their careers sometimes stand still. They see-saw from timidity to having grand adventures. They are on a sure course when it comes to friendship and love, though. Very well liked, their social circle is broad and their love life is full of energy and fire. You see, the firedog is a lovebird!<br><br>EARTH DOG<br>Feb 18, 1958 to Feb 7, 1959<br><br>The Earth Dog is well grounded, both feet solidly on the ground. Perfectionists at heart, they see that projects have a beginning and an end, and all they have to do is see things all the way through. A driving force propels their lives and they know they must never waver in reaching their goals, whether it's dealing with people, daily projects, or sailing around the world. Earth Dogs are brimming with confidence and are always finding four-leaf clovers. Luck happens! In the Love Arena, they take a somewhat lackadaisical approach; i.e., love is no big deal, it's just a natural part of life. If it happens, fine, but no great enthusiasm is lost here. The best person for the Earth Dog is a strongly independent someone who relishes freedom and has an identity apart from the relationship. When the Earth Dog and their mate do come together, it will be beautiful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese Horoscope (from another site):<br><br><strong>RAT</strong><br><br>Rat people are born under the sign of charm and aggressiveness. They are expressive and can be talkative sometimes. They like to go to parties and spend quite sometimes chatting with their friends. Although the Rat can be quiet sometime, it is rare to catch a Rat sitting quietly.<br><br>Rat people usually have more acquaintances than real friends and they revere and cherish those close to them. Once you become their real friends, they will treat you as their family. Rats are self-contained and keep problems to themselves. And even though they can be talkative sometimes, they never confide in anyone.<br><br>Sometimes mean, narrow-minded and suburban in outlook, Rat people are nevertheless honest. They can always make a success of their lives as long as they manage to master their perpetual discontent and their insistence on living for the present moment.<br><br>The Rat is quick-witted. Most rats get more accomplished in 24 hours than the rest of us do in as many days. They are confident and usually have good instinct. Stubborn as they are, they prefer to live by their own rules rather others. It won't be an easy task to work with Rat people, why? Because they are also 100% perfectionists.<br><br>They are very organized and talented; perhaps that is why the Rat makes a good businessman or politician. Unfortunately, as soon as the Rat earns money, he spends it. Maybe that explains why the Rat is so careful when he lends money to others. If you ever borrow money from the Rat, don't be surprised by the high-interests he charges.<br><br>The Rat is not romantic, but he is sensual and loving. Rat people could be hard to see through at first glance, because they are also very protective, but even though they are not easy but they are worth it - ask anyone who has a Rat for a lover, parent, child or friend. They are very loyal and devoting to their families.<br><br><strong>OX</strong><br><br>Ox people are hard-working and persistent, they can stick at a task longer and go at it harder than anybody. They believe in themselves and tend to classify almost everything into two basic categories, bad and good. They hold up their high standards as a model and severely judge those who don't aspire to maintain these same ideals.<br><br>Ox people are not social or party animals, they tend to be quiet when in a party. Although appears to be tranquil, in fact, Oxen are ponderous but impulsive when angry. They are capable of fearsome rages; therefore, it is better not to cross an Oxen.<br><br>Ox people are good observers with remarkable memories and can accurately report absolutely everything they see. Go ask an ox if he remembers who was at the party several months ago, most likely, he will name them one by one to you.<br><br>In the home, the ox is great to have around. In business, the ox can succeed in the arts, a contracting business, or an estate, thanks to his creative nature. And since an ox is intelligent and good with his hands, an ox can be a good surgeon as well.<br><br>Ox people are stubborn and dogmatic, believing firmly in their decisions and having no regrets. They are also very close to their families. Ox people often find that those who are close to them fail to understand them. Nevertheless, they are patient and caring and that makes an ox the best friend you can ever have.<br><br>Ox people are very responsible and loyal. They are very family-oriented, conservative and faithful. They are seldom jealous but they will be jealous of their rights - and the fidelity of a husband or a wife is one of their rights.<br><br><strong>TIGER</strong><br><br>"Born leader" is the key word for the Tigers. They are always in the lead and are most likely the ones to cry out "Let's Go"! Noble and Fearless, Tigers are respected for their courage, even from those working against them.<br><br>Tiger people are daring fighters, they are capable of standing up to the better end for what they think is right. Although they could be selfish from time to time in the little things, they are capable of great generosity. Tigers are unpredictable, always tense, and like to be in a hurry.<br><br>Tiger people are difficult to resist, for they are magnetic characters and their natural air of authority confers a certain prestige on them. They are tempestuous yet calm, warm-hearted yet fearsome, courageous in the face of danger yet yielding and soft in mysterious, unexpected places.<br><br>Tigers are very confident, perhaps too confident sometimes. Although they love adventures, and are addicted to excitement it is better not to challenge a Tiger's confidence. They like being obeyed and not the other way around.<br><br>Because Tigers are urgent people and always in a hurry to get things done right, they usually choose to operate alone. Tigers like to work; they are hard working and dynamic. If you assign a task to a Tiger, the job will be undertaken and accomplished with enthusiasm and efficiency. Tigers make money, but they are not directly interested in money. Still, the Tiger needs not worry about money: just when he fears the money is gone, more seems to show up.<br><br>Tigers are sensitive, emotional. They are capable of great love, but they become too intense about it. They are also territorial and possessive, if you are a friend of a Tiger, he wants you to take his side against the bad guys and because the Tiger is so adorable, you often do. As lovers, Tigers are passionate and romantic, but the real challenge for the Tiger is to grasp the true meaning of moderation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>RABBIT</strong><br><br>The rabbit is one of the most delicate animals among all 12 animals.

Nobody ignores them, for they are good company and know how to make the best of themselves<br><br>A rabbit's home is always a beautiful one because Rabbit people are famous for their artistic sense and good taste. They are also usually well dressed. Go check out your Rabbit friend's closet, I bet you will find many expensive and beautiful clothing there.<br><br>But even though they are popular and loved by their friends and family, rabbit people are also pessimistic.

Romantic and sweet, faithful too, rabbit people never lack of suitors. . Male rabbits are sometimes picky, and perhaps not a family man. And female rabbits should probably spend less time admiring themselves in front of the mirror and spend more time with friends.<br><br><strong>DRAGON</strong><br><br>As the noble animal symbol that represents the Chinese emperors, Dragons are born leaders and masters of ceremonies. And because of this, every Chinese parent is hoping to have a Dragon child. Dragon people get things started and keep them moving. They are feisty and gifted with power and luck. Most people look up to the Dragon.<br><br>Dragons are born monarchs. As far as they can see, their power is indisputable. Dragons are idealists, perfectionists, they are born thinking they are perfect and they are inflexible. Dragons are also aggressive and determined; going after what they want is second nature to them. And due to their hunger for power, Dragons are not well suited to growing old. The prospect of losing power, the helpless feeling of youthful strength ebbing away is unbearable to them.<br><br>Irritable and stubborn, the Dragon is a real big mouth and his words often outrun his thoughts. Nevertheless, his opinions are worth listening to and his advice is always good. People do, in fact, listen to him and his influence is considerable. The Dragon is over-proud. He is enthusiastic to the point of impetuosity, and he loses his temper easily.<br><br>Dragons are dauntless, dynamic and delightful. When a Dragon enters a gathering, the room starts to simmer.

He can do anything. No matter whether the Dragon chooses an artistic career, medical or political one, he is going to shine in it. He will be a success wherever he goes.<br><br>Dragons are beloved and are never disappointed in love. Women dragons are surrounded by admirers and are sought after in marriage.<br><br><strong>SNAKE</strong><br><br>Snake people are born charming and popular. Spotlight magnets, snakes will not be ignored. Peer group attention and public recognition are the least of what a snake expects. Yet snakes are never noisy or deliberately outspoken, they never gossip, and they have excellent manners.<br><br>A snake has good luck and always manages to get money when he needs it. The snake should stick to careers that won't involve him in any risk - even the risk of working too hard, for, to tell the truth, a snake is a bit lazy.<br><br>A snake likes to ponder. He is an intellectual, a philosopher, a cerebral person. Determined to follow through anything he undertakes to the bitter end, a snake detests being left in the air and often makes leap of faith decisions quickly and firmly. Snakes rely heavily on first impressions, on their own feelings, on their sympathies, and on the advice and opinions on others and a sort of guiding "sixth-sense" when making decisions.<br><br>Snakes are a bit cheap when it comes to lending money, though their sympathy for others often leads them to offer help. The fatal flaw in a snake's character is a tendency to exaggerate - in how far he'll go to help a friend as with everything else. If he does somebody a favor, he'll becomes possessive towards them in an odd way. Another big flaw in a snake's character is that he is capable of big lies. White lies, true lies, whatever the snakes call them, a lie's a lie, although snakes don't lie continually, only when they feel they can get away with it.<br><br>Snakes have always been seductive. The snake is a nice oversexed normal human being. Most people are secretly or hopelessly in love with snakes. Gather those frustrated folk you know and most likely, they are probably in love with a snake.<br><br>In love, the snake male is romantic and charming. A male snake has a sense of humor and a female snake is usually beautiful and successful. Howerver, be forewarned that when a snake chooses a partner, he'll be jealous and possessive - even if he no longer loves her. Rejection is the worst blow his delicate ego can suffer. A snake must be received, welcomed, accepted, and approved of by those with whom he comes in contact. They need a lot of reassurance to feel secure.</div>

Wherever you are, whoever you may be, if you've got a problem pick up the phone and dial-a-monkey. Monkeys know how to listen closely and work out solutions.

Some say monkeys are self-centered, some say they are opportunistic, some say they are guileful, but monkeys couldn't care less - because they are also indifferent.<br><br>Most monkeys have one fetish - FOOD. They are not pigs, they don't stuff themselves with food, instead, they just have this habit of eating snacks whenever they like, and wherever they like. And one last truth about monkey people is, they adore bananas. Go and visit your monkey friend's kitchen, I bet you will find some bananas there.<br><br>The monkey has a good chance of becoming famous or well known.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ROOSTER</strong><br><br>Roosters are conservatives at heart. With roosters, what you see is exactly what you get. There are no hidden depths to the rooster's character. A rooster is not a complicated or profound character but rather a very forthright and straightforward person.<br><br>Nevertheless, roosters are sociable animals and love to receive attention. They make great hosts and adore entertaining. Enjoying being noticed and flattered, roosters sometimes dress a bit flashy to gain the attention of others.<br><br>Roosters strive to be attractive and are always beautifully turned out. All roosters are extremely conscious about their clothing and appearance. Even when they dress conservatively they are obsessed with their looks - they can spend hours standing in front of mirrors and will not bat an eye at spending $500 for a dress. However, that doesn't mean they don't care about money for in fact they live for sales, love to compare prices, and even if the bargain is only a few cents or a few dollars cheaper, they will be satisfied.<br><br>Precise and accurate observers, roosters have a very keen "sixth-sense". It is not an easy task to fool the rooster. His mind is cautious and skeptical. With the gift of perception, roosters make excellent troubleshooters, detectives, doctors, nurses and psychiatrists. Roosters are always up, out, and doing. You rarely see a relaxed rooster that sits quietly in the living room, doing nothing. Multitalented, roosters can become accomplished in many different ways.<br><br>Though sharp, practical, and resourceful, a rooster also likes to dream. And because he likes to dream, he will often disappoint his loved ones, for reality seldom matches up to the dreams he promises despite his sincere belief that they will come true. The main virtue in the rooster character is loyalty: they make devoted friends. When roosters love and admire someone, they will even try to catch the moon just to keep them happy.<br><br><strong>DOG</strong><br><br>Dog is a symbol of loyalty and wisdom for the Chinese. It is one of the most likeable signs of the Chinese Horoscope.<br>The dog person is loyal, sincere, honest, and faithful. Dogs tend to be serious people who complain and worry, but they mellow with age. Dogs are honorable and speak out against injustice.<br><br>When rubbed the wrong way, dog people can be defensive and picky, but generally are agreeable companions. However, when panicked, a dog can turn nasty and bark until tired. Dogs can keep a secret, respect traditions, and enjoy helping others. Although never the life of a party, dogs are intelligent, caring, and good listeners.<br><br>In relationships, the dog person is the giver and the partner is the taker.<br><br><strong>PIG</strong><br><br>Pigs are about wealth, family, prosperity, happiness, and good luck.<br><br>Pigs are models of sincerity, purity, tolerance, and honor. When you first meet them, pigs seem too good to be true. They are careful and caring, obliging and chivalrous. Put your trust in them for they will never let you down and they will always try to do what's right.<br><br>Pigs are the people everyone likes. Make a list of the pigs in your life: aren't they the nicest, most loving, and caring people around?<br><br>Pigs are born to give, to yield, and to serve, and so, unfortunately, most people take advantage of them. Pigs know they are easy to fool but don't really mind. No matter how old they get, pigs keep their faith in human nature and believe that people are basically good. Pigs tend to sacrifice their own happiness and comfort for the sake of others.<br><br>A pig is a splendid companion. If you have a lifetime pig friend, treat them well. Pigs are loyal, faithful, and giving only so long as they approve of you. In order to keep your lifetime piggy friend, remember; never try to force your opinions on him. Also, remember that a pig rarely asks for help and cannot graciously accept it.<br><br>A pig doesn't say much - but when he does decide to speak, suddenly, nothing can stop him until he runs out of subjects. Like the monkey, the pig is intellectual - a character with a great thirst for knowledge.<br><br>Some people claim that pigs are snobbish. Manners, breeding and good taste are of enormous importance to them. In fact, pigs are aesthetic. Pigs are born with an excellent nose for style in everything. Food is another of piggy's little sins. Pigs adore food and after-dinner chocolates. The pig often over-eats, but he eats with good taste.<br><br>In relationships, pig people are sensitive, sweet, naive, and caring. They are romantic and certainly are the marriage-type. But on the other hand, pigs can also be possessive, jealous and exclusive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Five-Element Basic Concept</span></strong></span><br><br><img src="http://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/images/BIG8C.gif"> <strong>Ying and Ying must be in balance </strong><img src="http://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/images/BIG8C.gif"><br><br>The ancient Chinese YIN-YANG scholars believed that three are two natural, complementary and contradictory forces in our universe. The scholars named them as YIN and YANG. YIN represents the female, negative, darkness, softness, moisture, night-time, even numbers and docile aspects of things. YANG represents the male, positive, brightness, hardness, dryness, day-time, odd numbers and dominant aspects. YIN and YANG are continually in the state of flux and always looking for the BALANCE point. One moves, the other responses. Therefore, ancient scholars treated this natural phenomenon as a natural  universal law.<br><br>These scholars also believed that our universe consisted of five basic elements, which are Metal, Water, Wood, Fire and Earth (Soil). Everything, including humans, in the universe (between Heaven and Earth) must have a relationship with these five elements. So they tried to apply the five elements not only to every physical thing in the world, but also to the Colors, Directions, Seasons and Sounds. They even applied to the Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds of the  Chinese Calendar. Now, people are able to know their five-element weights from their birth date and time. Based on the combination of these five-element weights plus the concept of the natural phenomenon, they can tell the rise and fall of human destiny (fate) cycle.<br><br>FIVE ELEMENTS does not only mean metal, water, wood, fire and soil. The "element" in Chinese also means <strong>MOVEMENT</strong>, <strong>CHANGEABLE</strong> and <strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong>. These elements have their Ying and Yang sides too. They are moving, waning, waxing and changing all the time. Just like Ying and Yang, the movements of five elements are slow and stable when they are in kind of balance. If they are out of balance, then the movements are unstable and unpredictable. When a person is in a stable (five-element) environment, he should live peacefully. When a person is in an unpredictable environment, he is easily out of control. A person will feel lucky when everything is under control. A person will feel bad luck when everything is out of   control. <strong><span style="color: darkred;">If you want to be a lucky person, you have to move to an environment to bring your five elements into balance</span></strong>.<br><br>In the fortune-telling system, we want to use metal, water, wood, fire and earth as the five elements to explain everything. Metal stands for mineral, gold, jewelry, iron, rock or something hard. Water stands for liquid or something cold. Wood stands for tree or something to do with wood. Fire stands for Sun, fire, heat, light or something hot. Earth stands for soil, dust or ground. There are affinity and enmity relationships between five elements.<br><br><img src="http://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/images/5E/5EChart1.gif"><br><br>The affinity relationship means supporting, helping, producing, etc.<br><br>Water can help tree (Wood) grow.<br>Wood can help Fire to burn.<br>Fire can help to produce dust (Earth).<br>Earth can help mineral (Metal) to form.<br>Metal can hold Water.<br><br>We can say that :-<br>Water is the supporting element of Wood. Wood can release the power of Water.<br>Wood is the supporting element of Fire. Fire can release the power of Wood.<br>Fire is the supporting element of Earth. Earth can release the power of Fire.<br>Earth is the supporting element of Metal. Metal can release the power of Earth.<br>Metal is the supporting element of Water. Water can release the power of Metal.<br><br><img src="http://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/images/5E/5EChart2.gif"><br><br>The enmity relationship means fighting, conflicting, rejecting, etc.<br><br>Water can extinguish Fire, but Fire might evaporate Water.<br>Wood can break the ground (Earth), but Earth can buries Wood too.<br>Fire can melt Metal, but Metal might not melt before Fire is extinguished.<br>Earth can absorb Water, but Water can cover the land (Earth).<br>Metal can cut Wood, but Metal might become dull before breaking Wood.<br><br>We can say that :-<br>Water and Fire are enemies. Water overwhelms the movement of Fire.<br>Wood and Earth are enemies. Wood overwhelms the movement of Earth.<br>Fire and Metal are enemies. Fire overwhelms the movement of Metal.<br>Earth and Water are enemies. Earth overwhelms the movement of Water.<br>Metal and Wood are enemies. Metal overwhelms the movement of Wood.</div>
