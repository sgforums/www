This creative, esoteric Sign needs plenty of time alone in which to feed its Muse. Goats are generally most comfortable in their own minds (which other, more linear-thinking Signs may have trouble deciphering). This Sign makes a great craftsperson or artisan, or perhaps a teacher of New Age studies -- any occupation that allows its mind the full range of freedom. Goats tend not to be very well-organized, precluding many more dry business endeavors. In fact, Goats tend not to be very materialistic in general, finding plenty of riches in their own imagination. However, especially when in love, the Goat can be quite a lavish gift-giver.<br><br>Perhaps it's that artistic temperament that so often causes Goats to feel insecure, but the result is that these high-strung creatures need to feel loved and admired lest they start worrying incessantly. For this reason, Goats tend to have a hard time with romance; anyone who couples up with a Goat must know, this Sign has a sensitive streak a mile wide and can be subject to bouts of anxiety over seemingly inconsequential things. Goats need plenty of love, support and open reassurance from their lovers. If a relationship is marked by conflict, the Goat will often pull away -- either physically or simply by retreating into the safe haven of its imagination.<br><br>If the romance is going well, however, Goats won't hesitate to tell their partner what they need -- and they can be quite insistent about it! This Sign will definitely return the favor, however; the Goat has a luxurious side that delights in indulging a lover's every wish. Appearances are also important to the Goat, which may explain why these folks can spend hours primping and posing.<br><br>Goats would be well-served by learning to relax and let others run the show from time to time. Once they can be certain that their friends and lovers won't be gone when the Goat returns from its daydreams, life will be a field of daisies.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Goat is the Pig or the Rabbit.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Goats</span>: Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Benicio Del Toro.</div>

They have a love for beaty and are often artistic, cultured, elegant and well-read. Sheep are usually very romantic and sensitive. If one is a Goat's object of affection, it will be hard to resist their loving and caring demeanour! Goat are also often insecure deep down inside, and need to feel loved and wanted. They shy away from confrontation and are likely to give way to a more aggressive opponent in a disagreement just to keep the peace. They tend to be pessimistic and capricious at times. </span><br><br>The Goat is: Cheerful, generous, sensitive, irrational and pessimistic, likes creativity, romance and goals; dislikes hard rules and quarrels<br><br>Suited as a writer, entertainer, investor, painter, broadcaster<br><br>Suited with the Rabbit, Pig, Monkey, Snake and Dragon</div>

Your physical health will not be much harmed, but bad moods, depression and feeling low on yourself may completely overtake your senses and leave you feeling weak. Don't succumb to your emotions! Whenever you feel a bout of depression coming on, do go out and occupy your time with positive activities such as sports, or simply be with friends.

As for some natives of the sign, they should avoid indulging in their vices, even in a small quantity.

            <div class='col-md body'>Goat people have good taste and are quite charming and elegant Â… and rich. You may find them the center of attention at a stylish dinner party, ravishing all with incomparable wit and bon mots. The opposite is also true: they are often quite shy and sometimes prefer complete anonymity, the quiet life at home with a good book, a roaring fire, and the joys of the palate. A creative flame burns in their lives and you may find them before a canvas experimenting with bright bold genius strokes of paint. Sometimes, they tend to be pessimistic and question the meaning of life, wondering "why they dwell among green mountains." They are quite often deeply religious or spiritual and quite passionate about their work and their belief.<br><br>Famous Goat People: Sir Laurence Olivier, Josephine Bonaparte, Margot Fonteyn, Mikhail Gorbachev, Toni Morrison, Leonard Nimoy, Pierre Trudeau, Katharine Hepburn, Boris Yeltsin<br><br>METAL GOAT<br><span class="small">Feb 17, 1931 to Feb 5, 1932<br>Feb 15, 1991 to Feb 3, 1992</span><br><br>The bright moon nearly always comes to shine upon the Metal Goat. Courageous, these hearty souls know their share of trouble, but nearly always recover to rise like stars. The Metal Goat paints a canvas filled with blacks and grays, as well as brilliant splashes of reds and yellows. Like gypsies, these easy-going artistic souls passionately explore life, from one pursuit to another. Their sense of responsibility and a nagging practical streak, however, keep them anchored enough so that things never get out of hand. The Metal Goat is full of confidence and very career minded, but despite the best of intentions and best-laid plans, they experience plenty of ups and downs. The good thing is they can usually make a turnaround. Now, about money! The expression "so-so" best expresses the state of their financial fortune. When it's good, it's very good, but whenever Goats give in to a gambling nature, they can lose it all in a flash. Word to Metal Goats: Watch out! When it comes to Love &amp; Relationships, the Metal Goat falls in love over and over again, too often confusing physical sexual love with the real thing. Until Goats get control over their lusting ways, relationships won't last very long once the honeymoon is over.<br><br>WATER GOAT<br><span class="small">Feb 5, 1943 to Jan 24, 1944<br>Feb 1, 2003 to Jan 21, 2004</span><br><br>Sometimes in life you meet somebody so remarkable, you want to shout it to the world. The very charming Water Goat is such a person. The surefooted Water Goat is irresistibly appealing, the sort of person you might spend happy moments with seeing elephants in cloud formations, while lazing about on the beach. Or, on the other hand, discussing politics and current affairs with conviction and clever repartee. Living life with courage is a tall order, but this the goat does with unerring strength and beauty. The Water goat is also a remarkable leader, smart and capable, never giving up long or short range goals. Luckily, these Goats don't encounter much difficulty at all in careers, but they sure do with money. Financial life is pretty volatile, but thank goodness, their spouses know how to make money. Which leads us to the important area of Love &amp; Relationships. Water Goats like to be taken care of, pampered without having to do too much in return. They like assertive partners who make all the arrangements. Of course, there are partners who are perfect for them, the ones who give without expecting anything in return. Quite a pair! This symbiotic relationship has its share of romantic escapades and tender moments but must be on guard against becoming lop-sided in the give and take department.<br><br>WOOD GOAT<br><span class="small">Jan 24, 1955 to Feb 11, 1956</span><br><br>The successful Wood Goat has the horsepower of an optimist and the emergency brakes of a pessimist. The Wood Goat has a burning ambition that keeps his or her career path always moving upwards towards the mountain top. They are multi-talented jugglers, excelling in whatever endeavors they pursue. Super organizers, they can solve even the toughest of problems. Because of their laser focus, they always generate results. Financial Life is not too bad either! They have the opportunity to make really big money and must constantly be on guard not to let opportunities pass them by. In the Love &amp; Relationships arena, Wood Goats are blessed. Many divorces are caused by the marriage of two people who are in love with themselves. This won't happen with Wood Goats, who love their partners more than life itself. They take great pains to please their loved ones, who, however, may not ever hear whispered sweet nothings from their Goats. The Wood Goats, you see, don't wear their feelings on their sleeve. It's hard for them to talk about love but easy for them to show it. And show it they do, with countless acts of kindness and courtesy! This relationship will be filled with love of the most abiding kind.<br><br>FIRE GOAT<br><span class="small">Feb 13, 1907 to Feb 1, 1908<br>Feb 9, 1967 to Jan 29, 1968</span><br><br>Nary a cantankerous bone in the Fire Goat's body. Their lives are filled with laughter, giggles, and fun surprises. The Fire Goat possesses an unusual combination of traits of the introvert and extrovert. Thoroughly enjoying their own company, they relish solitude but also thoroughly enjoy the companionship of others. They exude such warmth and energy, people naturally gravitate to them, while respecting their needs for privacy. Straightforward in all their dealings with people, Fire Goats show sublime kindness because they know every person they meet is facing a difficult battle. Courageous under fire, Fire Goats realize they need to make big changes to banish the many obstacles that stand in their way. For instance, they do not experience a smooth-sailing career. When something turns bad, Fire Goats have to persevere to make turnarounds, and they do just that. Financial fortune peaks in middle age, but the Fire Goat has to be careful to make that fortune last way into the autumn and winter of life, or else! But, oh my, do Fire Goat ever experience good fortune when it comes to Love! Mama mia! Affectionate, loving, and passionate, they never part from their loved ones without loving words because they realize they might be their last. Every day is living poetry!<br><br>EARTH GOAT<br><span class="small">Feb 1, 1919 to Feb 19, 1920<br>Jan 28, 1979 to Feb 15, 1980</span><br><br>Earth Goats are like dancing daffodils, moving with kinetic exuberance and joy. Like all Goats, these creatures are wonderful to socialize with, you just can't help loving their friendly ways and enthusiasm for living. They make lemonade out of lemons, velvet out of porcupines, and find serendipity everywhere. All their friends and colleagues get caught up with this passion. As you can imagine, they make the best of traveling companions. Earth Goats are honorable in all their dealings; they roll up their sleeves and do whatever it is that must be done. They know true contentment because they can think of yesterday without regret and tomorrow without fear. Earth Goats love good books and spend many happy hours seeking treasures in used bookstores. This serious nature also applies to their college years and careers, which they pursue with utmost dedication, hard work, and diligence. At some point in later life, they are rewarded with unexpected financial fortune. What a cozy twosome the Earth Goat makes with a love partner. Relationships are filled with exquisite warmth, gentleness, and tenderness, with magical threads of sensuality taking them on beautiful carpet rides.<br></div>
