            <div class='col-md body'>15 Jul 06<br>Your relations with your mate won't be devoid of turmoil; the discussions will be stormy, and neither you nor they will want to lose the privilege of uttering the last word; be the more intelligent of the two by speaking less and by listening more. This lunar climate may bring about money concerns or problems in your business. There'll also be tensions in your professional relationships. The planets will give you a homebound mood and make you love domestic joys; it will be quite difficult to drag you out of your cozy cocoon and your slippers!</div>

All intellectual activities will be favored; profit by the opportunity to widen your cultural horizon. You'll triumph over microbes and viruses of all kinds as your energy will be at a peak; don't forget to get sufficient rest and sleep. Fruitful discussions in your family; your relationships with your nearest and dearest will give you full satisfaction.<br><br>17 Jul 06<br>The stars will advise you to be a little more easygoing; indeed, you tend to be too strict and tense, and this may prove harmful to your efficiency. In your work, delegate some your responsibilities if you can, and keep as low a profile as possible. The paranormal and occult may greatly appeal to you at this time; explore them if you'd like, but be careful not to let yourself be exploited by charlatans.

Well, console yourself, for you're in the good company of entire mankind. We all have problems in life, whatever our origin, race, culture, social condition or destiny. You'll be conscious of the actuality and the strength of your attraction to your mate, and you'll succeed in expressing it directly and frankly, which will give you much satisfaction.

Be careful with your diet; if you continue to overeat sweets and fats, you may soon have a serious problem of health.<br><br>20 Jul 06<br>This is not a time to declare your love for the person of your dreams, as you are not yet convincing enough; let time help you. You are lucky with money this day; don't hesitate to try the lottery, but only with a small sum. Beware of headaches or lightheadedness! This would be a good day to start to work on some self-improvements that you have been planning. A good diet or exercise routine will help a lot. Have a checkup of your eyesight, particularly if you have to make long car drives.</div>

Why not appeal to your friends if you have a problem too difficult to solve? Your relationships with your close circle will not be quite harmonious, for you may often react too strongly.

Beware of intakes that may prove harmful in the short or long term: besides alcohol, tobacco, inappropriate medicines or drugs, there're also excesses of sweets, pastries and fats.

You may feel torn between the desire to impose yourself in your work, to use your abilities to your advantage and to give up before the obstacles. Don't count too much on others, or else you'll know disappointments. In love, you'd like to express your spontaneity, but something will prevent you from doing it.<br><br>27 Jul 06<br>A friend of yours might disappoint you; don't go on about this incident. You'll have to steer a middle course between career and family life. If you decide to embark on a risky undertaking, take all necessary precautions since the juncture is strewn with traps. Show a sense of humor, don't take everything seriously and take even less tragically. You'll find much charm in your conjugal life; single natives of the sign will have a chance to meet their soul mate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>28 Jul 06<br>If you're living as a couple, beware of the possible tense atmosphere that results from the professional preoccupations of your mate. You'll feel the need to escape your everyday routine, which seems so savorless to you. And then you may meet a person who'll give your life this note of the unexpected, of mystery and of fancy that you've been missing so much. It's possible that you'll be concerned about metaphysical questions to which you can't find satisfactory answers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>30 Jul 06<br>Zoom on your professional life: your competence will be readily recognized. However, be careful not to spoil everything by excessive vanity -- or by excessive modesty, which has practically the same effects. Snuff out your perfectionism.

            <div class='col-md body'>31 Jul 06<br>You'll probably encounter some thorny problems in the career domain, but you'll rapidly recover your good judgment and your sharpness of mind. Don't overrate your strength: Rest will prove necessary, and too great fatigue can provoke backaches and heart weaknesses. Put a little distance between you and your family-in-law if you want to preserve your conjugal understanding; don't leave it any possibility of interference with your private life, otherwise you'll have to cope with an awkward situation.</div>
