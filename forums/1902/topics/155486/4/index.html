'There was blood everywhere.'<br><br>At least two explosions caused by bombs ripped through two areas in the resort district almost simultaneously around 7.30pm, a senior Bali police official said.<br><br>It was the hour when the Saturday night wining and dining crowd was just building up, at a time of the year when tourists - especially from Australia - flock to the island.<br><br>'Two bombs. One in Jimbaran and one in Kuta,' said the official, who declined to be identified, referring to two tourist areas on the island.<br><br>The BBC said four unexploded devices were also found at Jimbaran.<br><br>One security expert told the station the blasts were unlikely to have the same impact as the 2002 bombings which killed 202 people because cars are no longer allowed to park in the area.<br><br>Another explosion occurred at the Raja restaurant, a three-storey noodle and steak house in a bustling outdoor shopping centre in downtown Kuta, about 30km from Jimbaran.<br><br>A British tourist who was in a building next door to the restaurant that was hit in Kuta said there was a 'thunderous boom' that caused all the shop's windows to blow out.<br><br>'It was just chaos with no one really taking control,' Mr Daniel Martin told the BBC.<br><br>'There were no police or anyone else around for a good while. It was everyone pitching in to help the wounded.<br><br>'There were people lying in the street with serious wounds, blood pouring into the street...I was afraid to go into the restaurant for what I might see in there.'<br><br>Television images showed police with torches picking through the darkened interior of what appeared to be a badly damaged restaurant.<br><br>In other scenes, security forces were seen mingling with crowds of onlookers outside a clothing store that was shattered by the blast, its interior a jumble of broken shelves.<br><br>One scene showed what appeared to be a body covered by a bloodied blanket, while in another a man cried violently against the side of a van.<br><br>American tourist Maria Bakkalapulo, who arrived just after the blast, told CNN: 'The bomb exploded inside the restaurant.

I saw this Japanese woman and her daughter covered in blood. They looked like they were cut by the glass.'<br><br>Ms Teo did not step out onto the street because she feared there could be another bomb.<br><br>On the streets, people shouted and screamed. Some tried to help while others fled from the area.<br><br>After she found her mother, who had been pushed by the crowd to the rear exit, the Teo family walked back to their hotel.<br><br>Ms Teo said her family had planned to go to Jimbaran Bay for a seafood dinner tonight.<br><br>'It gives me goosebumps when I think about what could have been. Tonight too, we had delayed having dinner because we weren't hungry. We could very well have been in that Western restaurant.'<br><br>But she does not intend to cut short her holiday. 'I think at this moment, the best thing is for us to stay put in the hotel. Nobody can predict what will happen next.'<br><br>Mr K. Rajendran, 40, a manager with a construction company, was in Bali for business and had checked into the Aneka Beach Hotel in Kuta when the explosion went off.<br><br>Still, he went to a Japanese music festival in Nusa Dua. But the concert was stopped and he went back to his hotel, where he stayed 'glued to the TV watching CNN'.<br><br>Designer Marn Lim, 30, was in her room at Puri Bambu Hotel in Jimbaran, having dinner with her Taiwanese boyfriend, when she heard 'three loud explosions'.<br><br>The couple had arrived on Friday for a six-day stay.<br><br>'I am in shock because earlier in the day I was at Kuta Beach. And we were planning to go to Jimbaran for a seafood dinner, but to save money, we ordered room service instead.<br><br>'We turned on the TV at 11.30pm and when we saw the news, I initially thought it was about the 2002 Bali bombing. It didn't sink in until my mum, uncle and friends started SMSing and calling me.'<br><br>She will check today for a flight back to Singapore.<br><br></div>
