The blasts killed at least 17 people including foreigners and wounded dozens more, officials said. Yudhoyono condemned the nearly simultaneous blasts, which come three years since militants linked to al Qaeda bombed two nightclubs on Bali's Kuta Beach in October 2002, killing 202 people, mainly foreign tourists.
