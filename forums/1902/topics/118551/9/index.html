The alligator snapping turtle's aggressive temperament makes handling it dangerous, particularly to children, household pets, and to those with little caution. A small specimen can be picked up from the rear half of the shell, while a larger specimen should only be picked up by the tail at arms length (a very experienced person may lift by the rear edge of the shell). Caution, however, is required as all four legs have sharp claws and larger turtles can reach their head to the front half of the shell. Furthermore, removing alligator snapping turtles from the wild damages the ecosystems from which they are taken, and is illegal in many jurisdictions.<br><br>Conservation status: Vulnerable<br><br>Issue #184</div>

When born in captivity, they are quite docile and tolerant of interaction with humans. They are very active lizards, requiring a large amount of space to run. They prefer high temperatures, typically 105-110Â°F (40-43Â°C) at their basking spot and 80Â°F (26Â°C) elsewhere in their habitat during the day. Some collared lizards eat small amounts of fruit or vegetables, but most prefer a diet of insects. Like many reptiles, in captivity they must be provided a diet supplemented with extra calcium and a light source with ample UVB radiation to reduce the risk of bone disorders.<br><br>The origin of the name "mountain boomer" is unclear, but is thought to have originated among settlers travelling west during the Gold Rush. One theory is that settlers mistook the sound of wind in canyons for the call of an animal in an area where the collared lizard was abundant. In reality, collared lizards are silent.<br><br>Issue #192</div>

It is also called <span style="font-style: italic;">Ocypus olens</span> by some authors. The species has been introduced to the United States, New Zealand and Australia.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/Staphylinus_olens2web.jpg/800px-Staphylinus_olens2web.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/Staphylinus_olens2web.jpg/250px-Staphylinus_olens2web.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Devil's coach-horse beetle</strong>, Staphylinus olens</span><br><br>This black beetle usually shelters during the day under stones, logs or leaf litter. It is most often seen in forests, parks and gardens between April and October. It is a long-bodied beetle. At about 25-28 mm it is even one of the larger British beetles. Its wing covers (elytra) are short covering only its thorax, exposing the abdominal segments. The abdominal musculature is powerful and the abdominal segments are covered with sclerotized plates. It is capable of flight but its wings are rarely used. It is clothed with fine black hairs.<br><br>It is well known for its habit of raising its long and uncovered abdomen and opening its jaws, rather like a scorpion when threatened. This explains one of its alternative names, the <span style="font-style: italic;">cock-tail beetle</span>. Although it has no 'sting in its tail' it can give a painful bite with its strong pincer-like jaws. It also emits a foul smelling odour, as a defensive secretion, from a pair of white glands at the end of its abdomen. In the scientific name olens means oily and describes this secretion.<br><br>It is a predator, hunting mainly by night, feeding on invertebrates including worms and woodlice, as well as carrion. The prey is caught in the mandibles which are also used to cut and together with the front legs to manipulate the food into a bolus. The bolus is repeatedly chewed and swallowed, emerging covered with a brown secretion from the foregut, until it is reduced to a liquid which is digested. Skin (in the case of earth worms) and hard materials (from arthropods) are left. The larvae are also carnivorous with similar eating habits.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Staphylinus_olens%2801%29.jpg"><br><br>Females lay their eggs from 2-3 weeks after first mating. They are large (4mm) and white with a darker band and laid singly in damp conditions under moss, stones, cow pats or leaf litter, typically in the Autumn. After around 30 days the eggs split and the larvae emerge, white with a straw coloured head. The larva lives largely underground, and feeds on similar prey to the adult and has the same well developed mandibles. It adopts the same display with open jaws and raised tail when threatened. The larva goes through three stages of growth (instars) the final stage ranging from 20 to 26 mm in length. At around 150 days the larva pupates for about 35 days and emerges as an adult with its final colouring, fully formed except for the wings which cannot be folded neatly beneath the elytra for several hours. Adults can survive a second winter, some by hibernating in burrows and not emerging until March while others remain active.<br><br>This beetle has been associated with the Devil since the Middle Ages, hence its common name. Other names include <span style="font-style: italic;">Devil's footman</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Devil's steed</span>. In Ireland the beetle is known as <span style="font-style: italic;">darbhadal</span> (literally <span style="font-style: italic;">Devil's beast</span>) and it is said that the Devil assumes the form of this beetle to eat sinners. As with many supposed bringers of ill-luck superstition holds that people can turn the creature's powers to their own advantage and it is said that reapers used to enclose the body of a Devil's coach horse beetle in the handle of their scythes to improve their skill. The origin's of these beliefs can perhaps be explained by the beetle's threatening appearance, and its habit of eating carrion.<br><br>Issue #193</div>

In addition, bones and carcasses of very large sperm whales have been found with megalodon teeth jammed into them. One famed example is this, told by an unknown writer:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"In the year 1918 I recorded the sensation that had been caused among the "outside" crayfish men at Port Stephens, when, for several days, they refused to go to sea to their regular fishing grounds in the vicinity of Broughton Island. The men had been at work on the fishing groundsÂ—which lie in deep waterÂ—when an immense shark of almost unbelievable proportions put in an appearance, lifting pot after pot containing many crayfishes, and taking, as the men said, "pots, mooring lines and all". These crayfish pots, it should be mentioned, were about 3 feet 6 inches [1.06 m] in diameter and frequently contained from two to three dozen good-sized crayfish each weighing several pounds. The men were all unanimous that this shark was something the like of which they had never dreamed of. In company with the local Fisheries Inspector I questioned many of the men very closely and they all agreed as to the gigantic stature of the beast. But the lengths they gave were, on the whole, absurd. I mention them, however, as a indication of the state of mind which this unusual giant had thrown them into. And bear in mind that these were men who were used to the sea and all sorts of weather, and all sorts of sharks as well. One of the crew said the shark was "three hundred feet [90 m] long at least"! Others said it was as long as the wharf on which we stoodÂ—about 115 feet [35 m]! They affirmed that the water "boiled" over a large space when the fish swam past. They were all familiar with whales, which they had often seen passing at sea, but this was a vast shark. They had seen its terrible head which was "at least as long as the roof on the wharf shed at Nelson's Bay." Impossible, of course! But these were prosaic and rather stolid men, not given to 'fish stories' nor even to talking about their catches. Further, they knew that the person they were talking to (myself) had heard all the fish stories years before! One of the things that impressed me was that they all agreed as to the ghostly whitish color of the vast fish. The local Fisheries Inspector of the time, Mr Paton, agreed with me that it must have been something really gigantic to put these experienced men into such a state of fear and panic."</span><br><br>Others have countered that such recent estimates are inaccurate, and "claims of post-Pliocene <span style="font-style: italic;">C. megalodon</span> ... are erroneous" and based on outdated methodology. Roesch and others also note that Megalodons were probably coastal sharks, and that deep-sea survival is extremely unlikely.<br><br>There is a theory that <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodon megalodon</span> when adult fed largely on whales and went extinct as the polar seas became too cold for sharks, letting whales go out of reach of sharks for the summer.<br><br>Around 1995 the species was proposed to be placed in the new genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharocles</span>.

Rounded, pebbly scales cover the flanks and outsides of the legs.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Crocodylus_johnsoni.JPG/800px-Crocodylus_johnsoni.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Crocodylus_johnsoni.JPG/250px-Crocodylus_johnsoni.JPG"></a><br><br><strong>Diet</strong><br><br>The shape of the snout, like that of the gharial, suggests a primary adaptation to a piscivorous (fish-based) diet, and fish are certainly handled with ease. However, a wide variety of other prey items are often taken - generally invertebrates and small vertebrates, especially when younger. Larger individuals may take terrestrial species. <span style="font-style: italic;">C. johnstoni</span> favours a sit-and-wait hunting strategy, snatching prey up with a lightning-fast sideways movement of the head. It rarely feeds during the dry season because of a lack of prey availability, low temperatures at night and a reduction in available habitat due to drying of pools and rivers.<br><br><strong>Breeding</strong><br><br>Males reach sexual maturity around 1.5 m in length, with females being only slightly smaller. Courtship occurs in the early months of the dry season (around May) and nesting generally occurs between July and September. Females dig hole nests in sand embankments, exposed after the wet season water levels fall.<br><br>Research has found that all females within a particular population usually nest within the same three week period - behaviour described as 'pulse' nesting. They may also nest in groups, with many nests being laid in close proximity (some females even dig up the clutches of other females when nest density becomes very high).<br><br>Eggs are normally laid at night 6 weeks after mating, at a depth of 12 to 20 cm below the surface - too close to the surface and they risk being overheated from the sun. Incubation temperatures of between 30 and 33 degrees are desirable. Clutch size averages 13 eggs, but can range from 4 to 20. The incubation period is usually between 75 to 85 days (maximum range 65 to 95 days). Studies on temperature effects have shown that eggs incubated at 32Â°C produce male embryos, whereas those a couple of degrees above and below this produce female embryos - however, greater sexual differentiation seems to occur with fluctuating nest temperatures.<br><br>Varanus lizards and feral pigs are major predators of eggs during this period, when neither parent guards the nest. Varanids can easily find nests laid within 24 to 48 hours. On average for all nests laid, under one third of the eggs survive to hatching. The female parents return at the end of the incubation period and wait for the neonates to begin calling. They may then carry the newly-hatched juveniles to the water in their mouths, although the nests will still hatch out without the female being present. Adult females stay close to and protect the small crocodiles for a variable period following this, but protection is not as long as the sympatric <span style="font-style: italic;">C. porosus</span>. Disturbance is more likely to result in the female abandoning the nest and her offspring.<br><br>Cannibalism has been reported, often due to a scarcity of food. Only 1% of these hatchlings will survive to reach maturity, and in some years predation pressures are so high that it is unlikely that any new animals are recruited into the adult population. In some years, early rains at the end of the dry season can destroy almost all the nests through flooding. Juveniles which survive to maturity have been found returning to the same breeding and nesting areas.<br><br><strong>Conservation</strong><br><br>Good population data exist for this species, as well as the sympatric <span style="font-style: italic;">C. porosus</span>. Hunting has been less of a problem than with <span style="font-style: italic;">C. porosus</span>, mainly due to the presence of ventral osteoderms in the belly scales of adults. Long-term aboriginal hunting did not significantly affect the population, but advances in tanning processes at the end of the 1950s meant that <span style="font-style: italic;">C. johnstoni</span> skins could be utilised when <span style="font-style: italic;">C. porosus</span> populations became depleted. This hunting caused a widespread reduction in the population until protection measures were implemented in the 1960s and 1970s.<br><br>Although a small amount of illegal poaching and killing no doubt persists, the major threat at the moment is the omnipresent one of habitat destruction. Recently, invasive species such as cane toads (<span style="font-style: italic;">Bufo marinus</span>) have led to mortality of adults and presumably juveniles in otherwise healthy populations. The threat of these toads has not yet been ascertained properly, although it is likely that only dwarf populations are under any real long-term threat.<br><br>Populations have recently recovered to a significant extent. Small-scale farming and ranching programs exist for commercial purposes, and monitoring and management studies which were initiated in the 1970s are still ongoing. Valuable long-term research is being conducted upon the population dynamics of this species, together with other studies looking at biology, physiology and development. Population estimates vary, as the species can be difficult to survey effectively, but it is not unreasonable to assume that there are at least 100,000 individuals in the wild.<br><br>Conservation status: Lower risk (lc)<br><br>Issue #200</div>

Adults may attain a weight of 1.3 kilograms; there is no sexual dimorphism observed.<br><br><strong>Habitat and diet</strong><br><br>Found in both dry and moist areas, Gray-bellied Night Monkeys occupy all levels of the forest canopy; however, they are seldom found on the ground. They prefer dense vegetation with tangles of vines where the trees are evenly dispersed. Lemurine Owl Monkeys range from Colombia and north-eastern Argentina to Ecuador and Panama; they are also found in the tropical Andes.<br><br>By day the monkeys slumber in the cavities of trees or in dense thickets; by night, they search the canopy for a variety of food items.

When not feeding, the monkeys are typically inactive. Like other members of their genus, Gray-bellied Night Monkeys claim a relatively small territory of about 0.1 kmÂ².
