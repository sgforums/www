The hands and feet are black and the tail is brown. Outstanding is its long, white mustache, which extends to both sides beyond the shoulders. The animals reach a length of 24 to 26 cm, plus a 35 cm long tail. They weigh approximately 300 to 400 g.<br><br>This primate inhabits tropical rain forests, living deep in the forest and also in open tree-covered areas. They are diurnal animals, spending the majority of its days in the trees with quick, safe movements and broad jumps among the limbs.<br><br>Emperor Tamarins live together in groups of two to eight animals. The oldest female leads the group above several mature males. The mutual grooming plays an important role for bonding and socializing. The animals often associate themselves with other tamarins like the Brown-mantled Tamarin. They have various cries which help them to promptly recognize interlopers.<br><br>The diet of the Emperor Tamrins is similar to that of other tamarins. They are omnivores, primarily eating fruits, insects and sap. They also eat bird eggs and small vertebrates (such as tree frogs). Due to their small weight they can reach food at the far end of branches, which are not accessible to heavier animals.<br><br>Emperor Tamarins live a polyandrous life, i.e. the mature female mates with all of the males of her harem. Gestation is 140 to 145 days, and births are typially twins (although triplets happen on occasion) as is typical of tamarins. All the males, father or not, help with the birth and care and support the young, carrying them and bringing them to the mother to nurse. At approximately three months they are weaned, and towards end of the second year they are fully mature.

They are often found in urban and suburban settings and are a common backyard bird. They often take over a nest used by some other large bird, sometimes adding feathers to line the nest but usually not much more. In the Sonoran desert, they often take over abandoned Red-tailed Hawk nests in the arms of Saguaro cacti.<br><br>Great Horned Owls are one of the earliest breeding owls of North America. They breed in late January or early February and are often heard calling to each other in the fall. They choose a mate by December and are often heard dueting before this time. They are permanent residents, but may wander after the nesting season.<br><br>These birds hunt at night by waiting on a high perch and swooping down on prey. They mainly eat mammals such as rats, mice, rabbits and skunks, as well as small birds, including smaller owls. In northern regions, they may let uneaten food freeze and then thaw it out later using their own body heat.<br><br>They have excellent hearing and exceptional vision in low light. Unlike humans, owls have a sort of depth perception to their hearing, beyond "louder is closer". This is possible because owl ears are not placed in the same position on either side of their head: the right ear is typically set higher in the skull and at a slightly different angle. By tilting or turning its head until the sound is the same in each ear, an owl can pinpoint both the direction and the distance to the source of a sound.<br><br>Their call is a low-pitched but loud "ho-ho-hoo hoo hoo." Sometimes it is only four syllables instead of five. The female's call is higher and rises in pitch at the end of the call. Young owls make hissing or screeching sounds that are often confused with the calls of Barn Owls.<br><br>The Great Horned Owl is the provincial bird of Alberta.<br><br>Issue #391</div>

Typical males have a forewing length of 6-10 mm with a light brown area at the base distinguishable from a much darker, red-brown area at the tip. The latter may be absent, the moth appearing uniformly light brown, as in the females, with only slightly darker oblique markings distinguishing the area at the tip of the wing. Females have a forewing length of 7-13 mm.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pupae</span><br><br>Pupae are at first green, but become medium brown after rapidly hardening. Female pupae are generally larger than male pupae.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Larvae</span><br><br>Larvae are not easily distinguished from the larvae of other tortricid leafrollers. The first larval instar has a dark brown head; all other instars have a light fawn head and prothoracic plate. Overwintering larvae are darker. First instar larvae are approximately 1.6 mm long, and final instar larvae range from 10 to 18 mm in length. The body of a mature larva is medium green with a darker green central stripe and two side stripes.<br><br><strong>Distribution</strong><br><br>The light brown apple moth is a native insect of Australia. It has been introduced and now occurs in New Caledonia, the British Isles, Hawaii, Western Australia and New Zealand.<br><br><strong>Life cycle</strong><br><br>Light brown apple moth passes through three generations annually with a partial fourth generation in some years, and has no winter resting stage. There is considerable overlap in the generations. In warmer areas four generations are completed annually, with major flight periods occurring during September-October, December-January, February-March, and April-May. In cooler climates the number of complete generations may be reduced to two during prevailing inclement climatic conditions.<br><br>Eggs are laid in clusters of 3-150 on leaves or fruit. Adults produced by the overwintering larval generation emerge during October and November. These give rise to the first summer generation, in which final instar larvae mature between January and mid February. Second generation larvae reach maturity during March and April, and the adults from this generation provide third generation eggs. Normally, the rate of larval development is slowed considerably during the winter; thus the majority of larvae over-winter in the prolonged early juvenile phases of the second third, and fourth instars. During this period they normally feed on herbaceous plants. Re-invasion of apple trees takes place during October-December, when moths of the third generation start laying eggs again on the apple leaves<br><br><strong>Diet and Damage</strong><br><br>The insect is highly polyphagus and the larvae attack numerous horticultural crops in Australia and New Zealand. It is known to feed on 123 dicotyledonous plant species, including 22 Australian natives, belonging to 55 different families. In New Zealand, over 250 host species have been recorded. It attacks nearly all types of fruit crops, ornamentals, vegetables, glasshouse crops, and occasionally young pine seedlings.<br><br>The larvae cause damage to foliage and fruit. Early instars feed on tissue beneath the upper epidermis (surface layer) of leaves, while protected under self-constructed silken webs on the undersurface of leaves. Larger larvae migrate from these positions to construct feeding niches between adjacent leaves, between a leaf and a fruit, in the developing bud, or on a single leaf, where the "topical" leaf roll develops. The late stage larvae feed on all leaf tissue except main veins.<br><br>Superficial fruit damage is common in apple varieties which form compact fruit clusters. Leaves are webbed to the fruit and feeding injury takes place under the protection of the leaf; or larvae spin up between fruits of a cluster. Internal damage to apple, pear, and citrus fruits is less common, but a young larva may enter the interior of an apple or pear fruit through the calyx or beneath the stem of a citrus fruit. Excreta are usually ejected on to the outside of the fruit<br><br>Issue #393</div>

The original specimen, recovered by Gideon Mantell in 1832 from the Tilgate Forest in the south of England in 1832, now resides in the Natural History Museum of London, where it is still encased in the limestone block in which it was found. Despite never having been prepared, it is still the best specimen that exists of this primitive, armored ankylosaurian.<br><br><img src="http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/6537/goo2h1va.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Hylaeosaurus</strong></span><br><br><strong>Description and environment</strong><br><br>Hylaeosaurus lived about 135 million years ago, in the Valanginian to Berriasian ages of the early Cretaceous. Gideon Mantell originally estimated that the Hylaeosaurus was about 25 feet (7.5 meters) long, or about half the size of the other two original dinosaurs, the Iguanodon and the Megalosaurus. Modern estimates range from 3 to 6 meters (10 to 20 feet) in length.<br><br>It is a fairly typical armored dinosaur, with three long spines on its shoulder, two at the hips, and three rows of armor running down its back. It may also have had a row of plates down its tail. It has a long head, more like the head of a Nodosaurus than an Ankylosaurus; and a beak, which it probably used to crop low-lying vegetation.<br><br><strong>Classification</strong><br><br>Hylaeosaurus armatus was first named by Gideon Mantell in 1833, and is currently considered the only species in the genus. It is known from only two partial skeletons, some horny (dermal) spines, armor, and various other minor pieces. The best specimen (the original) is composed of the front end of a skeleton minus most of the head, though only the parts on the face of the stone block are easily studied.<br><br>Polacanthoides ponderosus, Hylaeosaurus conybearei, and Hylaeosaurus oweni have all been considered distinct dinosaurs in the past, but are now considered to be alternate names for this species (junior synonyms), along with Hyaelosaurus. It has also been suggested that Polacanthus is same species, but there are a number of differences in their bone structure (osteology).<br><br>Hylaeosaurus is traditionally considered to be a primitive nodosaurid, in the Polcanthinae subfamily, like Gastonia and Polcanthus. In the 1990s, the polcanthines were reclassified as primitive ankylosaurids, because they were mistakenly believed to have small tail-clubs; they are probably primitive ankylosaurids, but as a whole the polcanthines are poorly known. The group peaked in the Barremian age in North America and Europe, and then vanished shortly after, replaced by more advanced ankylosaurians.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The first Hylaeosaurus fossils were discovered in Sussex. Additional remains have been discovered on the Isle of Wight (also part of Great Britain), and in Ardennes, France, though the remains from France may actually belong to a Polacanthus. Mantell published a lithograph of his find in The Geology of the South-east of England in 1833; and another drawing in the fourth edition of The Wonders of Geology, in 1840.<br><br>Gideon Mantell originally claimed the name Hylaeosaurus meant "forest lizard", after the Tilgate Forest in which it was discovered. Later, he claimed that it meant "Wealden lizard" ("wealden" being another word for forest), in reference to the Wealden Group, the name for the early Cretaceous geological formation in which the dinosaur was first found.<br><br>In any case, the species epithet armatus, or "armored", was chosen by Mantell because there<br><br>"appears every reason to conclude that either its back was armed with a formidable row of spines, constituting a dermal fringe, or that its tail possessed the same appendage".<br><br>Conservation status: Fossil<br><br>Issue #396</div>

Flying W Farms has bred English Mastiffs for decades, but noticed several negative health characteristics incumbent within the breed, namely hip dysplasia, excessive drooling, a shorter lifespan, and chronic elbow and knee problems, although it is important to keep in mind that not all English Mastiffs suffer from these ailments. During World War II, English Mastiffs nearly vanished from England; with resources limited due to the war effort, it became unpopular to feed a dog quantities of food that could feed an active soldier. Following the war, the English Mastiffs breed began to recover in North America, but perhaps due to the dramatic narrowing of the breed's bloodlines, many of these negative health traits began appearing more frequently. In order to correct these faults, Flying W Farms crossed the English Mastiff with an Anatolian Shepherd and engaged in aggressive medical screening of its sires and dams. Flying W Farms American Mastiffs are 7/8 English Mastiff and 1/8 Anatolian Shepherd.<br><br>This resulted in a breed that looks exactly like the English Mastiff but without the excessive drooling that is common in the English Mastiff. This American Mastiff loves children and are devoted to their families. These are loyal and calm dogs. They are generally non-aggressive except when their family is threatened. In those instances they become fierce and courageous guard dogs. American Mastiffs generally weigh between 150 and 250 pounds.<br><br>The second line is sometimes called the Panja American Mastiff, developed by the Panja kennel. The Panja Mastiffs have a reputation for being much more aggressive than the Flying W Farms breed, and less suitable for children. They also grow to immense size and are highly intelligent.<br><br>Both lines are very new with not much breed history, making them ineligible for registration in most breed registries; registries with relaxed requirements may recognize a new breed with minimal history, such as the Continental Kennel Club's recognition of the Flying W Farms line. Some critics claim that these are simply crossbred dogs or variants on the standard English Mastiff. It is not clear which line, if either, will ultimately become a solid breed known as the American Mastiff.<br><br>Alternative names: Panja<br>Country of origin: United States<br><br>Issue #397</div>

Movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces, assisted by the huge tail, which is usually held upright, and rarely still. The diet is a wide range of small creatures, mostly insects, supplemented by small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit. Both males and females sing a pleasant, complex song. Additionally, males possess a peculiar "Type II Vocalization"; this is not an alarm call (the usual series of sharp chits which is universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators). It is given in response to predatory birds calling, commonly Grey Butcherbirds, and it is song-like and given only once each instance (Langmore &amp; Mulder 1992). The purpose of this behavior remains unknown; it has been proposed that it serves to announce male fitness (as it is not a warning call, but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator) but this is far from certain.<br><br>Another interesting habit of males of this and other fairy-wren species during the reproductive season is to pluck petals (in this species, yellow ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to conspecifics (Karubian &amp; Alvarando 2003). The obvious conclusion would be that this is a form of courtship (when directed at females) and/or antagonistic behavior (when directed at other males). However, research, while suggesting a courtship rather than antagonistic function of this behavior, has failed to show a good correspondence between petal-carrying and mating success in the related Red-backed Fairy-wren. It is notable that fairy-wrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for a long time, but mate with other individuals. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. Thus, petal-carrying might be a behavior that strengthens the pair-bond.<br><br>Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour, lighter underneath, with the tail fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males). Breeding males, however, take on rich blue tones around the head, chest and back.<br><br>Issue #399</div>

This apparent contradiction is known as Denny's paradox.<br><br>Water striders beat Denny's paradox by generating not capillary waves but hemispherical vortices in the water.

Writing in Nature, biophysicists Xuefeng Gao and Lei Jiang show that the water resistance of the legs is due to the "special hierarchical structure of the legs, which are covered by large numbers of oriented tiny hairs (microsetae) with fine nanogrooves". They go on to demonstrate that this physical structure is more important than the chemical properties of the wax coating of the legs.<br><br>Gao and Jiang calculate the maximal supporting force of a single leg to be is 1.52 millinewtons (152 dynes or 0.011 poundal), which is about 15 times the total body weight of the insect. This shows that the surface of the leg is strikingly water repellent.<br><br>For comparison, Gao and Jiang made a hydrophobic 'leg' from a smooth quartz fibre that was similar in shape and size to a strider's leg. Its surface was coated with a thin layer of heptadecafluorodecyltrimethoxysilane (FAS-17), whose contact angle with water is 109Â°. However, this artificial leg supported a force of only 0.19 mN (19 dyn or 0.0014 pdl): this would be just about enough to support the strider at rest, but not to enable it to dart around rapidly on the surface.<br><br>Gao and Jiang went on to calculate that the contact angle with water on a real strider's leg would be greater than 150Â° (and described this using the neologism 'superhydrophobic') and, using a sessile water-drop showed that the contact angle of the insect's legs with water was 167.6Â° Â± 4.4Â°.<br><br>They went on to infer that the observed superhydrophobicity was due to microstructures on the legs and, using a scanning electron microscope, showed that the legs were covered in many needle shaped setae, with diameters ranging from 3 micrometres down to a few hundred nanometres. Most of the setae were about 50 micrometres long and were at an angle of about 20Â° from the surface of leg. Each microseta also had nanoscale grooves, contributing to the hierarchical structure of the leg.<br><br>Gao and Jiang used Cassie's law to show that air is trapped in spaces in the microsetae and nanogrooves, forming a cushion at the legÂ–water interface.

The whale, which lives in the Southern Hemisphere, was first described by Gray in 1846, and is the sole member of the genus Caperea and the family Neobalaenidae. Despite its name, the Pygmy Right Whale has more in common with the Gray Whale and rorquals than the Bowhead and Right Whales.<br><br><img src="http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/5368/whaleee1wp.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Pygmy Right Whale</strong>, Caperea marginata</span><br><br><strong>Physical description</strong><br><br>The Pygmy Right Whale is rarely encountered and consequently little studied. However it is known that the Pygmy Right is by far smallest of the baleens. The birth weight and size of the animal are unknown. The estimated length of an adult is between 4 and 6.5 m. The estimated weight of an adult is between 3,000 and 3,500 kg. Gestation and lactation periods and longevity are all unknown. Part of the reason for the paucity of data may be the relative inactivity of the whale, making study difficult. The blow is small and indistinct and the whale is usually a slow undulating swimmer, but capable of bursts of acceleration.<br><br>The colouring and shape of the Pygmy Right Whale, a dark grey top side and lighter grey underside, commonly with a pair of chevron-shaped lighter patches behind the eyes, is similar to that of the Dwarf and Antarctic Minke Whales and at sea may easily be confused with these two species if the jaw and flippers are not. The arched jawline is not as pronounced as other Right Whales and may not be sufficient to distinguish a Pygmy Right from a Minke. The long, narrow cream-coloured baleen plates with a distinctive white gumline are the most effective discriminators. Unlike true Right Whales, Pygmy Rights do not have callosities. The dorsal fin is falcate (crescent-shaped) and located about three-quarters of the way along the back of the animal. Unlike the Minke Whale, occasionally the dorsal will not be seen on the whale surfacing, and the tail fin has not been observed clear of the water.<br><br>Analysis of the stomach contents of dead Pymgy Rights indicates that it feeds on copepods and euphausiids. It is not known if the animal feeds close to shore or at sea. Similarly the social and mating structures are unknown. The whale is typically seen alone or in a pair, with occasional sightings of groups up to 10 strong and one report of 80 animals grouped closely in oceanic waters.<br><br><strong>Population and distribution</strong><br><br>The Pygmy Right Whale is perhaps the least studied of all cetaceans on account of its sparse population (as of 1998 fewer than 20 encounters in the open sea have been recorded worldwide - the whale prefers sheltered shallow bays). The species lives in the Southern Hemisphere and is believed to be circumpolar, living in a band from about 30Â°S to 50Â°S in areas with surface water temperature between 5 and 20 degrees Celsius. One individual was found washed up as far south as Tierra del Fuego (55Â°S) in southern Argentina. Individuals have been found on the coast of Namibia, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. One group may be a year-round resident off Tasmania. The total population is unknown.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Cetacea_range_map_Pygmy_Right_Whale.PNG/250px-Cetacea_range_map_Pygmy_Right_Whale.PNG"><br><br><strong>Whaling and whale-watching</strong><br><br>On account of its relatively small size and sparse distribution the Pygmy Right Whale was not the target of a whalers. It is likely that a few Pygmy Rights were taken opportunistically by whalers hunting Minke Whales. Also a few Pygmy Rights are known to have been caught in fishing nets. However these factors are not believed to have had a significant on population.<br><br>Most data about Pygmy Right Whales comes from individuals washed up on coastlines; they are rarely encountered at sea and so they are not the primary subject of any whale watching cruises.<br><br>Conservation status: Unknown<br><br>Issue #406</div>

This snake normally reaches a size of around 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3.0 m), with females being slightly larger on average than the males. The largest recorded specimen was over 18 feet (5.5 m) long, but there is some controversy over this 18 foot specimen, which was collected on the island of Trinidad. The specimen was not preserved for science and the skin was lost and it is now believed that it was a case of misidentification; the specimen in question most likely being an anaconda.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/K%C3%B6nigsschlange_%28Boa_constrictor%29.jpg/517px-K%C3%B6nigsschlange_%28Boa_constrictor%29.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/K%C3%B6nigsschlange_%28Boa_constrictor%29.jpg/250px-K%C3%B6nigsschlange_%28Boa_constrictor%29.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Red-tailed Boa</strong>, Boa constrictor</span><br><br>Common specimens have an interesting pattern of brown and black with a reddish tail (see picture). They do well in captivity, become quite docile, and are a common sight in zoos. Boas can easily live to be 20 to 30 years old, with rare accounts of over 40 years, making them a long-term commitment as a pet. Animal husbandry may be the most significant factor in captive lifespan.<br><br>Female Boas have "live birth", rather than laying eggs. Fertilization by the male is internal. During copulation, females can cling to the male via a small set of "spurs" that are generally hidden below scales on either side of the vent and are actually remnants of the hind legs. Due to the lengthy mating period, it is often difficult to determine the start date of fertilization. As result, gestation period of Boas is not well understood. After a gestation period of roughly 4-6 months, the female gives birth to 20-40 live young (ovoviviparous reproduction).<br><br>The species has been divided into a number of sub-species that occur from Mexico to Argentina, as well as on the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica and St. Lucia. The sub-species vary somewhat in average size, color, and demeanor. Selective breeding has resulted in a wide range of colorations, including specimens which are completely white (albino), or white with orange-colored markings.<br><br>The common name "boa constrictor" can also be used to refer to any of the four species in the genus Boa, as all are constrictors Â— that is, they do not use venom to kill, but rather coil around the prey animal. Contrary to popular belief, the snake does not slowly crush its prey, death comes quickly usually via asphyxia or heart failure.<br><br>The subspecies <span style="font-style: italic;">B. c. imperator</span> (typically from Colombia) are popular in pet stores today, as are <span style="font-style: italic;">B. c. constrictor</span> (Guyana, Peru, Surinam). Both have been called "common" boas in the pet trade, although <span style="font-style: italic;">B. c. imperator</span> is more common in pet stores today. The term "red-tailed" (and which subspecies is the "true" red-tailed boa) is debated somewhat in the breeding community, as it tends to be used by pet-shops as a marketing term when referring to any boa, and has little scientific meaning.<br><br>Issue #408</div>

The breed is instantly recognised by its distinctive tricolor pattern: body, neck, legs, cranium and ears black; cheeks, stockings and eyespots rich tan, toes, chest, muzzle, tail tip and blaze between the eyes white. The pattern is rigid and varies only slightly in the amount of white. A perfectly-marked individual gives the impression of a white Â“Swiss crossÂ” on the chest, when viewed from the front in sitting position. The eyes are an expressive dark brown.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grooming</span><br><br>The Bernese coat is slightly rough in outline, but not at all harsh in texture.

Several kinds of cancer (malignant histiocytosis, mastocytoma, lymphosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma) commonly affect Berners; hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, osteoarthritis, plus autoimmune and kidney problems are other major health issues for the breed.
