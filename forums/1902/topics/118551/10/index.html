They are most common in the southeastern United States. They are best known for their large gray football-shaped paper nest, which they build in the spring for raising their young. Like the Median wasp <span style="font-style: italic;">Dolichovespula media</span> in Europe, Bald-faced hornets are extremely protective of their nests and will sting repeatedly if disturbed.<br><br>Every year young queens that were born and fertilized the previous year start a new colony and raise their young. The workers expand the nest by chewing up wood that mixes with a starch in their saliva, which they spread with their mandibles and legs to dry into paper. The workers also guard the nest and collect nectar and arthropods to feed the larvae. This continues through summer and into fall. As winter approaches, the wasps die, except for young fertilized queens which hibernate underground or in hollow trees. The nest is generally abandoned by winter, and will most likely not be reused. When spring arrives the young queens emerge, and the cycle begins again.<br><br>Like other social wasps, Bald-faced Hornets have a caste system made up of the following:<br><br>* Queens - Fertile females which begin the colonies and lay eggs<br>* Workers - Infertile females which have stingers and do the manual labor<br>* Drones - Fertile males which have no stingers, fertilize the eggs, yet are born from unfertilized eggs.<br><br>Bald-faced Hornets also go through a metamorphosis that consists of 4 stages:<br><br>1.

This small island was and still is an important seabird colony, and sustained a number of endemic species, including the rail.

Illustration from Rothschild (1893-1900)</span><br><br><strong>Habitat and Description</strong><br><br>Laysan is considered on of the most important seabird colonies in the United States. It has thousands of Black-footed Albatross, Laysan Albatross as well as shearwaters and terns. The island also held 5 unique landbirds, including the Laysan Rail. It was a small (15 cm) bird, flightless member of the rail family, an opportunist that would feed on invertebrates and the eggs of seabirds. It was an aggressive feeder that would fight off other species, particularly the Laysan Finch. It was endemic to the Laysan, though some authors have noted that there were records on other Hawaiian islands.<br><br><strong>Extinction</strong><br><br>The extinction of the Laysan Rail is particularly unfortunate as it could have easily been avoided. The rail was initially threatened when rabbits were introduced to Laysan. With no predators to control their numbers the rabbits soon ate the entire vegetation cover on the island. This turned the island into a barren dust bowl, sending the Laysan Millerbird and the Laysan Honeycreeper (both subspecies endemic to the island) to extinction. The Laysan Finch and Laysan Duck both survived by eating shore flies and scavenging bird eggs and carrion. The rail is believed to have become extinct on Laysan in the 1920s.<br><br>The story did not end there, however. The rail had been introduced to Midway Atoll in 1891, and had thrived on the island. Once the rail had become extinct on Laysan moves were made to both re-introduce the rail to its old home and take some to the main islands of Hawaii, along with Laysan Finches, to form a experimental population. This would have safeguarded the species. Rails were collected for this, however the idea was held up by red-tape, some people in the United States Biological Survey were concerned that the Laysan Finch, if it escaped on the main islands, would become a serious pest. The move of some of the birds to safety was therefore held up because of concerns about the finch.<br><br>The population on Midway survived until the Second World War, when in 1943 a landing craft accidentally broke free during a battle and rats were introduced on to the island. Within two years the species was extinct. A final irony was that the last man to see a Laysan Rail alive was warden Ed Caum, the man who had refused their export to Honolulu.<br><br>The scientific name honours Henry Palmer, who collected in the Hawaiian Islands for Walter Rothschild.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct (1945)<br><br>Issue #212</div>

The Keuda type is currently under development to become a standardized breed. The roots of the breed are from a 1980s study called the "<strong>K</strong>itten <strong>E</strong>valuation <strong>U</strong>nder <strong>D</strong>irect <strong>A</strong>ssessment" which was meant to determine the characteristics which led to superior barn cats in the Southwestern United States. Barn cats gathered from the study area (Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas) were bred with each other to develop the breed.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Cat.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>American Keuda</strong></span><br><br>The American Keuda has some pronounced similarities with the Egyptian Mau breed. It is an open and controversial question whether this reflects an Egyptian Mau contribution to their gene pool or whether cats with Mau-like traits are superior barn cats. In the latter case, these traits would be reinforced over time and would not necessarily require a Mau contribution to the gene pool. Since the Egyptian Mau itself was redomesticated from feral Egyptian cat populations in the mid-1950s, it may represent a superior feral cat type, closely reproduced in the deserts of the American Southwest in the Keuda, but with no direct genetic connection to that breed.<br><br>American Keuda cats share many physical similarities with the Mau, including body type and a belly flap, not seen in other breeds. Since the belly flap adaptation allows extra extension when running, and thus more speed, this would be a successful adaptation for any cat that needed speed, like a barn cat. Keudas also share a high level of intelligence and athleticism with the Mau, as well as speed and a love for warm conditions. One marked difference between the Keuda and the Mau is the wide diversity of appearance the Keuda displays. While some Keudas look strikingly like Maus, they may also look like a Siamese, Havana Brown, cats of other breeds or mixed breed cats. Keuda cats display a much wider variety of coat colors and patterns than do Maus.<br><br>Issue #213</div>

The fur is generally pearl grey, with black and cream patches at the base of the pink ears. The tail tapers only moderately and the last quarter of it is black, often with a white tip. The muzzle is short and rounded. Northern forms tend to be brown coloured rather than grey and, as predicted by Bergmann's Rule, smaller.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/Sugar-Glider2-232.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Sugar Glider</strong>, Petaurus breviceps</span><br><br>The most noticeable features of its anatomy, however, are the twin skin membranes called "patagium"s which extend from the fifth finger of the forelimb back to the first toe of the hind foot. These are inconspicuous when the Sugar Glider is at rest Â— it merely looks a little flabby, as though it had lost a lot of weight recently Â— but immediately obvious when it takes flight. The membranes are used to glide between trees: when fully extended they form an aerodynamic surface the size of a large handkerchief.<br><br>Sugar Gliders can occupy any area where there are tree hollows for shelter and sufficient food. Their diet varies considerably with both geography and the changing seasons, but the main items are the sap of acacias and certain eucalupts, nectar, pollen, and arthropods. They are difficult to see in the wild, being small, wary, and nocturnal, but a sure sign of their presence is the stripping of bark and tooth marks left in the soft, green shoots of acacia trees.<br><br>The gliding membranes are primarily used as an efficient way to get to food resources. They may also, as a secondary function, help the Sugar Glider escape predators like goannas, introduced foxes and cats, and the marsupial carnivores that foxes, cats, and Dingos largely supplanted. The ability to glide from tree to tree is clearly of little value with regard to the Sugar Glider's avian predators, however, in particular owls and kookaburras.<br><br>Although their aerial adaptation looks rather clumsy and primitive by comparison with the highly specialised limbs of birds and bats, Sugar Gliders can glide for a surprisingly long distance Â— flights have been measured at over 50 meters (55 yd) Â— and steer effectively by curving one or other of the gliding membranes (patagium). They use their hind legs to thrust powerfully away from a tree, and when about 3 meters (3 yd) from the destination tree trunk, bring their hind legs up close to the body and swoop upwards to make contact with all four limbs together.<br><br>In suitable habitats, they are common, often reaching densities of 1 per 1,000 square meters provided that there are tree hollows available for shelter. They live in groups of up to 7 adults, plus the current season's young, all sharing a nest and defending their territory. Adult males mark the territory with saliva and with scent glands, and also mark members of the group with the scent produced by separate glands on the forehead and chest. Visitors which lack the appropriate scent marking are expelled violently. The dominant male mates more frequently with the female of the group than the other males, and does most of the scent marking. When an adult member of the group dies, it is normally replaced: by one of the group's own offspring if female, but by an outsider if male.<br><br>In the more temperate south, breeding starts in mid-winter (June or July). In the north, there seems to be no particular breeding season. Two young per female is typical; they remain in the pouch for about 70 days, and after leaving it stay inside the nest for another 40 or 50 days, then begin to forage outside, usually under the care of the mother. The young are normally ejected from the group territory at 7 to 10 months of age. Sometimes they form new groups if an area is vacant, but competition for territory is fierce and not many survive the first months of independent life. In captivity, they may live up to fifteen years.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1a/Sugar-Glider-418.jpg"><br><br>Unlike many native animals, particularly smaller ones, Sugar Gliders are not endangered. Despite the massive loss of natural habitat in Australia over the last 200 years, they are adaptable and capable of living in surprisingly small patches of remnant bush, particularly if they do not have to cross large expanses of clear-felled land to reach them. Several close relatives, however, <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> endangered, particularly Leadbeater's Possum and the Mahogany Glider (which, to the non-expert, looks almost exactly like a Sugar Glider).<br><br>Like all native creatures they are protected by law in Australia where it is illegal to keep them as pets, or to capture or sell them without a licence (which is usually only issued for <span style="font-style: italic;">bona-fide</span> research). However, they are not difficult to breed in captivity under the right conditions, and small numbers have been legally exported to America where they have formed a breeding population for sale as pets. The Sugar Glider is a popular pet because of its sweet, lively, inquisitive nature, but is illegal in certain jurisdictions, such as California, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, and Alaska. Many other states in the United States require a permit.<br><br>A sugar glider featured on the reverse of the Australian 1 cent coin, until it was withdrawn from circulation in 1991.<br><br>Conservation status: Lower risk<br><br>Issue #214</div>

About 110 modern species are known separated into two families, with 10 genera.

There are two antennae on the first head segment and usually a pair of eyes. The second head segment has a mouth. Unlike arthropods, the animal does not have a stiff exoskeleton. Their skin (cuticle) is covered with fine hairs (papillae) giving a velvet-like feel and accounting for their popular name of "velvet worms". The cuticle is shed periodically to allow growth. Although the body has several dozen repeated leg pairs, it is not actually segmented. Onychophores are coelomates with a haemocoel. The entire structure is supported by blood pumped by a heart. Legs are tipped by chitinous claws and walking pads used on smooth surfaces. Onychophores breathe through always-open passages in the skin trachea. As a result, all known species require a humid environment to avoid desiccation.<br><br>Modern onychophores are predators that are able to immobilize animals several times their own size with a gluey substance that they eject from glands in their head.

The tortoises exploit many different kinds of habitat including grasslands, low scrub, mangrove swamps, and coastal dunes.<br><br>A peculiar kind of habitat has evolved due to the pressures of the tortoises: "tortoise turf," a comingling of 21 species of grasses and herbs. Many of these distinct plants are natually dwarfed and grow their seeds not from the tops of the plants, but closer to the ground to avoid the tortoises' close cropping jaws.<br><br>As the largest animal in its environment, the Aldabra Tortoise performs a role similar to that of the elephant. Their vigorous search for food fells trees and creates pathways used by other animals.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br><br>Aldabra tortoises are found both individually and in herds, which tend to gather mostly on open grasslands. They are most active in the mornings when they spend time browsing for food. They dig underground burrows or rest in swamps to keep cool during the heat of the day.<br><br>While they are characteristically slow and cautious, they are capable of appreciable speed, especially when tempted with a treat. They are also known to attempt perilous acrobatic feats, rising precariously on their hind legs to reach low branches. They risk death by tipping onto their backs and being unable to right themselves.<br><br>They are also excellent swimmers, being neutrally buoyant. This allowed the spread and eventual speciation of many kinds of related (and now extinct) tortoises across the Indian Ocean.<br><br>The tortoises are not domestic or tame, but they are remarkably indifferent to the presence of humans. They do not seem to have any fear of people; some even seek them out for attention. Some like to have their heads patted, others enjoy having their necks scratched where they meet their plastron.<br><br><strong>Life Span</strong><br><br>Large tortoises are among the longest-lived animals on the planet. Some individual Aldabra Giant Tortoises are thought to be over 100 years of age, but this is difficult to verify because they tend to outlive their human observers.<br><br><strong>Conservation</strong><br><br>The Aldabra Giant Tortoise has an unusually long history of organized conservation. No less a figure than Charles Darwin worked with the government of Mauritius to establish a preserve at the end of the 19th century.<br><br>Issue #224</div>

The name comes from the Afrikaans for "earth pig" (<span style="font-style: italic;">aarde</span> earth, <span style="font-style: italic;">vark</span> pig), because early settlers from Europe thought it resembled a pig (although Aardvarks are not closely related to pigs).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Erdferkel-drawing.jpg/800px-Erdferkel-drawing.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Erdferkel-drawing.jpg/200px-Erdferkel-drawing.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Aardvark</strong>, Orycteropus afer</span><br><br>The Aardvark is the only surviving member of the family Orycteropodidae and of the order Tubulidentata. The Aardvark was originally placed in the same genus as the South American anteaters because of superficial similarities which, it is now known, are the result of convergent evolution, not common ancestry. (For the same reason, Aardvarks bear a striking first-glance resemblance to the marsupial bilbies and bandicoots of Australasia, which are not placental mammals at all.)<br><br>The oldest known Tubulidentata fossils have been found in Kenya and date to the early Miocene. Although the relationships of Tubulidentata are unknown, they are probably Ungulates. They spread to Europe and southern Asia during the later Miocene and early Pliocene periods. Three genera of the family Orycteropodidae are known: <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorycteropus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Myorycteropus</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Orycteropus</span>, the surviving Aardvark. A genus from Madagascar may be related to them, called Plesiorycteropus.<br><br>The most distinctive characteristic of the Tubulidentata is (as the name implies) their teeth which, instead of having a pulp cavity, have lots of thin tubes of dentine, each containing pulp and held together by cementum. The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. Aardvarks are born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, but these fall out and are not replaced. In adult Aardvarks, the only teeth are the molars at the back of the jaw.<br><br>Aardvarks are only vaguely pig-like; the body is stout with an arched back; the limbs are of moderate length. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb')Â—resulting in four toesÂ—but the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof. The ears are disproportionately long and the tail very thick at the base with a gradual taper. The greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck, and at the end of the snout is a disk in which the nostrils open. The mouth is typical of species that feed on termites: small and tubular. Aardvarks have long, thin, protrusible tongues and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell.<br><br>Weight is typically between 40 and 65 kg; length is usually between 1 and 1.3 m. Aardvarks are a pale yellowish gray in color, often stained reddish-brown by soil. The coat is thin and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin; Aardvarks have been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest, so well does it protect them.<br><br>In the past, several individual species of Aardvark were named, however current knowledge indicates that there is only one species, <span style="font-style: italic;">Orycteropus afer</span>, with several subspecies; 18 have been listed but most are regarded as invalid.<br><br>Aardvarks are nocturnal and solitary creatures that feed almost exclusively on ants and termites. An Aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range, swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food. When a concentration of ants or termites is found, the Aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongueÂ—as many as 50,000 in one night has been recorded. They are exceptionally fast diggers, but otherwise move rather slowly.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Orycteropus_afer01.jpg/250px-Orycteropus_afer01.jpg"><br><br>Aside from digging out ants and termites, aardvarks also excavate burrows to live in: temporary sites scattered around the home range as refuges, and the main burrow which is used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances, and be 13 m long. Aardvarks change the layout of their home burrow regularly, and from time to time move on and make a new one. Only mothers and young share burrows.<br><br>After a gestation period of 7 months, a single young weighing around 2 kg is born, and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks. At six months of age it is digging its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season. Aardvarks live for up to 10 years in captivity.<br><br>Aardvarks are distributed across most of sub-Saharan Africa, and although killed by humans both for their flesh and for their teeth (which are used as decorations), do not appear to be threatened.<br><br>The aardvark is a distant cousin of the giraffe.

The skin is black, greenish or brown, often with white or yellow bars; while the snake is young these lines are more distinct. It is a native of South-east Asia, inhabiting the forests of India, Malaysia and the Philippines, but not Sri Lanka. Its main diet is other snakes, but if it is desperate it will hunt for other small vertebrates. It only hunts during the day, by sight, and thus is classified as diurnal. As it lacks cutting teeth, it swallows its prey whole as is usual with snakes.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/KINGCOBRA.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>King Cobra</strong>, Ophiophagus hannah</span><br><br>The King Cobra is one of the few snakes that builds a nest and lays eggs and sits there until just before they hatch. The female makes its nest by taking dead bamboo leaves on the ground and scooping them up with her large body. Though many people say that there is nothing more aggressive than a mother King Cobra protecting her nest, it is an old wives' tale, and with a little coaxing it will leave the nest site. It lays somewhere between 20 and 40 eggs in the spring, two months after mating; the eggs hatch within 60 to 80 days. The hatchlings are between 45 and 50 centimetres long, and marked with black and white banding, and have lethal venom already. Since King Cobras are natural snake eaters, instinct causes the mother King Cobra to leave the young before they hatch, so as to prevent her from eating them, mainly because the adult has not eaten for two months. The King Cobra male is similarly unique in that it guards the nest until the young hatch, patrolling a large area around the nest for threats.<br><br>Though it is called a cobra, it is in a different genus. The scientific name <span style="font-style: italic;">Ophiophagus</span> is derived from the Greek for "snake-eater". Though King Cobras are widely spread throughout India and southern Asia, there are no known subspecies;<br><br>The King Cobra has one of the longest lifespans among snakes (20 years). It is noted for its outstanding intelligence compared to that of other cobra species and other snakes in general. They also have excellent vision making it an expert hunter.<br><br>Drop for drop the King Cobra's venom is less lethal than many snakes including black mamba and common cobra, but the volume (7 ml) per bite is so overwhelming it can kill even an elephant or 20-30 humans. Currently anti-venom for its bite is not available readily. Its venom is a neurotoxin. It can stand in an upright threatening posture with its hood as high as 6 feet and even move in an upright stance; it can stare a human in the eye.<br><br>Adult King Cobras have no natural predators, though mongooses are known to attack young ones and steal eggs.
