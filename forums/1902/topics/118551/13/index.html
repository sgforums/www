It is the smallest and most abundant of the Pacific salmon.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Pink_salmon.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Pink Salmon</strong>, Oncorhyncus gorbuscha</span><br><br>Pink salmon are bright silver fish when they live in the ocean, and their coloring changes to pale grey on the back with yellowish white belly when spawning. They have two dorsal fins including one adipose fin, dark colouration of the mouth and gums, large oval shaped black spots on the tail and back and 13-17 rays in their anal fins. The males develop a large humpback during spawning, hence their nickname "humpies". Pink salmon are the smallest of the Pacific salmon with an average weight of five to six pounds and length of 30 inches.<br><br>Pink salmon have a two year life cycle. Adult pink salmon enter spawning streams, usually returning to the water course, or race, where they originated. Spawning occurs between late June and mid-October. The pink salmon prefer sloughs and slow moving water for spawning, and may spawn in the intertidal zone or at the mouth of streams. The female fish lays her eggs in gravel, she digs a trough or nest, called a redd, in the gravel with her tail, and once she has laid her eggs, and they have been fertilized by the male's milt, covers them. The female lays between 1,500 to 2,000 eggs, and guards the nest until death, both males and females both die approximately two weeks after spawning. The eggs hatch from December to February depending on the water temperature and the young emerge from the gravel during April and May and quickly migrate downstream as fry. They return to freshwater in the autumn of the following year as two year old adults. Pink and chum salmon can interbreed to form hybrid salmon.<br><br>Adult pink salmon are cold-water fish with a preferred temperature range of 5.6 to 14.6 Â°C, an optimal temperature of 10.1 Â°C, and an upper lethal temperature of 25.8 Â°C. The pink salmon is native to Pacific and arctic coastal waters from Sacramento River in northern California to the Mackenzie River, Canada, and to the west from the Lena River in Siberia to Korea. Populations in Asia occur as far south as Hondo Island in Japan. Pink salmon were introduced into the Great Lakes, this is the only location where the pink salmon has successfully been introduced to an entirely fresh water environment.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Pink_salmon_runs.PNG"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Distrubution and abundance of pink salmon in the United States</span><br><br>For commercial fisheries the pink salmon is the least preferred of the pacific salmon, due to its small size and pale flesh. Pink salmon is grown in fish farms by aquaculturists in Canada, Australia and Chile. The flesh is often canned, smoked or salted. Pink salmon roe is also produced commercially.<br><br>Beginning in the late nineteenth century, fish traps were used to supply fish for commercial canning and salting. The industry expanded steadily until 1920. During the 1940s and 1950s, Pink Salmon populations declined drastically. Fish traps were prohibited in Alaska in 1959. Now most pink salmon are taken with purse seines and drift or set gillnets. Some increase in population is evident.<br><br>Salmon Pink is a color that is derived the flesh of the pink salmon.<br><br>Issue #282</div>

Unlike earlier pterosaurs such as Rhamphorhynchus and Pterodactylus, Pteranodon had a toothless beak, like a bird. A fossil preserving fish in the throat region of Pteranodon indicates that the animal was a fish eater. The enormous length of the wings meant that they could not be beat rapidly and so Pteranodon probably spent much of its time gliding. Despite its incredible wingspan, it may have weighed little more than 15 kg, enabling it to glide slowly. With a low sinking speed, Pteranodon may have been able to soar on marine thermals, like living frigate birds.

Much of what is known of their origins and early history comes from <span style="font-style: italic;">Chasse et Peche</span> (French for "Hunting and Fishing"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) magazine, articles of which were translated into English and published by the English magazine <span style="font-style: italic;">The Stockkeeper</span>.<br><br>The breed name of "Schipperke", officially taken in 1888, is traditionally thought to mean "little captain". Beginning in the 1920s, however, it became popular in Belgium to believe that the name was actually a corruption of the Flemish word "Shapocke" or "Scheperke", meaning "little shepherd". It has been suggested that the idea of "little captain" was an invention of the English, who mistook the Schipperke for a Dutch barge dog.<br><br>Before the name "Schipperke" was officially taken, the breed was also known colloquially as "Spitzke". It is thought that the name change was to distinguish it from the German Spitz.<br><br><strong>Temperament</strong><br><br>A Schipperke is an all-around dog: it has strong herding, hunting, and watching instincts. They are fearless and independent, smart and willful. They are a high-energy dog with an intense curiosity about everything and therefore require a great deal of attention and stimulation. Consistent, positive training is a must or life can become a contest of wills. Schipperkes, like many small breeds, seem not to realize that they are small dogs and behave as if they are much larger than they actually are. Some like to bark at big dogs, while some simply don't care! They also often act as though they are high in authority in whatever society they live. They also have the nickname little nurse and can be quiet bedside companions to a sick family member.<br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>They are longer-lived than some breeds. A Schipperke generally lives from fifteen to twenty years, while most dogs live only around a dozen years.<br><br><strong>Appearance</strong><br><br>Schipperkes are usually large in the middle and have little pointed faces with little pointy ears.

Formerly it extended westward into central Germany and into Finland in the north, but it is now extinct in those countries.

The result of the introduction of the American Mink into the wild in Europe has been disastrous for the European Mink, who occupies almost the same ecological niche but is outcompeted by the larger and better-swimming American species. Attempts are now underway to introduce the European Mink to islands too far from the continent for American Mink to swim to, in an attempt to prevent the species from becoming extinct.<br><br>It is sometimes possible to distinguish one species from the other based on the fact that the American Mink usually lacks a large white patch on its upper lip, while the European Mink always possesses one. Any mink without such a patch can be identified with certainty as an American Mink, but an individual with such a patch, if encountered in continental Europe, cannot be certainly identified without looking at the skeleton. The European Mink always and the American Mink usually has a white spot on the lower lip, which continues in broken or unbroken fashion to form ventral markings. Since each is a different shape, it is possible to recognize individuals based on these ventral patterns. Fur also grows white over a scar and older mink tend to have more such patches, although absolute age is difficult to quantify without studying the animal from birth. In fur farms, mink are generally slaughtered after eight months, but can live several years in the wild (although mortality is high, especially among dispersing juveniles).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Nerz-drawing.jpg/800px-Nerz-drawing.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Nerz-drawing.jpg/200px-Nerz-drawing.jpg"></a><br><br>Female European Mink are roughly 1.3 lb (600 g) and males roughly 2 lb (900 g); female American Mink are roughly 2 lb (900 g) and male American Mink roughly 3.5 lb (1,600 g), although weight can vary considerably.

Leopard geckos are considered one of the easiest lizards to breed. In captivity, a number of distinct color morphs have been created possessing many varied colors and patterns. Some of these include: High yellow, orange, striped, patternless (no spots or stripes), lavender, "blizzard lizard" (which are solid white), and amelanistic (no black pigments in markings).<br><br>Leopard geckos, along with a few other old world geckos are one of only a few gecko species that have eyelids. This helps the gecko keep its eyes clean and particle-free in its dusty environment. Most geckos clean and moisten their eyes with their tongues. Another interesting difference in leopard geckos from most other gecko species is the absence of adhesive toe pads. Instead, they have small claws. Leopard geckos cannot climb walls or glass, although their claws give extra traction on the ground, the same applies for the same group of old world geckos having eyelids. Like all geckos, they shed their tail if chased or grabbed, though they will eventually grow a new one. However, the new tail will look nothing like the old one, having a monotone color and bulbous shape.<br><br>In its natural environment, the leopard gecko lives under rocks or in small caves to avoid temperature extremes. Like many desert dwelling species it is most active at night, hunting insects, scorpions, spiders, and small rodents as its prey.<br><br>Leopard geckos are only slightly sexually dimorphic, with the males being somewhat more heavy-bodied than females. Males possess a V-shaped row of enlarged pre-anal pores and a pair of hemipenal swellings at the base of the tail. Females have pre-anal pits and lack paired swelling at the base of the tail. Gender is differentiated during egg incubation and is dependent on the incubation temperature, but gender characteristics are not visible in young geckos.<br><br><strong>Leopard geckos as pets</strong><br><br>Leopard Geckos are widely considered to be a very good pet for a beginning herpetologist for several reasons: their small size, ease of care, cleanliness (they defecate in one corner of their enclosure), long life span (20+ years), and wide color range. They can usually be handled well by older children with the close supervision of an adult, as their tails can fall off if stressed or frightened. Feeding a gecko bottled gecko food is not enough; live food such as crickets and mealworms should be offered as they will promote exercise and offer better nutrition. Supplements are also necessary for captive animals. Force feeding should only be done in the most extreme situations and even then only by an expert, as this can result in injuries and/or stress, which may cause a gecko to bite and scratch.<br><br>Issue #288</div>

Oscars originate from the rivers in the area from Venezuela and along the east coast of South America, down to Paraguay. The fish come in a wide variety of colors and patterns such as Tiger, Black, Albino, Zebra, Red and Fire Red. Oscars typically reach a maximum size of 12-13 inches. Due to their size, they are often paired by aquarists with other of the larger New World cichlids. The Oscar is one of the most popular large home aquarium cichlids.<br><br><img src="http://img487.imageshack.us/img487/3406/tnasoceu55qo.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Oscar</strong>, Astronotus ocellatus</span><br><br>Oscars have a large body, and a slow, majestic appearance but they can be quite devastating to their surroundings as they tend to uproot plants and move other objects in the tank. They are very territorial and aggressive fish that will eat anything small enough to fit in their mouths and can quite easily be trained to eat from their owners' hands. Oscars will frequently fight vigorously with other Oscars which leads to much chasing and splashing, although they typically do not hurt each other. The usual recommendation with Oscars is to pair them only with larger fish because they have been known to eat smaller fish that are introduced into their territory. An intelligent fish, if the Oscar is raised with a set of fish it will tend to leave them alone, but will attack newly introduced fish even if they are of a similar size and species as ones already there.<br><br>Issue #290</div>

Current best estimates put its maximum size at 14 meters (46 feet), based on analysis of smaller and immature specimens.<br><br><img src="http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/6456/squid6ey.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A young <strong>Colossal squid</strong>, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, caught in the Ross Sea in 2003.</span><br><br><strong>Biology</strong><br><br>Unlike the various giant squid species whose tentacles are equipped with suckers lined with small teeth, the tentacles of the Colossal Squid are tipped with a fierce mixture of suckers and swiveling hooks. Its body is wider and stouter, and therefore heavier, than that of the giant squid. Giant squids are believed to have longer tentacles, but a shorter mantle than a Colossal Squid.<br><br>The squid's known range extends thousands of miles northward from Antarctica to southern South America, southern South Africa, and the southern tip of New Zealand, making it primarily an inhabitant of the entire circumantarctic Southern Ocean.<br><br>While little is known about the life of this creature, it is believed to hunt prey such as chaetognatha and squid in the deep ocean using bioluminescence. Based on capture depths of a few specimens, as well as beaks found in sperm whale stomachs, the adult squid ranges at least to a depth of 2,200 m, while juveniles can go as deep as 1,000 m.<br><br>The squid's method of reproduction has not been observed, although some data on their reproduction can be inferred from anatomy. Since males lack an organ called a hectocotylus (a tentacle used in other cephalopods to transfer a spermatophore to the female), they probably use a penis instead, which would be used to directly implant sperm into females.<br><br>Many Sperm whales carry scars on their backs believed to be caused by the hooks of Colossal Squid. Colossal Squid are a major prey item for Antarctic sperm whales feeding in the Southern Ocean; 14% of the squid beaks found in the stomachs of these sperm whales are those of the Colossal Squid, which indicates that Colossal Squid make up 77% of the biomass consumed by these whales. Many other animals also feed on this squid, including the beaked whales (such as the bottlenose whales), Pilot Whale, Southern Elephant Seal, Patagonian toothfish, Pacific sleeper shark, and albatross (e.g., the Wandering albatross). However, beaks from mature adults have only been recovered from those animals large enough to take such prey (i.e., the sperm whale and Pacific sleeper shark), while the remaining predators are limited to eating juveniles and/or young adults.<br><br><strong>Timeline</strong><br><br>This species was first discovered in 1925, in the form of two tentacles found in the stomach of a sperm whale. In 2003, a complete specimen was found near the surface of the Ross Sea with a total length of 6 m (20 feet) and a mantle length of 2.5 m (8 feet).<br><br>Issue #291</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Munchkin</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Munchkin</strong> cat is a relatively new breed created by a random mutation that produced a cat with extremely short legs. Munchkins have short or long coats in a wide variety of colours. Somewhat surprisingly, because of their short stature munchkins are particularly adept at climbing and jumping. They are usually raised as indoor cats, although they are reported to be extremely active, agile and fast runners. Those who have spent time around barns have proven to be extremely good hunters. The mutation only affects the length of the legs.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8b/MunchkinCat.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/MunchkinCat.jpg/300px-MunchkinCat.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Munchkin</strong></span><br><br>The breed was begun in 1983 when Sandra Hochenedel found an extremely short-legged black cat living under a trailer in Louisiana. The cat, Blackberry, was pregnant and half of her kittens were born short-legged. One of Blackberry's kittens, a tomcat named Tolouse, became the father of a breeding program and helped establish the breed in North America.<br><br>The Munchkin breed is not recognised by all registering associations and is specifically banned by the FÃ©dÃ©ration International FÃ©line FIFe and other European registries, but it is accepted by The International Cat Association (TICA). Because the munchkin gene is a dominant one, approximately half the kittens with a munchkin parent will be 'standard' munchkins. The remainder have normal length legs, but since it is a dominant gene these long/traditional legged cats cannot pass on the trait of short legs. Nor would this trait be passed on if the long legged kittens were crossed to another breed. At one time it was theorized that this short legged trait was due to the same gene that causes achondroplasia achondroplastic in humans, however all attempts to prove this to date, have failed. Neither is it the same gene nor has a specific locus on another gene been found and identified as of this writing. True "dwarfism" affects more than the long bones of the legs. The munchkin cat is shorter than a standard domestic, but in all other respects it is identical, genetically and in size and overall appearance.<br><br>Issue #293</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Giant pangolin</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Giant pangolin</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Manis gigantea</span>) is a pangolin species. Members of the species inhabit Africa with a range streching along the Equator from west Africa to Uganda. The giant pangolin is the largest species of pangolin, or "scaly anteaters"Â–the large, scaled mammals belonging to the Manidae family. They subsist almost entirely on ants and termites. The species was first described by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1815.<br><br><img src="http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/4003/medium6vs.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Giant pangolin</strong>, Manis gigantea</span><br><br><strong>Habitat, range, and endangered status</strong><br><br>The giant pangolin inhabits many countries with the largest concentration in Uganda, Tanzania, and western Kenya. It is found mainly in the savanna, rainforest, and forest, inhabiting areas with large termite populations and available water. Giant pangolins do not inhabit high-altitude areas.<br><br>Due to habitat destruction and deforestation, the species's numbers have greatly declined, and this together with the hunting of giant pangolins as bushmeat has led to concerns about population levels. Because the species is nocturnal, few studies have been carried out. Currently the pangolin is classified as an endangered species.<br><br><strong>Physical description</strong><br><br>The average mass of the species is unknown, but one giant pangolin was found to weigh 33 kg. Males are larger than females, with male body length about 140 cm and female about 125 cm. It is the largest of all pangolins, taking the name "giant pangolin" because of this. The scales are usually colored brown or reddish-brown. Like all pangolins, the species has large, armored scales and no hair except in the eyelashs. Giant pangolin have long snouts, a long and thick tail, and large front claws.<br><br>The animal has a strong sense of smell and large anal glands. Its secretions may be significant to animal communication. The species walks with most of its weight is on its columnar rear legs and curl their front paws, walking on the outside of the wrists rather than the palms to protect the claws. By using its tail for balance, giant pangolins can even walk upright as a biped.<br><br>Giant pangolins are endothermic and bilateral symmetric.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br><br>Giant pangolins, like other pangolin, are motile and nocturnal, which makes observation difficult. They are also usually solitary, although in one case an adult giant pangolin was seen in a burrow with a juvenile. The species is capable of climbing trees and other objects.<br><br><strong>Diet</strong><br><br>Like all pangolins, the giant pangolin is a specialized insectivore that lacks teeth and the ability to chew. Its diet mainly consists of ants and termites, which the species finds by tearing open anthills and termite nests, both subterranean and mound-type.<br><br>Because of its relatively large size, the giant pangolin is particularly well-suited to breaking open termite mounds, done by leaning on the mound and resting its weight on its tail, and then ripping into the mound with its front claws. The combination of weight and physical damage quickly lead to partial collapse of the mound, exposing the termites. It eats the insects by picking them up with its sticky tongue (up to 16 inches in length).<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>Very little information about the reproduction of giant pangolins is known. Two birth records exist, with one litter was found in September and another in October, with the young weighing around 500 g. As in all pangolins, infants have soft scales that eventually open and are born with open eyes. They cannot walk on their legs, but can move on the stomach.<br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #294</div>

It is advisable not to give a steady diet of earthworms/nightcrawlers as these lack sufficient vitamins for the snake's health.

This is true of all snake species, including water snakes.<br><br><strong>Life history</strong><br><br>The Common Garter Snake is a diurnal snake. In summer, it is most active in the morning and late afternoon; in cooler seasons or climates, it restricts its activity to the warm afternoons.<br><br>In southern, warm areas, the Common Garter Snake is active year-round; otherwise, it hibernates in common dens, sometimes in great numbers.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Common Earthworm</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Common Earthworm</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Lumbricus terrestris</span>) is a large reddish worm native to Europe. Through much of Europe it is the largest naturally occurring species of earthworm, typically reaching 20-25 cm long when extended (though in parts of southern Europe there are native species which are much larger). It has an unusual habit of copulating on the surface at night, which makes it more visible than most other earthworms. It is now also widely distributed elsewhere around the world, along with several other lumbricids, due to human introductions. In some areas where it has been introduced, it is a serious pest species, out-competing locally native worms.<br><br><img src="http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/2071/lumbric27gc.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Common Earthworm</strong>, Lumbricus terrestris</span><br><br><strong>Common names</strong><br><br>Being widely distributed, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lumbricus terrestris</span> goes under a variety of common names. In the British Isles it is primarily called the Common Earthworm. In North America and New Zealand the term Nightcrawler (or Night Crawler) is more common. In Canada, it is also called the Dew Worm, and in Britain Lob Worm (though that, as lobworm is also applied to a marine polychaete). In the rest of the world most references are just to the scientific name, though with occasional reference to the above names.<br><br>Although not the numerically most abundant earthworm even in its native range, it gets called the Common Earthworm (or even just "the Earthworm"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) as it is a very conspicuous and familiar earthworm species in garden and agricultural soils of the temperate zone, and frequently being seen on the surface, unlike most other earthworms. It is also used as the example earthworm for millions of biology students around the world, even in areas where the species does not exist. However this name can be a source of confusion, since in most of the world other species are more typical. For example, through much of the unirrigated temperate areas of the world, the "common earthworm" is actually <span style="font-style: italic;">Aporrectodea</span> (=<span style="font-style: italic;">Allolobophora</span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">trapezoides</span> which in those areas is a similar size and dark color to <span style="font-style: italic;">Lumbricus terrestris</span>.<br><br><strong>Biology</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lumbricus terrestris</span> is an anecic worm, that is, it forms permanent deep burrows and comes to the surface to feed, as opposed to burrowing through the soil for its food as most other earthworms do. An unusual habit of this species is to pull leaves into the mouth of its burrow where they partially decay before being eaten. While they generally feed on plant material, they have been observed feeding on squashed insects and feces.<br><br>The potential life span of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lumbricus terrestris</span> is unknown, though it has been kept in the laboratory for 6 years. Official estimates of 4 to 8 years for a general life span are probably reasonable.<br><br>In parts of Europe, notably the Atlantic fringe of northwestern Europe, it is now locally endangered due to predation by the New Zealand Flatworm (<span style="font-style: italic;">Arthurdendyus triangulatus</span>) and the Australian Flatworm (<span style="font-style: italic;">Australoplana sanguinea</span>), two predatory flatworms accidentally introduced from New Zealand and Australia. These predators are very efficient earthworm eaters, being able to survive for lengthy periods with no food, so therefore still persisting even when their prey has dropped to unsustainably low populations. In some areas, this is having a serious adverse effect on soil structure and quality, as the soil aeration and organic material mixing previously done by the earthworms ceases.<br><br>Issue #299</div>

The first Ammosaurus skeleton was found in the late 1880s by a group of construction workers in the Connecticut Valley in the US, who were building a bridge at the time. The valley was once a swamp, on which Amosaurus would often search for food along its banks. Other fragmental skeletons have been found in Arizona and Nova Scotia.<br><br><img src="http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/3499/ammo4xc.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Ammosaurus</strong>, Ammosaurus solus</span><br><br>When Othniel C. Marsh first identified Ammosaurus's remains, he confused them with those of another dinosaur, Anchisaurus. It was not until 1891 that he renamed the fossils as that of Ammosaurus. Ironically, some of the Anchisaurus remains were thought to be remains of prehistoric humans. Although no Ammosaurus skull has ever been found, enough fossil was found to determine that it was more closely related to Plateosaurus than Anchisaurus as previously thought.<br><br>Ammosaurus lived during the early Jurassic period, around 180 million years ago. It was a herbivore and could walk on both four or two feet, the latter undoubtably allowing it to reach higher branches. It had large claws on its hands to allow it to strip bark from trees and saplings. Compared to the rest of its body, Ammosaurus had both a long tail &amp; neck, suggesting that it would have walked on four legs for most of its life, only walking on two to defend itself or reach food. To defend itself, it would stand on its hind legs, slashing at its attacker with its large thumb claws on its fore legs.<br><br>Ammosaurus measured over 4.3 m (14 ft) long and stood about 1.8 m (6 ft) tall, although it would only be knee high if it was on all fours. Ammosaurus weighed around 290 kg (639 lbs), mainly due to its large body. At its largest, it would grow to the size of a small car.<br><br>Conservation status: Fossil<br><br>Issue #300</div>

They represent a small (Pequeno), medium (Medio) and large (Grande) type of dog, each with two hair coats (smooth and wirehaired).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Evflag.jpg/629px-Evflag.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f8/Evflag.jpg/250px-Evflag.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Wirehaired <strong>Portuguese Podengo</strong> Medio</span><br><br>The rarest of all, the Grande, was most likely developed from larger Medios and the Pequeno was most likely developed, with the addition of other small breeds, also from the Medio. Of the three, the Pequeno displays more color variety because of this probable outcrossing.<br><br>Each has a different type of temperament but all three love to hunt, as is their heritage and tradition in their native country. Typically, the dogs hunt in a pack with their human companion following them. Each is capable of hunting game that is appropriate to their size (Pequeno-rats, Medio-rabbits, Grande-boars).<br><br>They are very old type of dog, probably descended from ancient northern African sighthound-type dogs. As a breed, it is believed to be about 5,000 years old. They are all typically healthy, due to careful breeding practices in a rustic setting (in Portugal) where unhealthy whelps would not usually survive, thus removing them from possible breeding stock.<br><br>The WH PPM is a medium-sized, friendly, hardy and intelligent companion. It has a soft wire coat that functions as an air conditioner in the hot weather. The single coat (without undercoat) does shed. It is very active and is good with children and other animals, including livestock, if it is socialized from an early age.<br><br>The WH PPM (and S PPM) has existed in America for decades in small numbers with Portuguese-Americans in private home settings where they have been used for traditional rabbit hunting. Amazingly, they were never popularized outside of their immigrant homesteads. If dog-loving Americans had seen them there is no doubt that this breed would have become known sooner, as they are attractive, nice family dogs, with a touch of mischief.<br><br>They are watchful and observant and will bark when something gets their attention. They enjoy digging and need a secure fence. It is best if they have their own yard they can 'customize' themselves. When trained, they can have a good recall when not on leash. They are a very enthusiastic, trainable dog with a knowledgable trainer, as evidenced by their popularity in movies, where they are usually cast as a "scruffy mutt." This publicity has enabled the WH PPM to obtain a small but loyal fan base in America, who have turned into the first exhibitors (and will be the first breeders) of the breed.<br><br>The WH PPM have only recently been shown and developed as a registered (RVB-Netherlands, CPC-Portugal and AKC-Foundation Stock Service), pedigreed breed in the US and Canada.<br><br>The WH PPM is very young as a breed in America. There are about 11 breeders worldwide with registered, pedigreed stock. The available bloodlines of WH PPMs are extremely limited compared to other breeds of dogs (the coat types are not interbred) and all WH PPM are very closely related at this time. However, with careful breeding of only the best and healthiest dogs, larger bloodlines can be built confidently and strongly. Other examples of this situation are the Saluki and Basenji, both breeds which, within the past 100 years, descended from a tiny handful of registered dogs. With careful breeding of the best quality dogs, it is now a healthy, strong sighthound breed with much diversity.<br><br>Alternative names: Podengo Portugues, Portuguese Warren Hound<br>Country of origin: Portugal<br><br>Issue #301</div>

Pelage cover is sparsely distributed across the body, which many play a role in reducing the build-up of algae on the skin. The average West Indian Manatee is approximately 3 meters long, and weighs between 200 and 600 kg, with females generally larger than males. The largest individuals can weigh up to 1,500 kg.<br><br><strong>Habitat and Geographic range</strong><br><br>As its name implies, the West Indian Manatee lives in the West Indies, generally in shallow coastal areas. However, it is known to withstand large changes in water salinity, and so have also been found in shallow rivers and estuaries. It is limited to the tropics and sub-tropics due to an extremely low metabolic rate and lack of a thick layer of insulating body fat. During summer, these large mammals have even been found as far north as Rhode Island.<br><br><strong>Behavior and Food</strong><br><br>West Indian Manatees are surprisingly agile in water, and have been seen doing rolls, somersaults, and even swimming upside-down. Manatees are not territorial and do not have complex predator avoidance behavior, as they has evolved in areas without natural predators.<br><br>West Indian Mantees are opportunistic feeders, with large adults feasting on nearly 100 kg of sea grasses and plant leaves daily. Because manatees feed on abrasive plants, their molars are continually replaced throughout life. They are also known to eat invertebrates and fish.<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>Although female West Indian Manatees are mostly solitary creatures, they form mating herds while in estrus. Most females breed successfully between ages of seven and nine, however, females are capable of reproduction as early as four years of age. Gestation period lasts from twelve to fourteen months. Normally, one calf is born, although on rare occasions two have been recorded. The young are born with molars and premolars, allowing them to consume sea grass within the first three weeks of birth.<br><br><strong>Manatee Relationship with Humans</strong><br><br>The West Indian Manatee has been hunted for hundreds of years for meat and hide, and continues to be hunted to this day in Central and South America. Illegal poaching, as well as collisions with speeding motorboats, are a constant source of manatee fatalities.<br><br>Due to their low reproductive rates, a decline in manatee population may be hard to overcome. They enjoy protection from the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, and the U.S. Marine Mammal Act of 1972.<br><br><strong>Trivia</strong><br><br>The Florida Manatee is that state's official marine mammal and is a focus of tourist interest.<br><br>Conservation status: Vulnerable<br><br>Issue #302</div>

It is a popular gamebird, particularly in the US Southern States, forming what are known as "coveys", groups of five to 30 birds, during the non-breeding season (roughly October-April). Quail primarily inhabit areas of early successional growth dominated by various species of pine, hardwood, woody, and herbaceous growth. However, quail habitat varies greatly throughout their range which extends from Mexico east to Florida and north into the Upper Midwest and Northeast.<br><br>Bobwhites are distinguished by a black cap and black stripe behind the eye along the head.

The body is brown, speckled in places with black or white on both sexes, and average weight is five to six ounces (145-200 grams).<br><br>During the breeding season, typically beginning in mid-April, bobwhite coveys dissolve. Social pairs are typically formed between individuals of unknown relationship. These social pairings potentially result in the formation of a mate bond and subsequent female fertilization and egg formation.

Eggs are normally white in color with a more pointed end than normal chicken eggs.<br><br>Both males and females can incubate nests, with most nests predominantly incubated by females. If the first clutch of eggs is unsuccessful, a breeding pair (may be the same pair or a different pair as that which led to the previous nesting attempt) will attempt to lay, incubate, and hatch additional clutches. If the clutch is successful, chicks are precocial and will leave the nest approximately 24 hours following hatching.
