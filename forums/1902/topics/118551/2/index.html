            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Moa</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>moa</strong> were giant flightless birds of New Zealand. Ten species are known, of varying sizes, with the largest species, the Giant Moa (<span style="font-style: italic;">Dinornis robustus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dinornis novaezelandiae</span>), reaching about three metres (ten feet) in height and about 250 kilograms (550 pounds) in mass. They were the dominant herbivores in the forest ecosystem.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/MoaIllustration.gif/315px-MoaIllustration.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/MoaIllustration.gif/150px-MoaIllustration.gif"></a><br><br>Moa became extinct around the year 1500. This is thought to be due to hunting and land clearance after humans arrived in the islands although another school of thought suggests that numbers were declining before the impact of humans. Before the arrival of humans, some moa were hunted by Harpagornis, the world's largest eagle which is also now extinct. The kiwi are regarded as moderately close relatives of the moa.<br><br>Although the indigenous Maori told European settlers tales about the huge birds which they called Moa, which had once roamed the flats and valleys, the widespread physical evidence that they had actually existed was never closely examined by early European settlers.<br><br>In 1839, John W. Harris, a Poverty Bay flax trader who was a natural history enthusiast, was given a piece of unusual bone by a Maori who had found it in a river bank. He showed the 15cm fragment of bone to his uncle, John Rule, a Sydney surgeon, who sent it to Richard Owen who at that time was working at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal Colllege of Surgeons in London. Owen became a noted biologist, anatomist and paleontologist at the British Museum.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Dinornis1387.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Dinornis1387.jpg/150px-Dinornis1387.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sir Richard Owen and Dinornis skeleton from The Book of Knowledge, The Grolier Society, 1911</span><br><br>Owen puzzled over the fragment for almost four years. He established it was part of the femur of a big animal, but it was uncharacteristically light and honeycombed.<br><br>Owen announced to a skeptical scientific community and the world that it was from a giant extinct bird like an ostrich, and named it "Dinornis". His deduction was ridiculed in some quarters but was proved correct with the subsequent discoveries of considerable quantities of moa bones throughout the land, sufficient to construct skeletons of the birds.<br><br>Although dozens of species were described in the late 19th and early 20th century, many were based on partial skeletons and turned out to be synonyms. More recent research, based on DNA recovered from museum collections, suggest that there were only ten species, including two giant moa. The giant moa seems to have had sexual dimorphism, with females being much larger than males; so much bigger that they were formerly classified as separate species.<br><br>In July 2004, the Natural History Museum in London placed on display the moa bone fragment Owen had first examined, to celebrate 200 years since his birth, and in memory of Owen as founder of the museum.<br><br>Though there is no reasonable doubt that the Moa is extinct, there has been occasional speculation that some may still exist in deepest south-westland, a rugged wilderness in the South Island. Cryptozoologists and others reputedly continue to search for them, but none have ever been found, and some might regard such efforts as pseudoscience. In 1993, two people claimed to have seen a bird they suspect was a Moa, but their report was largely dismissed as a hoax.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct (c. 1500)<br><br>Issue #19</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Airedale Terrier</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Airedale Terrier</strong> (often shortened to "Airedale"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) is a large and versatile terrier dog breed originating from the Aire valley in Yorkshire, England. It is often called the "King of Terriers" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds, 50 to 70 pounds (23-32 kg). The Airedale was bred originally to hunt otters. It was also called a "Waterside Terrier" because of this connection to hunting otters.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c5/Rambo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c5/Rambo.jpg/250px-Rambo.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Airedale Terrier</strong></span><br><br><strong>Appearance</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Airedale coat</span><br><br>Like many terriers, it has a 'broken' coat, which requires regular hand stripping to maintain the coat and distinctive square terrier shape. A broken coat is a harsh, wiry topcoat with a soft, fur-like undercoat. Broken-coated breeds do not shed their coats as much as smooth coated breeds, and are therefore less likely to cause allergic reactions in people prone to dog allergies.<br><br>Stripping is the correct process for grooming an Airedale, using a small serrated edged knife to pull out loose hair from the dog's coat. Airedales who aren't being shown are often clipped with electric clippers. This process, while easier on the dog and the groomer, softens the coat and fades the color, and sometimes causes skin allegies for the dog. This is because the loose hair that would normally moult is cut, so the roots remain within the hair follicles.<br><br>The correct coat color is a black saddle, with a rich tan head, ears and legs; or a dark grizzle saddle (black mixed with gray and white). Both are acceptable in the AKC breed standard.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tail</span><br><br>The Airedale's tail is usually docked (surgically shortened) within five days of birth, but this is not a requirement of breed standard authorities. However, to show an Airedale in the United States, the tail is expected to be docked.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Airedale.jpg/800px-Airedale.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Airedale.jpg/180px-Airedale.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This Airedale's tail is natural (undocked).</span><br><br><strong>History of the Airedale</strong><br><br>The Airedale was extensively used in World War One to carry messages to soldiers behind enemy lines and occupying the trenches. They were also used extensively by the Red Cross to find wounded soldiers on the battlefield. Their courage and stalwart character in the face of danger was legendary. In fact, the German designation for an Airedale is "Kriegshund" which means "War dog". Before the adoption of the German Shepherd as the dog of choice for law enforcement and search and rescue work, the Airedale terrier often filled this role.<br><br><strong>Airedale temperament and character</strong><br><br>The Airedale can also be used as a working dog and also as a hunter and retriever. However, he is typically an independent (stubborn), strong-minded dog with a great sense of humour. For those who can laugh along with their Airedale, patience will be rewarded as they have been known to reach great heights in competitive obedience, dog agility, and Schutzhund. He is also a reliable and protective family pet.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/70/RoyceHead.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/RoyceHead.JPG/180px-RoyceHead.JPG"></a><br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>The Airedale is relatively free of inherited diseases except for hip dysplasia in some lines. He usually lives for around twelve years, but has been know to last until the age of seventeen.<br><br>Country of origin: Great Britain (England)<br><br>Issue #20</div>

(Authorities differ about the correct classification.) The two are the only equids that can cross-breed and produce fertile offspring.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/PrzewalskiHorse.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Przewalski's Horse</strong>, Equus przewalskii</span><br><br>As of 2002, the world population of these horses is about 1,000, all descended from approximately 15 captured around 1,900 and bred in zoos. The wild population in Mongolia died out in the 1960s; captive-bred horses were returned to the wild starting in 1992. The area to which they have been reintroduced became Hustai National Park in 1998. Three of these horses now graze in a 12 acre (49,000 mÂ²) paddock in the Clocaenog Forest in North Wales, UK, on the site of a former Neolithic/Iron Age settlement. The Forestry Commission hopes they will help recreate scenes from the Iron Age when these horses first roamed free in the woods.<br><br>Przewalski's Horse is stockily built in comparison to domesticated horses, with shorter legs. Typical length is about 2.1 metres (7 feet) with a 90 cm (3 foot) tail. They weigh around 350 kilograms (770 lb). The coat varies from dark brown around the mane (which stands erect) to pale brown on the flanks and yellowish-white on the belly.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Przewalskipaarden.jpg/800px-Przewalskipaarden.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Przewalskipaarden.jpg/250px-Przewalskipaarden.jpg"></a><br><br>In the wild, Przewalski's Horses live in social groups consisting of a dominant male, several mares, and their offspring. Each group has a well-defined home range; within the range, the herd travels between three and six miles a day, spending time grazing, drinking, using salt licks, dozing, and taking mud baths. At night, the herd clusters and sleeps for about four hours.<br><br>Fillies leave their natal groups around age 2, and look for a herd to join, after which they will begin to breed. Colts are driven out when they are about three years old, and spend a year or two in small bachelor herds, practicing fighting. At around age 5, a stallion will try to pass on his genes by attempting to take over an existing herd, stealing one or more mares from another stallion's harem, or gathering unattached fillies.<br><br>The horse is named after General NikolaÃ¯ MikhaÃ¯lovitch Prjevalski (1839Â–1888<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) who was also an explorer and naturalist.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct in the Wild<br><br>Issue #21</div>

As a defense against predators they secrete a toxic, foul tasting substance (bufagin). This is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes and hedgehogs are immune. Although the adults spend most of their time on land the females enter ponds and other still water to lay their eggs, toadspawn, which can be distinguished from the spawn of the common frog as it forms strings rather than than a large mass of eggs. Eggs are laid in the spring, with the females attempting to return to the water in which they were born.

They had a wingspan of about 3 meters which is short for a bird of that weight but which allowed them to hunt in forests. It preyed on large, flightless birds species including moa up to 15 times its weight. It attacked moa at speeds up to 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph), seizing a moa by the pelvis with the talons of one foot and killing it with a blow to the head or neck with a talon of the other foot. In the absence of other large predators or scavengers, Harpagornis could have fed on a single large kill over a number of days.<br><br>Early human settlers in New Zealand (Maori arrived about 1000 years ago) also preyed heavily on large, flightless birds and hunted some of them, including all the moa species, to extinction. The Harpagornis became extinct along with its prey. It may also have been hunted itself by humans: a large, fast bird of prey that specialized in hunting large bipeds may have been perceived as a threat by Maori.<br><br>In effect, birds occupied all positions in the New Zealand animal ecology. Moa filled a grazing niche occupied elsewhere by deer or cattle, and the harpagornis occupied the same niche as carnivorous hunters such as wolves, leopards or tigers.

Its increase in weight by 10 to 15 times in that period is the greatest and fastest evolutionary increase in weight of any known vertebrate.

They are not thought to be breeding in the UK, as the mean summer temperature is too low. However, there is some possibility that if temperatures rise by a few degrees breeding could start.

The plates are highly modified osteoderms, or bony-cored scales, similar to those seen in crocodiles and many lizards.<br><br>The purpose of the plates is debated. Their large size suggests that they may have been used to increase the apparent height of the animal, to intimidate enemies or impress other members of the species. A recent theory is that they may have helped to control the temperature of the animal, much as elephants and jackrabbits do with their ears. The plates have blood vessels running through grooves in them. Wind flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood flowing through them. The tail appears simply to have acted as a weapon.<br><br>The skull of Stegosaurus was long and narrow, and its head was carried close to the ground, probably no higher than 1 meter (3 feet).<br><br><strong>Relationships</strong><br><br>Stegosaurus was a member of the armored dinosaurs, or Thyreophora. Relatives included the ankylosaurus and the nodosaurus.<br><br><strong>In film</strong><br><br>As one of the most recognizable dinosaurs, the Stegosaurus has seen its share of screen time. In the classic monster film, King Kong (1933), the first creature the band of rescuers meet as they chase the abducted Fay Wray deep into Skull Island is a roaring Stegosaurus, which behaves like an irritable rhinoceros, and charges. It eventually goes down under several fusillades of small arms fire.<br><br><img src="http://dinosauricon.com/images/stegosaurus-po.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A Stegosaurus in the forest</span><br><br>Conservation status: Fossil<br><br>Issue #37</div>
