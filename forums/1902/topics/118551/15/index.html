It lived in China during the Cretaceous period and is related to Compsognathus. It was around 3 feet long, most of which was taken up by its extremely long tail. The remarkably well-preserved fossils show that Sinosauropteryx was covered with a furry down of very simple feathers. These feathers consisted of a simple two-branched structure, similar to the secondarily primitive feahters of the modern kiwi.<br><br><img src="http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1002/sinosauropteryxprima22yn.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Sinosauropteryx prima</strong></span><br><br>Sinosauropteryx is important because it had feather-like structures, yet was not very closely related to true birds. There are many dinosaur families that were more closely related to birds than Sinosauropteryx, including the deinonychosaurs, the oviraptosaurs and therizinosaurs. This indicates that feathers may have been a characteristic of many theropod dinosaurs, not just the obviously bird-like ones, making it quite possible that equally distant animals such as Ornitholestes, Coelurus and even Tyrannosaurus rex may have had feathers.<br><br>Conservation status: Fossil<br><br>Issue #332</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Norfolk Terrier</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Norfolk Terrier</strong> is a small breed of dog, one of many terrier breeds. Prior to 1960, when it gained recognition as an independent breed, it was a variety of the Norwich Terrier, distinguished from the Norwich by its "drop", or folded ears.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Norfolk_show.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Norfolk Terrier</strong></span><br><br><strong>Appearance</strong><br><br>The Norfolk Terrier has a wire-haired coat which, according to the various national kennel club breed standards, can be "all shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle."<br><br>They are the smallest of the working Terriers. They should feel heavier in weight than they appear to be. They are self confident and carry their heads with presence and importance and the tails should also be held erect.<br><br>They are active and compact, free moving, with good substance and bone. Good substance means good spring of rib and bone that matches the body such that the dog can be a very agile ratter, the function for which it was bred. Norfolks are moderately proportioned dogs. A too-heavy dog would not be agile. A too-refined dog would make it a toy breed. Norfolks generally have more reach and drive and a stronger rear angulation, hence cover more ground than their Norwich cousins. Norfolk have good side gait owed to their balanced angulation front and rear, not their perceived slightly longer length of back as is often cited.<br><br>The ideal height is 10 to 12 inches (25-30 cm) at the withers and weight is about 12 pounds (5 Kg). They are the smallest of the terriers.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grooming</span><br><br>These breeds have two coats - a harsh, wiry topcoat and a soft warm undercoat. All that is really necessary for grooming a companion dog is a good combing and brushing once a week to remove the loose, dead hairs and prevent matting. The coats should be hand stripped once in the Fall and once in the Spring. Clipping or cutting ruins the coat's colours and texture. You can wash this coat with a dog shampoo any time it is desirable.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Norfolkterriersideview.jpg/704px-Norfolkterriersideview.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Norfolkterriersideview.jpg/250px-Norfolkterriersideview.jpg"></a><br><br><strong>Temperament</strong><br><br>Norfolk Terriers are described as fearless but should not be aggressive despite being capable of defending themselves if need be. The AKC standard describes the Norfolk as Â“alert, gregarious, and loyalÂ”. They are dogs that work in packs and must get along with other dogs. They love people and children and can make good companions.<br><br>A Norfolk that is shy, or carries its tail between its legs is untypical as is a dog that is hot tempered and aggressive with other dogs; these are not the standard. Norfolk Terrier's typical breed temperament is happy, spirited and self confident.<br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>There are incidences of health issues that responsible breeders consider worthy to do preventative testing. Norfolks have incidences of mitral valve disease, luxating patellas, hip dysplasia and bad bites (where the teeth do not align with the breed standard, ie. overshot or undershot)<br><br><strong>Exercise</strong><br><br>A good daily walk takes care of the exercise requirements of the Norfolk Terrier. They are good walking companions and reasonable joggers.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>In the 1880s, British sportsmen developed a working terrier of East Anglia, England. The Norwich Terrier and later the drop-eared variety now know as the Norfolk Terrier, were believed to have been developed by crossing Yorkshire Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and small, short-legged Irish Terrier breeds.<br><br>They were first called the Cantab Terrier when they became fashionable for students to keep in their dormitory at Cambridge University in England. Later, they were called the Thrumpington Terrier, after a street in the area where the breed was first developed. Then, just prior to WWI, a Norwich huntsman helped introduce the short-legged terriers to the USA, calling them the Jones Terrier.<br><br>In 1932, the Norwich was granted acceptance into the English Kennel Club and the first written standard was created. The American Kennel Club registered the first Norwich Terrier in 1936. In 1964, The Kennel Club reclassified the drop-ear variety as it its own breed, the Norfolk Terrier, and the prick-eared variety retained the name Norwich Terrier. The American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club both recognized the division of the Norwich Terrier breed in 1979. After many generations, these two breeds have developed as two distinct breeds both in physical looks and in temperament. Of note, there is literature that suggests that the Norfolk and Norwich were always two distinct breeds and the original mistake was classifying them as one.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Working style</span><br><br>They are tireless workers in the field. These versatile, agreeable dogs can go to ground and bolt a fox and tackle or dispatch other small vermin, working alone or in a pack. Their courage is so that Â“honourable scars from wear and tearÂ” should not be counted against them in the show ring.<br><br>Country of origin: Great Britain<br><br>Issue #333</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rocky Mountain goat</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Rocky Mountain goat</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Oreamnos americanus</span>), often called simply <span style="font-style: italic;">mountain goat</span>, is a large hoofed mammal found only in North America. Although it resembles a goat, it is actually more closely related to the antelope family. It resides at high elevations and is a sure-footed climber, often resting on rocky cliffs that predators cannot reach.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Mountain-Goat.jpeg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Rocky Mountain goat</strong>, Oreamnos americanus</span><br><br><strong>Classification</strong><br><br>Mountain goats are even-toed ungulates of the order Artiodactyla and its subdivision, the Bovidae family. They belong to the subfamily Caprinae, along with thirty-two other species, and are the only species in the genus Oreamnos. The name Oreamnos is derived from the Greek term "ore," mountain (or, alternatively, "oreas," mountain nymph) and the word "amnos," lamb.<br><br><strong>General Appearance and Characteristics</strong><br><br>Both male and female mountain goats have beards, short tails, and long black horns, 15-28 cm in length, which contain yearly growth rings. They are protected from the elements by their woolly white double coats. The fine, dense wool of their undercoats is covered by an outer layer of longer, hollow hairs. In warmer seasons, mountain goats molt by rubbing against rocks and trees, with the adult billies (males) shedding their extra wool first and the pregnant nannies (females) shedding last. In the winter, their coats help them to withstand temperatures as low as -50 Fahrenheit (-46 Celsius) and winds of up to 100 mph (161 km/h).<br><br>A billy stands about 1 meter (3'3"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) at the shoulder and weighs about 90 kg (200 lbs.). It has longer horns and a longer beard than the nanny. Adult males typically weigh between 45 and 100 kg, while females are usually 10-30% lighter.<br><br>The mountain goat's feet are well-suited for climbing steep, rocky slopes, sometimes with pitches of 60 degrees or more, with inner pads that provide traction and cloven hooves that can spread apart as needed. Dewclaws on the back of their feet also help to keep them from slipping.<br><br><strong>Range and Habitat</strong><br><br>The mountain goat inhabits the Rocky Mountains and Coast Mountain regions of North America, from northern Washington, Idaho and Montana through British Columbia and Alberta, into the southern Yukon and southwestern Alaska. Its northernmost range is said to be along the northern fringe of the Chugach Mountains in southcentral Alaska. Transplanted populations can also be found in such areas as Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Colorado, South Dakota, and the Olympic Peninsula of Washington.<br><br>Mountain goats are the largest mammals found in their high-altitude habitats, which reach elevations of 3,000 metres or more. Although they sometimes descend to coastal areas, they are primarily an alpine and subalpine species. Throughout the year, the animals usually stay above the timberline, but they will migrate seasonally to higher or lower elevations within that range.<br><br><strong>Life Cycle and Breeding</strong><br><br>In the wild, mountain goats usually live twelve to fifteen years, with their lifespan limited by the wearing down of their teeth. In zoos, however, they can live for sixteen to twenty years.<br><br>Kids are born in the spring (late May or early June) after a six month gestation period. Nannies give birth, usually to a single offspring, after moving to an isolated ledge; post-partum, they lick the baby dry and ingest the placenta. Kids weigh a little over 3 kg (about 7 lb) at birth and begin to run and climb (or attempt to do so) within hours. Although they are mostly weaned within one month, kids follow their mothers closely for the first year of life (or until the nanny gives birth again, if this does not occur the next breeding season); nannies protect their young by leading them out of danger, standing over them when faced by predators, and positioning themselves below their kids on steep slopes to stop freefalls.<br><br>Mountain goats reach sexual maturity at about thirty months. Nannies in a herd undergo synchronized estrus in late October through early December, at which time males and females participate in a mating ritual. Mature billies will stare at nannies for long periods, dig rutting pits, and fight each other in showy (though occasionally dangerous) scuffles. Young billies sometimes try to participate, but they are ignored by nannies; nannies will also sometimes pursue inattentive billies. Both males and females usually mate with multiple individuals during breeding season, although some billies try to keep other males away from certain nannies. After the breeding season is over, males and females move away from each other, with the adult billies breaking up into small bands of two or three individuals. Nannies form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals.<br><br><strong>Aggressive Behavior</strong><br><br>Females can be very competitive and protective of their space and food sources. They will fight with one another for dominance in conflicts that can ultimately include all the females in the herd. In these battles, nannies will circle each other with their heads lowered, showing off their horns. As with fights between billies during breeding season, these conflicts can occasionally lead to injury or even death, but they are largely harmless. To avoid fighting, an animal may show a posture of non-aggression by stretching low to the ground.<br><br>In lower regions below the timberline, nannies also use their fighting abilities to protect themselves and their offspring from predators, such as wolves, wolverines, cougars, lynx, and bears. Even though their size protects them from most potential predators in higher altitudes, females still must defend their young from golden eagles, which can be a threat to very young kids. Nannies have even been observed trying to dominate the more passive bighorn sheep that share some of their territory.<br><br><strong>Diet</strong><br><br>Although they have gained notoriety for their shows of aggression, mountain goats spend most of their time quietly grazing. Their diet includes grasses, herbs, sedges, ferns, moss, lichen, twigs, and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and conifers of their high-altitude habitat.<br><br>In captivity, the mountain goat's diet can also include grain, alfalfa, fruits and vegetables.<br><br>Issue #334</div>

While some Mojave Rattlesnakes (Venom B populations) exhibit hemotoxic venom, there are others (Venom A populations) that possess Mojave Toxin, a potent neurotoxin, and still others that demonstrate both hemotoxic and neurotoxic venom.

Based on the distribution of northern Pacific sea star populations in shipping ports and routes, the most likely mechanism of introduction is the transport of free-swimming larvae in ballast water for ships. The ships suck in the ballast water containing sea star larvae, in a port such as one in Japan, and let it out in a port such as one in Tasmania, the larvae come out with the water, and metamophasize into juvenile sea stars.<br><br><img src="http://img76.imageshack.us/img76/593/staraster6cw.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Northern Pacific sea star</strong>, Asterias amurensis</span><br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>In Australia spawning occurs from July to October at temperatures of 10Â°-12Â° C. Fertilised eggs develop into free-swimming larvae that live in the water for around 90 days, before settling and metamorphosizing into juvenile sea stars. In one year the sea star is capable of increasing its diameter by 8 cm; at fully grown, the northern Pacific sea star can reach sizes up to 40 to 50 cm in diameter. Larval survival is constrained by temperature and salinity of the surrounding marine habitat, with the optimal ranges respectively 8Â° to 16Â° C, and 3Â° to 8.75Â° . Generally, sea stars are sensitive to salinity fluctuations, and is unlikely to be found in places as such. Northern Pacific sea stars live up to five years. In Japan its numbers increase and reach outbreak for two to three years; outbreaks tend to occur in three or ten year cycles.<br><br><strong>Habitat</strong><br><br>Native to the coasts of northern China, Korea, Russia and Japan, the northern Pacific sea star lives in waters between 7Â° and 22Â° C.<br><br>It lives in mainly shallow water, but also is found as deep as 200 metres. It is rarely found on reefs or high wave action areas, instead sitting on mud, sand or pebble substrates.<br><br><strong>Plagues</strong><br><br>In Tasmania, due to the plague of sea stars, hunting days have been organised, where volunteers work together to physically remove as many of the sea stars as possible. Efforts of this kind in 1993 resulted in the collection of more than 30,000 sea stars. During the first attempts to remove the sea star from Tasmania, many of the sea stars that were captured were cutg up and thrown back into the sea. Unfortunately, each part that was thrown back was able to regenerate and grow a new starfish.<br><br>Sea star poisons are not specific and in the ocean, could damage many other natural marine communities. Also, the amount of chemicals needed to poison sea stars in estuaries would be very expensive, and very impractical. In Australia, northern Pacific sea stars don't have any pathogens, though in Japan, northern Pacific sea stars are attacked by unicelled animal, called Orchitophrya. Orchitophrya invades sea stars' testes, and kills sperm and castrates the sea star. However scientists later found out that Orchitophrya don't usually invade all 10 of the sea star's testesm and it's unlikely Orchitophrya will have the effect scientists had hoped for.<br><br>The NOrthern Pacific sea star has also been found in Port Phillip, Victoria, for some years now. Interestingly, the seastar has migrated inland in the Maribyrnong River, reaching as far inland as Essendon. The Maribyrnong is a salty river (previously known as Saltwater River), but finding the sea star this far inland is quite unique.<br><br>Issue #339</div>

It has thousands of Black-footed Albatross, Laysan Albatross as well as shearwaters and terns. The island also held 5 unique landbirds, including the Laysan Rail. It was a small (15 cm) bird, flightless member of the rail family, an opportunist that would feed on invertebrates and the eggs of seabirds. It was an aggressive feeder that would fight off other species, particularly the Laysan Finch. It was endemic to the Laysan, though some authors have noted that there were records on other Hawaiian islands.<br><br><strong>Extinction</strong><br><br>The extinction of the Laysan Rail is particularly unfortunate as it could have easily been avoided. The rail was initially threatened when rabbits were introduced to Laysan. With no predators to control their numbers the rabbits soon ate the entire vegetation cover on the island. This turned the island into a barren dust bowl, sending the Laysan Millerbird and the Laysan Honeycreeper (both subspecies endemic to the island) to extinction. The Laysan Finch and Laysan Duck both survived by eating shore flies and scavenging bird eggs and carrion. The rail is believed to have become extinct on Laysan in the 1920s.<br><br>The story did not end there, however. The rail had been introduced to Midway Atoll in 1891, and had thrived on the island. Once the rail had become extinct on Laysan moves were made to both re-introduce the rail to its old home and take some to the main islands of Hawaii, along with Laysan Finches, to form a experimental population. This would have safeguarded the species. Rails were collected for this, however the idea was held up by red-tape, some people in the United States Biological Survey were concerned that the Laysan Finch, if it escaped on the main islands, would become a serious pest. The move of some of the birds to safety was therefore held up because of concerns about the finch.<br><br>The population on Midway survived until the Second World War, when in 1943 a landing craft accidentally broke free during a battle and rats were introduced on to the island. Within two years the species was extinct. A final irony was that the last man to see a Laysan Rail alive was warden Ed Caum, the man who had refused their export to Honolulu.<br><br>The scientific name honours Henry Palmer, who collected in the Hawaiian Islands for Walter Rothschild.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct (1945)<br><br>Issue #340</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Sei Whale</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Sei Whale</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Balaenoptera borealis</span>) is a large baleen whale, and as such is one of the largest animals in the world. Following large-scale hunting of Sei Whales in the Southern Ocean during middle part of the twentieth century when approximately 200,000 individuals were killed, the Sei Whale is now an internationally protected species.<br><br><img src="http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/2917/whalesei4mo.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Sei Whale</strong>, Balaenoptera borealis</span><br><br><strong>Taxonomy and naming</strong><br><br>This rorqual is in the order Cetacea. Like all the biggest whales it has baleen plates rather than teeth. This places it in the suborder Mysticeti and family Balaenopteridae. The species was first described by Lesson, but a further description was given by Karl Asmund Rudolphi and the species is often referred to as Rudolphi's Whale in older texts. This usage has since died out. Other names for the species include the Pollack Whale and Coalfish Whale.<br><br>The word Sei comes from the Norwegian word for coalfish (also called pollack). Sei Whales feed on coalfish, amongst other small fish and squid in Norwegian waters and so the fish and whales were and are often sighted together, giving the whale its name. Two geographically separated subspecies have been identified - the Northern Sei Whale (<span style="font-style: italic;">B.b.borealis</span>) and Southern Sei Whale (<span style="font-style: italic;">B.b.schleglii</span>). Genetic analyses may yet cause these two to be reclassed as separate species.<br><br><strong>Physical description</strong><br><br>The Sei Whale is large, weighing 600-750 kilograms and measuring 4-5 metres in length at birth. Adults typically measure 12-16 metres with large individuals upto 19.5 metres being recorded. Adults weigh 20-30 tonnes typically and can grow up to 45 tonnes. The Sei Whale looks similar to Bryde's Whale. At sea the most reliable distinguishing feature is the dive sequence. The whale has a relatively slim body, coloured dark grey on the upper side and light grey to white on the belly. The upper side commonly has white scar marks, believed to be caused by sharks. The dorsal fin is a little further up the body than most rorquals but still more than half way down the back. Carwardine (1995) describes the fin as erect. Contradictarily Reeves et al (2002) describe it as "very falcate". The tail is thick and the fluke is small in relation to body size.<br><br><strong>Population and distribution</strong><br><br>Sei Whales are found worldwide in a band stretching from about 60 degrees south to 60 degrees north. Deep off-shore waters are preferred. Sei Whales differ from other rorquals in that it is not easy to predict where groups will appear from one year to the next. A particular location may one year see an influx of many whales only for them not to return for several years afterwards. Sei Whales migrate annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to temperate and tropical waters for winter.<br><br>The total population of Sei Whales is now believed to be between 50 and 60 thousand of which around 10,000 are in or close to Icelandic waters.<br><br><strong>Behaviour</strong><br><br>Sei Whales usually move alone or in small groups. Larger groups have been seen at particularly abudant feeding grounds. The whale's dive sequence is more regular than its close relative. Blows occur at intervals of about 40-60 seconds for a few minutes followed a "deep dive" lasting five to fifteen minutes. Between shallow dives the whale stays close to the surface and remains visible in clear, calm waters. The Sei Whale is a fast swimmer, the fastest of all the baleens, and can reach speeds of up to 25 knots over short distances. In 1916, biologist R. C. Andrews likened them to a cheetah .<br><br><strong>Whaling</strong><br><br>On the advent of large fast whaling ships, Sei Whales, like other rorquals were hunted in earnest, particularly in Antarctic waters. Around 200,000 (the WWF quotes an exact figure of 203,588<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) were killed during the twentieth century, representing about 80% of the total worldwide population. The species was protected by the International Whaling Commission in 1976, with the morartorium being enforced since 1986. Since then some Sei Whales have been caught and killed by Icelandic and Japanese whalers under the auspices of scientific research. Currently around 50 Sei Whales are killed for this purpose each year by Japanese scientists. The main focus of the research is to examine what Sei Whales eat and whether they are reducing the amount of fish available for fisheries. Environmental campaigners dispute the necessity of the research, saying that it is known that Sei Whale feed on small fish, squid and plankton not hunted by humans.<br><br>The species remained listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2000, categorized as "endangered". Japanese scientists believe that the northern subspecies is more stable than this categorization implies, and believe it should be re-classified.<br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #342</div>

Its beak and feet are also all dark.<br><br><strong>Behaviour and Range</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Range</span><br><br>The Black-footed Albatross, along with the Laysan Albatross and the rare Short-tailed Albatross, are the three species of albatross that range in the northern hemisphere, as opposed to the rest of the family which range from the Equator south. They nest colonially on isolated islands of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (such as Laysan and Midway), and the Japanese islands of Toroshima Island, Bonin, and Senkaku. Their range at sea varies during the seasons (straying farther from the breeding islands when the chicks are older or they don't have chicks) but they make use of great areas of the North Pacific, feeding from Alaska to California and Japan. They overlap greatly in breeding and feeding range with the other two species of northern albatross, although the other two will range further north into the Bering Sea than the Black-footed will.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding</span><br><br>The Black-footed Albatross, like the rest of its family, forms long term pair-bonds that last for life. After fledging the birds return to the colony after three years, and spend two years building nests, dancing and being with prospective mates, a behaviour that probably evolved to ensure maximum trust between the birds (raising an albatross chick is a massive energetic investment, and a long courting period establishes for both birds that the other is committed).<br><br>Nests are simple depressions scraped in the sand, into which one egg is laid. The egg is incubated for just over two months (65 days). Both birds incubate the egg, the male incubating more as the female leaves soon after hatching to recoup reserves used for egg-laying. The average time spent on incubating shifts is 18 days. However, mates can wait up to 38 days to be relieved, and if something happens to the mate the other has been recorded incubating for 49 days without food or water.<br><br>The chick is brooded for 20 days by its parents, after which both parents leave the nest and return to feed the chick. The chick is fed regurgitated food by sticking its bill inside that of its parent. Fledging occurs after 140 days.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feeding</span><br><br>The Black-footed Albatross feeds in pelagic waters, taking fish, mostly the eggs of flying fish, squid and to a lesser extent crustaceans. It has been described as a 'floating pig' by one author for its habit of taking kitchen scraps from ships. It will also consume floating debris, including plastics.<br><br><strong>Conservation</strong><br><br>The Black-footed Albatross is considered endangered, because it is taken incidentally by long-line fishing. An estimated 4,000 are taken every year, based on the number taken in 1990; other estimates put the number at 8,000. It is also vulnerable to oil and ingestion of floating plastics, which reduces the space in the stomach available for food to be brought to the chick. All of its nesting sites in the U.S. are protected.<br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #343</div>

Weight varies between 17 and 31 grams. It has a coat of short, dense, silky fur, brown on the upper side with a number of ashy white patches, and paler underneath. The ears are short and rounded, and there are black rings around the eyes.<br><br><img src="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/6136/dromiciopsgliroides5008zs.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Monito del Monte</strong>, Dromiciops gliroides</span><br><br>Monitos del Monte are found only in the mountains of Chile and Argentina, preferring dense, humid forests, particularly where there are areas of Chilean bamboo.

Pairs make nests of leaves and sticks, about 20 cm in diameter and lined with grass or moss, in a variety of places: under rocks, in hollow trees, on branches, or suspended in thick shrubbery.<br><br>Monitos del Monte are largely carnivorous. Most of their diet is insects and other small invertebrates, although they may also take some fruit. They are nocturnal, and excellent climbers with both feet and tail, but equally at home on the ground. They have an extraordinary ability to rapidly accumulate a reserve of fat in the tail, being able to double their body weight within a week. This reserve is enough to sustain them through periods of cold weather, during which they hibernate.<br><br>Mating takes place in the spring and early summer, and results in a litter of between one and five young, which are carried in the well-developed pouch.

Although once thought to be a member of the Didelphidae (the order that contains the Virginia opossum), an accumulation of both anatomical and molecular evidence in recent years has led to the conclusion that this tiny South American marsupial is not a member of the Ameridelphia (the magnorder that contains all other American marsupials) at all, but is instead most closely related to the Australidelphia, or Australasian marsupials. The distant ancestors of the Monito del Monte, it is thought, either remained in what is now South America while others entered Antarctica and eventually Australia during the time when all three continents were joned as part of Gondwana, or else were part of the Australian marsupial fauna which reinvaded South America.<br><br>Conservation status: Vulnerable<br><br>Issue #350</div>

It is a major agricultural and garden pest, and a general nuisance. It is also a vector (as are many snail species) of several human pathogens and parasites.

The shell has a rounded conical shape, being about twice as high as it is broad. The shell is generally brown in color with irregular darker streaks running transversely across the whorls.<br><br><strong>Habitat</strong><br><br>The Giant African Snail is native to East Africa, especially Kenya and Tanzania, but also include most regions of the humid tropics, including many Pacific islands, southern and eastern Asia, and the Caribbean. The Giant African Snail can now be found in agricultural areas, coastland, disturbed areas, natural forest, planted forests, riparian zones, scrub/shrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.<br><br><strong>Impact</strong><br><br>The Giant African Snail has been widely introduced throughout the tropics and subtropics]]. After introduction, its population increases dramatically, perhaps following a variable lag time, as seen in many other introductions of non-native species. The snails frequently reach such enormous numbers, at least locally, that they become not only agricultural and garden pests but also a major public nuisance, causing road hazards and making it difficult to avoid them while walking. The snail has been considered the most important snail pest in the tropics and subtropics and perhaps the world.<br><br>However, some argue that its agricultural impacts may have been exaggerated, the nuisance factor perhaps being more important. By reaching such enormous numbers and invading native ecosystems they also pose a serious conservation problem. Not only may they eat native plants, modifying their habitat, but they probably also out-compete existing native snails.<br><br><strong>Disease</strong><br><br>The Giant African Snailis also a vector of <span style="font-style: italic;">Angiostrongylus cantonensis</span> (Nematoda; Protostrongylidae), the roundworm responsible for eosinophilic meningo-encephalitis in humans and the spread of the disease has been correlated with the spread of the snail. However, many other introduced snails in the tropics are also vectors of this parasite and the spread of the disease has not definitively been related to the spread of the Giant African Snail.<br><br>The more insidious conservation problem they cause is that they tempt agricultural officials to initiate a number of putative biological control measures. The most well publicised of these measures is the introduction of predatory snails, most notably <span style="font-style: italic;">Euglandina rosea</span>. The first attempts at such biological control were made in Hawaii. Fifteen carnivorous snail species were deliberately introduced. Of these, nine did not become established; the fate of three is unknown but they are certainly not common and do not appear to be causing serious problems. However, three have become established: <span style="font-style: italic;">Euglandina rosea, Gonaxis kibweziensis, Gonaxis quadrilateralis</span>. There is no scientific evidence that the predatory snails are the reason for the observed decline in numbers of the Giant African Snail, however.<br><br>Similar ill-conceived attempts at biological control involving Euglandina rosea in particular have been implemented in French Polynesia, American Samoa, Guam, and a number of other places in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In addition to the deliberate introduction of predatory snails, the predatory flatworm <span style="font-style: italic;">Platydemus manokwari</span> has also been introduced, although as yet less widely. It is reported that this flatworm can indeed cause populations of the Giant African Snail to decline, but the evidence is only correlative, not convincingly causative. However, the flatworm has also been implicated in the decline of native species on Guam. It cannot be stressed enough that these introductions of putative biological control agents against the Giant African Snail are extremely dangerous from the perspective of the conservation of native snail species, and in any case, there is no good evidence that they can indeed control Giant African Snail populations.<br><br><strong>Population control</strong><br><br>Suggested preventative measures must include strict quarantine measures to prevent introduction and further spread. Many methods have been tried to eradicate the Giant African Snail. Generally, none of them have been effective except where implemented at the first sign of infestation. Methods include hand collecting, use of molluscicides, flame-throwers, and the failed attempts at biological control discussed above. In some regions, an effort has been made to promote use of the Giant African Snail as a food resource, collecting the snails for food being seen as a method of controlling them. However, promoting a pest, for whatever seemingly positive reason, seems fundamentally counterproductive as it will likely encourage the further deliberate spread of the snails. It seems axiomatic that a pest species should not be promoted.<br><br><strong>Nutrition</strong><br><br>The Giant African Snail is a macrophytophagous herbivore.<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>The Giant African Snail is a cross-fertilizing, egg-laying hermaphrodite. The number of eggs per clutch averages around 200.
