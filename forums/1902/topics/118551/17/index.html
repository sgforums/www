            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Turkish Van</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Turkish Van </strong>(Turkish: <span style="font-style: italic;">Van Kedisi</span>) (also known as the Turkish Swimming Cat) is a rare, naturally occurring breed of cat originally found in the Lake Van region of southeastern Turkey. The word van refers to their color pattern, where the color is restricted to the head and the tail, and the rest of the cat is white. It is the maximum expression of the piebald white spotting gene that makes the van pattern. The spotting gene appears in many different species (like the horse and ball python). It also shows up in the common house cat, so a cat that shows this color pattern but is not registered or from the Van region, is called a "Vanalike".<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Turkish_Van_Example2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Turkish_Van_Example2.jpg/250px-Turkish_Van_Example2.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Immature male red tabby <strong>Turkish Van</strong></span><br><br><strong>Characteristics</strong><br><br>The coat on a Van is considered semi-longhaired. While many cats have three distinct hair types in their coat, guard hairs, awn hairs and down hairs, the Turkish Van only has one. This makes their coat feel like cashmere or rabbit fur, and the coat dries quickly when wet. Lake Van is a region of temperature extremes and the cats have evolved a coat that grows thick in the winter with a large ruff and bottlebrush tail for the harsh winters and then sheds out short in the body for the warm summers. The full tail is kept year round.<br><br>The Van is one of the larger cat breeds. The males can reach 20 lb (9 kg) and the females weigh about half of that. They have massive paws and rippling hard muscle structure which allows them to be very strong jumpers. Vans can easily hit the top of a refrigerator from a cold start on the floor. They are slow to mature and this process can take 3-5 years. Also, their fetching skills are quite good and they are quick to learn.<br><br>Another interesting trait is their fascination with water (rare among cats). Vans are also called the "Swimming Cats" since they have been known to take a dip in Lake Van in their native country. They may have acquired this trait due to the very hot summers and have extremely waterproof coats that make bathing them a challenge. Most Vans in the US are indoor cats and do not have access to large bodies of water but their love and curiosity of water stays with them. Instead of swimming they stir their water bowls and invent fishing games in the toilet.<br><br><strong>Breed standards</strong><br><br>Breed standards allow for one or more body spots as long as there is no more than 20% color and the cat does not give the appearance of a bicolor. Although red tabby and white is the classic van color, the color on a van's head and tail can be one of the following: Red, Cream, Black, Blue, Red Tabby, Cream Tabby, Brown Tabby, Blue Tabby, Tortoiseshell, Dilute Tortoise, Brown Patched Tabby, Blue patched Tabby and any other color not showing evidence of hybridization with the pointed cats (Siamese, Himalayan, etc).<br><br><strong>Preservation</strong><br><br>Turkish Vans are a naturally occurring breed of cat. They can still be found in east Turkey, near Lake Van. Their numbers have diminished, but both the Vans and the Turkish Angora, (which is a separate breed with different characteristics from central Turkey) are under the protection of the Turkish government and are bred at the Ankara Zoo. The genetic traits of the cats have not been modified from their originals and breeding programs seek to preserve their unique combination of athleticism and loyalty.<br><br>Vans are sometimes confused with Turkish Angoras, although a side-by-side comparison reveals vastly different characteristics. Angoras are named after Ankara (Angora) and descended separately from the Vans. Angoras also carry the W gene associated with white fur, blue eyes and deafness while Vans do not. Van eye color can be amber, blue or odd (one each, amber and blue) but Vans with two blue eyes are not deaf like Angoras.<br><br><strong>Origins</strong><br><br>Turkish Vans have been living in their native Turkey for thousands of years and various references to "white ringtail" cats through history show this. The classic red tabby and white pattern gives the ringtail appearance and has been found depicted on Hittite jewelry of antiquity.<br><br>In 1955 two British women, Laura Lushington and Sonia Halliday, saw Vans in Turkey for the first time and decided to bring them home. They immediately bred true, confirming they are a true natural breed.<br><br>The first Vans were brought to the United States in 1982 and accepted into championship for showing in the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) in 1994. Since then, CFA has registered approximately 100 Vans born each year in the US, making them one of the rarest cat breeds. However, the gene pool thrives because it still uses Vans imported from Turkey. Imported Vans have no human breeding intervention and are quite robust.<br><br><strong>Vans as pets</strong><br><br>Turkish Vans are very intelligent, and will easily take over their home and owners. Vans are people cats that want to be with people wherever they go. They like to play and jump and explore anything in their reach, which is quite large. They are energetic; they play hard and sleep hard. Many Vans are dedicated to fetching their particular object of interest, and many owners describe them as "dogs in a cat suit" because of their unusual personalities.<br><br>Common Nickname: Van, Swimming Cat<br>Country of origin: Turkey<br><br>Issue #373</div>

The posterior end of the shell has a saw-like formation, flanged outward like a bell. The carapace of adult specimens is almost completely black, with yellow highlights. The ventral shell is lighter coloured and has pairs of triangular markings with the points facing the rear of the animal. The front sides of the limbs are covered with large scales. In old female specimens, the rear flaps of the underside of the plastron are somewhat moveable. The tail is notable for a lengthwise marking and for an undivided carapace over the tail. Males have a longer tail, which is thicker at the base than the females. Their underside is more strongly indented. Males are also often larger than the females. The females lay their hard-shelled spherical eggs in the soil in May and June.<br><br><strong>Habitat and feeding habits</strong><br><br>The natural range of the Marginated Tortoise is southern Greece, from the Peloponnesus to Mount Olympus. They are also found in isolated zones of the Balkans and Italy, with a somewhat broader range in northeastern Sardinia.<br><br>The Marginated Tortoise lives in more mountainous regions than Herman's Tortoise (Testudo hermanni). It can be found in elevations as high as 1,600 m (5,250 feet). The black color of the carapace is helpful for survival in this environment, as it allows the tortoise to absorb a great deal of heat in a short time, helping it maintain its body temperature. Similarly, the lighter colored underside slows the radiation of body heat into the cold ground. Early in the morning, Marginated Tortoises bask in the sun to raise their body temperature, and then search for food. After feeding, the tortoises return to their shelters in the hot midday hours, leaving them again in the late afternoon.<br><br>Marginated Tortoise's food source consists primarily of plants from their native Mediterranean region. In captivity, the primary foodstuffs are dandelions, clover, salad leaves such as rocket or watercress, and also leaves from bean, radish, and crowfoot plants. Sometimes even grass and hay will be eaten, along with fruits. Lettuce will be eagerly devoured, but owing to its low nutrient value should not generally be given. They are primarily herbivorous, but they need a small amount of animal protein in their diet, particularly in the case of babies and egg-laying mothers. This protein is generally provided by earthworms and snails.<br><br><strong>Subspecies and related species</strong><br><br>The primary subspecies of Testudo marginata is <span style="font-style: italic;">Testudo marginata</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">marginata</span> (Schoepf, 1789), described above. Two additional varieties are generally mentioned in connection with the marginated tortoise. <span style="font-style: italic;">Testudo marginata sarda</span> (Mayer, 1992) is a separate population in Sardinia. This subspecies has less strongly bent tiles in the posterior of the carapace, and the posterior of the carapace is almost smooth compared with the saw-like <span style="font-style: italic;">Testudo marginata marginata</span>.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a3/MarginataComparison_007.jpg/180px-MarginataComparison_007.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">T. marginata marginata (left) and T. marginata sarda (right).</span><br><br>A particularly small variation of the marginated tortoise was discovered in the southwestern part of the Pelopponesus. However, the Dwarf Marginated Tortoise is not a subspecies, but rather a related species in the same genus (Testudo weissingeri, Bour, 1996).<br><br>Testudo marginata is also closely related to the Greek Tortoise or Spur-thighed Tortoise (<span style="font-style: italic;">Testudo graeca</span>). Both have very similar bodily characteristics, for example, an oblong carapace, large scales on the front legs, large covering for the head and cone-like scales on the upper thigh, undivided tail covering, moveable stomach plates, and lack of a tail spike. Presumably, Testudo marginata evolved from Testudo graeca as a population more suited for life in the mountainous regions. Evidence in favor of this is the wide geographical region and the extremely large number of subspecies of Testudo graeca, including a subspecies in Turkey with strongly bent carapace tiles, like the Marginated Tortoise. Testudo marginata on the other hand, despite the two subspecies, presents a much more unified appearance, which points toward an earlier appearance in evolutionary history. In captivity, the two species often cross-breed.<br><br><strong>Mating and reproduction</strong><br><br>Immediately after waking from hibernation the mating instinct starts up. The males follow the females with great interest, encircling them, biting them on the limbs, ramming them, and trying to mount them. During copulation, the male opens his mouth, showing his red tongue and making loud cries. The tone of the copulation cry is almost sobbing with long, deep tones, in contrast to Testudo hermanni, in which there is a much higher-toned peeping noise.<br><br>During mating, the female stands still and holds her head to the side, looking up to see the opened mouth of the male. It appears that the red tongue serves a signalling function. The female moves her head from left to right in the same rhythm as the male's cries.<br><br>Afterwards the female seeks out an adequate location to lay her eggs. Once such a place is found, the female stands still, propping both front legs firmly against the ground. Then she digs out a hole with her hind legs, alternating between left and right, beginning with simply scratching the ground but eventually moving large quantities of soil which are piled up beside the hole. The depth of the hole is determined by the length of her hind legs. If the ground is too hard to dig, the female releases water from her anal gland to soften it.<br><br>Once the hole is dug egg laying begins. Each egg is gently rolled back into the hole. After the last egg the female immediately begins refilling the hole, again using her hind legs. Finally, she stamps the opening closed with her feet so that the ground regains its natural hardness. Larger animals may lay eggs as many as three times per summer, with about 15 eggs per clutch.<br><br>Issue #376</div>

Often they will shelter in caves or gutters during the day, and come out at night to feed. During the day they exhibit sluggish behaviour, becoming more active during the night. Research indicates that generally the shark remains within a kilometre of its aggregation site, and stays close to the ocean floor. Present throughout the world, in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, the shark is a common sight in many areas of the world. Through the 1950s and 1960s it was exterminated due to biased opinions. It was near extinction in Australian waters by spearfishing, and numbers there are only slowly making a resurgence. The Eastern Australian population is critically endangered, whereas in the west of the continent the population is listed as vulnerable.<br><br><strong>Anatomy</strong><br><br>Their bodies are stout, with two large dorsal fins and the tail is elongated and have a long upper lobe. The shark has a precaudal pit but no caudal keels. It grows to a length of 3.2 m (about 10' 6"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>). Male grey nurse sharks mature at 2.1 m (about 6' 11"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>); and females mature at 2.2 m (about 7' 3"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>).<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>The species is ovoviviparous, i.e. bearing live young from eggs which hatch inside the uterus. Female sharks have two uteruses. Inside the uterus the young sharks develop and eat each other, so typically only two young sharks are born for each gestation period, which lasts 6-9 months. This process, also known as intra-uterine cannibalism, is making it harder for the shark population to rebound from the near extinction. As a result, scientists are working on an plan to artificially inseminate and breed the sharks with test tubes, in order to increase their population.<br><br>Conservation status: Vulnerable<br><br>Issue #378</div>

They are a good example of carcinization, whereby a non-crab-like animal (in this case a relative of a squat lobster) evolves into an animal that only a specialist would know is not a true crab.

They are common under rocks, and can often be found and observed on rocky beaches and shorelines, startled creatures scurrying away when a stone is lifted.<br><br>Porcelain crabs can be distinguished from the true crabs by the apparent number of walking legs (three instead of four pairs, the fourth pair is actually hidden under the carapace), the apparent lack of a wrist (carpal) segment on the chelipeds, and long antennae originating on the front outside of the eye stalks. The abdomen of the porcelain crab is long and folded underneath it, free to move. In fact, when alarmed, the crab might swim by flapping its abdomen.<br><br>Porcelain crabs share the general body plan of a squat lobster (Galatheidae), but their bodies are more compact and flattened, an adaptation for living and hiding under rocks, as well as squeezing into little nooks and crannies. The porcelain crabs are quite fragile animals, and will often shed their limbs, hence their name. This trait is useful for these crustaceans because it helps them escape if a limb is grabbed by a predator or caught between rocks shifting in the current. A broken-off piece of limb may still continue to move for a short while, distracting the would-be predator as the crustacean flees. The lost appendage can grow back over several molts. Porcelain crabs have large chelae (claws), which are used for territorial struggles, but not for catching food. Feeding is accomplished instead by combing plankton and other organic particles from the water using long setae (feathery hair or bristle-like structures) on the mouthparts, where they will later be scraped off and consumed into the mouth.

It is a non-venomous king snake native to Western North America, particularly Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and California. The snake has dark black or brown and creamy or white markings, but they are very variable in color and pattern. The most common morph has creamy white crossbands on a dark background, but some specimens of this general type appear to be generally light-coloured with darker patches. A second morph, particularly common around San Diego, has longitudinal stripes instead of lateral bands; the form of these is also quite variable.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/Lampropeltis_getula_californiae.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>California King Snake</strong>, Lampropeltis getula californiae</span><br><br>California King Snakes grow to a length of up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) and weigh as much as 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms).<br><br>The diet of the California King Snake is similar to that of other King snakes. Prey items include lizards, birds, and other snakes. However, during time of shedding the snake will refuse to eat because of greatly reduced vision due to build-ups of oil underneath the eye coverings.<br><br>Issue #384</div>

In the Philippines, in the aquarium trade, it is called the Janitor Fish. The Suckermouth Catfish is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food. These fish are sold when they are young and small but they can grow to be a maximum size of over a foot to around 50 cm or so.<br><br>In the aquarium, this dark colored bottom-feeding nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks. Being nocturnal, they usually avoid light and like to hide in dark places, coming out to feed at night. However, in aquaria, they can easily learn to be active in the daytime. They are hardy fish and can tolerate a range of conditions. In their natural habitat, this species feeds on algae, aquatic weeds and other plant matter and small crustaceans.<br><br>This species' native range is tropical Central America and South America; it naturally occurs on the Pacific slope of Costa Rica and both slopes of Panama, southward to Uruguay. Suckermouth catfishes occur in the wild in fresh running waters and brackish waters of river mouths.<br><br>Due to the adult size of these catfish, most successful breedings have occurred in ponds with steep clay or mud banks. They dig tunnels close to the water level and the males guard the eggs until they hatch.<br><br>In some places in the Southern US (Florida and Texas), this species has been introduced from its native range, probably dumped by aquarists into the local waters. They have been also been introduced to several Asian countries as well. Suckermouth catfish are often cultured in ponds in Singapore and Hong Kong, where it is very popular for the aquarium trade.<br><br>Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range. However, they are of great value in the aquarium trade in the United States.<br><br>Issue #386</div>

It is venomous, and its sting has been known to lethal, particularly for small children. An antivenom was developed for this species, and produced in quantities sufficient to treat individuals within the state of Arizona. Production of this antivenom has since ceased, and a Mexican antivenin is being tested in its place. Fatalities are rare, with two recorded in the state of Arizona since 1968.<br><br><img src="http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/9268/asianbarkscorpion010ue.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Arizona bark scorpion</strong>, Centruroides exilicauda</span><br><br>The bark scorpion is unusual in that it is the only species in the southwest that regularly climbs walls, trees, and other objects with a sufficiently rough surface. It is not capable of climbing glass or smooth plastic, so it may be safely contained in glass vessels without lids. It is one of two species within the United States that is dangerous; the other, far less dangerous, species is <span style="font-style: italic;">Centruroides vittatus</span>.<br><br>Arizona bark scorpions are not true desert species; they prefer riparian areas, with sufficient moisture and humidity to support insects and other prey species. However, the popularity of irrigated lawns in residential areas has led to an explosion in the number of these animals in some areas. Relatively high humidity seems important in the life cycle of the species in that the female will not give live birth if it is too dry.<br><br>Care and feeding is similar to that of other scorpions. The Arizona bark scorpion does prefer to hide, and will cling to all but the smoothest of surfaces. It is more active at night, and a diet of crickets and other insects suits them well. Due to the venomous nature of the species, handling is contraindicated. They are not aggressive, and prefer to run or hide when confronted. The sting is very painful, and may cause pain and loss of use of an affected limb. In extreme cases, allergic reactions may cause death. Injury to young children or the elderly may require medical intervention.<br><br>Individual scorpions may live to 5-6 years, and possibly more.<br><br>Issue #387</div>
