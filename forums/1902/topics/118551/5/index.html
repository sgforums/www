It has been introduced to many locations in the belief it will control agricultural pests, particularly of sugarcane. Introduced populations now occur in Australia, Florida, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ogasawara Islands and Ryukyu Islands of Japan, most Caribbean islands and many Pacific islands including Hawai'i and Fiji.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/CaneToad.jpeg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Giant Neotropical Toad</strong>, Bufo marinus</span><br><br>Some individuals reach exceptional sizes for an anuran. A preserved specimen in the museum of Queensland is 24 cm long and weighed 1.36 kg. They can live as long as twenty years in captivity, but usually don't live as long in the wild.<br><br>Adults possess enlarged paratoid glands behind the eyes and other glands across the back. When the animal is harassed these glands secrete a milky-white fluid known as bufotoxin. Bufotoxin contains components which are dangerous to many animals. There are reported deaths of humans after consumption of toads. Ill-effects from contact with toads have also been reported and they should be handed with caution. However they are sometimes kept as pets.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dd/Cane-toad.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/Cane-toad.jpg/250px-Cane-toad.jpg"></a><br><br>Adults are omnivores which is unusual for an anuran. Their prey includes small vertebrates, a wide range of invertebrates, carrion and plant material. They even been known to attempt to eat ping pong balls. They are active primarily at night, ranging far away from water.<br><br>Females lay from 4,000 to 36,000 eggs per clutch, and breed at least twice per year. Both eggs and tadpoles are toxic to many animals. This toxic protection is lost for a period after metamorphosis until the paratoid glands develop.<br><br><strong>Introduction to Hawaii</strong><br><br>This toad was introduced into Hawai'i in 1932 from Puerto Rico to control injurious insects in the sugarcane fields.<br><br><strong>Introduction into Australia</strong><br><br>101 toads were brought to Australia from HawaiÂ‘i in June 1935 in an attempt to control pests to sugarcane crops. They bred immediately in captivity and by August 1935 over 3000 young toads had been released in areas around Cairns, Gordonvale and Innisfail in northern Queensland. Releases were temporarily limited due to environmental concerns, but resumed in other areas after September 1936. Since their release, toads have steadily expanded their range through Queensland, reaching the border with New South Wales in 1978 and the Northern Territory in 1984.<br><br>There are grave concerns that toads might affect Australia's native fauna by predation, competition, conveying diseases and by poisoning animals that attempt to prey on toads. The long-term impact of toads on the Australian environment is difficult to determine. Precipitous declines in populations of the Northern Quoll have been observed after toads have invaded an area. There are also a number of reports of goanna and snake populations collapsing after the arrival of toads. See <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4073359.stm" rel="nofollow">link</a>.<br><br>A number of native species have been reported as successfully preying on toads. Some birds, such as the Torresian Crow and the Black Kite, have learned to attack a toad's belly, avoiding the venom-producing glands on the behind the head. Recent reports by researchers in the Northern Territory indicate that a native frog <span style="font-style: italic;">Litoria dahlii</span> is apparently able to eat the tadpoles and live young of the toad without being affected by the poison that often kills other predators. This is believed to account for slower than expected infestations of toads in certain areas of the Northern Territory.<br><br>The saga of the Cane toad in Australia was popularized by the film <span style="font-style: italic;">Cane Toads: An Unnatural History</span> (1987) which tells the tale with a humorous edge and is often shown in Environmental Science courses.<br><br><strong>Other names</strong><br><br>The Giant Neotropical Toad is also known by the following names:<br><br>- Aga Toad (German, origin unknown)<br>- Cane Toad<br>- Dominican Toad<br>- Giant Marine Toad<br>- Giant Toad<br>- Marine Toad<br>- Sapo gigante (Spanish)<br>- South American Cane Toad<br>- Spring Chicken (in Belize)<br>- Sapo Cururu (in Brazil)<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Bufo_marinus_1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Bufo_marinus_1.jpg/250px-Bufo_marinus_1.jpg"></a><br><br>Issue #87</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Desert locust</strong></span><br><br>Plagues of the <strong>desert locust</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Schistocerca gregaria</span>) have threatened agricultural production in Africa, the Middle East and Asia for centuries. The livelihood of at least one-tenth of the worldÂ’s human population can be affected by this hungry insect. The 2004 desert locust plague is predicted to cause significant crop losses in West Africa and have a negative impact food security in the region.<br><br><strong>Desert locust ecology</strong><br><br>The desert locust lives a solitary life, until it rains. Rain causes vegetation growth and spurs the development of eggs that have been laid in the sandy soil. The new vegetation provides food for the newly hatched locusts and provides them with shelter as they develop into winged adults.<br><br>When vegetation is distributed in such a way that the locusts have to congregate to feed, and there has been sufficient rain for a lot of eggs to hatch, forced physical contact causes the insect's hind legs to bump up against one another. This triggers a cascade of metabolic and behavioral changes that signal the insectÂ’s transformation from <span style="font-style: italic;">solitary</span> behaviour to <span style="font-style: italic;">gregarious</span> behavior. When the locusts become gregarious they change from green coloured to yellow and black, their bodies become shorter, and they give off a hormone that causes them all to be attracted to the same location, enhancing swarm formation.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/83/DesertLocust.jpeg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/DesertLocust.jpeg/190px-DesertLocust.jpeg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Solitary (top) and gregarious (bottom) <strong>desert locusts</strong>, Schistocerca gregaria</span><br><br>During quiet periods, called recessions, locusts are confined to a 16-million-square-kilometer belt that extends through the Sahara Desert in northern Africa, across the Arabian Peninsula, and into northwest India. When conditions are right swarms invade countries on all sides of the recession area, as far north as Spain and Russia and as far east as India and southwest Asia. As many as 60 countries can be affected.<br><br>Swarms regularly cross the Red Sea between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and are even reported to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Caribbean. A single swarm can cover 1,200 square kilometers and can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer. The locust can live between three to six months, and there is a tenfold increase in locust numbers from one generation to the next.<br><br><strong>Crop loss</strong><br><br>Desert locusts can consume the approximate equivalent of their body mass each day (2 g) in green vegetation: leaves, flowers, bark, stems, fruit, and seeds. Nearly all crops, and non crop plants, are at risk, including millet, rice, maize, sorghum, sugarcane, barley, cotton, fruit trees, date palm, vegetables, rangeland grasses, acacia, pines, and banana.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/18/Locusts_feeding.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/18/Locusts_feeding.jpg/210px-Locusts_feeding.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Desert locusts feeding</span><br><br>Crop loss from locusts was noted in the Bible and Qur'an. During the twentieth century, Desert Locust plagues occurred in 1926-1934, 1940-1948, 1949-1963, 1967-1969 and 1986-1989. The significant crop losses caused by swarming desert locusts, exacerbate problems of food shortage, and are a threat to food security.<br><br><strong>Control</strong><br><br>NASA has developed methods for detecting conditions and regions likely to give rise to swarms by satellite. Satellite data, combined with weather information and ground surveys, are used by the FAOs Desert Locust Information Service to produce forecasts published on the Web and in regular locust bulletins. They also provide information and training to affected countries and arrange for funding from donor agencies in case of major upsurges and plagues.<br><br>The desert locust is a difficult pest to control, and control measures are made more difficult by the large and often remote areas (16-30 million sq. km) where locusts can be found. Undeveloped basic infrastructure in some affected countries, limited resources for locust monitoring and control and political turmoil within and between affected countries further reduce the capacity of a country to prevent swarms.<br><br>At present the primary method of controlling desert locust swarms is with organophosphate insecticides applied in small concentrated doses by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers. The insecticide must be applied directly to the insect. Control is undertaken by government agencies in locust affected countries or by specialised organisations like the Desert Locust Control Organisation for East Africa (DLCO-EA).<br><br>A biological control product has been available since the late nineties. It is based on a naturally occurring entomopathogenic (i.e. infecting insects) fungus, <span style="font-style: italic;">Metarhizium anisopliae</span> var. <span style="font-style: italic;">acridum</span>. The species <span style="font-style: italic;">M. anisopliae</span> is widespread throughout the world infecting many groups of insects, but it is harmless to humans and other mammals and birds. The variety <span style="font-style: italic;">acridum</span> has specialised on short-horned grasshoppers, to which group locusts belong, and has therefore been chosen as the active ingredient of the product.<br><br>The product is available under different names in Africa and Australia. It is applied in the same way as chemical insecticides but does not kill as quickly. At recommended doses, the fungus typically takes two to three weeks to kill up to 90% of the locusts. For that reason, it is recommended for use mainly against hoppers, the wingless early stages of locusts. These are mostly found in the desert, far from cropping areas, where the delay in death does not result in damage. The advantage of the product is that it affects only grasshoppers, which makes it much safer than chemical insecticides. Specifically, it allows the natural enemies of locusts and grasshoppers to continue their beneficial work. These include birds, parasitoid and predatory wasps, parasitoid flies and certain species of beetles. Though they cannot always prevent plagues, they can limit the frequency of outbreaks and contribute to their control.<br><br><strong>2004 Desert locust swarm</strong><br><br>In 2004 West Africa faces the largest desert locust plague in 15 years. The costs of fighting the swarm are estmiated by the FAO to reach US$122 million and harvest losses are valued at up to US$2.5 billion which will have disastrous effects on the food security situation in West Africa.<br><br>The countries affected by the 2004 plague are Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Chad, Egypt, Gambia, Guinea, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen.<br><br>Recently, large swarms of locusts traveled from Egypt into Jordan and Israel. It was reported that millions have reached the Gulf of Aqaba and the surrounding regions. Israel's Ministry of Agriculture reported sightings of individual insects as far north as Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv.<br><br>Large scale control efforts are underway, but most countries face serious shortages of pesticides and aircraft.<br><br>Issue #88</div>

The adult male can be black, fluorescent blue with yellow highlights, blue-green, or brilliant yellow.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">R. quaesita</span> grows to an overall length of approximately 100 cm (36 in), and has a life span of up to five years. The ribbon eel is the only moray eel that is not gonochoristic.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br><br>Like many eels, the ribbon eel is sometimes thought to be angry or aggressive, because its mouth is often open, appearing ready to strike. In reality, the eel is simply breathing.<br><br>In the wild, the ribbon eel buries itself in sand or hides in rocks or reefs, dashing out to feed on small fishes. The ribbon eel is known as one of the most sociable and peaceful of all moray eels, and does not bother humans or get easily irritated.<br><br><strong>In the aquarium</strong><br><br>It is estimated that greater than 99% of ribbon eels do not live more than a month in captivity. Ribbon eels have been observed in nearly every case to stop eating after being captured.<br><br>Purchasing an animal of this species may be unwise, as it is extremely unlikely that the eel has continued eating since capture. It is always best to see it, in person, eat something while in captivity. Fish sellers have been known to hide or lie about the fact that the animal no longer eats. Some feel that this species should never be purchased under any circumstance, as when the demand dries up, these eels will no longer be caught and put up for sale. Capturing 100 of these animals to get 1 pet is not a very pleasant ratio for the species.<br><br>Issue #89</div>

These animals are herbivorous, slow and nonvenomous; unlike the somewhat similar and closely related centipedes (Class <span style="font-style: italic;">Chilopoda</span>), which can be easily distinguished by their single pair of legs for each body segment.

Many species also emit a somewhat poisonous liquid secretion, or hydrogen cyanide gas, through microscopic pores along the sides of their bodies as a secondary defense. Some of these substances are acidic and can burn the exoskeleton of ants and other insect predators, and the skin and eyes of larger predators. As far as humans are concerned, this chemical brew is fairly harmless, although it should never be eaten or applied to the eyes. Because of this, caution should be used when handling millipedes.<br><br>Issue #90</div>

The coat is medium long and is harsh and wiry in texture. The FCI breed standards specifies that the coat must be black, but the AKC also allows gray, silver, red, black and tan, and beige; other clubs have their own lists of acceptable colours, with black always being the preference.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Affenpinscher_600.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/Affenpinscher_600.jpg/250px-Affenpinscher_600.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Black is the most common coat colour of the <strong>Affenpinscher</strong>.</span><br><br><strong>Temperament</strong><br><br>The Affenpinscher has a personality that some associate with terriers. They're different from terriers, however, in that they often get along with other dogs and pets. They are active, adventurous, curious, and stubborn, but they are also fun-loving and playful. The breed is confident, lively, affectionate towards family members and also very defensive of them. This friendly little dog enjoys being with its family. It needs consistent, firm training because some can be quite difficult to housebreak. The training should be varied because the dog can easily become bored. This breed learns quickly but its stubbornness might make it difficult to train.<br><br>Affenpinschers are somewhat territorial when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not recommended for very small children. This dog is mostly quiet but can become very excited if attacked or threatened and shows no fear toward any aggressor. It is best suited for a family who likes a show and has a sense of humor.<br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>The breed can be expected to live about 14-15 years. It is one of the healthiest breeds, with no known genetic health problems.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The breed is European in origin and dates back to the seventeenth century. Its name is derived from the German <span style="font-style: italic;">affe</span> ("ape", "monkey"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) and <span style="font-style: italic;">pinscher</span> ("terrier"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>). The breed predates and is ancestral to the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon) and Belgian Griffon. Dogs of the Affenpinscher type have been known since about 1600 but these were somewhat larger, about 12 to 13 inches, and came in colors of gray, black, fawn, black and tan, gray and tan, and even red. White feet and chest were also common. The breed was created to be a ratter, working to remove rodents from kitchens, granaries, and stables.<br><br>Alternative name: Monkey Dog<br>Country of origin: Germany<br><br>Issue #92</div>

Some individuals may also have silver or blue specks on their sides; the area around the vent is usually gray. These salamanders are slender, with a wide nose and distinctive long toes, and range in size from 11 to 18 cm.<br><br>Like other mole salamanders, Jefferson Salamanders are burrowers; they have well developed lungs suited for this purpose. Nocturnal by nature, they can be spotted by day during the mating season. Breeding occurs in early spring, after the snow in the area has melted.<br><br><strong>Habitat</strong><br><br>The secretive adults tend to hide under stones or logs, or in leaf litter and other underbrush in deciduous forests. Migration to their breeding area is quick, since breeding sites are usually close to the over-wintering burrows. The breeding sites they choose are fishless ponds.<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>Eggs are laid in small agglomerations attached to submerged twigs or other natural support at the pond's edge. Clutches can contain between 5 to 60 eggs, averaging about 30. The age at which they first breed, and the frequency with which they breed are unknown; estimates are that females will first breed at 22 months, and males at 34 months. Eggs develop rapidly, and may hatch within 15 days. Larvae stay in the pond from two to four months, during which time they grow to between 3 and 8 times their hatching size.<br><br>The Jefferson Salamander is known to hybridize with the Blue-spotted Salamander. The offspring are always triploid females, possessing two of each chromosome from the Jefferson Salamander and one of each chromsome from the Blue-spotted Salamander.

(All of these are <span style="font-style: italic;">Scarabaeidae</span>, have white grubs and are turf pests, too.)<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br><br>Imagines (i.e. adults) of the Common Cockchafer reach sizes of 25 to 30 mm, the Forest Cockchafer is a bit smaller (20-25 mm). The two species can best be distinguished by the form of their Pygidium (the back end): it is long and slender in the Common Cockchafer, but shorter and knob-shaped at the end in the Forest Cockchafer. Both have a brown colour.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">M. pectoralis</span> looks similar, but its Pygidium is rounded.<br><br>Male cockchafers have seven "leaves" on their antennas, whereas the females have only six.<br><br><strong>Life cycle</strong><br><br>Adults appear at the end of April or in May and live only for about five to seven weeks. After about two weeks, the female begins laying eggs, which she buries about 10 to 20 cm deep in the earth. She may do this several times until she has laid between 60 and 80 eggs. The Common Cockchafer lays its eggs in fields, whereas the Forest Cockchafer stays in the vicinity of the trees. The preferred food for adults are oak leaves, but they will also feed on conifer needles.<br><br>The larvae, known as "<span style="font-style: italic;">white grubs</span>" or "<span style="font-style: italic;">chafer grubs</span>", hatch after some four to six weeks. They feed on plant roots, for instance potato roots. The grubs develop in the earth for some three to four years, in colder climates even five years, and grow continually to a size of about 4 to 5 cm, before they pupate in early autumn and develop into a cockchafer in some six weeks.<br><br>The cockchafer imagines overwinter in the earth at depths between 20 and 100 cm and work their way to the surface only in spring.<br><br>Because of their long development time as larvae, cockchafers appear in a cycle of every three or four years; the years vary from region to region. There is a larger cycle of some 30 years superimposed, in which they occur (or rather, used to occur) in unusually high numbers.<br><br><strong>Pest control and History</strong><br><br>Both the grubs and the imagines have an enormous appetite and thus were/are a major problem in agriculture and forestry. In pre-industrialized times, the main mechanism to control their numbers was to collect and kill the adult beetles, thereby interrupting the cycle. They were once very abundant: in 1911, more than 20 million individuals were collected in 18 kmÂ² of forest.<br><br>Collecting adults was an only moderately successful method. In the Middle ages, pest control was rare and people had no effective means to protect their harvest. This gave rise to events that seem completely ludicrous from a modern perspective. In 1320, for instance, cockchafers were brought to court in Avignon and sentenced to withdraw within three days onto a specially designated area, otherwise they'd be outlawed. Of course, the cockchafers didn't obey, and were collected and killed. (Similar trials also occurred for mice.)<br><br>In some areas and times, cockchafers even served as food. A 19th century recipe from France for cockchafer soup is handed down to us as "roast 1 pound (500 g) of cockchafers without wings and legs in sizzling butter, then cook them in a chicken soup, add some veal liver and serve with chives on a toast"! And a German newspaper from Fulda from the 1920s tells of students eating sugar-coated cockchafers. Today, only cockchafers made of chocolate are eaten.<br><br>Only with the modernization of agriculture in the 20th century and the invention of chemical pesticides did it become possible to effectively combat the cockchafer. Combined with the transformation of many pastures into agricultural land, this has resulted in a decrease of the cockchafer to near-extinction in some areas in Europe in the 1970s. Since then, agriculture has generally reduced its use of pesticides. Because of environmental and public health concerns - pesticides may enter the food chain and thus also the human body - many chemical pesticides have been phased out in the European Union and worldwide. In recent years, the cockchafer's numbers have been increasing again, causing damage to over 1,000 square kilometres of land all over Europe. While this may be due to the reduced use of chemicals, some scientists also argue that, since the cockchafer thrives in warm and dry soils, the current increase in abundance may be related to climate change.<br><br>Today, only biological measures are available for control. For instance, pathogenic fungi or nematodes that kill the grubs are applied to the soil.<br><br>Issue #97</div>

By 1768, less than 30 years after it had been discovered, the Steller's Sea Cow was extinct.<br><br>There are still sporadic reports of sea cow-like animals from the Bering area, however, so it has been suggested that small populations of the animal may have survived to the present day.

Its metabolic rate is approximately 3 times higher than one would expect for a reptile of its size, which, coupled with counter-current heat exchangers and large size, allow it to maintain a body temperature above that of the surrounding water. It also has a shell that lacks the bony scutes of other turtles, being comprised mainly of connective tissue.<br><br><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong><br><br>The Leatherback is the largest of all the turtles and is very different from other turtles in both appearance and physiology. It has a smooth, blackish carapace with ridges running from head to tail. This shell is not made of bone plates but of soft connective tissue. The carapace does not meet the plastron at a sharp angle like in other turtles, but a gentle curve, giving the animal a semi-cylindrical appearance.<br><br>The front flippers of the Leatherback turtle are much larger than those of other turtles, both in proportion and in absolute size. Those of adults can span 270 cm from tip to tip.<br><br>The beak of the Leatherback turtle is specially hooked to help it bite jellyfish and its throat has backward-facing barbs to help it swallow them.<br><br><strong>Diet</strong><br><br>Leatherback turtles subsist on a diet of jellyfish. Because of the translucent nature of its prey, Leatherbacks are often fooled into eating floating plastic debris. Dead leatherbacks have been found with plastic bags, pieces of hard plastic, and monofilament fishing line in their stomachs.<br><br><strong>Breeding</strong><br><br>Leatherbacks mate at sea; males never leave the water once they enter it as hatchlings. Females mate every three or four years, returning to the beaches where they themselves were hatched to deposit their eggs. One female may lay as many as ten clutches in one breeding season. The interval between laying is about nine days. Mating only occurs after the age of ten years.<br><br>After encountering a female (who possibly exudes a pheromone to signal her reproductive status) the leatherback male uses head movements, nuzzling, biting or flipper movements to determine her receptiveness. Marine turtles often face a difficult and sometimes even dangerous task when attempting to reproduce. The male has to mount the female from behind and latch on in order to be able to copulate, but sometimes their shells obstruct this process. Mating can also become dangerous when the male is so desperately overeager to find a mate that he stays underwater for too long, and after encountering the female, he must spend another hour with no air. Fertilization is internal, and multiple males usually mate with a single female. This may be a development evolved to insure against male infertility, eliminate the risk of sperm depletion, allow females to select the highest quality sperm, and increase the genetic variation amongst offspring. However, studies have shown that the process of polyandry in sea turtles actually reduces fertilization success.<br><br>Cleavage of the cell begins within hours of fertilization, but development is suspended during the gastrulation period of movements and infoldings of embryonic cells, while the eggs are being laid. Development soon resumes, but the embryos remain extremely susceptible to movement-induced mortality in their nests until the membranes fully develop through the first 20-25 days of incubation, when the structural differentiation of body and organs (organogenesis) soon follows.<br><br>Nesting beaches must be comprised of soft sand and have a shallow approach angle from the sea. This is because their soft shells are easily damaged by hard rocks. This is a source of vulnerability for the turtles because these beaches are subject to erosion. Females excavate a nest above the high-tide line with their flippers. They then begin to lay their eggs, producing about 110 ova, 70 of which are large and fertile, the remaining 40 being smaller and sterile. The female carefully back-fills the nest, making sure to disguise it from predators with a scattering of sand.<br><br>The eggs hatch in about 60 days. Like some other reptiles, the ambient temperature of the nest determines the gender of the hatchlings. The eggs hatch while still buried under the sand. After nightfall, the hatchlings dig their way to the surface and make their way to the sea. Once the hatchlings reach the ocean they are generally not seen again until maturity. Very few of them survive this mysterious period to become adults. Most hatchlings are eaten by birds or even other reptiles before they have a chance to reach the water. When the lights of a city are visible from a hatching site, Leatherback hatchlings are attracted to the lights and away from the sea. Many of these hatchlings are struck by traffic or otherwise perish.<br><br>Atlantic Leatherback Turtles nest between February and July from Georgia in the United States to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.<br><br><strong>Range and Habitat</strong><br><br>In the summer months, Atlantic Leatherback turtles are most common from the Gulf of Maine in the north to the coast of central Florida in the south. They have also been sighted as far north as the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada. Pacific Leatherback turtles are most often seen off the Hawaiian Islands, where they are known to congregate north of the archipelago.<br><br>The turtles prefer deep water but are most often spotted within sight of land. In the summer they are frequently seen basking near the surface, particularly in the Long Island Sound, where they have been injured by collisions with boat propellers.<br><br><strong>Threats and Conservation</strong><br><br>In the United States the Leatherback turtle has been classified as endangered across its range since 1970. It is also listed on Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). This makes it illegal to harm or kill the turtles.<br><br>Adult Leatherback turtles are large animals that are not particularly vulnerable to natural predators. Eggs and hatchlings are most vulnerable to predation of all kinds. Birds, dogs, or other opportunists are known to dig up nests and consume eggs. New hatchlings are also vulnerable on their journey from nest to sea. Once they enter the water they become prey to many new predators and very few survive to adulthood.<br><br>Human activity endangers Leatherback turtles in many ways. Though it is forbidden, eggs are harvested by people in Puerto Rico, the surrounding islands, and possibly in other places. Development of beaches can disturb or destroy the particular kind of habitat that Leatherbacks need to nest, and the lights of development can cause hatchlings to move away from the sea rather than toward it. Human use of beaches can crush nests and hatchlings or bury eggs too deep for the hatchlings to emerge. Finally humans may disturb nesting females out of curiosity.<br><br>While adults are at sea their major threats are all from humans. Ingesting plastic, rubber, tar, oil, and other synthetic materials can kill an adult Leatherback or severly injure it. Many have been injured by colliding with boats, especially in shallow water. The equipment associated with commercial fishing, including lines, nets, ropes, and cables can entangle adult turtles and cause them to drown. Though "Turtle Exclusion Devices" are mandated on nets, they often fail to allow an animal the size of an adult Leatherback to escape. The NOAA estimates that about 640 adult Leatherback turtles are killed each year by commercial fishing enterprise.<br><br>Nets are purposely set for other kinds of sea turtles in some areas of Puerto Rico. Though they are not intended for Leatherbacks, some are occasionally caught. Despite its illegality, the practice continues.<br><br>Conservation status: Critical<br><br>Issue #104</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Siamese fighting fish</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Siamese fighting fish</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Betta splendens</span>) is one of the most popular species of freshwater aquarium fish. It is a member of the gourami family (family Osphronemidae) of order Perciformes, but was formerly classified among the Anabantidae. It is native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/Betta_splendens.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1e/Betta_splendens.jpg/250px-Betta_splendens.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Siamese fighting fish</strong>, Betta splendens</span><br><br>The natural colouration of <span style="font-style: italic;">B. splendens</span> is a dull green and brown, and the fins of wild specimens are relatively short; brilliantly-coloured and longer-finned varieties have, however, been developed by breeders (see In the aquarium, below.)<br><br>In the wild, the Siamese fighting fish inhabits standing or slow-moving water, including floodplains and rice paddys, at temperatures of 24Â–30Â°C (75Â–86Â°F). Carnivorous, it feeds on zooplankton and mosquito and other insect larvae.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">B. splendens</span> grows to an overall length of approximately 6 cm (2.5 in), and has a life span of up to two years.<br><br>The Siamese fighting fish is often called simply (if imprecisely) by its generic name, which is then treated as a common name ("betta"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>).<br><br><strong>Behaviour</strong><br><br>Both instinctive and learned behaviours of <span style="font-style: italic;">B. splendens</span> have been studied in considerable detail. Its characteristic aggressive responses are readily elicited by its own reflection in a mirror placed outside an aquarium. The capacity to turn aggressive behaviour on and off in this way, without putting the subject at the risk of physical damage inherent in staging an actual aggressive conflict, made the fish a popular subject of study by ethologists and comparative psychologists interested in studying aggression. There was a stream of research on the fish's aggressive behaviour from the 1970s, though this has reduced lately, partly because of new approaches to studying aggression arising out of sociobiology, and partly because it was realised that, even if no tissue damage was done, repeatedly eliciting aggressive responses in the fish might be a source of stress. Interesting results were obtained, however; for example was shown that the presentation of such an aggression-eliciting stimulus will act as an unconditional stimulus in classical conditioning, and as a reinforcer in operant conditioning. It is as if the fish finds the opportunity to attack another fish rewarding.<br><br><strong>In the aquarium</strong><br><br>Because of its beautiful colours and fin shapes, the Siamese fighting fish is popular with aquarists. In Asian countries they have long been used in a sport similar to cockfighting, where it was necessary to have aggressive short-finned fish. But today, by selective breeding, it is not uncommon to see males with an array of colors and tails. <span style="font-style: italic;">B. splendens</span> specimens are bred for tail shapes ranging from the common veil-tail to the much-desired 180Â° "half-moon" tails, while still showing a stunning array of colors: marbled, Cambodian, butterfly, and chocolate are just a few examples.<br><br><a href="http://www.fishbase.org/images/species/Bespl_m0.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.fishbase.org/images/thumbnails/jpg/tn_Bespl_m0.jpg"></a><br><br>To keep an individual <span style="font-style: italic;">B. splendens</span>, a minimum tank size of 4 Litres (1 gallon) is recommended, if it will be kept in a warm room. A larger tank of 22 Litres (5 gallons) will allow use of a heater, to maintain a temperature of about 27Â°C (81Â°F). The floor of the tank should have, as a minimum, a thin (5 mm or 0.25 in) layer of gravel to increase the surface area for nitrifying bacteria to colonize. Decorations can provide hiding places, especially important when two males are housed in a divided tank, or when the betta is living in a community tank. Every decoration must be free of rough areas or sharp points which can damage the delicate fins of the bettaÂ—for this reason, silk rather than plastic plants are recommended. Live plants will improve the water quality.<br><br>In Canada and the United States, the Siamese fighting fish is sometimes sold in a vase with a plant, with the erroneous claim that the fish can feed on the roots of the plant. <span style="font-style: italic;">Betta</span> species are carnivorous, though, and an appropriate food must be provided, such as dry "betta pellets" or live or frozen bloodworms or brine shrimp. When kept in a small container such as a vase, the fish need frequent water changes, and the container must be kept in a warm room. A larger tank with a heater will provide better living conditions. Wherever the fish is kept, water must be treated with an appropriate water conditioner before use.<br><br><a href="http://www.fishbase.org/images/species/Bespl_u7.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.fishbase.org/images/thumbnails/jpg/tn_Bespl_u7.jpg"></a><br><br>Because of the aggressive nature of this species, tankmates must be chosen carefully, and two male <span style="font-style: italic;">B. splendens</span> should not be housed in the same tank unless they are separated by a dividing wall. Females may or may not be able to coexist peacefully in the same tank depending on their temperaments. Before co-housing Siamese fighting fish with other species, their compatibility should be carefully researched, and the owner should have a back-up plan if the shared tank does not work.<br><br>Issue #106</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Basenji</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Basenji</strong> is a breed of dog and a member of the sighthound family. The Basenji is a Congolese hunting dog that has no bark, but an odd yodelling sound. Recent DNA analysis confirms that this is one of the oldest breeds of dog. It was officially accepted into the AKC in 1943.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Basenji_600.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Basenji_600.jpg/250px-Basenji_600.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Basenji</strong></span><br><br><strong>Appearance</strong><br><br>Basenjis are small, elegant-looking, short-haired dogs with erect ears, tightly curled tail, and graceful neck. Some people equate their appearance to that of a miniature deer. Their forehead is wrinkled, especially when young. Eyes are typically almond shaped, which gives the appearance of squinting with a serious look. It is not uncommon for a Basenji to stare down a person, which gives some people an unsettling feeling. The stare is not meant as an aggressive act; Basenjis feel that they are of equal stature with humans and are not intimidated by a human's interest in them.<br><br>Basenjis typically weigh around 20 to 24 pounds (9 to 11 kg) and stand about 17 inches (43 cm) tall at the withers. They are an athletic dog, and are deceptively powerful for their size. They have a graceful, confident gait like a trotting horse, and skim the ground in a "double-suspension gallop" when running flat out at their considerable top speed.<br><br>The AKC recognizes the following colorations: red/white, black/white, tricolor (red/black/white), and brindle (black stripes on a background of red)/white. There are additional variations, such as the "trindle", which is a tricolor and brindle, and several other colorations that remain in the Congo.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/Congo1.jpg/800px-Congo1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/Congo1.jpg/250px-Congo1.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Tri-colored brindle (Trindle) Basenji at a hunt</span><br><br><strong>Temperament</strong><br><br>Most Basenjis have a strong dislike for contact with water, and will go to great, and sometimes amusing, lengths to avoid getting wet. On the other hand, they are extremely curious dogs, and can temporarily be completely oblivious to the pouring rain if something piques their interest. They are highly intelligent and learn quickly, but they also have a cat-like independence and "self-motivation<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>" which can make them somewhat casual about obedience. A healthy Basenji is a mischievous and good-humored animal, and is not above testing the limits of its environment and owner just for sport. They can be aloof with strangers but form strong bonds with their owners. If not supervised or trained properly, Basenjis can become bored and destructive when left alone. Extremely quick and fast on its feet, the Basenji loves to run and chase, so much so that they are sometimes competitively raced in lure courses. There are few creatures the Basenji is likely to encounter (including its owner!) that it does not believe it can either outwit or outrun. This, combined with a virtually fearless approach to the world, make it a good idea not to allow a Basenji to run free in an unconfined area or where it may get into trouble. Basenjis can be very good with children if raised around them, but may not have much patience for them otherwise.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The Basenji is one of the most ancient breeds of dog. Originating on the continent of Africa, it has been venerated by humans for thousands of years. Basenjis can be seen on stele in the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs, sitting at the feet of their masters, looking just as they do today, with prick ears and tightly curled tail.<br><br>The Basenji had all but disappeared from civilization when it was rediscovered in the Congo region of Africa in 1895. There, the Basenji was highly prized by natives for its intelligence, courage, speed, and silence. They were invaluable assistants to the hunt, chasing wild game into nets for their masters. The Azande and Mangbetu tribes from the northeastern Congo region describe Basenjis, in the trade language of Lingala, as "embwa na bwasenji". Translated, this means "dogs from when we were wild" or "dogs from long ago".<br><br>Several attempts were made to bring the breed to England, but the earliest imports succumbed to disease. It was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in England, and thence to the United States. So it is that nearly all the Basenjis in the western world are descended from these original imports. For a fascinating account of the importation of the Basenji from Africa, read <a href="http://www.basenji.org/african/jone8908.htm" rel="nofollow">The History of the Breed</a>, a letter to the AKC in support of opening the stud book to admit new African imports.<br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>Some Basenjis are prone to <a href="http://www.basenji.org/healthfanconi.htm" rel="nofollow">Fanconi syndrome</a>. Basenjis, along with certain other breeds of dog have been known to be carriers of a simple recessive gene which, when expressed, immediately causes <a href="http://www.basenji.org/healthha.htm" rel="nofollow">Hemolytic Anemia</a>.
