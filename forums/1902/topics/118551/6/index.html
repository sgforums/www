The insects are killed by either immersion in hot water or by exposure to sunlight, steam, or the heat of an oven. The variety in the appearance of commercial cochineal is caused by these differing methods. It takes around 70,000 insects to make one pound of cochineal. The coloring comes from carminic acid.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History</span><br><br>The cochineal was used by the Aztecs. After the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors, it was introduced to Europe during the 17th century. The Mexican city of Oaxaca, Oaxaca, and its hinterland owed much of its prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries to the cochineal trade. It has since been imported to and cultivated in other locations, such as Peru and the Canary Islands, where it became a lucrative export.<br><br>In the course of the 20th century, trade in cochineal diminished, as it was replaced by synthetic compounds. In recent years it has become commercially valuable again, because unlike many commercial synthetic red dyes, it is non-toxic and not carcinogenic (this is a point of controversy - see section below).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Usage</span><br><br>Traditionally cochineal was used for coloring fabrics. Now it is used as a fabric and cosmetics dye and as a natural food coloring, as well as for oil paints and watercolours.

Additional introductions in Florida, supposedly purposeful releases, were made by fish farmers in the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County in late 1967 or early 1968, after the state banned the importation and possession of walking catfish. Aquarium releases likely are responsible for introductions in other states.

Historical habitats included forests, swamps and coastal prairies.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Redwolf-tn.jpg/401px-Redwolf-tn.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Redwolf-tn.jpg/200px-Redwolf-tn.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Red Wolf</strong>, Canis rufus</span><br><br>Traditionally, three subspecies of Red Wolf have been recognised, two of which are extinct. <span style="font-style: italic;">Canis rufus floridanus</span> has been extinct since 1930; <span style="font-style: italic;">Canis rufus rufus</span> was declared extinct by 1970; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Canis rufus gregoryi</span>, the surviving subspecies, became extinct in the wild by 1980.<br><br><strong>Anatomy</strong><br><br>The Red Wolf is a medium-sized canid, smaller and more slender than the Grey Wolf but larger than the coyote. Adult males weigh between 25-35 kilograms (60-80 lbs) while females are generally two-thirds this range. Their coats may take a variety of colours: black, brown and grey through cinnamon and yellow. The reddish coats for which they are named was typical of some Texan populations. In the wild average life spans are estimated as low as four years; in captivity this rises as high as fourteen years.<br><br><strong>Habits and Social Structure</strong><br><br>Red wolves are shy and wary creatures. They prefer to hunt alone or in small family groups; pack sizes are smaller than those of their grey cousins, consisting often of one adult pair and their offspring.<br><br>As in other canids pair-bonding is strong and red wolves mate for life. They mate yearly and two or three pups are usually born in the Spring. Both parents help raise the offspring who are mature enough to leave behind parental support at six months of age.<br><br>Their diet consists of any available small animal, including rabbits, raccoons and rodents. They occasionally bring down deer and supplement their diet with insects and berries.<br><br><strong>Taxonomy</strong><br><br>The taxonomic status of the Red Wolf has long been controversial: the traditional view is that it is indeed a distinct species. An alternative view is that the Red Wolf is simply a recent hybrid between the Grey Wolf and the Coyote. In this view, Red Wolves arose when habitat loss and human disruption caused remnant Grey Wolf and Coyote populations to interbreed.<br><br>Extensive studies have thrown much light but little clarity on the question. On the whole, morphological, behavioural, and genetic evidence supports the view that there has been a distinct Red Wolf population for over half a million years, but much confusion and not a little controversy remains. There seems little doubt that there has been considerable hybridisation between Red Wolves, Grey Wolves, and Coyotes, and that in recent years the Red Wolf has declined and been replaced over most of its range by Coyotes and Coyote-Red Wolf hybrids.<br><br>In 1999, Brad White of McMaster University and Paul Wilson of Trent University found evidence suggesting that the wolves of south-eastern Canada (previously assumed to be Grey Wolves) were in fact Red Wolves, a view which has since found support in both fossil and morphological evidence. The Eastern Canadian Wolf, as this population has been named, ranges from Minnesota to Quebec.<br><br>One recent theory suggests that Red Wolves, Grey Wolves and Coyotes are all descended from a common ancestor population in North America between one and two million years ago. According to this theory, the ancestors of the Grey Wolf migrated to Europe and Asia at that time, becoming the Grey Wolf as we know it today, and then returned to the Americas about 300,000 years ago. At around the same time (300,000 years ago) the Coyote and Red Wolf populations diverged and began to differentiate. The modern Eastern Canadian Wolf population, in this view, is a mixture of different blood lines, including pure Grey Wolves, pure Red Wolves, and hybrids between Red Wolves and Coyotes, and Red Wolves and Grey Wolves. Grey Wolves and Coyotes do not hybridise directly.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Redwolf.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Redwolf.jpg/250px-Redwolf.jpg"></a><br><br>The upshot of the taxonomic debate is not simply a matter of accurate classification: although the actual patterns of evolution are complex and subtle, human classification schemes usually rely on relatively simple, hard-edged divisions, such as the concept of species, which is ill-adapted to describing the wolves of North America. It remains a crucial concept, however, as many environmental policy decisions revolve around the species concept. In law, a distinct "species" is much better protected than a "mere subspecies".<br><br>Conservation status: Critical<br><br>Issue #118</div>

Highly commercial food fish which are farmed in their native Southeast Asia, kissing gouramis are also popular with aquarists for the fish's peculiar "kissing" behaviour.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Helostoma_temminckii.jpg/800px-Helostoma_temminckii.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Helostoma_temminckii.jpg/220px-Helostoma_temminckii.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Pink <strong>Kissing gourami</strong>, Helostoma temminckii, rasping algae from gravel</span><br><br><strong>Physical description</strong><br><br>Typical of gouramis, the body is deep and strongly compressed laterally. The long-based dorsal (16Â–18 spinous rays, 13Â–16 soft) and anal fins (13Â–15 spinous rays, 17Â–19 soft) mirror each other in length and frame the body; the posterior most soft rays of each are slightly elongated to create a trailing margin. The foremost rays of the jugular pelvic fins are also slightly elongated. The pectoral fins are large, rounded, and low-slung. The caudal fin is rounded to concave. The lateral line is divided in two, with the posterior portion starting below the end of the other; there are a total of 43Â–48 scales running the line's length.<br><br>The most distinctive feature of the kissing gourami is its mouth. Other than being terminal rather than superior (as in other gourami families), the kissing gourami's mouth is highly protrusible; as its family name suggests, the lips are lined with horny teeth. However, teeth are absent from the premaxilla, dentaries, palatine, and pharynx. The gill rakers are also well-developed and numerous. The eye-visible scales of the body are ctenoid, whereas the scales of the top of the head are cycloid. Kissing gouramis reach a maximum size of 30 cm (12 inches) total length. There is no outward sexual dimorphism, but females are characteritically fatter.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Helostoma_temminckii2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Helostoma_temminckii2.jpg/220px-Helostoma_temminckii2.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This head-on view provides a close look at the kissing gourami's distinctive mouth structure.</span><br><br>There are two colour morphs encountered: the natural greens, which have lengthwise lateral stripes and opaque, dark brown fins; and the pseudo-albino pinks, which have a rose to orangy pink body and silvery scales, with transparent pinkish fins. There is also a "dwarf" or "balloon pink" variety, which is a mutated strain of the pink gouramis that are offered to hobbyists. The "balloons" are named so for their smaller and rounder bodies.<br><br><strong>In the wild</strong><br><br>Shallow, slow-moving, and thickly vegetated backwaters are the kissing gourami's natural habitat. They are midwater omnivores that feed primarily on benthic algae and aquatic plants, with insects taken from the surface and zooplankton and phytoplankton filtered through their many gill rakers supplementing their diet. The fish use their toothed lips to rasp algae from stones and other surfaces. This rasping action, which (to humans) looks superficially like kissing, is also used by males to challenge the dominancy of conspecifics.<br><br>Spawning occurs from May to October in Thailand. Kissing gouramis are open-water egg scatterers; spawning is initiated by the female and takes place under cover of floating vegetation. The eggs, which the adults do not guard, are spherical, smooth, and buoyant. Initial development is rapid: the eggs hatch after one day, and the fry are free-swimming two days thereafter. The Kissing gourami is the only member of the suborder Anabantoidei not to build a nest or otherwise care for its young.<br><br><strong>In the aquarium</strong><br><br>Kissing gouramis need a roomy tank in order to thrive; small juveniles will quickly outgrow a 70 cm (27 inch) tank. Kissing gouramis are tolerant toward conspecifics and heterospecifics of similar size, although male kissers will occasionally challenge each other; however, the "kissing" is never fatal. To prevent digging and to present enough surface area for algae growth, the substrate should consist of large-diameter gravel and stones. The aquarium's back glass should not be cleaned during regular maintenance, as the gouramis will feed on the algae grown there. Most plants will not survive the fish's grazing, so inedible plants such as Java fern, Java moss, or plastic plants are recommended.<br><br>The fish will accept vegetables such as cooked lettuce and any kind of live food. Water hardness should be between 5Â–30Â°dGH and pH between 6.8Â–8.5; the temperature should be between 22Â–28Â°C (72Â–82Â°F). When breeding kissing gouramis, soft water is preferred. As the fish do not build a nest, lettuce leaves placed on the water surface serve as a spawning medium. The lettuce will eventually host bacteria and infusoria which the fry will feed upon.<br><br>Issue #122</div>

The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1994 and set the current standard for the breed. The United Kennel Club had recognized the breed long before 1994, and there is no difference between the two breed standards.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/American_Eskimo_Dog.jpg/765px-American_Eskimo_Dog.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/American_Eskimo_Dog.jpg/250px-American_Eskimo_Dog.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>American Eskimo Dog</strong></span><br><br><strong>Appearance</strong><br><br>The standard for the American Eskimo Dog calls for them to be white, with brown eyes (blue eyes, such as those found on the Alaskan Malamute, are a disqualification and a sign of poor health or breeding), and a compact body. The dog's length should be only slightly greater than its height at the shoulder. The muzzle is long and lupine (in contrast to the muzzles of Pomeranians). The ears are held erect and alert, and the tail should be feathered and curled on the dog's back. These dogs look very much like smaller versions of the Samoyed, to which they are related, and come in three standard sizes. The toy is from 9 to 12 inches (23 to 30 cm) at the withers; the miniature is from 12 to 15 inches (33 to 38 cm); the standard is from fifteen inches up to and including nineteen inches (39 to 48 cm).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/American_Eskimo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9c/American_Eskimo.jpg/245px-American_Eskimo.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">American Eskimo braving wind and snow.</span><br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">American Eskimo Dog</span>, or "Eskie" as it is often called, is derived from the German Spitz, the Finnish Spitz, and almost certainly the Pomeranian and Keeshond.

Within its range it is most commonly referred to as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Black Oystercatcher</span>, although this name is also used locally for the Blackish Oystercatcher and the African Black Oystercatcher. Its scientific name is derived by John James Audubon from that of his friend John Bachman. The species is not considered threatened.<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br><br>The American Black Oystercatcher is a large entirely black shorebird, with a long (9 cm) bright red bill and pink legs. It has a bright yellow iris and a red eye-ring. Its plumage varies slightly from north to south, being darker further north.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br><br>The American Black Oystercatcher is restricted in its range, never straying far from shores, in particular favoring rocky shorelines. It forages in the intertidal zone, feeding on marine invertebrates, particularly molluscs such as mussels, limpets and chitons. It will also take crabs, isopods and barnacles. It hunts through the intertidal area, searching for food visually, often so close to the water's edge it has to fly up to avoid crashing surf. It uses its strong bill to dislodge food and pry shells open.<br><br>The American Black Oystercatcher is a territorial bird during the nesting season, defending a foraging and nesting area in one territory. Some pairs have been recorded staying together for many years. Nests are small bowls or depressions close to the shore in which small pebbles and shell fragments are tossed in with a sideward or backard flick of the bill.<br><br>Around 2 to 3 eggs are laid in this nest, these are hardy and can even survive being submerged by a high tide. The chicks are capable of leaving the nest after one day, and will stay in the territory for a long time after fledging (40 days). The fledged juveniles will stay in the territory until the next breeding season. If the parents migrate, that year's chicks will migrate with them; this happens more often in the north of the range.<br><br>Issue #127</div>

Within a day, the larvae (maggots) hatch from the eggs; they live and feed in (usually dead and decaying) organic material, such as garbage or feces. They are pale whitish and have no legs. After several molts, the maggots crawl to a dry cool place and transform into pupae, colored reddish or brown. The adult flies then emerge from the pupae. (This whole cycle is known as complete metamorphosis.) The adults live from half a month to a month. After having emerged from the pupae, the flies cease to grow. Small flies are not young flies but the result of little food during the maggot stage.<br><br>Some 36 hours after having emerged from the pupa, the female is receptive for mating. The male mounts her from the back to inject sperm. Normally the female mates only once, storing the sperm to use it repeatedly for several sets of eggs. Males are territorial: they defend a certain territory against other males and try to mount any female that enters.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/Houseflies.jpg/750px-Houseflies.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/Houseflies.jpg/200px-Houseflies.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Two copulating houseflies</span><br><br>The flies depend on warm temperatures; generally, the warmer the temperature the faster the flies will develop.

They spit out saliva on solid foods to pre-digest it, and then suck it back in. They also throw up partially digested matter and eat it again.<br><br>The flies can walk on vertical planes, and can even hang upside down from ceilings. This is accomplished with the surface tension of liquids secreted by glands near their feet.<br><br>Lacking eyelids, the flies continually clean their eyes with their forelegs. Most of their taste and smell sensor cells are on hairs on their legs, and that is why they also keep rubbing their legs together.<br><br><strong>Flies and humans</strong><br><br>Houseflies originated in Africa; it is quite possible that they entered America along with Christopher Columbus.<br><br>In colder climates, houseflies only occur together with humans. They have a tendency to aggregate and are difficult to dispel. They are capable of carrying over 100 pathogens, such as typhoid, cholera, Salmonella, bacillary dysentery, tuberculosis, anthrax ophthalmia, and parasitic worms.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Irish Elk</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Irish Elk</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Megaloceros giganteus</span>) is an extinct deer that lived in Europe during the Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene epochs. It is famous for its formidable size (about two meters at the shoulders), and in particular for having the largest antlers of any known cervid (a maximum of 13 feet from tip to tip). The name Â“<span style="font-style: italic;">giant deer</span>Â” is sometimes preferred; although large numbers of its skeletons have been found in Irish bogs, the animal was not exclusively Irish, and neither was it closely related to either of the living species currently called Â“elkÂ”.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e6/Irish_Elk.jpg/450px-Irish_Elk.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e6/Irish_Elk.jpg/250px-Irish_Elk.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Irish Elk</strong>, Megaloceros giganteus, skeleton at the National Museum of Natural History</span><br><br>The latest known remains of the Irish elk have been carbon dated to about 5700 BC.<br><br>The size of the Irish Elk's antlers is remarkable, and some evolutionists have felt that their purpose demands an explanation. One theory was that the Elk's antlers, under constant sexual selection, increased in size because males were using them in combat for access to females; it was also suggested that they eventually became so unwieldy that the Elks could not carry on the normal business of life and so became extinct. However, Stephen Jay Gould's important essay on <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaloceros</span> demonstrated that for deer in general, species with larger body size have antlers that are <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> than proportionately larger, a consequence of allometry, or differential growth rate of body size and antler size during development. In fact, Irish Elk had antlers of exactly the size one would predict from their body size and no special story of natural selection is required.<br><br>The antlers do seem to have played a role in the animal's eventual extinction, however. Recent research has determined that due to the high amounts of calcium and phosphate compounds required to form these massive structures, the Irish Elk males had to deplete these compounds partly from their bones, replenishing them from foodplants when the antlers were grown. Thus, in the growth phase, males were suffering from a condition similar to osteoporosis. When the climate changed at the end of the last Ice Age, the vegetation in the animal's habitat also changed towards species that could not deliver sufficient amounts of the required minerals. Thus, the delicate balance between the animal and its environment was brokenÂ—coupled with hunting by humans (facilitated by the weakening of the males' bones during antler growth), this was the probable cause of this animal's extinction.<br><br>A significant collection of Irish Elk skeletons can be found at the Natural History branch of the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct (5000 BC)<br><br>Issue #132</div>

All American Curls descend from her, the foundation female. In 1983, the first American Curl was exhibited at a cat show, and in 1987, the longhair American Curl was given championship status by The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1993, the American Curl set a precedent in the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) by being the first breed to be admitted to the Championship Class as one breed with two coat lengths.<br><br>The American Curl is a medium size cat with no health handicaps associated with the curled ears. They are strong, healthy cats remarkably free of genetic defects that affect many purebred cats. The American Curl may have either curled ears or straight ears. The American Curl may have three degrees of curl - first degree, second degree, or third degree. The third degree is the preferred one. The straight ear American Curl has all of the loving personality of the curled ear American Curl but may not be shown.<br><br>The American Curl comes in two coat lengths - either long haired or short haired.
