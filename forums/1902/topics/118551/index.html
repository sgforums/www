            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Kingdom Animalia</strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Animals</span></strong> are a major group of organisms, classified as the kingdom <strong>Animalia</strong>.<br><br>An animal is a multicellular organism that obtains energy by eating food. With over 2 million known species, and many more awaiting identification, animals are the most diverse forms of life on earth. They range in size from 30-m (100-ft) long whales to microscopic organisms only 0.05 mm (0.002 in) long. They live in a vast range of habitats, from deserts and Arctic tundra to the deep-sea floor. Animals are the only living things that have evolved nervous systems and sense organs that monitor their surroundings. They are also the only forms of life that show flexible patterns of behavior that can be shaped by past experience. The study of animals is known as zoology.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/Aphthona_flava_flea_beetle.jpg/410px-Aphthona_flava_flea_beetle.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f1/Aphthona_flava_flea_beetle.jpg/250px-Aphthona_flava_flea_beetle.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Aphthona flava flea beetle</span><br><br>Animals are multicellular organisms, a characteristic they share with plants and many fungi. But they differ from plants and fungi in several important ways. Foremost among these is the way they obtain energy. Plants obtain energy directly from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis, and they use this energy to build up organic matter from simple raw materials. Animals, on the other hand, eat other living things or their dead remains. They then digest this food to release the energy that it contains. Fungi also take in food, but instead of digesting it internally as animals do, they digest it before they absorb it.<br><br>Most animals start life as a single fertilized cell, which divides many times to produce the thousands or millions of cells needed to form a functioning body. During this process, groups of cells develop different characteristics and arrange themselves in tissues that carry out specialized functions. Epithelial tissue covers the body's inner and outer surfaces, while connective tissue binds it together and provides support. Nervous tissue conducts the signals that coordinate the body, and muscle tissueÂ–which makes up over two-thirds of the body mass of some animalsÂ–contracts to make the body move. This mobility, coupled with rapid responses to opportunities and hazards, is one feature that distinguishes animals from other forms of life.<br><br>Some kinds of animal movement, such as the slow progress of a limpet as it creeps across rocks, are so slow that they are almost imperceptible. Others, such as the attacking dive of a peregrine falcon or the leap of a flea, are so fast that they are difficult or even impossible to follow. Many single-celled organisms can move, but in absolute terms, animals are by far the fastest-moving living things on earth.<br><br>Animal life spans vary from less than 3 weeks in some insects to over a century in giant tortoises. Some animals, such as sponges, mollusks, fish, and snakes, show indeterminate growth, which means that they continue to grow throughout life. Most, however, reach a pre-defined size at maturity, at which point their physical growth stops.<br><br>Issue #1</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Beagle</strong></span><br><br>A <strong>Beagle</strong> is a medium-sized dog breed and a member of the hound group, similar in appearance to a Foxhound but smaller with shorter legs, and with longer, softer ears. It has a somewhat domed skull; a medium-length, square-cut muzzle; large, hound-like hazel or brown eyes; long, low-set ears, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips; a medium-length, strong neck without folds in the skin; a short, slightly curved tail; an overall muscular body; and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. They appear in a range of colors, not limited to the familiar tricolor (white with large black and light brown spots). The UK Kennel Club describes it as "a merry hound," and it is indeed a cheerful, energetic dog.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/Beagle_600.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Beagle_600.jpg/250px-Beagle_600.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A tri-colour <strong>Beagle</strong></span><br><br>The American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club recognize two separate varieties of Beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than 13 inches, and the 15-inch for those between 13 and 15 inches. The Kennel Club (UK) and FCI affiliated clubs recognise a single type, with a height of between 13 and 16 inches.<br><br>As well as making excellent (if difficult to train) pets, Beagles are used for hunting. Beagling has been referred to as "the poor person's foxhunting," as a Beagle pack (30-40 dogs) is followed on foot, not horseback. The usual quarry is the hare. Beagles are admired by some for the bloodcurdling "Beagle music" they emit when in full pursuit. Beagling, like foxhunting, is banned in England. Drag hunting is another Beagle sport.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/Beagle_resting.jpg/800px-Beagle_resting.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3d/Beagle_resting.jpg/200px-Beagle_resting.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Beagle taking a break.</span><br><br>Beagles (or their ancestors) appear to have been used for hare hunting in England as early as the reign of Edward III, who had a pack of up to 120 hare hounds with him on the battlefield during the Hundred Years' War. The first mention of the beagle in English literature by name dates from 1475. The origin of the word "beagle" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French begueule (meaning "open throat"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) or from an Old English, French, or Welsh term meaning "small."<br><br>Beagles have superb noses and, despite their self-willed temperament, are sometimes used as sniffer dogs for drug detection. More often, though, they are the breed of choice of the United States Department of Agriculture to detect food items in luggage being transported into the U.S. The force is called the Beagle Brigade and these dogs wear a green jacket. Beagles were chosen because they are small and easy to care for, and because they are not as intimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs. They are also used for this purpose by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in New Zealand.<br><br>Country of origin: United Kingdom<br><br>Issue #2</div>

Its classification is uncertain. It was formerly classified in the raccoon family (Procyonidae), but now many experts, including Wilson and Reeder, classify it as a member of the bear family (Ursidae) or in its own family the Ailuridae. It is native to the Himalayas and southern China. Fossil evidence suggests that it once also existed in North America.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/65/691px-Katzenb%E4r.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/260px-Katzenb%E4r.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Red Panda</strong></span><br><br>Its Western name is taken from a Himalayan language, possibly Nepalese, but its meaning is uncertain. One theory is that "panda" is an anglicisation of "poonya", which means "eater of bamboo". Its Chinese name means "little panda," named after the Giant Panda. Because of its distinctive cry, it is also commonly known as the Wah.<br><br>Like the Giant Panda, it eats large amounts of bamboo, but its diet also includes fruit, roots, acorns, and lichen, and captive Red Pandas readily eat meat. Red Pandas are excellent climbers, and forage largely in trees. Since the Red Panda mainly eats bamboo, it has a low-calorie diet which causes it to not do much more than eat and sleep.<br><br>The red panda has a digestive system more suited to a carnivorous diet, and cannot digest cellulose, meaning that it must eat a great deal of bamboo to survive. Red pandas are known to supplement their diet with young birds, eggs, small rodents and insects on occasion.<br><br>The Red panda has semi-retractile claws and a "false thumb", really an extension of the wrist bone. Thick fur on the soles of the feet offers protection from cold, and also hides scent glands.<br><br>Adults are largely solitary and mainly nocturnal. Females give birth to litters of one to four young (most often two) between mid-May and mid-July. The young are born fully-furred, but blind and helpless, and are weaned at five months of age. Sexual maturity occurs at age 18Â–20 months.<br><br>The species is endangered, largely because of habitat loss, though there is also some illegal hunting. Red Pandas are often killed for their coats to make fur hats and clothes. Also, because of the growing population in China, their habitats are knocked down in order to build houses. Approximately 10,000 pandas die per year, and approximately 7,000 of the 10,000 die from deforestation.<br><br>There are two subspecies of red panda: <span style="font-style: italic;">Ailurus fulgens fulgens</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ailurus fulgens styani</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">A.f. fulgens</span> is a little smaller and its facial fur is much lighter; its range covers Nepal, Tibet, the Indian states of Assam and Sikkim, Bhutan and China. <span style="font-style: italic;">A.f. styani</span> has more pronounced facial markings; it is restricted to northern Myanmar and some areas of China. The red panda depicted in the photo above seems to be <span style="font-style: italic;">A.f. fulgens</span>. The red panda is the state animal of Sikkim.<br><br><strong>Firefox</strong><br><br>The Chinese name <span style="font-style: italic;">huo hu</span>, which literally translates as 'fire fox', can refer to the red fox or sometimes to the red panda. However, the name normally used for the Red Panda is <span style="font-style: italic;">xiao xiong mao</span> (literally `little bear cat').<br><br>The term, firefox, to describe the Red Panda has been propagated by its use in the web browser, Mozilla Firefox, although the logo of Firefox is a fox with its tail on fire as opposed to a red panda.<br><br><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/upload/thumb/c/ce/800px-Red_Panda.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/upload/thumb/6/66/300px-Red_Panda.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A Red Panda at the Munich zoo.</span><br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #3</div>

Its unique size, color, and markings make the Hyacinth Macaw one of the most popular species of macaw among bird lovers and caretakers. Just like the Green-winged Macaw, the Hyacinth Macaw is considered more docile than other members of the macaw family, making it a popular pet.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/47/Hyacinthmacaw.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/47/Hyacinthmacaw.jpg/250px-Hyacinthmacaw.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Hyacinth Macaw</strong> (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus)</span><br><br>These birds grow to a total length of 42" and can weigh over 4 lbs. Wingspan is around 4 ft. They have a beak pressure that can easily disassemble the bars of a welded wrought iron cage in a short time. This powerful beak is ideal for its favorite foods, which include hard nuts and seeds that would otherwise be inaccessible to it. In addition, they eat fruits and other vegetable matter. There are eight species of palm that are central to its diet. They are generally messy eaters.<br><br>The Hyacinth Macaw has a solid blue/purple body of feathers, similar to the color of a blueberry. It has a solid black beak with bright yellow along the sides of the lower part of the beak and circling its solid dark eyes. Unlike other breeds of macaw, it does not have a white patch of featherless skin around the eye. The female and male are nearly indistinguishable, although the female is typically a bit more slender.<br><br>These birds nest in preexisting holes in trees. The clutch size is two or three eggs, although usually only one fledgling survives. Juveniles stay with their parents until they are six months old. They are mature and begin breeding at seven years.<br><br>The Hyacinth Macaw survives today in three known distinct populations in South America: southern Brazil, eastern Bolivia and northeastern Paraguay. It is possible that smaller, fragmented populations occur in other areas of its range. Its habitat includes riverside tropical rain forests and palm swamps.<br><br>Bird experts often advise those interested in obtaining a macaw as a pet to educate themselves extensively about these birds prior to obtaining one, as these animals require more attention than a dog or cat and they are not considered domesticated animals by the official definition. Also, one should consider the bird's endangered status before choosing to own one, as trade in these birds is illegal.<br><br>The Hyacinth Macaw is considered an endangered species due to overcollection for the cage bird trade and by the use of their feathers by the Kayapo Indians of Gorotire in southern Brazil. These Indians use the feathers to make headdresses and other baubles for the tourist trade. Like so many other species, their habitat is also being reduced by development.<br><br><img src="http://www.earlham.edu/~chickha/hyacinth/ara_giacinto.jpg"><img src="http://www.earlham.edu/~chickha/hyacinth/hyacinthpreen.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.earlham.edu/~chickha/hyacinth/hyacinth_macaw1.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.earlham.edu/~chickha/hyacinth/hyacinth2.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.earlham.edu/~chickha/hyacinth/hcliffs.jpg"><br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #4</div>

The green base color is marked with stripes and spots of yellow, brown, and blue. Non breeding females and juvinile chameleons are generally a uniform green color with some white markings. Breeding and gravid females are a very dark green with blue and yellow spots. The prominence of these markings is dependent on several factors including health, mood, and temperature of the lizard.<br><br>This species is sexually dimorphic, meaning it is possible to tell the gender of an individual by looking at physical traits. Aside from the previously mentioned color differences, adult male veiled chameleons are large animals. It is possible for them to reach an over all length of 24 inches. Most specimens usually reach between 14 to 18 inches. Females are smaller with the average over all length being just under 12 inches. Males and females both have a decorative growth called a "casque" on their heads. The casque of a male chameleon is much taller than the female's. Males also have a spur on each hind leg that the females do not have.<br><br>Like most chameleons, veiled chameleons are specialized tree dwellers. They have a flattened body meant to mimic a leaf and feet specially designed for grasping limbs and branches. They have a prehensile tail that acts as a fifth appendage and aids in climbing. Their eyes work ingependently of one another allowing the chameleon to look infront of and behind itself at the same time. They have a long sticky tongue that they use to capture their insect prey. Veiled chameleons are ambush predators and are capable of lying still for very long periods of time waiting for an unsuspecting locust to wander by.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/C_Calyptratus_male.jpg/800px-C_Calyptratus_male.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/C_Calyptratus_male.jpg/150px-C_Calyptratus_male.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A young adult male veiled chameleon, with a characteristically masculine casque.

While their main diet consists of insects, they will occasionally consume the leaves and blossoms of various plants. This is especially true in times of drought when water is scarce. Like all chameleons, veiled chameleons prefer to drink water that is in drops. They do not always recognize standing water and may dehydrate if that is their only source.<br><br>Female veiled chameleons can produce up to 3 clutches of eggs a year. Each clutch may contain 20-70 eggs. The eggs usually take 6-9 months to hatch.<br><br>Issue #5</div>

They have distinctive 'fern-like' gill structures that are not covered (as are gills in fish and in frog tadpoles) - usually 3 stalks on each side of the head; axolotls also breathe through the skin and possess lungs. In colour they range from albino or white (leucistic) to black, through greys, tans and browns. Wild axolotls are rarely white, though all leucistic (white with black eyes) axolotls are decended from a single mutant male brought to Paris in 1863 in a shipment to the Jardin des Plantes in the city. The true albino mutant common in labs and pet stores was created in an American laboratory in the 1950s. No axolotls commercially available today are wild caught (since doing so is strictly forbidden), the majority being descended from these same research specimens, even in the pet trade.<br><br>The axolotl is carnivorous, consuming small prey such as worms, insects, and small fish in the wild. In captivity, they can be fed a variety of readily available foods, including trout and salmon pellets, frozen or live bloodworms, earthworms, and waxworms on occasion. Beef Heart is sometimes recommended, but is not a good choice for the animal as mammal proteins are not readily digestible. Small juveniles can be fed with Daphnia or brine shrimp until old enough for the larger foodstuffs. Axolotls locate food by smell, and will "snap" at any potential meal, sucking the food into their stomachs with vacuum force. This is why other animals may not be housed with axolotls (excluding adults with adults) as anything smaller will invariably end up in their mouths - even siblings. Fish can also nibble an axolotl's gill stalks and appendages while it is asleep, leading to infection.<br><br>Axolotls live at temperatures of 14-20 C (54-68 F). Lower temperatures slow down their metabolism, although temperatures around 10 C (50 F) are a panacea when it comes to treating disease. Higher temperatures can lead to stress and increased appetite. In the wild, the water temperature in Xochimilco rarely rises above 20Â°C (68Â°F), though it may fall to 6 or 7Â°C (43Â°F) in the winter, and perhaps lower. Tapwater should be treated with a dechlorinator before the animal is introduced into it, as chlorine is harmful. A single typical axolotl should be kept in a normal 10 US gallon tank with around 150 mm (6 inches) of water. A full tank without a lid can lead to the animal "jumping ship" as it were. A power filter or underwater filter run by an airpump can be used, though water flow should be kept to a minimum to avoid stressing the animal. A 20% water change should be done every week, with debris being siphoned from the bottom. Small gravel should be avoided, as the axolotl can mistakenly injest the rocks, leading to stress and gas. Floating plants should be provided for juveniles as a hiding place, and small caves should likewise be provided for adults. No light is necessary as axolotls are nocturnal. Axolotl's will spend a majority of the time on the bottom of the tank (floating is a sign of stress and illness), so design accordingly.<br><br>Axolotls are very closely related to Tiger Salamanders (<span style="font-style: italic;">Ambystoma tigrinum</span>). Some axolotls can metamorphose, although they do so rarely, and usually have to be treated with iodine or shots of thyroxine hormone to achieve the full transformation. The loss of the ability to produce the hormones on their own is what results in the animal's neotenic existence. Metamorphosis also dramatically shortens the axolotl's lifespan, assuming they even survive the process. A neotenic axolotl will live an average of 10-15 years (though an individual in Paris is credited with achieving 25 years), while a metamophosed speciman will scarcely live past the age of 5.<br><br>Native to Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco in central Mexico, they also live in "axalapascos" (volcanic craters filled with water, maare). The wild population has been put under heavy pressure by the growth of Mexico City. Axolotls are also sold as food in Mexican markets, and were a staple in the Aztec diet. It is currently listed by CITES as an endangered species. In the Spanish language it is called the ajolote.<br><br>The axolotl is used in research and large numbers are bred in captivity. The feature of the salamander that attracts most attention is its healing ability: the axolotl does not heal by scarring and is capable of the regeneration of entire lost appendages in a period of months, and, in certain cases, more vital structures. Some have indeed been found restoring the less vital parts of their brains. They can also readily accept transplants from other individuals, including eyes and parts of the brain - restoring these alien organs to full fuctionality. In metamorphosed individuals, however, this ability is greatly diminished. Another attractive feature, for research, is the large and robust embryos. Axolotls are especially easy to breed compared to other salamanders in their family, which are almost never captive bred.<br><br>The name is from the Aztec Nahuatl language, from "atl" meaning water, and "xolotl" meaning dog. It also derives its name from the Aztec God of Death Xolotl, who - according to myth - assumed the amphibian's form in an effort to escape exile, and was killed while such.<br><br>Pop cultural reference: The word "axolotl" is used frequently in crossword puzzles. It was often used in the early years of Mad Magazine as a running joke.<br><br>Axolotl tanks are frequently mentioned in Frank Herbert's Dune series of books.<br><br>Conservation status: Vulnerable<br><br>Issue #6</div>

They make massive southward migrations from August through October. A northward migration takes place in the spring. Female Monarch butterflies deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations. The population east of the Rocky Mountains overwinters in MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico, and the western population overwinters in various sites in central coastal California, notably in Pacific Grove and Santa Cruz. The length of these journeys far exceeds the lifetime of any given butterfly. How the species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several generations remains a mystery. This is one of the few insects to manage transatlantic crossings. A few Monarchs turn up in the far southwest of Great Britain in any year when the wind conditions are right.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/Monarchbutterfly04.jpg"><br><br>The life cycle of a Monarch butterfly includes a change of form called complete metamorphosis. This process goes through four radically different stages. First, as mentioned above, the eggs are laid by the females during migration. Second, the eggs hatch, revealing worm-like larva, the caterpillars. The caterpillars consume their egg cases, then feed on milkweed, and sequester substances called cardenolides, related to the cardiac glycoside digitalis. The amount accumulated depends on the level present in the milkweed. This accumulation makes the adult butterfly distasteful and poisonous to Blue Jays and other would-be predators, and many such animals avoid consuming it. This defense is shared by the similarly distasteful (and similar-appearing) viceroy, in an example of Mullerian mimicry.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/Monarch_flock.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/Monarch_flock.jpg/125px-Monarch_flock.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Monarchs swarm in Santa Cruz, California during winter.</span><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Monarch_Butterfly_egg.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Monarch egg on milkweed.</span><br><br>During the caterpillar stage, Monarchs store energy in the form of fat and nutrients to carry them through the non-feeding pupa stage. The third stage is the pupa, or chrysalis. The caterpillar attaches itself to a lump of material secreted on a twig or leaf. It hangs upside down in the shape of a 'J', and then molts, leaving itself encased in an articulated green exoskeleton. At this point, hormonal changes occur, leading to the development of a butterfly. Fourth, the mature butterfly emerges after about two weeks.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cd/Monarchrsh3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/Monarchrsh3.jpg/175px-Monarchrsh3.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Monarch caterpillar</span><br><br>The monarch butterfly is the state insect of Texas and the state butterfly of Minnesota.

The shark has a capacious mouth, which can be up to 1.5 m wide and contain up to 300 rows of tiny teeth, and as part of its feeding process, it also has five large pairs of gill arches. The head is, naturally, wide and also flat with the small eyes towards the front of the snout. The body is mostly grey with a white belly, but three prominent ridges run along each side and the skin is marked with a 'checkerboard' of pale yellow spots and stripes.

It is currently classified as the only member of its genus and of the family Tarsipedidae, but many authorities believe that it is sufficiently distinct to be more properly raised to a separate superfamily within the Diprotodontia, or perhaps even further.<br><br>It is one of the very few entirely nectarivoruos mammals; it has a long, pointed snout and a long, protusible tongue with a brush tip like a honeyeater or a hummingbird. It is thought to be the sole survivor of an otherwise long-extinct marsupial group. Although restricted to a fairly small range in the southwest of Western Australia, it is locally common and does not seem to be threatened with extinction so long as its habitat remains intact and diverse. (Floral diversity is particularly important for the Honey Possum as it cannot survive without a year-round supply of nectar, and unlike nectarivorous birds, it cannot easily travel long distances in search of fresh supplies.)<br><br>The Honey Possum is mainly nocturnal but will come out to feed during daylight in cooler weather. Generally, though, it spends the days asleep in a shelter of convenience: a rock cranny, a tree cavity, the hollow inside of a grass tree, or an abandoned bird nest. When food is scarce or in cold weather, it becomes torpid to conserve energy.<br><br>Conservation status: Lower Risk<br><br>Issue #12</div>

They prefer deciduous forests, as they like to hide in the fallen leaves, but also at mossy tree trunks. They need clean small brooks in their habitat for the development of the larvae.<br><br>Fire salamanders are active in the evening and the night, but on rainy days they are active in daytime as well. Their diet consists of various insects, spiders, earthworms and slugs.<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>Males and females look much alike except during the the breeding season, when the most conspicuous difference is a swollen gland around the male's vent. This gland produces the spermatophore, which carries a sperm packet at its tip. The courtship happens on land. After the male becomes aware of a potential mate, he captures her and blocks her paths. The male now deposits his spermatophore on the ground. Reproduction occurs by means of this spermatophore, which will be taken up by the female salamander.<br><br>The eggs are retained in the oviducts of females by developing within several months. Under normal conditions the females give ovoviviparous birth to nearly full developed aquatic larvae with external gills and caudal fin borders. After several months, the larvae transform into adults and leave the water. During the transformation they lose their gills and develop lungs.

In fact, crinoids, holothurians, and ophiuroids rule the floor of the deep oceans at depths below 500 metres. Basket stars usually confined to the deeper parts of this range. Ophiuroids are known even from abyssal (&gt; 6000m) depths. However brittle stars are also common, if cryptic, members of reef communities, where they hide under rocks and even within other living organisms. A few ophiuroid species can even tolerate brackish water, an ability otherwise almost unknown among echinoderms.<br><br>The ophiuroids diverged in the Early Ordovician, roughly 500 million years ago.

In ophiuroids, the calcite ossicles are fused to form armor plates (collectively, the test).<br><br>Of all echinoderms, the Ophiuroidea may have the strongest tendency toward 5-segment radial (pentaradial) symmetry. The body outline is similar to the Asteroidea, in that ophiuroids have five arms joined to a central disk (calyx). However the central body disk in ophiuroids is sharply marked off from the arms. The disk contains all of the viscera. That is, the internal organs of digestion and reproduction never enter the arms (in contrast to Asteroidea).<br><br>The mouth is rimmed with five jaws. Behind the jaws is a short esophagus and a large, blind stomach cavity which occupies much of the dorsal half of the disk. Ophiuroids have neither an intestine nor an anus. Digestion occurs within 10 pouches or infolds of the stomach. Gas exchange and excretion occur through cilia-lined sacs called bursae; each opens onto the interambulacral area (between the arm bases) of the oral (ventral) surface of the disc. Typically there are 10 bursae, and each fits between two stomach digestive pouches.<br><br>The sexes are separate in most species. Gonads in the disc open into the bursae. Gametes are then shed by way of the bursal sacs. Many species actually brood developing larvae in the bursae. The ophiuroid coelom is strongly reduced, particularly in comparison to other echinoderms. The nervous system consists of a main nerve ring which runs around the central disk. At the base of each arm, the ring attaches to a radial nerve which runs to the end of the limb. Ophiuroids have no eyes, as such. However, they have some ability to sense light through receptors in the epidermis.<br><br>Both the Ophiurida and Euryalida have five long, slender, flexible whip-like arms, up to 60 cm in length. They are supported by an internal skeleton of calcium carbonate plates that referred to as vertebral ossicles. These "vertebrae" articulate through ball-in-socket joints, and are controlled by muscles as shown in the figure. The body and arms are also bear calcite plates and delicate spines. Euryalids are similar, if larger, but their arms are forked and branched. Ophiuroid podia generally function as sensory organs. They are not usually used for feeding, as in Asteroidea.<br><br>The vessels of the water vascular system end in tube feet. The water vascular system generally has one madreporite. However, some forms have none. Suckers and ampullae are absent from the tube feet.<br><br>Ophiuroids can readily regenerate lost arms or arm segments unless all arms are lost. Ophiuroids use this ability to escape predators, like lizards who automize, or deliberately shed, part of their tails to confuse pursuers.<br><br><strong>Locomotion</strong><br><br>Brittle stars use their arms for locomotion. They do not, like starfishes, depend on tube feet. Brittle stars move fairly rapidly by wriggling their arms which are highly flexible and enable the animals to make either snake-like or rowing movements.<br><br><strong>Trophic</strong><br><br>Many ophiuroids are scavengers or detritivores. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Basket stars, in particular may be capable of suspension feeding, using their mucous covering the branched arms to trap plankton and bacteria.<br><br>Issue #18</div>
