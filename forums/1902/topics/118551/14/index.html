Mostly found on the sea floor. It is so named because of its cucumber-like shape. Like all echinoderms, sea cucumbers have an endoskeleton just below the skin.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Sea_cucumber.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/Sea_cucumber.jpg/200px-Sea_cucumber.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Sea cucumber</strong>, class Holothuroidea</span><br><br>Sea cucumbers are generally scavengers, feeding on debris in the benthic layer. Their diet consist of plankton and other organic matter found in the sea. One way they might get a supply of food is to position themselves in a current where they can catch food that flow by with their tentacles when they open. Another way is to sift through the bottom sediments using their tentacles. They can be found in great numbers beneath fish farms.<br><br>They have the peculiar adaptation of expelling first sticky threads, perhaps to incapacitate predators, and then their internal organs when startled by a potential predator. These organs can then be regrown.<br><br>Sea cucumbers reproduce by releasing sperm and ova into the ocean water. Depending on conditions, one organism can produce thousands of gametes.<br><br><strong>Sea cucumber as food and medicine</strong><br><br>Sea cucumber is one of the most unique foodstuffs in Chinese cuisine. It is highly valued for its supposed medicinal properties. The flesh of the animal is "cleaned" in a process that takes several days. Trepang is often purchased dried, and rehydrated before use. The product is used in Chinese stews and braised dishes due to its gelatinous texture but is unappetising on its own. In Japanese cuisine, Konowata is made of cured sea cucumber entrails from which they extract, salt, and cure. It is considered a major delicacy.<br><br>Some varieties of sea cucumber (known as "gamat" in Malaysia) are said to have excellent healing properties. There are pharmaceutical companies being built based on this gamat product. Extracts are prepared and made into oil, cream or cosmetics. Some products are intended to be taken internally. The effectiveness of sea cucumber extract in tissue repair has been the subject of serious study. It not only helps a wound heal more quickly but is also said to reduce scarring.<br><br>Issue #307</div>

The soles and palms were naked, with the nails on the anterior digits well developed. The males reached a length of about 2.25 meters and weighed up to 200 kilograms. Displaying sexual dimorphism, the females of this species were generally smaller than males.<br><br>These pinnipeds lived in marine environment, spending much of their time in the water, and occupying rocky and sandy coastlines for shelter and breeding. Their diet included eels, lobsters, octopus, and other reef fish.<br><br>Like other true seals, the Caribbean Monk Seal was sluggish on land. This, along with its lack of fear for man, and an unaggressive and curious behaviour, likely contributed to its demise.<br><br><strong>Reproduction and Longevity</strong><br><br>Very little is known about the reproduction behavior and longevity of this animal. Live pups were likely born in early December because several females killed in the Yucatan during this time of the year had well-developed fetuses. It is believed that this animal's average lifespan was approximately 20 years.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>During his 1493 voyage, Christopher Columbus described the Caribbean Monk Seal as a "sea-wolf". Once this region began to be colonized soon afterward, whatever little habitat this species had left was lost. It also began to be exploited commercially for its oil, and less frequently, for its meat.<br><br><strong>Unconfirmed Sightings</strong><br><br>Unconfirmed sightings of Caribbean Monk Seals are relatively common in Haiti and Jamaica, where two scientific expeditions were undertaken recently -- both failed to produce any evidence of this animal as still living. Nonetheless, local fishermen and divers regularly claim to have seen the seal, making the existence of this animal still a possibility.<br><br><strong>Today</strong><br><br>A collection of Caribbean Monk Seal bones can be found at the Tropical Crane Point Hammock Museum in Key Vaca.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct (mid-1950s)<br><br>Issue #308</div>

The strong slender legs taper to small oval feet. The tail should be slender but not whippy. and should have a blunt tip. Body colour is an old or golden ivory with a soft warm effect, ticked with sepia brown. Each hair has at least two bands of sepia brown ticking, separated by light bands Â— light next to skin, and dark tip. Muzzle, chest, stomach and inner legs are an unticked light ivory colour. Singapuras should have some barring on their inner front legs and back knees.

Eyes are large, set not less than an eye width apart, held wide open, but showing slant when closed or partially closed. A dark outline to the eyes is desirable. Eye colour hazel, green or yellow only. Ears are large, wide open at base, and deep cupped. The outer line of the ears extends upwards to an angle slightly wide of parallel. The head is gently rounded with a definite whisker break and a medium short, broad muzzle with a blunt nose. In profile, the Singapura has a rounded skull with a slight stop just below eye level. There must be evidence of dark pigment outline on the nose. Â‘CheetahÂ’ lines from the inner corner of the eye towards just behind the whisker pad should be present.<br><br>The original home of the Singapura is the island of Singapore, with the breed taking its name from the local Malay name for the island Â— meaning 'Lion City'. The breed is the result of Mother NatureÂ’s combination of genes indigenous to Southeast Asia Â— both the brown as in Siamese and Burmese and the agouti or ticked pattern. The area is the highest epicentre for the agouti gene, according to geneticist, Neal Todd, who has published articles on the migration of feline genes. This breed is the same colour as seal point cats or brown Burmese, but the difference is the agouti coat pattern and how it interacts with the sepia brown.<br><br>Alternate Names: The Drain Cat, Kucinta<br>Country of origin: Singapore<br><br>Issue #309</div>

A shy, cryptic creature of the wet sclerophyll forests of southern New South Wales, it was never common and, even before the end of the 19th century, it was believed to be extinct.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Parma-Wallaby.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Parma Wallaby</strong>, Macropus parma</span><br><br>In 1965 workers on Kawau Island (near Auckland) attempting to control a plague of introduced Tammar Wallabies (a widespread and fairly common species in Australia) were astonished to discover that some of the pests were not Tammar Wallabies at all, but a miraculously surviving population of Parma WallabiesÂ—a species long thought extinct. The extermination effort was put on hold while individuals were captured and sent to institutions in Australia and around the world in the hope that they would breed in captivity and could eventually be reintroduced to their native habitat.<br><br>The renewed interest in the Parma Wallaby soon produced another surprise: in 1967 it was found that they still existed in the forests near Gosford, New South Wales. Further investigation demonstrated that the Parma Wallaby was alive and well, and although not common, was to be found in forests along the Great Dividing Range from near Gosford almost as far north as the Queensland border.<br><br>Interestingly, the offspring of the Kawau Island population are smaller than their fully wild relatives, even when provided with ample food: it appears that competition for limited food resources on the island selected for smaller individuals.<br><br>The Parma Wallaby is the smallest member of the genus Macropus, at between 3.2 and 5.8 kg, less than one tenth the size of the largest surviving member, the Red Kangaroo. It is about a half metre in length, with a sparsely furred, blackish tail about the same length again. The fur is a reddish or greyish brown above, greyer about the head, and fading to pale grey underneath. Presumably, individuals had been sighted many times during the years when it was "extinct", but mistaken for an especially slender and long-tailed example of the otherwise similar Red-legged or Red-necked Pademelon.<br><br>Like the pademelons, it prefers to occupy wet sclerophyll forest with thick undergrowth, and grassy patches, although Parma Wallabies are also found occasionally in dry eucalypt forest and even rainforest. It is mainly nocturnal and usually shelters in thick scrub during the day, through which it can travel at speed along the runways it makes. It emerges from cover shortly before dusk to feed on grasses and herbs in forest clearings. The Parma Wallaby is largely solitary; two or at most three animals sometimes coming together to feed in favourable circumstances.<br><br>Although the Parma Wallaby remains rare, there seems to be no immediate threat to it provided that more habitat destruction does not take place, and the population is thought to be slowly increasing.<br><br>Conservation status: Lower risk (nt)<br><br>Issue #310</div>

It is a brood parasite, which lays its eggs in the nests particularly of Dunnocks, Meadow Pipits, and Reed Warblers.<br><br>Female Cuckoos are divided into gentes, that is populations favouring a particular host species nest and laying eggs which match those of that species' in colour and pattern.<br><br>The exception is in the case of the Dunnock, where the Cuckoo's egg has no resemblance to its hosts' blue eggs. This is thought to be because the Dunnock is a recent host, and has not acquired the ability to distinguish eggs. Male cuckoos breed with females without regard to gens. This results in gene flow between the gentes and maintains a common gene pool for the species.<br><br>The chick which hatches from the egg laid in the other species' nest methodically evicts all other occupants of the nest, a behaviour that was first described by Edward Jenner. This is necessary since it is a much larger bird than its hosts, and needs to monopolise the parents' food supplies.<br><br>This cuckoo is a greyish bird with a slender body, long tail and strong legs. The females only are sometimes brown, the Â“hepaticÂ” phase. It looks like a small bird of prey in flight, although the wings stay below the horizontal.<br><br>It is a bird of open country. Its food is insects, with hairy caterpillars, which are distasteful to many birds, being a speciality.<br><br>The cuckoo group gets its English and scientific names from the call of the male Common Cuckoo, usually given from an open perch,<span style="font-style: italic;"> goo-ko</span>. The female has a loud bubbling call. In England, hearing the call of the Cuckoo is regarded as the first harbinger of spring, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Times</span> newspaper notoriously features correspondence every year reporting the first calls.<br><br>In Russia, there's a popular belief that a cuckoo can predict how many more years a person will live. If a person hears a cuckoo in the woods, he or she usually asks "Cuckoo, cuckoo, how long will I live?". It is believed that a person will live as many years as a cuckoo cuckooed.<br><br>The word "cuckold" derives from the Cuckoo's practice of tricking other birds into raising its young.<br><br>Issue #311</div>

Geoducks have few natural predators which may also contribute to their longevity. In Alaska, sea otters and dogfish have proved capable of dislodging adult geoducks. Starfish also attack and feed on the exposed geoduck siphon.<br><br>Geoducks are broadcast spawners. A female geoduck produces about 5 billion eggs in her century-long lifespanÂ—in comparison, a human female produces about 500 viable ova during the course of her life. It is possible that this fact, in conjunction with the phallic shape of the siphon, has led to the belief that the shellfish has aphrodisiac properties.<br><br>The geoduck is the official mascot of the Evergreen State College, located at the southernmost tip of Puget Sound in Olympia, Washington. The school's Latin motto, Omnia Extares (or, "let it all hang out"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) is probably intended as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the creature's appearance.<br><br><strong>Industry</strong><br><br>The world's first geoduck fishery was created in 1970, but demand for the semi-forgotten clam was low. Today, they sell in Asia for up to US$30/lb. The Jumbo clam, like abalone, is highly regarded in Chinese cuisine. Its large, meaty siphon is prized for its incredibly sweet (umame) flavour and crunchy texture. Extremely popular in Hong Kong, China and Japan, where it is considered a rare taste treat, Geoduck is mostly eaten cooked in a fondue-style Chinese hot pot or raw sashimi style, dipped in soy sauce and wasabi. On Japanese menus, Geoduck is called <span style="font-style: italic;">mirugai</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">mirukuigai</span>. (Although mirugai is sometimes translated to english as "Giant Clam", it is distinguished from "Himejako" sushi made from Tridacna gigas.)<br><br>The geoduck's high market value has created an $80M annual industry, with harvesting occurring in both Washington state and the province of British Columbia. It is one of the most closely regulated fisheries in the both countries; in Washington, Department of Natural Resources staff are on the water continually, monitoring harvests, and the same is true in Canada where the Underwater Harvesters' Association manages the Canadian Fishery in conjunction with Canada's Department of Fisheries and Ocean. Demand has also led to a rapidly developing aquaculture industry.<br><br>Conservation status: Lower risk<br><br>Issue #315</div>

Queens are larger and may weigh over 50 g, the largest reaching 80 g. They are well-adapted for their underground existence. Their eyes are just narrow slits, and consequently their eyesight is poor. However, they are highly adapted to moving underground, and can move backwards as fast as they move forwards. Their large, protruding teeth are used to dig. Their lips are sealed just behind their teeth while digging to avoid filling their mouth with soil. Their legs are thin and short. They have little hair (hence the common name) and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin.<br><br>Clusters of 20 to 300 animals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid East African deserts. They have a complex social structure in which only one female (the queen) and one to three males reproduces. The relationships between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years. A behaviour called reproductive suppression is believed to be the reason why the other females do not reproduce, meaning the sterility in the working females is only temporary, and not genetic. Queens live from 13 to 18 years, and are extremely hostile to other females behaving like queens, or producing hormones for becoming queens. When the queen dies, another female takes her place, sometimes after a violent struggle with her competitors.<br><br>This eusocial organisation social structure, similar to that found in ants, termites, and some bees and wasps, is believed to be nearly unique among mammals. The Damaraland Mole Rat (<span style="font-style: italic;">Coetomys damarensis</span>) is probably the only other eusocial mammal. The naked mole rat is also unique among mammals as it is virtually cold-blooded; it cannot regulate its body temperature at all and requires an environment with a specific constant temperature in order to survive.<br><br>Respiration plays an important role, because in the tunnels there exists hardly any oxygen. The lungs of this animal are built very small, so therefore they have blood with a very strong affinity for oxygen, which uses oxygen quite efficiently. It has a very low respiration and metabolism rate for an animal of its size, which uses oxygen minimally. In long periods of hunger, such as a drought, this rate can sink up to 25 percent.<br><br>The skin of naked mole rats lacks a key neurotransmitter called Substance P that is responsible in mammals for sending pain signals to the central nervous system. Therefore, when naked mole rats are cut, scraped or burned, they feel no pain. When injected with Substance P, however, the pain signalling works as it does in other mammals.<br><br><strong>In popular culture</strong><br><br>A naked mole rat named Rufus is featured in the Disney cartoon Kim Possible.

Its legs are adapted to climbing along relatively widely spaced hairs, and so can be found in eyelashes, pubic hair, beards, moustaches, and even armpit hairs. The individual louse can survive up to a week apart from its necessary human host, so that crab lice can be passed on in sleeping bags and bedding. The female may lay up to 40 eggs a time, resulting in a fluctuating but growing population. The louse feeds on blood and can leave irritating spots on the skin, sometimes mistaken for pimples, a condition called Pediculosis pubis.<br><br>Pubic lice have legs that are spaced further apart than head lice, this is an adaptation that enables them to move around more easily in their habitat.<br><br>The female louse glues her eggs, called "nits", which look like tiny white beads, to hair shafts. The louse feeds on human blood, and the bite causes itching. Bites can become secondarily infected; scratching may break the skin and help cause secondary infection. The most common symptom is itching of genital area.<br><br>Pubic lice are normally spread by sexual contact and are considered a sexually transmitted disease, but can also be spread by sharing clothes or bedding. A common misbelief is that infestation can be spread by sitting on a toilet seat. This isn't likely, since lice cannot live long away from a warm human body. Also, lice do not have feet designed to walk or hold onto smooth surfaces such as toilet seats.<br><br><strong>Life cycle</strong><br><br>There are three stages in the life of a pubic louse: the nit, the nymph, and the adult.<br><br>* Nit: Nits are pubic lice eggs. They are hard to see and are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are oval and usually yellow to white. Nits take about 1 week to hatch.<br>* Nymph: The nit hatches into a baby louse called a nymph. It looks like an adult pubic louse, but is smaller. Nymphs mature into adults about 7 days after hatching. To live, the nymph must feed on blood.<br>* Adult: The adult pubic louse resembles a miniature crab when viewed through a strong magnifying glass. Pubic lice have six legs, but their two front legs are very large and look like the pincher claws of a crab; this how they got the nickname "crabs." Pubic lice are tan to greyish-white in color. Females lay nits; they are usually larger than males. To live, adult lice need to feed on blood. If the louse falls off a person, it dies within 1-2 days.<br><br><strong>Treatment</strong><br><br>Pubic lice are easily killed by a 1% permethrin or pyrethrin lice shampoo, but the pubic hair must be combed with a fine-toothed comb after treatment to remove the nits. Lice can survive in bedding and clothing, so these items must be treated, sterilized, or contact with them must be avoided for two weeks, after which time any lice will have died.<br><br>Lindane (1%), another pediculocide, is not recommended for pregnant or nursing women or for children less than 2 years old.<br><br>Issue #323</div>

This small (for its family) albatross is the second most common seabird in the Hawaiian Islands, with an estimated population of 2.5 million birds, and is currently expanding (or possibly re-expanding) its range to new islands. It is named for Laysan, one of its breeding colonies in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/86/Laysanalbatross.jpeg/800px-Laysanalbatross.jpeg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/86/Laysanalbatross.jpeg/250px-Laysanalbatross.jpeg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Laysan Albatross</strong>, Phoebastria immutabilis</span><br><br><strong>Description</strong><br><br>The Laysan Albatross is usually easy to identify, in the North Pacific it is simple to separate from the other relatively common albatross, the all black Black-footed Albatross. It can be distinguished from the very rare Short-tailed Albatross by its all dark back and smaller size. The Laysan Albatross' plumage has been compared to that of a gull, two tone with a dark grey mantle and wings, and white underside and head.<br><br><strong>Behaviour and range</strong><br><br>The Laysan Albatross has a wide range across the North Pacific. Its main breeding colonies are in the Hawaiian Islands, particularly the islands of Midway and Laysan. It also nests in the Bonin Islands near Japan, and has recently began to colonize islands off Mexico, such as Guadalupe Island. When away from the breeding areas they range widely from Japan to Alaska and down to California, but usually far offshore.<br><br>The Laysan Albatross is colonial, nesting on scattered small islands and atolls, often in huge numbers. They also have a protracted breeding cycle. Juvenile birds return to the colony three years after fledging, but will not mate for the first time until they are seven or eight years old. over these four or five years they form pair bonds with a mate that they will keep for life. Courtship entails especially elaborate 'dances' that have up to 25 ritualised movements.<br><br>Both birds incubate the single egg, with the male being the first to incubate the egg after laying. The incubation takes about 65 days, after which the chick is brooded for a few days, after which both parents are out at sea to provision for the growing chick. The chick takes about 160 days to fledge, a long investment for the parents (which may explain the long courtship, both parents want to sure the other is serious). The chicks are fed a stomach oil by the parents.<br><br><strong>Conservation</strong><br><br>The Laysan Albatross, while a common species, has not yet recovered from the wide-scale hunting that happened in the early 1900s, with feather hunters killing many hundreds of thousands, and wiping them out from Wake Island and Johnston Atoll. This slaughter led to efforts to protect the species (and others) which led eventually to the protection of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The species is still vulnerable to long-line fisheries, and the injestion of floating plastics. On some of the new islands it has colonized it has also been taken by feral cats.<br><br>Conservation status: Vulnerable<br><br>Issue #327</div>

The form that overwinters before reproducing has dark undersides of the wings, whereas the form that develops directly to sexual maturation has lighter colured wing undersides. Both forms can arise from eggs laid by the same female, depending mainly on the photoperiods experienced by the larvae, but also with an influence of host plants, temperature and sex of individuals.<br><br>Issue #329</div>
