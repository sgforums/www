It has since been exceeded in sheer mass by a number of giant titanosaurids like the Argentinosaurus and it was finally surpassed in height by another brachiosaurid, the Sauroposeidon. It was, however, still the largest dinosaur known from a relatively complete skeleton.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Jurassic_Park_screenshot_2.jpg/800px-Jurassic_Park_screenshot_2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Jurassic_Park_screenshot_2.jpg/200px-Jurassic_Park_screenshot_2.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A <strong>Brachiosaurus</strong>, genus Brachiosaurus, from the movie Jurassic Park</span><br><br>However, even that may no longer be true, since the largest known specimens are now considered to be part of the new <span style="font-style: italic;">Giraffatitan</span> genus. This new genus includes the famous mounted Brachiosaurus in the Humboldt Museum of Berlin, which is the tallest mounted skeleton in the world.<br><br>Brachiosaurus is estimated to weigh from 30 to 80 tonnes (35 to 90 tons), to reach 13 meters (42 feet) in height, and 25 meters (82 feet) in length. Higher estimates are usually based on the Ultrasauros, which was originally considered to be an extremely large Brachiosaurus. However, Ultrasauros is now believed to be a chimera, composed of neck bones from a Supersaurus, and a shoulder bone (scapulacoracoid) from a Brachiosaurus smaller than the largest Giraffatitan specimens.<br><br><strong>Description and environment</strong><br><br>Brachiosaurus was a sauropod, one of a group of four-legged, plant-eating dinosaurs with long necks and tails, and tiny brains. Unlike other families of sauropods, it had a giraffe-like build, with long forelimbs and a raised neck, which it probably used to graze in the tops of trees. It had teeth like chisels (<span style="font-style: italic;">spatulate</span>), and nostrils on the top of its head, which may indicate it had a good sense of smell. It had a number of holes in its skull to reduce weight. The first toe on its front foot, and the first three on its hind feet had claws. They may have traveled in herds.<br><br>It used to be theorized that it used the nostrils on the top of its head like a snorkel, and spent most of its time submerged in water to help support its great mass. However, it is now believed that it was a fully terrestrial animal. Studies have shown that the water pressure would be too great for it to breathe while submerged, and its feet are too narrow, and would sink into the mud.<br><br>Like all of the other "long-necked" dinosaurs, the BrachiosaurusÂ’ neck was heavy and when it held it in a upright position for too long time, it would not get any blood to the brain. It might have stood at the edge of the forests and waved the head up and down, while it systematically removed all the eatable food on the trees.<br><br>If the Brachiosaurus was warm-blooded, it is estimated that it would take ten years to reach full size. If it was cold-blooded, then it would take over 100 years to do so. If it was warm-blooded, it would have to eat more than 400 lbs. (200 kg) a day, but a lot less if it was not.<br><br><strong>Berlin's <span style="font-style: italic;">brancai</span> and Chicago's high flyer</strong><br><br>The mounted skeleton of a <span style="font-style: italic;">B. brancai</span> (or Giraffatitan) in the Humboldt Museum in Berlin is 4 stories tall, reaching 12 meters (39 feet) into the air, and is 23 meters (74 feet) long.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Fin Whale</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Fin Whale</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Balaenoptera physalus</span>) is a mammal which belongs to the baleen whales suborder. It is the second largest whale and also the second largest animal ever to have lived, after the Blue Whale. It has a world wide distribution, and in Europe is readily seen in the Bay of Biscay. The Fin Whale was hunted more than any other whale during the twentieth century.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Fin_whale.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Fin_whale.jpg/250px-Fin_whale.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Fin Whale</strong>, Balaenoptera physalus</span><br><br><strong>Taxonomy</strong><br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Finback</span> has long been known to taxonomists. It was first described by Frederick Martens in 1675 and then again by Paul Dudley in 1725. These descriptions were used as the basis of Carolus Linnaeus' <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaena physalus</span> (1758<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>). The Comte de Lacepede reclassified it as <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaenoptera physalus</span> early in the nineteenth century. The specific name comes from the Greek physa, meaning bellows.<br><br>The Fin Whale is a close relative of the Blue Whale taxonomically speaking. Evolutionary divergence occurred between 3 and 5 million years ago. Hybrids between the two species are quite common - for every 1,000 Fin Whales there is a hybrid Blue-Fin Whale.<br><br>Population groups have split into north-south groups. On account of their migatory patterns (see below), the northern and southern groups do not meet and hence do not interbreed. There has been some genetic drifting and some sources recognise two sub-species <span style="font-style: italic;">B. p. physalus</span> (Northern Fin Whale) and <span style="font-style: italic;">B. p. quoyi</span> (Southern Fin Whale).<br><br><strong>Physical description and behaviour</strong><br><br>Fin Whales are enormous animals. The longest specimens - typically females found in Southern Hemisphere populations can be up to 26 m in length and weigh 120,000 kg. Males are typically a metre shorter. Northern specimens are between 21 m and 23 m long. Even at birth Fin Whales weigh in excess of 3,000 kg - more than half the weight of a fully grown Indian elephant. They reach their full size at about 10 years old and can live for over 80 years. The gestation period is eleven months to one year. Calves stay close to their mother for about six months.<br><br>Fin Whales are usually distinguished by their gigantic size. From this fact only, the only possibilities for confusion when making an identification at size are with the Blue Whale, the Sei Whale, or, in warmer waters, Bryde's Whale. The Fin Whale has a large white patch on its right jaw (and right jaw only, the left jaw is grey) and the baleen at the tip of the right jaw is also white. This type of asymmetry can be seen occasionally in Minke whales, but the fin whales's asymmetry is universal and thus is unique to the amongst cetaceans and is the key to making a full identification. Although it was hypothesized to probably have arisen because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and circles to the right often while at the surface, presumably above a prey patch (circle feeding), the whales just as often circle to the left. To date, we have no successful hypothesis to explain the asymmetry (Tershy, B. R. 1992. MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, 8(3):315-318<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>). The belly and underside of the flippers are white. The rest of the body is grey - with lighter patches on the head roughly demarced from the dark back in V-shapes (chevrons) which also assist in identification. 50-100 ventrical pleats or grooves run from the tip of the chin to the navel.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Finwhale99.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9d/Finwhale99.jpg/500px-Finwhale99.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A surfacing Fin Whale</span><br><br>This rorqual is a filter-feeder, using its baleen to strain small schooling fish, squid and crustaceans. An adult has between 260 and 480 baleen plates on each side of the mouth for filtering.<br><br>It is a long slim whale with a prominent dorsal fin about three-quarters of the way along the back. The fin is visible soon after the blow when the whale surfaces. It has a 5 m vertical single column blow. The whale will blow one to several times on each visit to the surface, staying close to the surface for about one and a half minutes each time. The tail remains submerged during the dive sequence. It can dive to depths of 250 m and dives last between 10 and 15 minutes.<br><br>The Fin Whale is a very fast swimmer amongst whales of its size. Speeds of 20 mph are common, and bursts in excess of 25 mph have been recorded, which labeled it with the nickname "greyhound of the sea". Breaching is seen but is not common. Fin Whales appear to have an ambivalent attitude to boats.<br><br>Like Blue Whales, Fin Whales have been recorded making long, loud, low-frequency noices. Under water, these vocalizations can be detected hundreds of miles from their source. It is undetermined whether the vocalization is used for communication and/or shows of machismo from breeding males.<br><br><strong>Population and distribution</strong><br><br>Like many of the large rorquals, the Fin Whale is a cosmopolitan species. It is found in all the world's major oceans, and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at both the North and South extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the eastern part of the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the hottest, equatorial regions. Deep waters beyond the continental shelf are preferred to shallow waters.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Cetacea_range_map_Fin_Whale.PNG/800px-Cetacea_range_map_Fin_Whale.PNG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Cetacea_range_map_Fin_Whale.PNG/250px-Cetacea_range_map_Fin_Whale.PNG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fin Whale range</span><br><br>The total population is estimated to be just in excess of 100,000. The largest populations include 24,000 in the Southern Ocean and 14,000 in the North Atlantic between Iceland and Greenland.<br><br>Fin Whales are migratory species. A north-south pattern has been proposed for populations in both the northern and southern hemispheres. For southern populations this pattern is believed to be well understood. Animals travel south for the summer and back north for the winter. The precise route of migration appears to be governed by the strength of geo-magnetic fields - Fin Whales preferring low and constant fields strengths to high and variable ones. The northern migration is less well-understood and is probably more patchy particularly in the North Atlantic. There are three suggested reasons for this. One is that the Atlantic Gulf Stream lessens the north-south temperature gradient making migration a less attractive option. Thirdly food may be available in the cold north all year round, again lessening the need for travel. Finally in winter, Fin Whales prefer to stick to deeper colder waters, further from the shore and thus less easily detected by humans wanting to measure their movement.<br><br><strong>Human interaction</strong><br><br>In the early days of whaling, Fin Whales were safe from the hunters. Their rapid speed enabled them to become a low priority for whalers. However the advent of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact took the upper hand away from the Fin Whale. It went on to become the most hunted cetacean in history. 725,000 recorded kills of Fin Whales were made in the twentieth century, causing them to become endangered around the world, and in particular in the Southern and Atlantic Oceans. Whaling of the species reached its peak between 1935 and 1970 when in excess of 30,000 animals were taken annually. Following a morartorium on hunting of Fin Whales enforced since 1985, the Northern and Southern Pacific Oceans populations have recovered somewhat. There may also be some recovery in Antarctic waters. However all populations worldwide remain listed as endangered species on the International Conservation Union Red List. Today about 10 Fin Whales are killed each year by whalers on the west coast of Greenland, under an agreement with the International Whaling Commission to allow subsistence whaling in the area.<br><br>Other cetacean dangers caused by humans, including catching in fishing nets, collisions with ships and pollution, are relatively rare in Fin Whales on account of their size, speed and position high in the food chain.<br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #142</div>

Adults reach up to 130 cm (4 ft) in length and can weigh up to a maximum of 44.0 kg (97 lbs). They prefer large bodies of water similar to the deep waters of its native Mekong river basin. Iridescent Sharks are a freshwater fish that natively live in a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6.5-7.5 pH, a water hardness of 2.0-29.0 dGH, and a temperature range of 72-79 Â°F (22-26 Â°C).

The first is called the nauplius, which spends its time as part of the plankton, floating wherever the wind, waves, currents, and tides may take it, whilst eating and molting. This lasts for about two weeks until the sixth stage is reached. At this point the nauplius metamorphoses into a non-feeding, more strongly swimming cyprid larva. The cyprids settle down in an area where environmental cues indicate a safe and productive environment. If they don't, the larvae will die.<br><br>When an appropriate place is found, the cyprid larva cements itself headfirst to the surface and then undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile barnacle. Typical barnacles develop six hard armor plates to surround and protect their body. For the rest of their lives they are cemented to the ground, using their feathery legs to capture plankton and gametes when spawning. They are usually found in the intertidal zone.<br><br>Like many invertebrates, barnacles are hermaphroditic and alternate male and female roles over time.<br><br>Barnacles often attach themselves to human-made structures, sometimes to the structure's detriment.

Subsequently fossils were found on Maui, Oahu and Lanai, the remains found in lava tubes, in lakebeds and sinkholes. They represent four species, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chelychelynechen quassus</span> (from Kauai), <span style="font-style: italic;">Thambetochen xanion</span> (from Oahu), <span style="font-style: italic;">Thambetochen chaulious</span>, (from Maui, Lanai and Molokai) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ptaiochen pau</span> (from Maui). <span style="font-style: italic;">Chelychelynechen</span>, meaning turtle-jawed goose, had a large heavy bill like that of a tortoise, while the other two genera, <span style="font-style: italic;">Thambetochen</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ptaiochen</span> all had serrations in their bills known as pseudoteeth. All the species were large, weighing between 4 to 7.5 kg, and were flightless.<br><br><strong>Evolution and Ecology</strong><br><br>Some of the fossils found contained traces of mitochondrial DNA, which were compared to living duck species in order to establish their place in the duck family, Anatidae. Contrary to expectations, the Moa-nalos were not related to the large geese (Anserinae) but instead the dabbling ducks of the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Anas</span>; (for example the Mallard). From the DNA it has been estimated that the Moa-nalos reached the Hawaiian Islands about 3.6 million years ago. There they increased in size, but must have retained the ability to fly until they had spread to the newer islands. They seem to have lost the power of flight by the time the main island of Hawaii had emerged from the sea, instead their niche was filled by a goose related to the Hawaiian Goose.<br><br>The unusual shape and size of the Moa-nalos can be attributed to their role in the ecology of prehistoric Hawaii. Studies of coprolites (fossil dung) found in caves associated with their remains has shown they ate leaves, particularly fronds from ferns, this is backed up by the shapes of their beaks. This indicates they were the principal browsers on the island, studies of fern species suggest that there was coevolution between the fern species and the Moa-nalos, with the ferns evolving thorn-like prickles on new growth to defend itself. The Moa-nalos themselves filled the niche of herbivore usually filled by mammals such as goats and deer. This has implications for the ecology of Hawaiian Islands today, as a major group of species have been lost.<br><br>The Moa-nalos went extinct after the arrival of Polynesian settlers in the islands, along with many other species, including a native eagle, owls, several species of flightless ibis and a large number of flightless rails. Like island faunas from Mauritius, New Zealand and Polynesia, they were unused to mammals and were easily taken by hunters or the animals that were introduced.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Genera</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chelychelynechen<br>Thambetochen<br>Ptaiochen</span><br><br>Conservation status: Fossil<br><br>Issue #148</div>

Their bodies are elongate and scaleless; a strong spine guards the preopercle (part of the gill cover), which has been reported to be venomous in some species. All fins are large, showy and elongate; the first high dorsal fin usually has four spines; in males, the first of these spines may be further adorned with filamentous extentions. Dragonets have flattened, triangular heads with large mouths and eyes; their tail fins are fan-shaped and tapered.<br><br>The largest species, the longtail dragonet (<span style="font-style: italic;">Callionymus gardineri</span>) reaches a length of 30 centimetres. At the other end of the scale, the St. Helena dragonet (<span style="font-style: italic;">Callionymus sanctaehelenae</span>) reaches a length of just 2 centimetres. Many species exhibit marked sexual dimorphism: males and females are coloured and patterned differently, and (in addition to the spine filament) males have a much higher dorsal fin. This theme is taken to extremes in the high-finned dragonet (<span style="font-style: italic;">Synchiropus rameus</span>).<br><br><strong>Behaviour</strong><br><br>Dragonets are benthic animals, spending most of their time on or near the bottom. They prefer sandy or rocky substrates, sometimes near reefs. Inhabiting depths down to about 200 metres, dragonets feed mostly on crustaceans, worms and other small invertebrates rooted out from the substrate. The dragonet's large pectoral fins serve as a primary means of propulsion. Males are highly territorial between themselves.<br><br>Although their bright colours and showy fins make them a popular choice for the aquarium, most dragonets are picky eaters and will only accept live food.<br><br>Spawning involves elaborate courtship displays; the males show off their flashy fins and repeatedly open and close their mouths. If the female is interested, pairing occurs and the two fish rise upwards with male supporting the female on his pectoral fins. Eggs and sperm are released in midwater, where fertilization takes place. The buoyant eggs subsequently become part of the plankton, drifting with the currents until hatching.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Genera</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Anaora<br>Bathycallionymus<br>Callionymus<br>Calliurichthys<br>Dactylopus<br>Diplogrammus<br>Draculo<br>Eleutherochir<br>Eocallionymus<br>Foetorepus<br>Minysynchiropus<br>Neosynchiropus<br>Paracallionymus<br>Paradiplogrammus<br>Protogrammus<br>Pseudocalliurichthys<br>Repomucenus<br>Synchiropus</span><br><br>Issue #154</div>

Its name, "fearsome claw", refers to the huge, sickle-shaped talons on the second toe. These claws were probably held retracted while the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes. It is thought that Deinonychus would kick with the sickle claws to slash at its prey. Like with all dromaeosaurids the tail was stiffened by a series of elongated bones (not tendons).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c1/Deinonychus_skull.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/Deinonychus_skull.jpg/250px-Deinonychus_skull.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Skull of <strong>Deinonychus</strong> antirrhopus</span><br><br><strong>Discoveries</strong><br><br>Based on the association of a number of Deinonychus skeletons in a single quarry Â— several hundred Deinonychus bones were discovered by paleontologist John Ostrom and Grant E. Meyer in 1964 in southern Montana Â— it has been speculated that Deinonychus lived in packs. This is quite possible, but it is difficult to prove or disprove this idea. Shed teeth of Deinonychus are often found alongside skeletons of the ornithopod dinosaur Tenontosaurus, indicating that it fed on them, and perhaps hunted them.<br><br>John Ostrom named and described Deinonychus, and the discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and open the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. Deinonychus was a fearsome predator that probablly hunted in packs. They used their retractable foot claws to slash at and weaken their prey.<br><br>Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the hand of Deinonychus and birds, which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Thirty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted. Finds of related dinosaurs from China, such as Sinornithosaurus and Microraptor indicate that this dinosaur probably bore feathers. Other relatives include Velociraptor, Utahraptor, and Dromaeosaurus.<br><br>A skeleton of Deinonychus can be seen on display at the American Museum of Natural History or the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. The American Museum and Harvard specimens are from a different locality than the Yale specimens which Ostrom described, and the claws are different shapes (Ostrom 1976). This raises the possibility that the two are, in fact, different species or even different genera.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Physical characteristics</span><br>- Skull length: 410 mm (16 in)<br>- Total length: 3 m (10 ft)<br>- Hip height: 1.2 m (4 ft)<br>- Weight: 80 kg (175 lb)<br><br>Conservation status: Fossil<br><br>Issue #156</div>

The breed is instantly recognised by its distinctive tricolour pattern: body, neck, legs, cranium and ears black; cheeks, stockings and eyespots rich tan, toes, chest, muzzle, tail tip and blaze between the eyes white. The pattern is rigid and varies only slightly in the amount of white. A perfectly-marked individual gives the impression of a white Â“Swiss crossÂ” on the chest, when viewed from the front in sitting position. The eyes are an expressive dark brown.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grooming</span><br><br>The Bernese coat is slightly rough in outline, but not at all harsh in texture. The undercoat is fairly dense; the coat is quite dirt and weather resistant. A good brushing every week or two is sufficient to keep it in fine shape, except when the undercoat is being shed; then daily combing is in order for the duration of the shed.<br><br><strong>Temperament</strong><br><br>Berners are outdoor dogs at heart, though well-behaved in the house; they need activity and exercise, but do not have a great deal of endurance. They can move with amazing bursts of speed for their size when motivated; stray cats and similar intruders must beware of the Berner!<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/Bernese_mountain_dogs.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/87/Bernese_mountain_dogs.jpg/250px-Bernese_mountain_dogs.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Female and male Bernese Mountain Dogs</span><br><br>The Berner temperament is a strong point of the breed. Affectionate, loyal, faithful, stable and intelligent, Bernese Mountain Dogs make wonderful family pets. They are very trainable provided the owner is patient and consistent in training; Berners need time to think things through. Although the breed is stable in temperament, patient and loving, a Berner who has really lost his temper is a fearsome thing; given cause for attack they are swift, powerful and efficient. It is said that the breed is descended from the molossus war dogs of the Roman legions; anyone who has witnessed an angry Berner will have no trouble believing that story.<br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>The breedÂ’s genetic base is somewhat narrow, so hereditary diseases and inbreeding depression are major issues. Several kinds of cancer (histiocytosis, mastocytoma, lymphosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma) affect Berners; hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, osteoarthritis, plus autoimmune and kidney problems are other major health issues for the breed. Many litters contain stillborn young (a major indicator of inbreeding depression).<br><br>Although slow to mature, the Berner is not particularly long-lived. The Swiss say, Â“three years a young dog, three years a good dog, and three years an old dog.Â” Today even nine years may be slightly optimistic; certainly a ten-year-old Berner is a very old one. In fact, surveys around the world show that the average lifespan is seven years.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The breed originated in Swiss farm villages where it was used as a cowherd, a draught dog to haul carts containing milk cans and farm goods, and a flock guardian. It nearly disappeared in the late 1800s but was rescued around the turn of the century by a determined Swiss cynologist, Herr Franz Schertenleib.<br><br>Alternative names: Berner Sennenhund, Bouvier Bernois, DÃ¼rrbÃ¤chler<br>Common nicknames: Berner<br>Country of origin: Switzerland<br><br>Issue #157</div>
