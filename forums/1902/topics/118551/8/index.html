In addition there are large lynx populations in Montana, Idaho and Washington. The Canada Lynx is rare in Utah, Minnesota, and New England. It is considered to be threatened in the contiguous United States.<br><br>The appearance of a Canada Lynx resembles a Eurasian Lynx: the dense fur is silvery brown and may bear blackish markings. In summer, their coat takes on a more reddish brown colour. Males are larger than females. The lynx has a furry ruff which resembles a double-pointed beard, a short tail with a black tip and long furry tufts on its ears. Its long legs with broad furred feet aid the lynx in travelling through deep snow.<br><br>Lynxes hunt for hares, rodents and birds, sometimes killing larger animals such as deer. They rely mainly on hearing and sight to locate prey. In some areas the Snowshoe Hare is virtually the only prey of the Canada Lynx. The size of the lynx population tends to follow the approximately 10 year long rise and decline of Snowshoe Hare numbers.<br><br>The lynx is a solitary and secretive animal, usually active at night, and requires a large territory. It breeds in spring and one to five kittens are born. The survival of the young depends heavily on the availability of prey species.<br><br>These animals are trapped for their fur and have declined in many areas due to habitat loss.<br><br><strong>Subspecies</strong><br><br>The <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Newfoundland Lynx</span></strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Lynx canadensis subsolanus</span>) is a subspecies of the Canada Lynx.

There are five species of Chuckwalla, all within the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauromalus</span>; they are part of the iguana family, Iguanidae.<br><br>The name <span style="font-style: italic;">Chuckwalla</span> derives from the Shoshone word "tcaxxwal" or Cahullia "caxwal", transcribed by Spaniards as "chacahuala".<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Common_chuckwalla.jpg/355px-Common_chuckwalla.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Common_chuckwalla.jpg/200px-Common_chuckwalla.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Common <strong>Chuckwalla</strong>, Sauromalus ater</span><br><br><strong>Physical description</strong><br><br>Reaching a total length of 16 inches (40 centimetres) and a weight of 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms), Chuckwallas are noted for their wide, flattened midsections and prominent paunch. Their tails are also notably thick, tapering to a blunt tip. Loose folds of skin characterise the neck and sides of the body, which is covered in small, coarsely granular scales. Males are generally larger than females.<br><br>These lizards are coloured plainly; sexual dimorphism is marked, with males having reddish to orange, yellow or light gray bodies and black heads, shoulders and limbs; females and the immature have bodies with scattered spots or contrasting bands of light and dark in shades of gray or yellow.<br><br>Well-developed femoral pores are located on the inner side of the thighs in males; these pores produce secretions believed to play a role in marking territory.<br><br><strong>Range, habitat and diet</strong><br><br>The genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauromalus</span> has a wide distribution in desert biomes. This is especially true of the Common Chuckwalla (<span style="font-style: italic;">Sauromalus ater</span>), found from southern California east to southern Nevada and Utah, western Arizona and south to Baja California and northwestern Mexico. Other species are island-dwelling and therefore have much more restricted distributions: Two rare and endangered are the Chuckwalla de Montserrat (<span style="font-style: italic;">Sauromalus slevini</span>) found on Islas Carmen, Coronados and Montserrat and the San Esteban Chuckwalla or Painted Chuckwalla (<span style="font-style: italic;">Sauromalus varius</span>) found on San Esteban, Lobos and Pelicanos. The Angel Island Chuckwalla (<span style="font-style: italic;">Sauromalus hispidus</span>) and Peninsular Chuckwalla (<span style="font-style: italic;">Sauromalus australis</span>) are found on Isla Angel de la Guarda and surrounding islands off the coast of the Baja California peninsula.<br><br>Chuckwallas prefer lava flows and rocky areas, such as those found in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts. These areas are typically vegetated by creosote bush and other such drought-tolerant scrub. The lizards may be found at elevations of up to 4,500 feet (1,370 metres).<br><br>Primarily herbivorous, Chuckwallas feed on leaves, fruit and flowers of both annuals and perennial plants; insects represent a supplementary prey. The lizards are said to prefer yellow flowers, such as those of the brittle-bush (<span style="font-style: italic;">Encelia farinosa</span>).<br><br><strong>Behaviour and reproduction</strong><br><br>Harmless to humans, these lizards are known to run from potential threats; a tight rock crevice is sought wherein the Chuckwalla will inflate its body with air in order to entrench itself.<br><br>Males are seasonally and conditionally territorial; an abundance of resources tends to create a hierarchy based on size, with one large male dominating the area's smaller males. Chuckwallas are visually oriented and use a combination of colour and physical displays, namely "push ups", head-hobbing, and gaping of the mouth to communicate and defend their territory. In lean periods no territories are observed.<br><br>Chuckwallas are diurnal animals and as they are exothermic, spend much of their mornings and winter days basking. These lizards are well adapted to desert conditions; they are active at temperatures of up to 102Â°F (39Â°C). Chuckwallas hibernate during cooler months and emerge in February.<br><br>Mating occurs from April to July, with 5-16 eggs subsequently laid between June and August. The eggs hatch in late September.

The compound eyes and ocelli are dark brown, and the antennae are dark brown with orange scapes. The clypeus (the shield-like plate on the front of the head) is orange and coarsely punctured; the posterior side of the clypeus has narrow, rounded lobes.

The hornet's forelegs are orange with dark brown tarsi (the distal - furthest down - part of the leg); the midlegs and hindlegs are dark brown. Wings are a dark brownish-gray. The tegulae are brown.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/Asian_giant_hornet_head.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/77/Asian_giant_hornet_head.jpg/200px-Asian_giant_hornet_head.jpg"></a><br><br>The gaster (the portion of the abdomen behind the thorax-abdomen connection) is dark brown with a white, powdery covering; with narrow yellow bands at the posterior margins of the tergite, the sixth segment is entirely yellow.<br><br><strong>Geographic Distribution</strong><br><br>It can be found in most of Asia but mostly in the mountains of Japan: southeastern regions of Asian Russia (Primorskii Krai), Korea, China, Japan, Indochina, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka.<br><br><strong>"Hornets From Hell"</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sting</span><br><br>The stinger of the Asian giant hornet is about a quarter-inch (6 mm) in length, and injects an especially potent venom that contains an enzyme so strong that it can dissolve human tissue. Masato Ono, an entomologist at Tamagawa University near Tokyo, described the sensation as feeling "like a hot nail through my leg."<br><br>If a person is stung by the giant hornet and does not receive prompt medical treatment, he or she may die from a reaction to the venom. About 40 people die each year after being stung by giant hornets, mainly as a result of an allergic reaction to the venom.<br><br>A couple of interesting notes on the <span style="font-style: italic;">V. mandarinia</span>'s venom and stinger:<br><br>- The venom contains 5% acetylcholine, which stimulates the pain nerve fibres more than bee or other wasp venoms, so that it is a bit more painful.<br>- The venom is optimized to kill bees which are the <span style="font-style: italic;">V. mandarinia</span>'s natural prey. This means that while the venom may be a bit more painful to vertebrates, it is actually less toxic.<br>- Like all hornets, <span style="font-style: italic;">V. mandarinia</span> can sting repeatedly, and do so when they prey on bees and other insects.<br>- According to a report, one victim could not be recognized because said victim's face was dissolved beyond recognition due to numerous stings to that area.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Predation</span><br><br>The Asian giant hornet is a relentless hunter that preys on other large insects such as bees, other hornet species, and praying mantises.<br><br>The hornets often attack honeybee hives with the goal of obtaining the honeybee larvae. The hornets can devastate a colony of honeybees: a single hornet can kill as many as 40 honeybees <span style="font-style: italic;">per minute</span>; it takes only a few of these hornets a few hours to exterminate the population of a 30,000-member honeybee hive, leaving a trail of severed insect heads and limbs. Once a hive is emptied of all defending bees, the hornets carry the honeybee larvae back to feed to their own larvae.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Giant_hornet_attacks.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A giant hornet attacks a honeybee hive.</span><br><br>Rather than consume their kills directly, the hornets chew them into a paste and feed them to their larvae. The hornet larvae, in return, produce a clear liquid which the adults consume (see <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hornet and the Japanese Diet</span>, below).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Native Honeybees</span><br><br>Although a handful of Asian giant hornets can easily defeat the defenses of honeybees, whose correspondingly small sting cannot inflict much damage against such a large predator as the giant hornet, the Japanese honeybee (<span style="font-style: italic;">Apis cerana japonica</span>) has evolved an ingenious method of defending against the much larger predator.<br><br>When a hornet scout locates a Japanese honeybee hive and approaches the nest, the scout will emit specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the honeybees detect these pheromones, a hundred or so honeybees will gather near the entrance of the nest, apparently to draw the hornet further into the hive. As the hornet enters the nest, a large mob of about five hundred honeybees surround the hornet, completely covering it and preventing it from moving, and begin quickly vibrating their flight muscles. This has the effect of raising the temperature of the honeybee mass to 47 Â°C (116.6 Â°F). Though the honeybees can tolerate such a temperature, it is fatal to the intruder, which can handle a maximum temperature of about 45 Â°C/113 Â°F, and is effectively baked to death by the large mass of vibrating bees.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Hornet and the Japanese Diet</span><br><br>In Japan's mountain villages, the hornets are valued as part of the basic diet. They are eaten deep fried or as a kind of hornet sashimi.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hornet supplement manufacturers</span><br><br>Recently several companies in Asia and Europe have begun to manufacture dietary supplements and energy drinks supposedly containing the secretions of the larvae of <span style="font-style: italic;">Vespa Mandarina Japonica</span>, which the adult hornets usually consume. According to the manufacturers of these products, because the adult hornet can fly 50 miles in a single day at 20 miles per hour, consuming the larval hornet secretions (marketed as "hornet juice"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) will similarly enhance human endurance.<br><br>Note that these "supplements" are not really made from hornets, but synthesized from, eg, according to Vaam: "Diet Amino is composed of: Maltodextrin, Betacarotene, Amino Acids (Proline, Lysine, Leucine,Valine, Isoleucine, Alanine), Vitamin E, Vitamin B1, Flavoring, Acidifier, Sweetener (Stevia, Sucrose)". Also that there is no medical evidence that these have any effect, but as "supplements" rather than pharmaceuticals, do not have to prove their claims.<br><br>Issue #161</div>

Anchovies are placed in the family Engraulidae.<br><br>It is easily distinguished by its deeply-cleft mouth, the angle of the gape being behind the eyes. The pointed snout extends beyond the lower jaw. The fish resembles a sprat in having a forked tail and a single dorsal fin, but the body is round and slender.

The range of the species also extends along the Atlantic coast of Europe to the south of Norway. In winter it is common off Devon and Cornwall (Great Britain), but has not hitherto been caught in such numbers as to be of commercial importance.<br><br>Formerly they were caught in large numbers off the coast of the Netherlands in summer when they entered the Wadden Sea and Zuider Zee. After the closing of the Zuider Zee they were still found in the Wadden Sea until the 1960s. They were also caught in the estuary of the Scheldt.<br><br>There is reason to believe that the anchovies found at the western end of the English Channel in November and December are those which annually migrated from the Zuider Zee and Scheldt in autumn, returning thither in the following spring; they were assumed to form an isolated stock, for none come up from the south in summer to occupy the English Channel, though the species is resident on the coast of Portugal.<br><br>The explanation appears to be that the shallow and landlocked waters of the Zuider Zee, as well as the sea on the Dutch coast, become raised to a higher temperature in summer than any part of the sea about the British coasts, and that therefore anchovies were able to spawn and maintain their numbers in these waters.<br><br>Their reproduction and development were first described by a Dutch naturalist from observations made on the shores of the Zuider Zee. Spawning takes place in June and July, and the eggs, like those of the majority of marine fishes, are buoyant and transparent, but they are peculiar in having an elongated, sausage-like shape, instead of being globular. They resemble those of the sprat and pilchard in having a segmented yolk and there is no oil globule.<br><br>The larva hatch two or three days after the fertilization of the egg, and are minute and transparent. In August young specimens 1Â½ to 3Â½ in. in length have been taken in the Zuider Zee, and these must derived from the spawning of the previous summer.<br><br>There is no evidence to decide the question whether all the young anchovies as well as the adults leave the Zuider Zee in autumn, but, considering the winter temperature there, it is probable that they do. The eggs have also been obtained from the Bay of Naples, and near Marseilles, also off the coast of Holland, and once at least off the coast of Lancashire.<br><br>The occurrence of anchovies in the English Channel has been carefully studied at the laboratory of the Marine Biological Association at Plymouth. They were most abundant in 1889 and 1890. In the former year considerable numbers were taken off Dover in drift nets of small mesh used for the capture of sprats. In the following December large numbers were taken together with sprats at Torquay. In November 1890 a thousand of the fish were obtained in two days from the pilchard boats fishing near Plymouth; these were caught near the Eddystone.<br><br>Issue #162</div>

Other polyps branch out from this central stalk, forming water intake structures (<span style="font-style: italic;">siphonozooids</span>), feeding structures (<span style="font-style: italic;">autozooids</span>) with nematocysts, and reproductive structures. The entire colony is fortified by calcium carbonate in the form of <span style="font-style: italic;">spicules</span> and a central <span style="font-style: italic;">axial rod</span>.<br><br>Using their root-like peduncles to anchor themselves in sandy or muddy substrate, the exposed portion of sea pens may rise up to 2 metres in some species, such as the Tall Sea Pen (<span style="font-style: italic;">Funiculina quadrangularis</span>). Sea Pens are sometimes brightly coloured; the Orange Sea Pen (<span style="font-style: italic;">Ptilosarcus gurneyi</span>) is a notable example. Rarely found above depths of 10 metres, Sea Pens prefer deeper waters where turbulence is less likely to uproot them. Some species may inhabit depths of 2,000 metres or more.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Sea_pen_uprooted.jpg/569px-Sea_pen_uprooted.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Sea_pen_uprooted.jpg/250px-Sea_pen_uprooted.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Uprooted Sea Pen with the bulbous peduncle in view.</span><br><br>While generally sessile animals, Sea Pens are able to relocate and re-anchor themselves if need be. They position themselves favourably in the path of currents, ensuring a steady flow of plankton, the Sea Pens' chief source of food. Their primary predators are nudibranchs and starfishs, some of which feed exclusively on Sea Pens. When touched, Sea Pens emit a bright greenish light; this is known as <span style="font-style: italic;">bioluminescence</span>. They may also force water out of themselves as a defensive act, deflating and retreating into their peduncle.<br><br>Like other anthozoans, Sea Pens reproduce by co-ordinating a release of sperm and eggs into the water column; this may occur seasonally or throughout the year. Fertilized eggs develop into larvae called planulae which drift freely for about a week before settling on the substrate. Mature Sea Pens provide shelter for other animals, such as juvenile fish. Analysis of rachis growth rings indicates Sea Pens may live for 100 years or more, if the rings are indeed annual in nature.<br><br>The Sea Pen fossil record is patchy and disputed by some; while the earliest accepted fossils are known from the Cambrian-aged Burgess Shale, similar fossils from the late Proterozoic (Vendian) may represent the dawn of Sea Pens. Precisely what the Proterozoic fossils are, however, is not decided.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Families</span><br><br>* Suborder <span style="font-style: italic;">Sessiliflorae<br>o Anthoptilidae<br>o Chunellidae<br>o Echinoptilidae<br>o Funiculinidae<br>o Kophobelemnidae<br>o Protoptilidae<br>o Renillidae<br>o Scleroptilidae<br>o Stachyptilidae<br>o Umbellulidae<br>o Veretillidae</span><br><br>* Suborder <span style="font-style: italic;">Subselliflorae<br>o Pennatulidae<br>o Pteroeididae<br>o Virgulariidae</span><br><br>Issue #163</div>

Cornish Rexes have only the undercoat.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/CornishRexRopey.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/CornishRexRopey.jpg/250px-CornishRexRopey.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Cornish Rex</strong></span><br><br>The coat of a Cornish Rex is extremely fine and soft to the touch. As the coat of the Cornish Rex is not highly allergenic, the breed is suitable for people with allergies or asthmatic conditions. However, their light coat means that they are only suitable for indoor living in moisture free and warm conditions. Consequently, these cats tend to hang around light bulbs, the tops of computer monitors, and other warm places. Cornish Rexes also have a cheesy smell peculiar to the breed.<br><br>The Cornish Rex is an adventurous cat. As the Rex is intelligent, it can readily adapt to new situations and engage in explorative behaviour. Humans often consider this behaviour to be deliberately mischevious, but this is a case of anthropomorphism. The Rex seeks out the company of people, and is friendly towards other companion animals. It is a suitable pet for timid children.<br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br><br>The Cornish Rex is a genetic mutation that originated from a litter of kittens born in the 1950s on a farm in Cornwall, UK (hence their name). One of the kittens, Kallibunker, a cream colored male, had an extremely unusual, fine, curly coat, and he became the first Cornish Rex.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/Cornish_rex_killian.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/Cornish_rex_killian.jpg/250px-Cornish_rex_killian.jpg"></a><br><br>There is another very similar breed Â— the Devon Rex. Devon and Cornish Rexes are produced by different genes, and crosses between the two are not allowed in pedigrees. Another hair-deficient breed is the Sphynx cat.<br><br>The word "Rex" implying short or otherwise unusual fur comes from a rabbit breed. King Albert of the Belgians (1875Â–1934) once entered some short-haired rabbits in a rabbit show. The rabbits didn't meet the breed standard. Not wanting to offend the king, the show officials accepted them, but wrote "rex," meaning "king" by their names.<br><br>Common Nicknames: Rex<br>Country of origin: England<br><br>Issue #165</div>

A Mallard has been recorded as living for 29 years.<br><br>The Greenland Mallard is one of the rare examples of both Allen's Rule and Bergmann's Rule in birds. Bergmann's Rule - polar subspecies/species tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates - has numerous examples in birds, but examples of Allen's Rule - appendages like ears tend to be smaller in polar subspecies/species to minimize heat loss and large in tropical and desert equivalents to faciliate heat diffusion, and the polar taxa are stockier overall - are rare, as birds don't have ears (where Allen's Rule manifests most prominently). However, the bill of ducks is very well supplied with blood vessels and vulnerable to cold. Thus, the Greenland Mallard, although considerably larger than the nominate subspecies, has a smaller bill and is stockier.<br><br><strong>Breeding behaviour</strong><br><br>Mallards form pairs only until the female lays eggs, at which time she is left by the male. The clutch is 9-13 eggs, which are incubated for 27-28 days to hatching with 50-60 days to fledging.

It is one of two species within the United States that is dangerous; the other, far less dangerous, species is <span style="font-style: italic;">Centruroides vittatus</span>.<br><br>Arizona bark scorpions are not true desert species; they prefer riparian areas, with sufficient moisture and humidity to support insects and other prey species. However, the popularity of irrigated lawns in residential areas has led to an explosion in the number of these animals in some areas. Relatively high humidity seems important in the life cycle of the species in that the female will not give live birth if it is too dry.<br><br>Care and feeding is similar to that of other scorpions. The Arizona bark scorpion does prefer to hide, and will cling to all but the smoothest of surfaces. It is more active at night, and a diet of crickets and other insects suits them well. Due to the venomous nature of the species, handling is contraindicated. They are not aggressive, and prefer to run or hide when confronted. The sting is very painful, and may cause pain and loss of use of an affected limb. In extreme cases, allergic reactions may cause death.

The question was significant, as the Catholic faith at that time prohibited the eating of meat (other than fish) during Lent, the period of abstinence lasting 40 days before Easter. Having a second-hand description of the animal, and not wanting the petitioners to turn away from Catholicism, the Church agreed and declared the capybara a fish Â— a decision that was never reversed and which has since, in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, become irrelevant.<br><br>A capybara has recently been spotted living in the wild on a ranch in Medina, Texas.

The USDA developed this biological control and it is commercially available in powder form for application to lawn areas. Standard applications (low density across a broad area) take from 1 to 5 years to establish maximal protection against larval survival (depending on climate), expanding through the soil through repeated rounds of infection, in-host multiplication, release from killed host, and infection.

The trapezoidal-shaped shells are colored brown or yellowish-olive, with reddish brown or greenish rays in young or pale specimens. The nacre is bluish or silvery white, and is iridescent on the posterior.<br><br>Details of reproduction are slim, but it is believed to be not unlike that of other mussels. It spawns in late summer.<br><br>It lives in muddy sand, cobble, firm silt and gravel bottoms of creeks and rivers in areas of slow to moderate current and little silt deposit. At times, it has also been found to utilize the root systems of trees at the water's edge. It is believed to be primarily sessile, with limited movement in the substrate.<br><br>There are only 20 known remaining populations, and these continue to be endangered to to agricultural and industrial runoff. Road and dam construction, as well as channelization and removal of shoreline vegetation, are also threats. It is currently on the U.S. Endangered Species List. It is also classified as endangered in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Vermont. The only recorded Canadian location for the Dwarf wedge mussel is the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick. A specimen was last collected there in 1960, at which time the species was classified as being common. It became extirpated in 1968, following construction of a causeway.<br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #179</div>

Their front leg bones were reduced in length, their paddles strengthened by long finger-bones. Their rear legs were atrophied. Their powerful tails, lashed side to side crocodile-fashion, provided locomotion.<br><br>Mosasaurs had a loosely-hinged jaw which enabled them to gulp down their prey almost whole, a snakelike habit that has helped identify the stomach contents fossilized within a Mosasaur skeleton, which included the diving seabird <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornis</span>, a marine bony fish, a shark, and part of a smaller mosasaur. Mosasaur bones have been found with embedded shark teeth.<br><br>Based on features such as the loosely-hinged jaw, modified/reduced limbs and probable locomation, many researchers believe that snakes may be descended from mosasaurs, a suggestion advanced in 1869, by Edward Drinker Cope, who coined the term "Pythonomorpha<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>" to include them.

Susie's ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with folded ears, and one of the siblings was acquired by William Ross, a neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in Great Britain and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of geneticist Pat Turner. The breeding program produced 76 kittens in the first three years - 42 with folded ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple dominant gene. If one parent provides the gene for straight ears, and one parent provides the gene for folded ears, the kittens will be Folds.<br><br>The breed was not accepted for showing in Great Britain and Europe as it was felt that they would be extremely prone to ear problems such as infection, mites and deafness, but the folds were exported to America and the breed continued to be established there using crosses with British Shorthair and the American Shorthair.<br><br>Scottish Folds can be either long or short-haired, and they may have any coat colour combination except for Siamese-style points. Pointed Folds have been bred but they are not eligible for showing. The original cats only had one fold in their ears, but due to selective breeding they have increased the fold to a double or triple crease that lies the ear totally flat against the head.<br><br>There is one medical problem that has been found to be related to Scottish-Fold breeding. If both parents have folded ears, their kittens will be extremely prone to developing a painful degenerative joint disease that fuses the tail, ankles and knees. The disease is not fatal, but as it is easily avoidable, reputable breeders will only breed fold to non-fold.<br><br>Issue #181</div>
