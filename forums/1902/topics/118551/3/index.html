            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Dingo</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Dingo</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Canis lupus dingo</span>), is a type of wolf, probably descended from the Indian Wolf (<span style="font-style: italic;">Canis lupus pallipes</span>). It is commonly described as an Australian wild dog, but is not restricted to Australia, nor did it originate there.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Dingo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Dingo.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Dingo</strong>, Canis lupus dingo</span><br><br>The earliest known Dingo skulls have been found in Vietnam and are about 5,500 years old. Dingo remains from 5,000 to 2,500 years old have been found in other parts of South-east Asia, and the earliest record of Dingos in Australia is 3,500 years old.<br><br>The ultimate origin of the Dingo is uncertain, but it is clearly related to the wolves of south-west Asia, and probably arose in that area at about the same time as humans began to develop agriculture. Current thinking suggests that modern dogs are a mixture of several separate domestications of wolves at different times and in different areas: the modern Dingo appears to be a relatively pure-bred descendant of one of the earliest domestications. It is probable that 14,000 year-old Dingo-like bones found in Israel, and 9,000 year-old bones in the Americas are evidence of the commensal relationships that developed between wolves and peopleÂ—as people migrated eastward, semi-domesticated dogs came with them. The Carolina dog found in the US southeast resembles the dingo and has common genetic features not found in other dogs.<br><br>Modern Dingos are found throughout South-east Asia, mostly in small pockets of remaining natural forest, and in mainland Australia, particularly in the north. They have features in common with both wolves and modern dogs, and are regarded as more-or-less unchanged descendants of an early ancestor of modern dogs.<br><br>At between 10 and 24 kilograms, Dingos are a little smaller than most wolves of the northern hemisphere (in keeping with Bergmann's Rule) and have a lean, athletic build. They stand between 44 and 63 cm high at the shoulder, and the head-body length varies between 86 and 122 cm. Colour varies but is usually ginger: some have a reddish tinge, others are more sandy yellow; the underside is lighter. Most Dingos have white markings on the chest, feet, and the tip of the tail; some have a blackish muzzle. (The one illustrated above is paler than usual, and noticeably more thick-set than most.)<br><br>Unlike domestic dogs, Dingos breed only once a year, do not bark, have permanently erect ears and are usually a sandy-peppered colour. They have a more independent temperament than dogs, and the skull is distinctive, with a narrower muzzle, larger auditory bullae, larger canine teeth, and a domed head.<br><br>Dingos did not arrive in Australia as companions of the original Aborigines around 50,000 years ago, but seem to have been brought by seafaring Austronesian traders at about the same time as the Great Pyramids were being built in ancient Egypt. A study of dingo mitochondrial DNA published in 2004 places their arrival at around 4000 BC, and suggests that only one small group may be the ancestors of all modern dingos.<br><br>The Dingo spread rapidly, probably with human assistance, and is thought to have occupied the entire continent within a short time. The full extent of the ecological change brought about by the introduction of the Dingo remains unknown, but there is little doubt that it was responsible for a series of extinctions, notably of marsupial carnivores, including the last remaining large predator, the Thylacine. (Note that the demise of the Australian megafauna took place more than 40,000 years before Dingos arrived and is believed to have been largely a result of human impact on an already fragile ecosystem.)<br><br>Aboriginal people across the continent adopted the Dingo as a companion animal, using it to assist with hunting, and for warmth on cold nights.<br><br>Wild Dingos prey on a variety of animals, mostly small or medium-sized, but also larger herbivores at need. Generally, Dingos live in small family groups, but they are capable of forming larger packs to hunt cooperatively. It is thought that this gave Dingos an important competitive advantage over the more solitary marsupial carnivores, particularly during Australia's frequent droughts (when game becomes scarce).<br><br>When European settlers first arrived in Australia, Dingos were tolerated, even welcomed at times. That changed rapidly when sheep became an important part of the white economy. Dingos were trapped, shot on sight, and poisonedÂ—often regardless of whether they were truly wild or belonged to Aboriginal people. In the 1880s, construction of the great Dingo Fence began. The Dingo Fence was designed to keep Dingos out of the relatively fertile south-east part of the continent (where they had largely been exterminated) and protect the sheep flocks of southern Queensland. It would eventually stretch 8,500 kilometres; from near Toowoomba through thousands of miles of arid country to the Great Australian Bight and be (at that time) the longest man-made structure in the world. It was only partly successful: Dingos can still be found in parts of the southern states to this day, and although the fence helped reduce losses of sheep to predators, this was counterbalanced by increased pasture competition from rabbits and kangaroos.<br><br>Dingoes have received bad publicity in recent years as a result of the highly publicised Azaria Chamberlain disappearance and also because of Dingo attacks on Fraser Island in Queensland. They are opportunistic carnivores, taking prey ranging in size from lizards and small rodents up to sheep and kangaroos. Unlike many feral dogs, Dingoes do not generally form packs; they more often travel in pairs or small family groups. While Dingo groups use defined home territories, these territories can overlap with those of other groups.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/Dingo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/300px-Dingo.jpg"></a><br><br>As a result of interbreeding with dogs introduced by European settlers, the purebred Dingo gene pool is being swamped. By the early 1990s, about a third of all wild Dingos in the south-east of the continent were hybrids, and although the process of interbreeding is less advanced in more remote areas, the extinction of the subspecies in the wild is considered inevitable.<br><br>The Australian National Kennel Council recognises the Dingo as a pure breed of dog and accepts the breed for showing in those states where it is legal to own. Most other Kennel Clubs, including the international Federation Cynologique Internationale, do not recognise or register Dingos.<br><br>Conservation status: Secure<br><br>Issue #38</div>

The ancient species of <span style="font-style: italic;">Bos nomadicus</span> cattle or even gaur may have contributed to the development of the zebus.

The resulting breed, which consists of 5/8 Charolais and 3/8 Zebu is called the Chanchim. It has a better meat quality than the zebu but better heat resistance than European cattle.

At around the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites. Though they are thought to be most closely related to either cassowaries or moa, their evolutionary origin is still uncertain. Several kiwi species are endangered. The kiwi is also a national symbol for New Zealand.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Kiwi.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Kiwi.jpg/180px-Kiwi.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Kiwi</strong>, genus Apteryx</span><br><br>Prior to the arrival of humans in about 1300, New Zealand's only endemic mammals were two species of bat (the long-tailed bat (<span style="font-style: italic;">Chalinolobus</span>) and the short-tailed bat (<span style="font-style: italic;">Mystacina</span>)). The ecological niches that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses, wolves and mice were taken up by birds (and, to a lesser extent, reptiles).<br><br>Kiwi are shy, nocturnal creatures with a highly developed sense of smell and, most unusual in a bird, nostrils at the end of their long, sharp bill. They feed by thrusting the bill into the ground in search of worms, insects, and other invertebrates; though they also take fruit and, if the opportunity arises, small crayfish, amphibians and eels.<br><br>Their adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive: like all ratites they have no keel on the bre<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>astbone to anchor wing muscles, and barely any wings either: the vestiges are so small that they are invisible under the kiwi's bristly, hair-like, two-branched feathers. While birds generally have hollow bones to save weight and make flight practicable, kiwi have marrow, in the style of mammals. With no constraints on weight from flight requirements, some Brown Kiwi females carry and lay a single 450 gram egg.<br><br>Currently there are three accepted species, one of which has two sub-species:<br><br>-- The <strong>North Island Brown Kiwi</strong>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Apteryx australis mantelli</span> is widespread in the northern two-thirds of the North Island and with about 35,000 remaining is the most common kiwi. Females stand about 400 mm high and weigh about 2.8 kg, the males about 2.2 kg. The North Island Brown has demonstrated a remarkable resilience: it adapts to a wide range of habitats, even non-native forests and some farmland. The plumage is streaky red-brown and spiky. The female usually lays two eggs, which are incubated by the male.<br><br>-- The <strong>Okarito Brown Kiwi</strong>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Apteryx australis australis</span>, is a recently identified sub-species of the North Island Brown, slightly smaller, with a greyish tinge to the plumage and sometimes white facial feathers. Females lay as many as three eggs in a season, each one in a different nest. Male and female both incubate.

A third distict population of the North Island Brown Kiwi is the Tokoeka, distributed in the in lowland forest to the north of Franz Josef glacier in the South Island.

Tuataras are endemic to New Zealand, and now live only on a small number of offshore islands. It has been classified as an endangered species since 1895. Tuatara, like many native New Zealand animals, are threatened by habitat loss, harvesting, and introduced species such as mustelids and rats.<br><br>There are two extant species: <span style="font-style: italic;">Sphenodon punctatus</span> and the much rarer <span style="font-style: italic;">Sphenodon guntheri</span>, or Brothers Island tuatara which is confined to The Brothers Islands in Cook Strait. These have olive skin with yellowish patches.<br><br><img src="http://reptilis.net/index4/punctatus.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Tuatara</strong>, Sphenodon punctatus</span><br><br>Though tuataras resemble lizards, the genus has several characteristics unique among reptiles. Its teeth are fused to its jaw bone; it has no external copulatory organs or earholes. Indeed, tuatara were originally classified as lizards in 1831 when the British Museum received a skull. The species remained misclassified until 1867, when Gunther (also at the British Museum) noted certain bird-like, turtle-like, and crocodile-like features and proposed the order Rhynchocephalia for the tuatara and its fossile relatives.<br><br>The name tuatara derives from the Maori language, meaning "spiny back". Tuatara feature in a number of indigenous legends. They are held as ariki (God forms). Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster. MÃ¢ori women are forbidden to eat tuatara.<br><br>Tuatara thrive in much lower temperatures than are tolerated by most reptiles, preferring temperatures of 16Â–21Â°C (60Â–70Â°F); temperatures over 27Â°C (80Â°F) are fatal. Adults are about 50 cm long and weigh between 500 and 1,000 grams. Tuatara are notoriously cryptic, and hibernate in winter. Adults are terrestrial and nocturnal, but hatchlings are arboreal and diurnal (likely because the adults are known to eat younger tuatara).<br><br>Tuatara are extremely long-lived, with individuals commonly living for over a century. They reproduce very slowly: tuataras take at least ten years to reach sexual maturity, females only lay eggs once every four years, and it takes between 12 and 15 months after copulation for a new tuatara to hatch from its egg. The sex of the hatchling depends on the temperature of the egg, with warmer eggs tending to produce male tuatara, and cooler eggs producing females. Tuatara continue to grow larger for the first thirty-five years of their lives, and they can hold their breath for over an hour.<br><br>Like some lizards, the tuatara has a third eye on the top of its head. In adult animals, a scale grows over the eye, and its purpose is unknown. It may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to manufacture vitamin D.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Tuatara.jpg"><br><br>Issue #41</div>

The California Tiger Salamander has protruding eyes with black irises.<br><br><strong>Habitat and range</strong><br><br>The California Tiger Salamander is endemic to California. Because it depends on water for reproduction, its habitat is limited to the vicinity of large, fishless vernal pools or similar water bodies. It occurs at elevations up to 1,000 m (3,200 ft).<br><br>It occurs in California in Sonoma County and Santa Barbara County, in vernal pool complexes and isolated ponds along the Central Valley from Colusa County to Kern County, and in sag ponds in the coastal range. Both the Sonoma and Santa Barbara populations are listed as endangered since 2000 and 2003, respectively. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is currently campaigning to list all the populations as threatened.

After building a nest, the female wasp captures several spiders or insects. The captured prey are stung and paralyzed before being placed in the nest, and then a single egg is deposited on the prey within each cell. The wasp then seals the cell with mud. After finishing a series of cells, she leaves and does not return. Eventually, the hatching larvae will eat the prey and emerge from the nest.<br><br>Mud daubers very rarely, if ever, sting people or animals. Even when thoroughly agitated or aroused, they are not likely to sting. Because of their calm tempers and ability to control the insect and spider population, many people respect them. In many rural areas of the southern United States, killing a mud dauber without reason is considered cruel and silly.<br><br>Issue #43</div>

The breed is a naturally occurring one from New England. Cold New England winters have made this cat very well adapted to cold weather. The name comes from a legend that a domestic cat released in the wilds of Maine interbred with a raccoon, resulting in offspring with the Maine Coon characteristics. Maine Coons resemble their European counterparts, the Norwegian Forest Cats.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/White_Maine_Coon.jpg/566px-White_Maine_Coon.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/White_Maine_Coon.jpg/250px-White_Maine_Coon.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Maine Coon</strong></span><br><br><strong>Physical characteristics</strong><br><br>Maine Coons are very large, but energetic cats, often weighing over 10 kilograms (22 pounds). The most common color in the breed is tabby markings, but all coat colors exist. They have medium-long, dense fur, with longer hair, or ruff, on their chests and a pronounced mane, similar to a lion. Their fur consists of two layers, with an additional layer of guard hairs. The fur is generally very soft. They have long hair on the backs of their legs, and between their toes, to assist keeping warm while in the snow. Their tails are bushy. Their heads are broad, the males' heads being larger than females', with wide-set ears that have tufts of fur in them.<br><br><strong>Behavioural characteristics</strong><br><br>Maine Coons are intelligent, dextrous, and playful. They have a tendency to use their front paws extensively (often curling the paw round to pick things up) and as a consequence will easily learn to open cabinet doors or pick small objects up. In addition to this, Maine Coons have a tendency to use their paws to knock on a surface to gain entry, much like a human would. They'll do this with a motion similar to vertical wiping strokes (top-down) with enough force at contact to produce a sound. If left outside or in another room, for example, they may employ this method to gain their owner's attention. Some Maine Coons will eat with their paws, rather than eating from the bowl itself. They can also be trained to play fetch. They are very curious, and will explore anywhere and everywhere possible. They are happy to stay indoors, as long as they have an adequate amount of playtime and exercise. While being a lap cat depends on the individual cat's own personality, most do enjoy being near their people, other cats and even dogs. Maine Coons are generally very quiet, not tending to meow much, unless they are hungry. Maine Coons do make a very distinct sound, called trilling, that is soft and high-pitched, usually used when happy or startled. Some Maine Coons enjoy playing with, but not usually in, water. They may dip toys in their water bowls before playing with them, or just tip the water bowl over. They may also "fish" in their water bowl. A few have been known to hop in the shower with their owner. The males tend to be quite goofy, and a bit clumsy, but in a good-natured way. Maine Coons can occasionally be a bit mischievous when bored, such as deliberately pushing things off tables and the tops of fridges with their paws, to see what happens.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/00/Ashesrey95reduced.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A Tabby-colored Maine Coon adult male (right) next to an average sized adult tortoiseshell mixed breed female.</span><br><br>Maine Coons have a tendency to be very independent - that is, they do not beg for attention as much as other breeds. As a result of this, they may encounter problems with another Maine Coon if it is not introduced into the household at the same time. Maine Coons can be described as the "king" of the house, having a tendency to keep other pets (cats and other species alike) in check at any given time. These cats will generally stand up to a dog many times their size, and "argue" with it.<br><br><strong>Grooming and cleaning</strong><br><br>Maine Coons need to be combed out once a week, to avoid mats in their fur, especially on their belly, in their armpits, and on the backs of their legs.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d9/Awoken_Enki.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Awoken_Enki.JPG/180px-Awoken_Enki.JPG"></a><br><br>Country of origin: United States<br><br>Issue #47</div>

The scientific name is somewhat misleading, as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tapirus indicus</span> is not native to India.<br><br><img src="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Images/Tapirus_indicus/T_indicus2.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Malayan Tapir</strong>, Tapirus indicus</span><br><br><strong>General Appearance and Characteristics</strong><br><br>The animal is easily identified by its markings, most notably the light-colored Â“saddleÂ” which extends from its shoulders to its rump. The rest of its hair is black, except for the tips of its ears which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. This pattern is for camouflage: the disrupted coloration makes it more difficult to recognize it as a tapir, and other animals may mistake it for a large rock rather than a form of prey when it is lying down to sleep.<br><br>Malayan Tapirs grow to between 6 and 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) in length, stand 3 to 3.5 feet (90 to 107 cm) tall, and typically weigh between 550 and 700 pounds (250 to 320 kg), although they can weigh upwards of 900 pounds (410 kg) on occasion. The females are usually larger than the males. Like the other types of tapir, they have small stubby tails and long, flexible proboscises. They have four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot. The Malayan Tapir has rather poor eyesight but excellent hearing and sense of smell.<br><br><strong>Lifecycle</strong><br><br>The gestation period of the Malayan Tapir is approximately 400 days, after which a single offspring, weighing around 15 pounds (6.8 kg), is born. Young tapirs of all species have brown hair with white stripes and spots, a pattern with enables them to hide effectively in the dappled light of the forest. This baby coat fades into adult coloration between four and seven months after birth. Weaning occurs between between six and eight months of age, at which time the babies are nearly full-grown, and the animals reach sexual maturity around age three. Breeding typically occurs in April, May or June, and females generally produce one calf every two years. Malayan Tapirs can live up to 30 years, both in the wild and in zoos.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br><br>Malayan Tapirs are primarily solitary creatures, marking out large tracts of land as their territory, though these areas usually overlap with those of other individuals. Tapirs mark out their territories by spraying urine on plants, and they often follow distinct paths which they have bulldozed through the undergrowth.<br><br>Exclusively vegetarian, the animal forages for the tender shoots and leaves of more than 100 species of plants (though it prefers around 30), moving slowly through the forest and pausing often to eat and note the scents left behind by other tapirs in the area. However, when threatened or frightened, the tapir can run quickly, despite its considerable bulk, and they can also defend themselves with their strong jaws and sharp teeth. Malayan Tapirs communicate with high-pitched squeaks and whistles. They usually prefer to live near water and often bathe and swim, and they are also able to climb steep slopes. Tapirs are mainly active at night, though they are not exclusively nocturnal. They tend to eat soon after sunset or before sunrise, and they will often nap in the middle of the night. This type of behavior characterizes them as crepuscular animals.<br><br><strong>Habitat, Predation, and Vulnerability</strong><br><br>The Malayan Tapir was once found throughout the tropical lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam. Due to human activity, especially deforestation for agricultural purposes as well as poaching and illegal trade, its habitat and numbers have decreased in recent years and, like all tapirs, it is in danger of extinction.<br><br><img src="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Images/Tapirus_indicus/T_indicus_map.gif"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Range of the Malayan Tapir</span><br><br>The species is officially recognized as Â“VulnerableÂ” under the 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. The exact number of Malayan Tapirs left in the wild is unknown, but many scientists estimate that there are approximately 3,000 individuals left in the wild and 200 in zoos worldwide. Tapirs are rarely hunted by animals other than humans, because their tough skin and good defenses make it difficult to harm a healthy adult. Leopards and tigers may attack calves, old adults, or ill individuals, but for the most part the threat to tapirs comes from humans.<br><br>Conservation status: Vulnerable<br><br>Issue #48</div>

This is a highly gregarious species, forming huge flocks in winter, and providing a spectacular sight as they descend into evening reed-bed roosts, often attracting birds of prey. Large roosts (exceptionally up to a million birds) can form in city centres, causing a great deal of mess from their droppings.<br><br>This is a hole-nesting species, and has impacted on native species where it has been introduced because of competition for nest sites.<br><br>This must be one of the most familiar of birds, with its shiny black plumage spangled with white. Confusion is only likely in Iberia in winter, when it has to be distinguished from the closely related Spotless Starling, which, as its name implies, has less spotting on its plumage. Adult males are less spotted below than adult females. Juveniles are dull brown, and by their first winter resemble adults but are browner especially on the head.<br><br>Starlings walk rather than hop. Their flight is quite strong and direct; they look triangular-winged and short-tailed in flight. In most of Europe, only the rarer and much paler Bohemian Waxwing shares this flight profile. This is a noisy bird, and a good mimic, like many of its family. In captivity, they are gregarious and love to imitate all types of sounds and speech, earning them the nickname "Poor-man's Myna". Information on care of Starlings as well as recordings of a Starling talking can be found at <a href="http://www.starlingcentral.net" rel="nofollow">Starling Central</a>.<br><br>Although there are approximately 200 million starlings in North America, they are all descendants of approximately 100 birds released in Central Park in the 1890s from Europeans. These starlings have created an evolutionary problem in North America since the starling prey has not adapted any type of defense instincts. This is what makes the European Starlings severely overpopulated and the birds can now be found all through North America and Alaska.<br><br>Issue #49</div>

Imagines have a size of 2.5 to 3 cm (1 to 1.2 inches). They are black, with red eyes and yellow or orange stripes on the underside. The wings are translucent and have orange veins.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/Magicicada_young.jpg/800px-Magicicada_young.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/Magicicada_young.jpg/200px-Magicicada_young.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Magicicadas</strong> (both teneral and fully developed).</span><br><br>They are harmless animals; they neither bite nor sting. They are not poisonous, and there is no evidence that they transmit diseases. They generally do not pose a threat to vegetation, but young plants may be damaged by excessive feeding or egg laying. It is thus advised not to plant new trees or shrubs just before an emergence of the periodical cicadas. Mature plants usually do not suffer lasting damage even by a mass-emergence.<br><br><strong>Broods</strong><br><br>Periodical cicadas are grouped into thirty <span style="font-style: italic;">broods</span>, based on the year they emerge. Broods are numbered using Roman numerals; broods I-XVII are the seventeen-year cicadas, while broods XVIII-XXX are the thirteen-year cicadas. Some broods are not known to exist, but they are retained in the numbering scheme for convenience.<br><br>Brood IX emerged in 2003. Brood X, a seventeen year brood stretching from New York to North Carolina on the East Coast to Illinois and Michigan, emerged in May 2004. Brood X is the largest of the broods of the periodical cicadas. No broods are expected to emerge in 2005 or 2006. The next brood to emerge is Brood XIII -- the Northern Illinois Brood. After a seventeen-year hiatus, this brood is scheduled to emerge in 2007.<br><br>The next thirteen-year brood to emerge will be Brood XIX in 2011 in Maryland and Virginia.<br><br>Brood VII is an isolated population in upstate New York and consists only of <span style="font-style: italic;">M. septendecim</span>. It emerged in 2001, and hence its next emergence will be in 2018.<br><br><strong>Life Cycle</strong><br><br>The nymphs of the periodical cicadas live underground, at depths of 30 cm (one foot) or more, feeding on the juices of plant roots. They stay immobile and go through five development stages before constructing an exit tunnel in the spring of their 13th or 17th year. These exit tunnels have a diameter of about 1-1.5 cm (Â½ in.)<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/27/Magicicada_emergence_holes.jpg/800px-Magicicada_emergence_holes.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/27/Magicicada_emergence_holes.jpg/200px-Magicicada_emergence_holes.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Emergence holes</span><br><br>The nymphs emerge at an evening when the soil temperature is above 17Â°C (63 F) and climb to a suitable place on the nearby vegetation to complete their transformation into an adult cicada. They molt one last time and then spend about six days in the leaves waiting for their exoskeleton to harden completely. Just after this final molt, the teneral adults are white, but darken within an hour.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/20040515_083441_1_crop2.jpg/666px-20040515_083441_1_crop2.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/20040515_083441_1_crop2.jpg/200px-20040515_083441_1_crop2.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Magicicadas molting</span><br><br>The nymphs emerge in large numbers at about the same time, sometimes more than one million individuals per acre (250/mÂ²). Their mass-emergence is a survival trait called "predator satiation": for the first week after emergence, the periodic cicadas are an easy prey for reptiles, birds, squirrels, cats, and other small and large mammals. The cicadas' survival strategy is simply to overwhelm predators by their sheer numbers, ensuring the survival of most of the individuals and thus of the species.<br><br>Adult periodical cicadas live only for a few weeksÂ—by mid-July, they'll all be gone. Their short life has one sole purpose: reproduction. The males "sing" a mating song; like other cicadas, they produce loud sounds using their tymbal. The sounds of a "chorus"Â—a group of malesÂ—can be deafening and reach 100 dB.<br><br>After mating, the male weakens and dies. The female lives a little longer in order to lay eggs: it makes between six and 20 V-shaped slits in the bark of young twigs and deposits up to 600 eggs there. Shortly afterwards, the female also dies. After about six to ten weeks, the eggs hatch and the newborn nymphs drop to the ground, where they burrow and begin another 13 or 17-year cycle.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/Cicada_egg_slits_20040606_200213_1.jpg/800px-Cicada_egg_slits_20040606_200213_1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/Cicada_egg_slits_20040606_200213_1.jpg/200px-Cicada_egg_slits_20040606_200213_1.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Magicicadas egg slits (circled in red)</span><br><br>Issue #52</div>

"vampire squid from hell", is a small, deep-sea cirrate (finned) cephalopod found throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world. Unique retractile sensory filaments justify the vampire squid's placement in its own order of Vampyromorphida (formerly Vampyromorpha), sharing similarities with both squid and octopuses. As a phylogenetic relic it is the only surviving member of its order, first described and mistakenly identified as an octopus in 1903 by German teuthologist Carl Chun.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/Vampyroteuthis_illustration.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Vampyroteuthis_illustration.jpg/250px-Vampyroteuthis_illustration.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A <strong>Vampire Squid</strong>, Vampyroteuthis infernalis, drawn by Carl Chun, 1903.</span><br><br><strong>Physical description</strong><br><br>At a maximum 30 cm (1 foot) in total length, the vampire squid is of no threat to humans. Its 15 cm (6 inch) gelatinous body appears velvety jet-black, red, purple or brown, depending on location and lighting conditions. A webbing of skin connects its eight arms, each lined with rows of fleshy spines or cirri. Only the distal half (farthest from the body) of the arms have suckers. Its limpid, globular eyesÂ—which appear red or blue, also depending on lightingÂ—are proportionately the largest in the animal kingdom at 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter.<br><br>Mature adults have a pair of ear-like fins projecting from the lateral sides of the mantle. These fins serve as the adult's primary means of propulsion: vampire squid are said to "fly" through the water by way of flapping their fins. Their powerful beak-like jaws are as white as ivory. Within the webbing are two pouches wherein the tactile velar filaments are concealed. The filaments are analogous to a true squid's tentacles, extending well past the arms.<br><br>The vampire squid is covered entirely in light-producing organs called photophores. The animal has great control over the organs, capable of producing disorienting flashes of light for fractions of a second to several minutes in duration. The intensity and size of the photophores can also be modulated. Appearing as small white discs, the photophores are larger and more complex at the tips of the arms and at the base of the two fins, but are absent from the underside of the caped arms.<br><br>The chromatophores (pigment organs) common to most cephalopods are poorly developed in vampire squid. While this means the animal is not capable of changing their skin colour in the dramatic fashion of shallow-dwelling cephalopods, such trickery is not needed at the pitch black depths in which it lives.<br><br><strong>Habitat and adaptations</strong><br><br>The vampire squid is an extreme example of a deep-sea cephalopod, thought to reside at aphotic (lightless) depths from 600-900 metres (2,000-3,000 feet) or more. Within this region of the world's oceans is a discrete habitat known as the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Within the OMZ oxygen saturation is too low to support aerobic metabolism in most higher organisms. Nonetheless, the vampire squid is able to live and breathe normally in the OMZ at oxygen saturations as low as 3%; a feat no other cephalopodÂ—and few other animalsÂ—can claim.<br><br>In order to cope with life in the suffocating depths, vampire squid have developed several radical adaptations. Of all deep-sea cephalopods, their mass-specific metabolic rate is the lowest. Their blue blood's hemocyanin binds and transports oxygen most efficiently, aided by gills with especially large surface area. The animals have weak musculature but maintain agility and buoyancy with little effort thanks to sophisticated statocysts (balancing organs akin to a human's inner ear) and ammonium-rich gelatinous tissues closely matching the density of the surrounding seawater.<br><br>At the shallower end of the vampire squid's vertical range, the view from below is like the sky at twilight: The highly sensitive eyes of deepwater denizens are able to distinguish the silhouettes of other animals moving overhead. To combat this, the vampire squid generates its own bluish light (bioluminescence) in a strategy called counterillumination: The light diffuses the animal's silhouette, effectively "cloaking" its presence from the watchful eyes below. Its own large eyes detect even the faintest of gleams. A pair of photoreceptors are located atop its head, perhaps alerting the animal to movements above.<br><br>Like other deep-sea cephalopods, vampire squid lack ink sacs. If threatened, instead of ink, a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light is ejected from the arm tips. This luminous barrage, which may last nearly 10 minutes, is presumably meant to daze would-be predators and allow the vampire squid to disappear into the blackness without the need to swim far. The display is made only if the animal is very agitated; regenerating the mucus is costly.<br><br>Issue #54</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Vampire Squid - Cont'd</strong></span><br><br><strong>Development</strong><br><br>Few specifics are known regarding the ontogeny of the vampire squid. Their development progresses through three morphologic forms: the very young animals have a single pair of fins, an intermediate form has two pairs, and the mature form again has one. As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops, the fins are resized and repositioned in order to maximize gait efficiency. Whereas the young propel themselves primarily by jet propulsion, mature adults find flapping their fins to be the most efficient means. This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past, with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families.<br><br>If hypotheses may be drawn from knowledge of other deep-sea cephalopods, the vampire squid likely reproduces slowly by way of a small number of large eggs. Growth is slow as nutrients are not abundant at depths frequented by the animals. The vastness of their habitat and its sparse population make procreative encounters a fortuitous event. The female may store a male's hydraulically implanted spermatophore (a sort of tapered, cylindrical satchel of sperm) for long periods before she is ready to fertilize her eggs. Once she does, she may need to brood over them for up to 400 days before they hatch. The female will not eat towards this culmination and dies shortly thereafter.<br><br>Hatchlings are c. 8 mm in length and are well-developed miniatures of the adults, with some differences. Their arms lack webbing, their eyes are smaller and their velar filaments are not fully formed. The hatchlings are transparent and survive on a generous internal yolk for an unknown period before they begin to actively feed. The smaller animals frequent much deeper waters, perhaps feeding on marine snow (falling organic detritus).<br><br><strong>Behaviour</strong><br><br>What behavioural data known has been gleaned from ephemeral encounters with ROVs; animals are often damaged during capture and survive for no more than about two months in aquaria. An artificial environment makes reliable observation of non-defensive behaviour difficult.<br><br>With their long velar filaments deployed, vampire squid have been observed drifting along in the deep, black ocean currents. If the filaments contact an entity, or if vibrations impinge upon them, the animals investigate with rapid acrobatic movements. They are capable of swimming at speeds equivalent to two body lengths per second, with an acceleration time of five seconds. However, their weak muscles limit stamina considerably.<br><br>Unlike their deep-sea relatives, cephalopods living in more hospitable climes can afford to expend energy in protracted flight. Vampire squid must use innovative predator avoidance tactics in order to conserve energy. Their aforementioned bioluminescent "fireworks" are combined with the writhing of glowing arms, erratic movements and escape trajectories, making it difficult for a predator to home in.<br><br>In a threat response called "pumpkin posture," the vampire squid inverts its caped arms back over the body, presenting an ostensibly larger form covered in unappetizing spines. The underside of the cape is heavily pigmented, masking most of the body's photophores. The glowing arm tips are clustered together far above the animal's head, diverting attack away from critical areas. If a predator were to bite off an arm tip, the vampire squid can regenerate it.<br><br>Copepods, prawns and cnidarians have all been reported as prey of vampire squid. Little else is known regarding their feeding habits, but considering their environment, a fussy palate is unlikely. Vampire squid have been found among the stomach contents of large deepwater fish, deep diving whales and pinnipeds such as sea lions.<br><br><img src="http://www.smithsonianmag.si.edu/smithsonian/issues96/may96/images/vampire.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.smithsonianmag.si.edu/smithsonian/issues96/may96/images/vampireinverted.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fins look like ears (top) on the "vampire squid from hell."

Cockers have been a highly popular American breed since the 1940s, occupying the top position in number of American Kennel Club registrations in many years.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/ACS700.jpeg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/ACS700.jpeg/180px-ACS700.jpeg"></a><br><br>Alternative name: Cocker Spaniel<br>Country of origin: United States<br><br>Issue #56</div>

The word orangutan is derived from the Malay orang hutan meaning man of the forest. They are the only extant species in the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Pongo</span> and the subfamily Ponginae, although that subfamily also includes the extinct <span style="font-style: italic;">Gigantopithecus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sivapithecus</span> genera.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Orangutan.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Orangutan.jpg/200px-Orangutan.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">An <strong>orangutan</strong>, genus Pongo</span><br><br>Orangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes, spending nearly all of their time in the trees. They are only found in rainforests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. These two small isolated populations were classified as subspecies until recently, when they were elevated to full specific level (<span style="font-style: italic;">Pongo pygmaeus</span> on Borneo, and <span style="font-style: italic;">P. abelii</span> on Sumatra). Furthermore, primatologists now recognise three subspecies of the Bornean orangutan: <span style="font-style: italic;">P. p. pygmaeus</span> in northwest Borneo, <span style="font-style: italic;">P. p. morio</span> in northeast and east Borneo, and <span style="font-style: italic;">P. p. wurmbii</span> in southwest Borneo.<br><br>Orangutans are highly endangered in the wild. Orangutan habitat destruction due to logging, mining and forest fires has been increasing rapidly in the last decade. Much of this activity is illegal, occurring in national parks that are officially off limits to loggers, miners and plantation development. There is also a major problem with the illegal trapping of baby orangutans for sale into the pet trade; the trappers usually kill the mother to steal the baby.<br><br>Like the other great apes, orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the mid-1990s, one population of orangutans was found to use feeding tools regularly. Evidence of this had been earlier discovered among chimpanzees by Jane Goodall in the 1960s. A 2003 paper in the journal Science described the evidence for distinct orangutan cultures (see <a href="http://www.duke.edu/%7Emym1/ouculturesPR.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a>). Orangutans are generally among the least aggressive among the apes, being friendly animals. Particularly notable is that wild orangutans are known to visit human-run facilities for orphaned young orangutans released from illegal captivity, interacting with the orphans and probably helping them adapt in their return to living in the wild.<br><br>Major conservation centres in Borneo include those at Semenggok in Sarawak, and Sepilok near Sandakan in Sabah.<br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #57</div>

The shape of the carapace and other morphological features are indicative of the terrain the animal inhabits. Highland areas with lush vegetation near the ground are normally home to tortoises with domed shells; these animals have restricted upward head movement due to shorter necks, and tend to have shorter limbs as well (see photo). Coastal regions with less vegetation at ground level are inhabited by tortoises with saddle-back shells; their extended necks and limbs help them to reach food higher off the ground.

They mostly live hidden in the ground which makes them the least explored order of amphibians, and widely unknown.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/Cae23232s.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/200px-Cae23232s.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Caecilian</strong>, order Gymnophiona or Apoda</span><br><br><strong>Anatomy</strong><br><br>Caecilians' feet have degenerated, making the smaller species resemble worms, while the larger species with lengths up to 1.5 m resemble snakes. The tail is also very short, so the cloaca is near the end of the body. Their skin is smooth and usually dark-matt, but many species also have colorful skins. Inside the skin are calcite scales, which suggests that they are related with the fossil Stegocephalia. However the scales are now believed to be a secondary development, and not directly inherited from Stegocephalia. Due to their underground life the eyes are small and covered by skin for protection, which have led to the misconception that they are blind. However due to the skin cover their visual sense is limited to simple dark-light perception. All Caecilians share two tentacles at their head, which are probably used for the olfactory sense additional to the normal nose.<br><br>Except one lungless species - <span style="font-style: italic;">Typhlonectes eiselti</span>, only known from one specimen collected somewhere in South America - all Caecilians have lungs, but also use the skin or the mouth for oxygen absorption. Often the left lung is much smaller than the right one, an adaptation to the body shape also found in snakes.<br><br><strong>Distribution</strong><br><br>Caecilians are found in most of the tropic areas of South-East Asia, Africa and South America, except the dry areas and the high mountains. In South America their distribution extends well into the temperate north of Argentina. For central Africa no systematic search has been done yet, but it is likely Caecilians are found all over the tropical rainforest there.<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>Caecilians are the only order of amphibians which only use internal insemination. The male Caecilians have a penis-like organ, the phallodeum, which is inserted into the cloaca of the female for 2 to 3 hours. About 25% of the species are oviparous; the eggs are guarded by the female. For some species the young Caecilians are already metamorphed when they hatch, other hatch as larvae. The larvae aren't fully aquatic, but spend the daytime in the soil near the water.<br><br>75% of the species are viviparous, that means they give birth to already developed offspring. The fetus is fed inside the female with special cells of the oviduct, which are eaten by the fetus with special scraping teeth.<br><br><strong>Origin of the name</strong><br><br>The name <span style="font-style: italic;">Caecilian</span> derives from the Latin word <span style="font-style: italic;">caecus</span> = blind, referring to the small or sometimes non-existing eyes. The name dates back to the taxonomic name of the first species described by Carolus Linnaeus, which he gave the name <span style="font-style: italic;">Caecilia tentaculata</span>. The taxonomic name of the order derives from the Greek words <span style="font-style: italic;">gymnos</span> = naked and <span style="font-style: italic;">ophio</span> = snake, as the Caecilians were originally thought to be related with snakes.<br><br><strong>Taxonomy</strong><br><br>Taxonomically the Caecilians are divided into 5 families. The species numbers have to be taken with care, as many of the species are described after only one specimen. Probably not all species have been described yet, however some of the described different species might turn out to be normal variations inside one species.<br><br>- Beaked Caecilians (Rhinatrematidae) - 2 genera, 9 species<br>- Fish Caecilians (Ichthyophiidae) - 2 genera, 39 species<br>- Indian Caecilians (Uraeotyphlidae) - 1 genus, 5 species<br>- Tropical Caecilians (Scolecomorphidae) - 2 genera, 6 species<br>- Common Caecilians (Caeciliidae) - 26 genera, 107 species<br><br><strong>Miscellany</strong><br><br>Large Caecilians dubbed "ingots" plagued the French occupation of Indochina in the years before the Vietnam war.

Murine typhus (endemic typhus) fever, and in some cases tapeworms can also be transmitted by fleas.<br><br><strong>Life Cycle</strong><br><br>Fleas pass through a complete life cycle consisting of egg, larva, pupa and adult. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months depending on the temperature, humidity, food, and species. Normally after a blood meal, the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day Â– up to 600 in its lifetime Â– usually on the host (dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, humans, etc.).

Outdoor development occurs in sandy gravel soils (moist sand boxes, dirt crawlspace under the house, under shrubs, etc.) where the host may rest or sleep. Sand and gravel are very suitable for larval development which is the reason fleas are erroneously called "sand fleas."<br><br>Larvae are blind, avoid light, pass through three larval instars and take a week to several months to develop. Their food consists of digested blood from adult flea feces, dead skin, hair, feathers, and other organic debris; larvae do not suck blood. Pupae mature to adulthood within a silken cocoon woven by the larva to which pet hair, carpet fiber, dust, grass cuttings, and other debris adheres. In about five to fourteen days, adult fleas emerge or may remain resting in the cocoon until the detection of vibration (pet and people movement), pressure (host animal lying down on them), heat, noise, or carbon dioxide (meaning a potential blood source is near).
