It is a large, brightly colored and active butterfly, rarely seen at rest; its wingspan is 7 to 10 cm, and its wings are yellow with black stripes, and in addition it has blue and orange spots near its tail. It has the "tails" on the hind wings that are often found in swallowtails.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/WesternTigerSwallowtail01.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/WesternTigerSwallowtail01.jpg/250px-WesternTigerSwallowtail01.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Western Tiger Swallowtail</strong>, Papilio rutulus</span><br><br>The eggs are deep green, shiny and spherical. They are laid singly, on the undersides of leaves. The caterpillars emerge about four days later. They are bright green, with a pair of large yellow eyespots with black and blue pupils. They can feed on the leaves of a variety of trees, and the predominant foodplant varies across their range; trees commonly used include cottonwood, willow, quaking aspen and many others. The caterpillars molt 5 times, eventually reaching a length of up to 5 cm before pupating. In summer, the butterfly can emerge as little as 15 days after the caterpillar pupated, but when the caterpillar pupates in the fall, the butterfly will not emerge until the spring. The chrysalis is green in summer and dark brown in winter, and looks like a piece of wood. Butterflies emerge from winter chrysalises between February and May, the date depending on the temperature, so they are seen earlier in the more southerly and more coastal parts of their range. The adult females lay up to a hundred eggs in total. The males often congregate, along with other species of swallowtail at pools and along streams and rivers; they drink from the water and mud, extracting minerals as well as moisture.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Papilio_rutulus_400.jpg"><br><br>The normal range of the Western Tiger Swallowtail covers much of western North America, from British Columbia to North Dakota in the north to Baja California and New Mexico in the south. Individuals occasionally turn up east of this range; however, in general, in eastern North America, it is replaced by the similar Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, <span style="font-style: italic;">Papilio glaucus</span>.<br><br>Like the other tiger swallowtails, the Western Tiger Swallowtail was formally classified in genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Pterourus</span>, but modern classifications all agree in placing them within <span style="font-style: italic;">Papilio</span>.<br><br>Conservation status: Secure<br><br>Issue #257</div>

They are distinguished by having photophores (which they use to attract prey and after which they are named, reminding some of a naval uniform's buttons) and four lateral lines. Typical midshipman fishes, such as the Plainfin Midshipman, are nocturnal and bury themselves in sand or mud of the intertidal zone during the day. At night they float just above the seabed. Some species are armed with venomous dorsal spines and are capable of inflicting serious injuries if handled.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/48/Midshipman_fish.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://img367.imageshack.us/img367/1245/300pxmidshipmanfish8et.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys porosissimus, a species of <strong>Midshipman fish</strong>.</span><br><br>Mating in midshipman fishes depends on auditory communication; males during the breeding season broadcast a sound usually described as a hum, generated by rapid contractions of the muscles in the swim bladder. The sound can be kept up for up to an hour, and is loud enough to be heard by (and to puzzle) people on nearby land and houseboats; the hulls of the boats tend to amplify the sound to sleep-disrupting levels. Reproductive females develop a selective sensitivity to this sound, and respond by laying eggs in the rock nest of a singing male.<br><br>Researchers from the University of Washington and Cornell University have recently demonstrated that the increase in sensitivity associated with female reproductive status can be duplicated in non-reproductive females of the Plainfin Midshipman (<span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys notatus</span>) by boosting hormone levels, and that this acts on the fish's inner-ear to produce the change in sensitivity. An increase in levels of the hormones testosterone and estradiol triggers changes that result in increased sensitivity to higher sound frequencies.<br><br>There are about 15 species of midshipman fishes, including the following:<br><br>* Atlantic Midshipman <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys plectrodon</span><br>* Daisy Midshipman <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys margaritatus</span><br>* Darkedge Midshipman <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys analis</span><br>* Greene's Midshipman <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys greenei</span><br>* Mimetic Midshipman <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys mimeticus</span><br>* Plainfin Midshipman, Humming Toadfish, or California Canary Fish <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys notatus</span><br>* Saddle Midshipman <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys ephippiatus</span><br>* Smalleye Midshipman <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys oculellus</span><br>* Specklefin Midshipman <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys myriaster</span><br>* <span style="font-style: italic;">Porichthys bathoiketes<br>* Porichthys kymosemeum<br>* Porichthys oculofrenum<br>* Porichthys pauciradiatus<br>* Porichthys porosissimus<br>* Porichthys queenslandiae</span><br><br>Issue #258</div>

Other species found in the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurelia</span> besides <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> are: <span style="font-style: italic;">A. labiata</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">A. limbata</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurelia sp</span>. They can be found in the Atlantic Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and are common to the waters off California, Japan, the East Coast of the United States as well as Europe. The animal can be large (up to 15 cm across), translucent and often considered beautiful for the patterns of color within its body. It feeds by stinging small medusans, plankton and mollusks with its tentacles and bringing them into its body for digestion, but is capable of only limited motion; like other jellies it drifts with the current.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Aureliaauritakils.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/Aureliaauritakils.jpg/200px-Aureliaauritakils.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Moon Jelly</strong>, Aurelia aurita</span><br><br><strong>General biology</strong><br><br>The cosmopolitan <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurelia aurita</span> is found throughout the tropics and as far north as 70Â° latitude and as far south as 40Â°. (J.E. Purcell, et al. 2001). In addition to frequenting the North American coast, they are usually found all around the coasts of the British Isles (Russell, 1953). In general, <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> is an inshore species that can be found in places like estuaries and harbors (Russell, 1953). They live in ocean water temperatures that range from -6Â° to 31Â° Celsius; with optimum temperatures of 9-19Â° Celsius (Rodriguez, 1996). <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> prefers mildly cold salt water with consistent currents (Rodriguez, 1996). They can be found in 3% salinity water but are typically found only in water with 6% salinity (Russell, 1953).<br><br><strong>Life cycle</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> first starts out with an ovum from a female medusa and a sperm from a different medusa to form a zygote (Gilbertson, 1999). The zygote then turns into a blastula, then gastrula, and then planula (Gilbertson, 1999).<br><br>The planula settles on the bottom and attaches itself onto a reef for a while (Gilbertson, 1999). The planula then grows and changes into a small polyp called a scyphistoma. The scyphistoma grows and becomes a strobila with small buds on the top layers. Each of the buds breaks off and forms an ephyra. The ephyra enlarges and matures to become the last stage, adult medusa. The strobila stage can reproduce by asexual fission (Gilbertson, 1999).<br><br>From mid July to October is when the growth of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> at its highest. The ephyra and medusa stage can last approximately 14 months, although some medusae die earlier in the winter (Aria, 1997).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> has a complicated life cycle that has two main stages. In the polyp stage they reproduce asexually while the medusa stage they reproduce sexually.<br><br>The major tolerance and adaptability of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> explains its presence worldwide. Medusae appear more frequently in shallow water that is open to the ocean with limited waves. The intermediate planula stage generally stays in water that is around 20 feet deep. The scyphistomas can be located in mussel beds. <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> medusae can survive in polluted, nutrient-poor, and airless environments. The polyps can survive in oxygen levels that are three times normal for several days, giving them a higher chance of living in case of a sudden change in the water oxygen.<br><br><strong>Feeding</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> species feed on zooplankton that includes organisms such as "mollusks, crustaceans, tunicate larvae, copepods, rotifers, nematodes, young polychaetes, protozoans, diatoms, eggs, fish eggs, and other small jellies." (Rodriguez, 1996). Occasionally, they would be seen feeding on hydromedusa and ctenophores (Rodriguez, 1996). Larvae of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> have special nematocysts to capture prey and also to protect themselves from predators (Arai, 1997). The food is tied with mucus, and then it passed down by ciliated action down into the gastrovascular cavity where digestive enzymes from serous cell would break down the food (Arai, 1997). There is little known about the requirements for particular vitamins and minerals, but due to the presence of some digestive enzymes, we can deduce in general that <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> species consume carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids (Arai, 1997).<br><br><strong>Body system</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> does not have respiratory parts such as gills, lungs, or trachea. Since it is a small organism, it respires by diffusing oxygen from water through the thin membrane. Within the gastrovascular cavity, low oxygenated water can be expelled and high oxygenated water can come in by ciliated action, thus increasing the diffusion of oxygen through cell (Rees, 1966). The large surface area membrane to volume ratio helps <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> to diffuse more oxygen and nutrients into the cells.<br><br>The basic body plan of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> consists of several parts. The species lack respiratory, excretory, and circulatory systems (Arai, 1997). The adult medusa of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span>, with a transparent look, has an umbrella margin membrane and tentacles that are attached to the bottom (Russell, 1953). It has four bright circular gonads that are under the stomach (J.E. Purcell, et al. 2001). Food travels through the muscular manubrium while the radial canals help disperse the food (Russell 1963). There is a middle layer of mesoglea, gastrodervascular cavity with gastrodermis, and epidermis (Solomon, 2002). There is a nerve net that is responsible for contractions in swimming muscles and feeding responses (Aria, 1997). Adult medusa can have a diameter up to 40 cm (Arai, 1997). The sexes are can be differentiated between males and females in the medusa stage (Arai, 1997). The young stage, planula, has small ciliated cells and would settle at the bottom of the water where it would change into strobila and then float off as ephyra (Gilbertson, 1999). There is an increasing size from starting stage planula to ephyra, from less than 1 cm in planula stage to 1 cm in ephyra stage (Russell, 1953).<br><br><strong>Predators</strong><br><br>The death of the organism sometimes is brought about after reproduction, leaving the gonads open to infection and degradation (Arai, 1997). <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> have been food for a wide variety of predators including the Ocean Sunfish (<span style="font-style: italic;">Mola mola</span>), the Loggerhead Sea Turtle (<span style="font-style: italic;">Caretta caretta</span>), and the hydromedusae (<span style="font-style: italic;">Aequorea victoria</span>) (Arai, 1997).<br><br>Another cause of death is by fisheries of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> for food in countries such as China, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. They are hunted by birds also. They defend themselves by stinging with their tentacles (Arai, 1997).<br><br>There are possible metazoan parasites that attack <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> (Arai, 1997).<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Aurelia aurita</span> interaction</strong><br><br>Beside from being a source of food for human consumption, <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> species also "represent an important step in pelagic organic matter transformations<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>" (Rodriguez, 1996). On the bad side, <span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurita</span> species could ruin the fish markets for human, creating a tidal effect that may hurt the fish population either indirectly or directly by feeding on fish larvae (Arai, 1997).<br><br>Issue #259</div>

Australia. Hence an arboreal reconstruction with leopard-like appearance is presented. An alternative interpretation has thylacoleonids arising from Vombatid stock. In this case they would have been more closely related to modern day wombats than to possums. That ancestry would, presumably, leave them looking not quite so feline in appearance.<br><br>The dentition of this animal was unique. It had no canine teeth as do placental predators like wolves or lions. Instead it was equipped with very large incisors and extremely specialised carnassial teeth. These had become blade-like cutting edges, two pairs only being positioned on the upper and lower jaws. It has been asserted that <span style="font-style: italic;">T. carnifex</span>'s dentition represents the most extreme specialisation of any known mammalian carnivore.<br><br>The front paws of <span style="font-style: italic;">T. carnifex</span> were equipped with a partly opposable thumb. The terminal phalanx of the thumb sported an impressively large, curved claw, while the other digits had smaller claws. The rear feet were equipped with similarly opposable thumbs. It's probably true to say that this was an animal equipped with four hands, rather than paws, and that it almost certainly was primarily an arboreal hunter. However, fossil specimens have been unearthed in areas which were open plains when the animal lived. So it appears to have been resourceful enough to make a living with or without a forest habitat.<br><br>Variation in the size of fossil remains are usually interpreted to mean that males of the species were bigger than females. Sexual dimorphism is common in many mammalian species, for instance kangaroos, lions and seals. It generally indicates a breeding system where males must defeat and dispossess other more dominant males for access to females. In such species, mature males are often fewer in number than breeding-age females.<br><br>Generally speaking, fossil <span style="font-style: italic;">T. carnifex</span> presents as a large animal which exhibited a wide range in body size. Fossil evidence suggests that an average individual would have weighed about 45 kg. The largest specimens, which were just a shade smaller than the African lioness, <span style="font-style: italic;">Panthera leo</span>, appear to have lived in south-eastern Australia.<br><br>Pound for pound, the Marsupial Lion had the strongest bite of any mammal species living or extinct; a 100 kg Marsupial Lion, had a bite comparable to that of a 250 kg African Lion and is thought to have hunted large animals such as diprotodonts.<br><br>Conservation status: Prehistoric<br><br>Issue #260</div>

At night, the mother opens the entrance to the hole, while watching for predators (like venomous snakes), and then nurses its young, after which it closes the hole with dirt and plant material by thumping on it with its front paws. Amami Rabbits sleep during the day in hidden places, such as caves. Amami Rabbits are also noted for making calling noises, which sound something like the call of a pika; this makes them unique as most rabbits cannot make calling noises.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Amami Rabbit is endangered, because of hunting, which ended when Japan gave the rabbit legal protection in 1921, but also because of deforestation and killings by dogs, cats, and other animals introduced by humans, which continue today.

They form complex organizations through their simple intelligence to emerge as an elaborate social structure. At first the queen ant lays her eggs among tree leaves while the worker ants engage in building the nest. This emergent ant society helps in building the nest by weaving together living tree leaves. This is done by first forming ant chains that hold together leaves and then manipulating the ant larva to produce silk in order to glue the tree leaves. Thus the ant colony emerges with the queen in the centre of the nest whose only purpose is to lay eggs while female ants engage in building the nest. The entire nest building activity is a very distributed process involving every ant.<br><br><strong>Emergent ant organization and artificial intelligence</strong><br><br>The emergence of complex organization among weaver ants, from simple biological intelligence is a model for social communication processes in organizations and artificial intelligence.

The name "candlefish" derives from the fact that it is so fat during spawning, with up to 15% of total body weight in fat, that if caught, dried, and strung on a wick, it can be burned as a candle. This is the name most often used by early explorers. The name "eulachon" (occ. "oolichan", "oulachon", "uthlecan", etc.) is from the Chinookan language and the Chinook jargon based on that language. The name "hooligan" appears to have been derived from "eulachon" by similarity with the English slang term for a ruffian or scoundrel which gained currency in the late 19th century. Eulachon is the more proper of the two names, but most people who harvest the fish call it "hooligan". Others pronounce the name as "hooligan" but write "eulachon".<br><br>Eulachon, as anadromous fish, spend most of their adult lives in the ocean but return to their natal freshwater streams and rivers to spawn and die. As such, one stream may see regular large runs of eulachon while a neighboring stream sees few or none at all. Regular annual runs are common but not entirely predictable, and occasionally a river which has large runs sees a year with no returns; the reasons for such variability are not known. The eulachon run is characteristic for the early portion being almost entirely male, with females following about midway through the run to its conclusion. Males are easily distinguished from females during spawning by fleshy ridges which form along the length of their bodies.<br><br>Native Americans and Eskimos made eulachon an important part of their diet, as well as a valuable trade item with people who lived outside of its range. They were caught using traps, rakes, and nets. The harvest continues today, with other residents taking part in the exploitation of the large runs. Today harvested eulachon are typically stored frozen and thawed as needed. They may also be dried, smoked, or canned. Most Native American and Eskimo groups also boiled large amounts of eulachon for the rich oil, which is easily skimmed and preserved. Preserved eulachon oil formed a valuable trade commodity for coastal people, and the numerous passes through the coastal mountains used for this trade were called "grease trails". Other uses include bait for sport and subsistence fishing, and food for cats and dogs.<br><br>The unrelated sablefish <span style="font-style: italic;">Anoplopoma fimbria</span> is also called "candlefish" in the United Kingdom.<br><br>Issue #266</div>

Its name, "Terrible claw", refers to the huge, sickle-shaped talons on the second toe. These claws were probably held retracted while the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes. It was commonly thought that Deinonychus would kick with the sickle claws to slash at its prey, but recent tests on reconstructions of similar velociraptor talons suggest that the claw was used to stab, not slash. Like with all dromaeosaurids the tail was stiffened by a series of elongated bones (not tendons).

Meyer in 1964 in southern Montana Â— it has been speculated that Deinonychus lived in packs. This is quite possible, but it is difficult to prove or disprove this idea. Shed teeth of Deinonychus are often found alongside skeletons of the ornithopod dinosaur Tenontosaurus, indicating that it fed on them, and perhaps hunted them. Deinonychus, like all dromaeosaurids, were among the smartest dinosaurs. If deinonychus hunted in packs, it most likely used tactics to bring there larger prey down. Like most carnivores, deinonychus probably preyed upon the young, sick, old, and weak.<br><br>John Ostrom named and described Deinonychus, and the discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and open the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded.<br><br>Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the hand of Deinonychus and birds, which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Thirty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted. Finds of related dinosaurs from China, such as Sinornithosaurus and Microraptor indicate that this dinosaur probably bore feathers.

They can fall up to 40 feet without being injured, and can run quickly despite their clumsy appearance. Because of their popularity in the pet trade and as food in Latin American countries, green iguanas are listed on the CITES Appendix II, which means they considered a threatened species.<br><br>Iguanas have an unusual behaviour when threatened- they bite onto the threatening creature and do not let go until forced to, or the threat is removed.

They do not wander around inside one's house except to find a secure place to build a web. Once they have a web they are quite happy to stay there waiting for flies and mosquitoes.

If a three-stage cycle does exist, it is likely that the Salt Creek tiger beetle spends over a year in the third larval stage.<br><br>The larva prepares for its pupation by digging a side chamber and sealing the burrow entrance.<br><br><strong>Habitat</strong><br><br>The beetle is found along the banks of Salt Creek and its tributaries and in the mud flats of saline marshes of northern Lancaster County. Its historical range is believed to have included similar habitat in extreme southern Saunders County. Much of this habitat has been degraded or destroyed by drainage of the salt marshes for agriculture or development and by runoff from surrounding farms and the city of Lincoln.<br><br><strong>Conservation</strong><br><br>Interest in the Salt Creek tiger beetle began with surveys conducted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the mid-1980s. These surveys indicated that the beetle was quite rare; an in-depth study of the beetle began in 1991. The beetle was added to the Nebraska endangered species lists in the 1990s. On October 6, 2005, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the beetle as an endangered species under the federal Endangered Species Act.<br><br>From 1991 to 2005, the number of sites containing Salt Creek tiger beetles has declined from six to three.<br><br>Conservation status: Critical<br><br>Issue #281</div>
