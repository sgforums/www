The species is known from early drawings and subfossil bones. It had a long tail and a reduced flight apparatus and was probably flightless. The bill was very large but weak and probably designed to crush the pulp of large fruits so that they could be swallowed, pit and all. The color was a bluish gray overall, and there was a small frontal crest. The discovery of the structure of the bill (which was previously thought to be adapted to cracking nuts) has led to the hypothesis that this bird, not the dodo, was one of the main animals responsible for propagation of the Tambalacoque or "dodo tree".<br><br><img src="http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/219/lophopsittacusmauritianus35aa.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Broad-billed Parrot</strong>, Lophopsittacus mauritianus</span><br><br>It became extinct partly due to hunting, but more importantly due to predation by introduced pigs, monkeys and rats which fed on the eggs and young of this species, which was in all likelihood ground-nesting (a rare occurrence among parrots, the Kakapo, the Night Parrot and the Ground Parrot being essentially the only species doing so) due to its inability to fly.<br><br>A smaller, but very similar species was described from very few bones as the Mauritius Grey Parrot (<span style="font-style: italic;">Lophopsittacus bensoni</span>) and some early travelers' records of "small grey parrots", but it is far from clear whether this was not simply the female of <span style="font-style: italic;">L. mauritianus</span>.<br><br>The affinities of Lophopsittacus are undetermined; despite its appearance and distribution suggesting it was related to the African Grey and Vasa Parrots, it is more likely that its real relationships lie with the Psittaculini radiation of South(east) Asia Â— notably, the Eclectus Parrot, the large-billed Tanygnathus parrots, and, interestingly, possibly most closely with the rather smallish and nimble Psittacula parakeets Â— given that most Mascarene bird species, such as the dodo, derive from Southeast Asian progenitors and that details of their morphology suggest a close relationship. As Psittacula species actually spread to the Mascarenes, this is not to be understood as if they are very closely related Â— the most likely scenario is that the "mysterious" Mascarene parrots (Lophopsittacus, Necropsittacus and Mascarinus) are derived from one or several early colonization by the progenitors of today's Psittacula, Lophopsittacus being most strongly differentiated and Necropsittacus having being still rather similar to Psittacula.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct (1680)<br><br>Issue #420</div>

Pelage cover is sparsely distributed across the body, which many play a role in reducing the build-up of algae on the skin. The average West Indian Manatee is approximately 3 meters long, and weighs between 400 and 600 kg, with females generally larger than males. The largest individuals can weigh up to 1,500 kg.<br><br><strong>Habitat and geographic range</strong><br><br>As its name implies, the West Indian Manatee lives in the West Indies, generally in shallow coastal areas. However, it is known to withstand large changes in water salinity, and so have also been found in shallow rivers and estuaries. It is limited to the tropics and sub-tropics due to an extremely low metabolic rate and lack of a thick layer of insulating body fat. During summer, these large mammals have even been found as far north as Rhode Island.<br><br><strong>Behavior and food</strong><br><br>The West Indian Manatee is surprisingly agile in water, and individuals have been seen doing rolls, somersaults, and even swimming upside-down. Manatees are not territorial and do not have complex predator avoidance behavior, as they have evolved in areas without natural predators.<br><br>The West Indian Mantee is an opportunistic feeder, with large adults feasting on nearly 100 kg of sea grasses and plant leaves daily. Because manatees feed on abrasive plants, their molars are often worn down and are continually replaced throughout life. They are also known to eat invertebrates and fish.<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>Although female West Indian Manatees are mostly solitary creatures, they form mating herds while in estrus. Most females breed successfully between ages of seven and nine, however, females are capable of reproduction as early as four years of age. Gestation period lasts from twelve to fourteen months. Normally, one calf is born, although on rare occasions two have been recorded. The young are born with molars and premolars, allowing them to consume sea grass within the first three weeks of birth.<br><br><strong>Manatee relationship with humans</strong><br><br>The West Indian Manatee has been hunted for hundreds of years for meat and hide, and continues to be hunted to this day in Central and South America. Illegal poaching, as well as collisions with speeding motorboats, are a constant source of manatee fatalities.<br><br>Due to their low reproductive rates, a decline in manatee population may be hard to overcome.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Western Skink</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Western Skink</strong> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Eumeces skiltonianus</span>) is a small, smooth-scaled lizard with relatively small limbs, measuring about 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 inches) from snout to vent. It is one of five species of lizards in Canada.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/Western_Skink.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Western Skink</strong>, Eumeces skiltonianus</span><br><br><strong>Description</strong><br><br>The Western Skink is a secretive and very agile lizard that forages actively through leaf litter and dense vegetation, preying upon small invertebrates. It is a good burrower and sometimes constructs burrows several times its own body length.<br><br>Found in a variety of habitats from sea level to at least 2,130 m (7,000 ft), the Western Skink is commonest in early successional stages or open areas within habitats in which it occurs. Heavy brush and densely forested areas are generally avoided. The Western Skink seems to prefer a somewhat moist environment, although it can also be found on dry hillsides. The soil of its nest chambers is invariably moist. Standing water is apparently not required.<br><br>The Western Skink is brown in color and has four white or beige stripes, two on the back and one on each side. Juveniles have bright blue tails.<br><br><strong>Life History</strong><br><br>This skink is diurnal during the period of warm-season activity. During summer most activity is concentrated in the morning and late afternoon. Where summer temperatures are not extreme, activity extends throughout the day. Adult skinks usually become inactive by early fall but juveniles extend their period of activity several weeks.<br><br>The reproductive season for this species varies geographically and from year to year depending on local conditions. Mating probably occurs in the spring soon after emergence. Males turn orange on the underside when they are breeding. Females lay 2-6 eggs during June and July in nest chambers constructed in loose, moist soil under rocks, logs, or other cover.<br><br>Young Western Skinks probably hatch in late summer, and sexual maturity may occur at 2 years of age, but most individuals probably do not reproduce until they are 3 years old. Western Skinks can reach an age of about 5 or 6 years.<br><br>Issue #424</div>

It lives in Indonesian rainforests and has a wingspan up to 11 inches (28 centimeters). The locals from Papua New Guinea farm these butterflies in the wild as a means of generating income from the environment without destroying it Harvesting the butterflies is legal and does require a permit. It is a rare butterfly, but harvesting does not endanger it.<br><br><img src="http://img164.imageshack.us/img164/8837/goliath5al.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Goliath Birdwing</strong>, Ornithoptera goliath</span><br><br>The males have black, yellow and green wings and a yellow and black body, while the females are brown and white on the top wings and yellow on the bottom wings. The female is typically larger than the male. Flight is leisurely, but controlled and powerful. Males pursue their females for long distances, rising high over the forest canopy then folding their wings and diving down to tree level to mate, even though they risk hindwing damage by the sharp tarsal claws of females.<br><br>Issue #425</div>
