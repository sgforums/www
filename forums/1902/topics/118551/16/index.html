Peterbalds love their family members and need to communicate with them; they do not belong to an independent kind of cats. Peterbalds live in harmony with another cats and pets and also with children. They are also not vindictive and all that makes peterbalds an excellent companion cats.<br><br>The Peterbald breed was founded in the end of 1994 in St.-Petersburg, Russia as a result of experimental mating of Don hairless (Don Sphynx or Donskoy) male called Afinogen Myth and Oriental Shorthair female World Champion Radma von Jagerhov. The breed was created by a well known Russian felinologist Olga S. Mironova. First two litters gave four peterbald kittens: Mandarin iz Murino, Muscat iz Murino, Nezhenka iz Murino and Nocturne iz Murino. These four peterbalds are founders of the breed.<br><br>In 1996, the breed was adopted in Russian Selectional Feline Federation (SFF) with a standard and an abbreviation PBD. In 1997 it was adopted in The International Cat Association (TICA) with abbreviation PB, and in 2003 in World Cat Federation (WCF) with abbreviation PBD. Used handles of the breed are: PBD, PTB, PD and PSX.<br><br>These days the breed develops in the direction of modern Oriental and Siamese type, that is long muzzle, set apart big ears, flat cheek bones, elegant body on long legs. This is why all standards for this breed encourages mating with Oriental and Siamese cats and semi-longhair variations of those (balinese and javanese).<br><br>Issue #357</div>

The pronghorn's range extends from southern Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada to Sonora and Baja California in Mexico. They live on both sides of the Rocky Mountains. Their eastern extent is generally bounded by the Missouri River in the United States. The subspecies known as the Sonoran pronghorn (<span style="font-style: italic;">Antilocapra americana sonoriensis</span>) occurs in Arizona and Mexico.<br><br>Pronghorn live primarily in grasslands but also in brushland and deserts. Pronghorn eat cacti, grasses, forbs and browse plants.<br><br>Pronghorn newborns weigh 5 to 9 lb (2 to 4 kg) and are grey in color. Adult male pronghorn weigh 100 to 130 lb (45 to 60 kg) while females weigh 75 to 100 lb (35 to 45 kg). The main color of adults is brown or tan, with a white rump and belly and two white stripes on the throat. A short dark mane grows along the neck, and males also sport a black mask and black patches on the sides of the neck.<br><br>Male pronghorns have horns about 12 in (300 mm) long with a prong. Female horns are unusual, occurring in perhaps an eighth of specimens. Female horns range from 1 to 6 in (25 to 150 mm) and are straight rather than pronged. Pronghorns have a distinct, musky odor and are commonly called "Prairie Goats", "Speed Goats", or simply "goats" for this reason (as well as their resemblance to domesticated goats.) The pronghorn is one of the fastest land animals, being second only to the cheetah. It can sustain high speeds longer than cheetahs, however. The top recorded speed was 61 mph (98 km/h).<br><br>By 1908, hunting pressure had reduced the pronghorn population to about 20,000. Protection of habitat and hunting restrictions have allowed them to recover to 2Â–3,000,000 pronghorns. Wolves, coyotes and bobcats are the major predators. Golden Eagles have been reported to prey on fawns.<br><br>Pronghorns are now numerous enough that they outstrip the human population in all of Wyoming and parts of northern Colorado. The Pronghorn is widely hunted in western states for purposes of population control and exoticism, as its meat is rich, but extremely gamey and lean. Most control-killed antelope end up discarded excepting the horns or cape for mounting purposes, or as part of a heavily spiced, partly beef or pork sausage.

Members of the species inhabit Africa with a range streching along the Equator from west Africa to Uganda. The giant pangolin is the largest species of pangolin, or "scaly anteaters"Â–the large, scaled mammals belonging to the Manidae family. They subsist almost entirely on ants and termites. The species was first described by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1815.<br><br><img src="http://img500.imageshack.us/img500/8398/manisgigantea49fi.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Giant pangolin</strong>, Manis gigantea</span><br><br><strong>Habitat, range, and endangered status</strong><br><br>The giant pangolin inhabits many countries with the largest concentration in Uganda, Tanzania, and western Kenya. It is found mainly in the savanna, rainforest, and forest, inhabiting areas with large termite populations and available water. Giant pangolins do not inhabit high-altitude areas.<br><br>Due to habitat destruction and deforestation, the species's numbers have greatly declined, and this together with the hunting of giant pangolins as bushmeat has led to concerns about population levels. Because the species is nocturnal, few studies have been carried out. Currently the pangolin is classified as an endangered species.<br><br><strong>Physical description</strong><br><br>The average mass of the species is unknown, but one giant pangolin was found to weigh 33 kg. Males are larger than females, with male body length about 140 cm and female about 125 cm. It is the largest of all pangolins, taking the name "giant pangolin" because of this. The scales are usually colored brown or reddish-brown. Like all pangolins, the species has large, armored scales and no hair except in the eyelashs. Giant pangolin have long snouts, a long and thick tail, and large front claws.<br><br>The animal has a strong sense of smell and large anal glands. Its secretions may be significant to animal communication. The species walks with most of its weight is on its columnar rear legs and curl their front paws, walking on the outside of the wrists rather than the palms to protect the claws. By using its tail for balance, giant pangolins can even walk upright as a biped.<br><br>Giant pangolins are endothermic and bilateral symmetric.<br><br><strong>Behavior</strong><br><br>Giant pangolins, like other pangolin, are motile and nocturnal, which makes observation difficult. They are also usually solitary, although in one case an adult giant pangolin was seen in a burrow with a juvenile. The species is capable of climbing trees and other objects.<br><br><strong>Diet</strong><br><br>Like all pangolins, the giant pangolin is a specialized insectivore that lacks teeth and the ability to chew. Its diet mainly consists of ants and termites, which the species finds by tearing open anthills and termite nests, both subterranean and mound-type.<br><br>Because of its relatively large size, the giant pangolin is particularly well-suited to breaking open termite mounds, done by leaning on the mound and resting its weight on its tail, and then ripping into the mound with its front claws. The combination of weight and physical damage quickly lead to partial collapse of the mound, exposing the termites. It eats the insects by picking them up with its sticky tongue (up to 16 inches in length).<br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>Very little information about the reproduction of giant pangolins is known. Two birth records exist, with one litter was found in September and another in October, with the young weighing around 500 g. As in all pangolins, infants have soft scales that eventually open and are born with open eyes. They cannot walk on their legs, but can move on the stomach.<br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #366</div>

It lays one or two eggs in places such as caves and crevices, protected from direct sunlight which can lead to the eggs overheating. One parent will always stay with the eggs or chicks while the other is absent for several days to feed. If there is not enough food available, the nest may be abandoned.<br><br>The species is endangered, with an estimated population size of around 1,500 individuals in 2004, according to a survey by the Charles Darwin Research Station. The population underwent an alarming decline of 65% in the 1980s, but is slowly recovering. It is therefore the rarest penguin species (a status which is often falsely attributed to the Yellow-eyed penguin). Population levels are influenced by the effects of the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation, which reduces the availability of shoaling fish, leading to low reproduction or starvation. However, anthropogenic factors (e.g. oil pollution, fishing bycatch and competition) may be adding to the ongoing demise of this species. On Isabela island, the introduced cats, dogs and rats may attack penguins and destroy their nests.<br><br>Conservation status: Endangered<br><br>Issue #367</div>

In years past, it was sometimes called the "McKinley spider" because in the period before the election that brought McKinley to office someone claimed that the stabilimentum of one spider's web spelled out "McKinley."<br><br>The average orb web is practically invisible, and it is easy to blunder into one and end up covered with a sticky web. The very easily visible pattern of banded silk made by Argiope is pure white, and the highly visible spider sitting in the center is bright yellow on a field of black.<br><br>These spiders build their webs with their centers about belt high, so they are too low for anything much larger than a rabbit to walk under. It is thought that the advantage to the spider of it and its web being highly visible comes from larger creatures avoiding destroying its web by walking through it. It would be an interesting experiment to see whether animals such as deer walk around them if they are on their path; if a human or other rather large creature walks through a web, then the spider's weaving job is demolished. Additionally, the spider may be accidentally stepped on and killed.<br><br>These spiders are spectacular and may be quite alarming if one is not familiar with them, but they are not dangerous. Like most garden spiders they eat insects, and they are capable of consuming prey up to 200% of their size. They might bite if grabbed, but other than defense they have no interest in biting humans. Their venom is not regarded as a serious medical problem for humans.<br><br>The male spider is much smaller than the female, and unassumingly marked. When it is time to mate, it spins a companion web alongside the females. After it mates with the female, she then lays her eggs, places her egg sac in the web, and dies. The sac contains 400-1,400 eggs. These eggs hatch in the autumn, but the spiderlings overwinter in the sac and emerge during the spring. The egg sac is composed of multiple layers of silk and designed to protect its contents from damage, but numerous species of insects have been observed to parasitise the egg sacs.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Species</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A. aurantia<br>A. bruennichi<br>A. pulchella</span><br><br>Issue #371</div>

It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico, and lived in old forests along rivers. It was the only extinct species at the time classified in genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Conuropsis</span>.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8b/Brd_CarPar_Audubon.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Carolina Parakeet</strong>, Conuropsis carolinensis</span><br><br>The Carolina Parakeet died out because of a number of different threats. To make space for more agricultural land, large areas of forest were cut down, taking away its living space. The colorful feathers (green body, yellow head, and red around the bill) were in demand as decorations in ladies' hats, and the birds were kept as pets. Even though the birds bred easily in captivity, little was done by owners to increase the population of tamed birds. Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers considered them a pest, although many farmers valued them for controlling invasive co<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ckleburs.<br><br>A factor that contributed to their extinction was the unfortunate flocking behavior that led them to return immediately to a location where some of the birds had just been killed. This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock.<br><br>The last wild specimen was killed in Okeechobee County in Florida in 1913, and the last captive bird died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918. This was the male specimen "Incas," who died within a year of his mate "Lady Jane."<br><br>In 1937, a Carolina Parakeet was sighted in the Okefenokee swamp of Georgia. The bird was recorded on film. However, the Audobon Society's analyzation of the film said that it probably wasn't a Carolina Parakeet. Another location that reports were made of this bird after 1918 was Okeechobee County in Florida.<br><br>The Louisiana subspecies of the Carolina Parakeet was slightly different in color to the parent species and went extinct in much the same way.<br><br>About 700 skins are housed in museums around the world.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct (1918<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>)<br><br>Issue #372</div>
