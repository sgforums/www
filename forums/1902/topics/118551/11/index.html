However, they require a great deal of human companionship and do not do well if left alone for long periods of time. Most dogs of the breed are extremely patient and eager to please. As such, dogs of the breed are usually good with children and other dogs.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>For many centuries, small breeds of spaniels have been popular in the United Kingdom. In the eleventh century, in the reign of King Canute, it was illegal to hunt with any dog that could not fit through a gauge that was eleven inches in diameter. Hence, the "birth" of the Toy Spaniel in the United Kingdom. Some centuries later, Toy Spaniels became popular as pets, especially as pets of the royal family. In fact, the King Charles Spaniel was so named because a Blenheim-coated spaniel was the children's pet in the household of King Charles I. King Charles II went so far as to issue a decree that the King Charles Spaniel could not be forbidden entrance to any public place, including the Houses of Parliament. Such spaniels can be be seen in many paintings of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. These early spaniels had longer, pointier snouts and thinner-boned limbs than today's.<br><br>Over time, the toy spaniels were replaced in popularity by short-snouted, dome-headed dogs of asian descent, such as the Pug and Japanese Chin. The King Charles Spaniel was bred with these dogs, resulting in the similar-shaped head of today's breed. The King Charles Spaniel remained popular at Blenheim Castle, home to the Dukes of Marlborough, where the brown and white version was the most popular - resulting in the name Blenheim for that color combination.<br><br>In the beginning of the 1900s, an American named Roswell Eldrige offered twenty-five pounds as a prize for any King Charles Spaniel "of the old-fashioned type" with a longer nose, flat skull, and a lozenge (spot) in the middle of the crown of the head, commonly called "the kiss of Buddha". So, the breed was developed by selective breeding of short-snouted King Charles Spaniels. The result was a dog that resembled the boyhood pet of the future Charles II of England ("Cavalier King Charles"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>), whence the breed derives its name.<br><br>Two breed clubs are found in the United States: the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club (CKCSC) USA and the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club. The latter club is the breed club of the American Kennel Club.<br><br><strong>Health</strong><br><br>The breed suffers from a number of congenital defects, most significantly, syringomyelia, a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. A major health issue that virtually all Cavaliers suffer from is mitral valve disease, causing progressively worsening heart murmurs leading to heart failure. This condition can begin to emerge at an early age, and is present in many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by 5 years of age. It is extremely rare for a 10 year old to not have at least a slight murmur. Symptoms may only present as mild as heart murmurs, or the disease may progress rapidly, resulting in early death. Responsible breeders are attempting to breed only from dogs that exhibit a later onset of the disease.<br><br>Another common defect among Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as "dry eye". The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog's tear ducts, reducing the production of tears. The condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness.<br><br><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Puppy Mills</span><br><br>The increasing popularity of the breed has led to breeding of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in puppy mills. As for all breeds, prospective owners interested in purebred dogs should carefully research any potential puppy breeder.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Cavalier King Charles Spaniels</span><br><br>* Rex, pet of Ronald Reagan<br>* Elizabeth Taylor, pet of Charlotte York in Sex and the City<br>* Hopper and Harley, pets of Courtney Cox<br><br>Country of origin: United Kingdom<br><br>Issue #237</div>

Many other methods of control are being utilized as techniques are refined. Pheromone traps are used to prevent successful mating by capturing male moths using female pheromone as an attractant. Mating disruption devices emit female pheromone in higher quantities so that males are not actually trapped, merely confused and unable to locate females.

However, this scientific name is now considered invalid by ITIS, who classify aurochs under <span style="font-style: italic;">Bos taurus</span>, the same species as domestic cattle.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Lascaux.jpg/800px-Lascaux.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Lascaux.jpg/200px-Lascaux.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Cave painting of <strong>Aurochs</strong>, Bos taurus</span><br><br><strong>Origin</strong><br><br>According to the Paleontologisk Museum, University of Oslo, aurochs evolved in India some two million years ago, migrated into the Middle East and further into Asia, and reached Europe about 250,000 years ago. They were once considered a distinct species from modern European cattle (<span style="font-style: italic;">Bos taurus</span>), but more recent taxonomy has rejected this distinction. The South Asian domestic cattle, the zebu descended from different group of aurochs, presumably at the edge of Thar Desert in India which would explain zebu resistance to drought. Domestic yak, gayal and Javan cattle do not descend from aurochs. Modern cattle have become much smaller than their wild forebears: the height at the withers of a domesticated cow is about 1.4 meters, whereas an aurochs could reach about 1.75 meters.<br><br><strong>The Worship of aurochs</strong><br><br>Aurochs are depicted in many Paleolithic European cave paintings such as those found at Lascaux and Livernon in France. Their life force may have been attributed with magical qualities, for early carvings of the aurochs have also been found. The impressive and dangerous aurochs survived into the Iron Age in Anatolia and the Near East, and was worshiped throughout that area as a sacred animal, the Lunar Bull, associated with the Great Goddess and later with Mithras.<br><br>A 1999 archaeological dig in Peterborough, England, uncovered the skull of an aurochs. The front part of the skull had been removed but the horns remained attached. The supposition is that the killing of the aurochs in this instance was a sacrificial act.<br><br>The Aurochs were also the symbol of Moldavia; nowadays they can be found in the coat of arms of both Romania and Moldova.<br><br><strong>Domestication and disappearance</strong><br><br>Domestication of the aurochs began in the southern Caucasus and northern Mesopotamia from about the 6th millennium BC, while genetic evidence suggests that aurochs were independently domesticated in northern Africa and in India. Domestication caused dramatic changes to the physiology of the creatures, to the extent that domestic cattle must now be regarded as a separate species.<br><br>Genetic analysis has provided many insights about the aurochs. Though aurochs became extinct in Britain during the Bronze age, analysis of bones from aurochs that lived contemporaneously with domesticated cattle there showed no genetic contribution to modern breeds. So modern European cattle are thought to be descended directly from the Near East domestication event. Indian cattle (zebu), although domesticated eight to ten thousand years ago, are related to aurochs which diverged from the Near Eastern ones some 200,000 years ago. The African cattle are thought to descend from aurochs more closely related to the Near Eastern ones. The Near East and African aurochs groups are thought to have split some 25,000 years ago, probably 15,000 years before domestication. The "Turano-Mongolian<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>" type of cattle now found in Northern China, Mongolia, Korea and Japan may represent a fourth domestication event (and a third event among <span style="font-style: italic;">Bos taurus</span>Â–type aurochs). This group may have diverged from the Near East group some 35,000 years ago. Whether these separate genetic populations would have equated to separate subspecies is unclear.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Jaktorow_pomnik_tura.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Jaktorow_pomnik_tura.jpg/200px-Jaktorow_pomnik_tura.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Monument to the last aurochs in JaktorÃ³w</span><br><br>The original range of the aurochs was from the British Isles, to Africa, the Middle East, India and central Asia. By the 13th century A.D., the aurochs' range was restricted to Poland, Lithuania and East Prussia. The right to hunt large animals on any land was restricted to nobles and gradually to the royal household. As the population of aurochs declined, hunting ceased but the royal court still required gamekeepers to provide open fields for the aurochs to graze in. The gamekeepers were exempted from local taxes in exchange for their service and a decree made poaching an aurochs punishable by death. In 1564, the gamekeepers knew of only 38 animals, according to the royal survey. The last recorded live aurochs (female) had died in 1627 in the JaktorÃ³w Forest, Poland.<br><br>In the 1920s two German zookeepers, the brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck, attempted to breed the aurochs back into existence from the domestic cattle that were their descendants. Their plan was based on the pre-Darwinian conception of 'atavism', according to which "primitive" traits might reappear as 'throwbacks' to an earlier form. The result is the breed called Heck Cattle, 'Recreated Aurochs', or 'Heck Aurochs', which bears an incomplete resemblance to what is known about the physiology of the wild aurochs.<br><br>Conservation status: Extinct (1627)<br><br>Issue #244</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Burying beetle</strong></span><br><br><strong>Burying beetles</strong> or <span style="font-style: italic;">sexton beetles</span> (genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Nicrophorus</span>) are the best-known members of the family Silphidae (carrion beetles). Most of these beetles are black with red markings on the elytra (forewings). They bury the carcasses of small vertebrates such as birds and rodents as a food source for their larvae. They are unusual among insects in that both the male and female parents take care of the brood (biparental care).<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/AmericanCarrionBeetle.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">American Burrying Beetle, Nicrophorus americanus</span><br><br><strong>Reproduction</strong><br><br>Burying beetles have large club-like antennae equipped with chemoreceptors capable of detecting a dead animal from a long way away. After finding a carcass (most likely that of a small bird or a mouse), beetles fight amongst themselves (males fighting males, females fighting females) until the winning pair (usually the largest) remain. If a lone beetle finds a carcass, it can continue alone and await a partner. Single males attract a mate by releasing a pheromone from the tip of his abdomen. Females can raise a brood alone, fertilizing her eggs using sperm stored from previous copulations.<br><br>The carcass must be buried by the beetle(s) to get it out of the way of potential competitors, which are numerous.<br><br>The prospective parents begin to dig a hole below the carcass. While doing so, the beetles cover the animal with antibacterial and antifungal oral and anal secretions, slowing the decay of the carcass and preventing the smell of rotting flesh from attracting competition. The carcass is formed into a ball and the fur or feathers stripped away and used to line and reinforce the crypt, where the carcass will remain until the flesh has been completely consumed. The burial process can take around 8 hours.<br><br>The female burying beetle lays eggs in the soil around the crypt. The larvae hatch after a few days and move into a pit in the carcass which the parents have created. Although the larvae are able to feed themselves, both parents also feed the larvae: they digest the flesh and regurgitate liquid food for the larvae to feed on. This probably speeds up larval development.<br><br>At an early stage, the parents may cull their young. This infanticide functions to match the number of larvae to the size of the carcass so that there is enough food to go around. If there are too many young, they will all be underfed and will develop less quickly, reducing their chances of surviving to adulthood. If there are too few young, the resulting adult beetles will be large but the parents could have produced more of them. The most successful beetle parents will achieve a good balance between the size of offspring and the number produced. This unusual method of brood size regulation might be the result of the eggs being laid before the female has been able to gauge the size of the carcass and hence how many larvae it can provision.<br><br>Several pairs of beetles may cooperate to bury large carcasses and then raise their broods communally.<br><br>The adult beetles continue to protect the larvae, which take several days to mature. Many competitors make this task difficult, e.g. bluebottles and ants or burying beetles of either another or the same species.<br><br>The final stage larvae migrate into the soil and pupate, transforming from small white larvae to fully formed adult beetles.<br><br>Parental care is quite rare among insects, and burying beetles are remarkable exceptions.<br><br><strong>Species</strong><br><br>About eighty species have been described.<br><br>Common European species:<br>- <span style="font-style: italic;">N. humator<br>- N. investigator<br>- N. vespillo<br>- N. vespilloides<br>- N. vestigator<br>- N. interruptus </span><br><br>Extinct European species:<br>- <span style="font-style: italic;">N. germanicus </span><br><br>Common North American species:<br>- <span style="font-style: italic;">N. americanus</span> - American Burying Beetle<br>- <span style="font-style: italic;">N. sayi<br>- N. orbicollis<br>- N. pustulatus<br>- N. defodiens<br>- N. tomentosus<br>- N. vespillo<br>- N. vespilloides </span><br><br>Issue #249</div>

The name alludes to its aggressive nature. Like most cichlids it is territorial, especially against its own kind and similar species. The fish was once very popular due to its striking appearance and personable mannerisms. While it is a popular aquarium fish, due to its behavior it is not easy to keep.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Jack_dempsey.jpg/800px-Jack_dempsey.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Jack_dempsey.jpg/250px-Jack_dempsey.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Jack Dempsey</strong>, Cichlasoma octofasciatum</span><br><br>The coloration changes as the fish matures from a light gray or tan with faint turquoise flecks to a dark purple-gray with very bright, iridescent blue, green, and gold flecks. The dorsal and anal fins of mature males have long, pointed tips. Females lack these exaggerated tips.<br><br>The fish is native to Yucatan and Central America, where it is found in slow-moving waters, such as swampy areas with warm, murky water, weedy, mud- and sand-bottomed canals, drainage ditches, and rivers. It is also established as an introduced species in Australia, the USA and Thailand (presumably as an aquarium escape). The Jack Dempsey natively lives in a tropical climate and prefers water with a 7.0 - 8.0 pH, a water hardness of 9 - 20 dGH, and a temperature range of 72 - 86 Â°F (22 - 30 Â°C). It can reach up to 25 cm (10 in) in length. It is carnivorous, eating worms, crustaceans, insects and other fish.<br><br>Jack Dempseys lay their eggs on the substrate (the bottom of the aquarium or pool). Like most cichlids, they show substantial parental care: both parents help incubate the eggs and guard the fry when they hatch. Jack Dempseys are known to be attentive parents, pre-chewing food to feed to their offspring.<br><br>In 1997 the San Francisco Chronicle reported that a man had died when he put a Jack Dempsey into his mouth as a joke: the fish presumably erected its fin spines to avoid being swallowed, a characteristic cichlid anti-predator response, and became wedged in the man's throat.<br><br>Conservation status: Secure<br><br>Issue #250</div>

This region covers parts of the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and, to a lesser degree, Andhra Pradesh. The breed is basically an offshoot of the Saluki and was first introduced into India by traders and mercenaries from various parts of Asia, who traveled in caravans. When local people saw the dogs running alongside the caravans, they began referring to them as Â“karwaniÂ”, meaning Â“of the caravansÂ”. The name endures to this day in the villages, but it was anglicized to Caravan Hound when the Kennel Club of India recognized the breed.<br><br>In Karnataka, the breed is also known as the Mudhol Hound, after a small town in Bijapur district. A former ruler of Mudhol, Sri Srimanth Raja Malojirao Gorphade (Maloji Rao Ghorpade), is said to have presented a pair of hound puppies to King George V of England. Upon inspecting these curiosities, the monarch found them true to sighthound conformation and dubbed them Â“the hounds of MudholÂ”.<br><br>It is found not only in Mudhol, but is widely kept throughout the Deccan; however, the Indian National Kennel Club uses the Mudhol Hound name.<br><br>Alternative names: Mudhol Dog, Caravan Hound, Karwani, Pashmi<br>Country of origin: India (Deccan Plateau)<br><br>Issue #253</div>
