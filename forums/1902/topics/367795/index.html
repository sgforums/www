              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>SAN FRANCISCO – A
                      fast-growing kelp from the Far East has spread along the California
                      coast from Los Angeles to San Francisco Bay, worrying marine scientists
                      and outpacing eradication efforts.</p>
              <p>In May,
                      scientists for the first time found the invasive seaweed called Undaria
                      pinnatifida clinging to docks at a yacht harbor in San Francisco Bay,
                      fouling boat hulls and pier pilings.</p>
              <p>"I was
                      walking in San Francisco Marina, and that's when I saw the kelp
                      attached to a boat," said Chela Zabin, a biologist at the Smithsonian
                      Environmental Research Center in Tiburon, Calif.</p>
              <p>"It
                      was 6-foot long, and there is nothing here in the bay that gets to that
                      size," Zabin said. "I didn't want to believe what it was, it's
                      depressing."</p>
              <p>Before Zabin's discovery, ocean scientists believed the northward spread of the invasive kelp had been stopped at Monterey Bay<a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: none ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #000000;"></span></a>.
                      But last year, federal funding used to buy equipment for volunteer
                      divers dried up, reducing the number of people working on eradication.</p>
              <p>The
                      seaweed — known as wakame by Japanese food lovers and used in miso soup
                      — was first discovered in Los Angeles Harbor in 2000.</p>
              <p>A
                      year later, the kelp, which can grow an inch a day as it creates dense
                      underwater forests, showed up at Catalina Island, off the Los Angeles
                      coastline, and Monterey Bay.</p>
              <p>Studies have
                      concluded the kelp was likely introduced to California by accidental
                      transport on shipments of oysters, vessel hulls and people who
                      cultivated it in the region for cooking.</p>
              <p>On
                      Thursday, four divers spent hours at Pier 40 on San Francisco's
                      Fisherman's Wharf peeling pieces of kelp off of the docks, yachts and
                      pier pilings. But few believe the effort removed all traces of the
                      seaweed. Scientists will be checking monthly for signs of further
                      spread.</p>
              <p>"On any invasion, the window of
                      opportunity to successfully eradicate that species is usually narrow,"
                      said Steve Lonhart, one of the divers and a senior scientist with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.<a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: none ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #000000; background-color: transparent;"></span></a></p>
              <p>"You want to do it as soon as it becomes established. The longer you wait, the less chance for success," he said.</p>
              <p>The
                      seaweed concerns marine biologists because it can damage fragile ocean
                      ecosystems by choking off the sunlight needed by native kelps. The
                      native kelp forests provide key habitat for otters, fish and other
                      marine life.</p>
              <p>The seaweed spreads by releasing
                      millions of spores that can be dispersed by currents in the open ocean,
                      but in a protected marina lighter currents could slow its reach. While
                      it is native to Japan, China and Korea, studies have found the kelp in
                      the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Coast of Europe, New Zealand and
                      Argentina.</p>
              <p>"If it's restricted to two docks in
                      the marinas in San Francisco Bay, we'll have a chance," Zabin said. "If
                      it's spread beyond those places, it may be a lost cause."</p>
              <p>Because
                      of its wide range, it has been nominated as among 100 of the world's
                      worst invaders, according to the Global Invasive Species Database.</p>
              <p>Though
                      Thursday's dive may remove the immediate threat to the bay, Lonhart
                      believes they are fighting a losing battle against a persistent pest.</p>
              <p>"In
                      10 years I'm guessing Undaria is going to be all over the place. It's
                      not a problem getting smaller in scope, it's getting worse and worse,"
                      he said.</p>
              <p>Scientists say the waters from Baja
                      California to British Columbia are the perfect temperature for Undaria
                      to spread even further up the Pacific Coast of the United States.</p>
              <p>For about six years, the National Oceanic Atmospheric
                      Administration had organized monthly volunteer diving efforts to yank
                      the stubborn kelp out of Monterey harbor to help root out the kelp.</p>
              <p>The program helped, but it failed to stop the kelp from entering San Francisco Bay, scientists say.</p>
              <p>"This is not well studied enough, and we're really quite nervous
                      about it getting out in the ecosystem," Zabin said. "It will attach to
                      about anything."</p>
