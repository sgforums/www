              <p>PARIS (AFP) – The
                  tiny ancient humans dubbed hobbits, whose remains were discovered on an
                  Indonesian island in 2003, were a previously unknown species
                  altogether, according to two new studies.</p>
              <p>Debate has raged in the scientific community since the fossils were
                  found on the island of Flores, with some experts insisting they were
                  descended from <span id="lw_1241702442_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Homo erectus</span> and others saying evolution could not account for their small brains.</p>
              <p>About a metre (three feet) tall and weighing 30 kilos (65 pounds), the
                  tiny, tool-making hunters may have roamed the remote island as recently
                  as 8,000 years ago. Their fossils are about 18,000 years old.</p>
              <p>Many scientists have said <span id="lw_1241702442_1" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Homo floresiensis</span>, as the creature is now formally known, was a prehistoric human stunted by <span id="lw_1241702442_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">natural selection</span> over millennia through a process called insular dwarfing.</p>
              <p>Others countered that even this evolutionary shrinking, well documented
                  in island-bound animals, could not account for the chimpanzee-sized
                  brain -- just a third the size of that in a modern human being.</p>
              <p>The only plausible explanation, they insisted, was that the handful of
                  specimens found had a genetic disorder resulting in an abnormally small
                  skull or that they suffered from "dwarf cretinism" caused by deficient
                  thyroids.</p>
              <p>Two new studies in the British journal Nature go a long way toward settling the debate.</p>
              <p>A team led by William Jungers of Stony Brook University in New York tackled the problem by analysing the hobbit's foot.</p>
              <p>In some ways it is very human. The big toe is aligned with the others
                  and the joints make it possible to extend the toes as the body's full
                  weight falls on the foot -- attributes not found in <span id="lw_1241702442_3" class="yshortcuts">great apes</span>.</p>
              <p>But in other respects it is startlingly primitive: far longer than its
                  modern human equivalent and equipped with a very small big toe, long
                  and curved lateral toes, and a weight-bearing structure closer to a
                  chimpanzee's.</p>
              <p>Recent archaeological evidence from Kenya shows that the modern foot evolved more than 1.5 million years ago, most likely in <span id="lw_1241702442_4" class="yshortcuts">Homo erectus</span>.</p>
              <p>So unless the Flores hobbits became more primitive over time --
                  considered extremely unlikely -- they must have branched off the human
                  line at an even earlier date.</p>
              <p>For Jungers and colleagues, this suggests their ancestor was not Homo
                  erectus "but instead some other more primitive hominin whose dispersal
                  into southeast Asia is still undocumented."</p>
              <p>Companion studies published by the Journal of Human Evolution bolster
                  this theory and conjecture that these more ancient forebears may be the
                  still poorly understood <span id="lw_1241702442_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Homo habilis</span>.</p>
              <p>In any case, <span id="lw_1241702442_6" class="yshortcuts">Homo floresiensis</span> would be confirmed as a separate species.</p>
              <p>But what still has not been explained the hobbit's inordinately small brain.</p>
              <p>That's where hippos come into the picture.</p>
              <p>Eleanor Weston and Adrian Lister of the <span id="lw_1241702442_7" class="yshortcuts">Natural History Museum</span> in London compared fossils of several species of ancient hippos found
                  on the island of Madagascar with the mainland ancestors from which they
                  had evolved.</p>
              <p>They were surprised to find that insular dwarfing -- driven by
                  the need to adapt to an island environment -- shrank their brains far
                  more than had previously been thought possible.</p>
              <p>"Whatever the explanation for the tiny brain of H. floresiensis
                  relative to its body size, our evidence suggests that insular dwarfing
                  could have played a role in its evolution," they conclude.</p>
              <p>While the new studies answer some questions, they also raise
                  new ones sure to spark fresh debate, Harvard professor Daniel Lieberman
                  said in Nature.</p>
              <p>Only more fossil evidence will indicate whether the hobbits of
                  Flores evolved from Homo erectus, whose traces have been found
                  throughout Eurasia, or from an even more ancient lineage not yet found
                  outside Africa, he said.</p>

              <h1>Australia discovers 3 new large dinosaurs</h1>
              <p><cite class="vcard">By Michael Perry        <span class="fn org">Michael Perry</span> </cite> – Fri Jul 3, 12.45 pm ET</p>
              <p>SYDNEY (Reuters) – 
              Fossils of three new species of dinosaurs have been discovered in <span id="lw_1246639649_0" class="yshortcuts">Australia</span>, including a meat-eater larger than <span id="lw_1246639649_1" class="yshortcuts">Velociraptor</span> from the <span id="lw_1246639649_2" class="yshortcuts">Jurassic Park</span> movies, suggesting Australia may have a more complex prehistoric past.</p>
              <p>The two plant-eating and one carnivore dinosaurs, the first large dinosaurs unearthed since 1981, were found in <span id="lw_1246639649_3" class="yshortcuts">Queensland</span> and date back 98 million years to the mid-Cretaceous period.</p>
              <p>"It not only presents us with two new amazing long-necked giants of the
              ancient Australian continent, but also announces our first really big
              predator," paleontologist John Long, head of sciences at <span id="lw_1246639649_4" class="yshortcuts">Museum Victoria</span> said on Friday.</p>
              <p>Paleontologist Ben Kear at <span id="lw_1246639649_5" class="yshortcuts">La Trobe University in Melbourne</span> said the discovery will pave the way for new studies on Australian dinosaurs and their environments.</p>
              <p>"Australia is one of the great untapped resources in our current understanding of life from the <span id="lw_1246639649_6" class="yshortcuts">Age of Dinosaurs</span>,"
              Kear said. "The discoveries...will definitely reinvigorate interest in
              the hitherto tantalizingly incomplete, but globally significant record
              from this continent..."</p>
              <p>Australia's dinosaur fossil record has been extremely poor compared with North America, South America and Africa.</p>
              <p>The new dinosaurs were unearthed during joint Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum and <span id="lw_1246639649_7" class="yshortcuts">Queensland Museum</span> digs at Winton in outback Queensland.</p>
              <p>SLASHING CLAWS</p>
              <p>The meat-eating theropod dinosaur has been called Australovenator
              (nicknamed Banjo after Australian bush poet Banjo Patterson) and the
              two plant-eating sauropod dinosaurs are Wintonotitan and
              Diamantinasaurus</p>
              <p>"The cheetah of his time, Banjo was light and agile. He could run down most prey with ease over open ground," said <span id="lw_1246639649_8" class="yshortcuts">Scott Hocknull</span>, lead author of the dinosaur discovery, published on Friday on PLos One (<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/nm/sc_nm/storytext/us_australia_dinosaurs/32583599/SIG=114rcngdn/*http://www.plosone.org/home.action"><span id="lw_1246639649_9" class="yshortcuts">www.plosone.org/home.action</span></a>).</p>
              <p>"His most distinguishing feature was three large slashing claws on each hand. Unlike some theropods that have small arms (like <span id="lw_1246639649_10" class="yshortcuts">T Rex</span>), Banjo was different. His arms were a primary weapon. He's Australia's answer to <span id="lw_1246639649_11" class="yshortcuts">Velociraptor</span>, but many times bigger and more terrifying," said Hocknull.</p>
              <p>"Banjo" sheds light on the ancestry of the largest-ever meat-eating
              dinosaurs, the carcharodontosaurs, a group of dinosaurs that became
              gigantic, like <span id="lw_1246639649_12" class="yshortcuts">Giganotosaurus</span>, he said.</p>
              <p>The two herbivore dinosaurs were different kinds of titanosaur, the largest type of dinosaur ever to have lived.</p>
              <p>Wintonotitan was a tall animal which may have fitted into a
              giraffe-like niche, while the stocky Diamantinasaurus was more
              hippo-like, said Hocknull.</p>
              <p>Two of the dinosaurs were found buried together in a 98-million-year-old "billabong" or waterhole.</p>
              <p>"Billabongs are a built-in part of the Australian mind because we
              associate them with mystery, ghosts and monsters," said Hocknull,
              referring to Patterson's poem <span id="lw_1246639649_13" class="yshortcuts">Waltzing Matilda</span>,
              which tells of a "swagman" or bushman who jumps into a billabong and
              drowns after police try and catch him with a stolen sheep.</p>
              <p>Hocknull said hundreds more fossils from the dig were still to be prepared and there was more material to be excavated.</p>
