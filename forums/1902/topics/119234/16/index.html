            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You may have difficulties with family members if you get involved in petty arguments. Hard work will bring rewards. Your lover probably won't put up with your behavior.<br>Don't let your health suffer because of worry. Talk to someone you trust. It's time to reevaluate your own motives and make changes to yourself first. You can come up with ways of earning extra cash.<br>With the sun moving into Pisces today you should experience a sudden serenity of mood around mid afternoon. This will be helped by a calming influence that will see you just kicking back and letting the day drift by. Plan to do something that taps into your imagination: writing a short play, perhaps.</div>

You should focus on moneymaking matters and stay away from emotional disputes.<br>Social activity should be on your agenda today. Don't overspend on entertainment, on children, or make poor investments. Entertainment could cost you more than you expect.<br>Not for you a lazy day idling in front of the TV. With several planets in your eighth house and given the positive aspects affecting them youÂ’ll be looking to learn about the deeper things in life.

Your ability to deal with others will help you in getting the support you need. Don't argue with family.<br>Two negative aspects affecting both your home life and work or school will impact on your day today. Quite simply you are likely to try and take over. Believing that you know best is one thing; standing back and letting people make their own mistakes is another, but how else will they learn?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Make plans to do something special with the one you love. Don't make large purchases unless you have discussed your choices with your mate. Try to be considerate in your personal obligations.<br>Don't overload your plate. Don't invest too much of your own money. If you're preoccupied, be careful while operating a vehicle or any kind of equipment or machinery.<br>With the moon in your sign and thanks to the influence of Pluto you are likely to be in need of controlling your ultra fiery side. Your need for praise and approval could test other peopleÂ’s patience today so try to give praise when itÂ’s due instead, which will moderate that Leonine ego!</div>
