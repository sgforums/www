Don't let someone take the credit for a job you did. You must lay down ground rules so that you can complete a job.<br>With the sun in Taurus moving into your work or school house youÂ’ll find that youÂ’ll become more focused on duties, assignments and exams in general.

YouÂ’re likely to meet someone unusual who youÂ’ll admire even if you donÂ’t agree with some of the things they say.
