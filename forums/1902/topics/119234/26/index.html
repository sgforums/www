Your lover may disappoint you in such a way that estrangement will follow.<br>Someone envious of your popularity may challenge you to a debate. Take care of matters involving institutions or government agencies. Organization will be the key to avoiding discord and family feuds.<br>Try not to overreact if an older relative seems to be behaving in an odd or off way: chances are that they have a few, unvoiced concerns about a friend, or even your partner!
