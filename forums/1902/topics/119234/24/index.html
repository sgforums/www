            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Your romantic inclination should lead to a committed relation ship. The emotional state of peers may cause a problem for you. You won't be well received by superiors or by your spouse.<br>Don't reveal anything about your personal life to those who may use such information against you. Your partner may blame you for everything. Don't let your emotions interfere with completing your chores.<br>The effects of the planetary formation are going to linger or much of the day! For you the area that is likely to cause the most frustration is romance. Attached Leos should avoid heavy, serious discussions with their partners, while singles should consider postponing their hot date for another day!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Get ready to discover love, passion, and the desire to enjoy all that life has to offer. You can look into new jobs but don't count on getting help from someone who may have promised you assistance. You can get ready to celebrate your new direction.<br>Your boss may be on the rampage and you certainly don't want to be the one to take the brunt of a bad situation. You're in the mood to spend money. Relatives may be less than easy to deal with.<br>Your friends are likely to prove to be rather invaluable today, helping you to smooth over a misunderstanding between you and a family member. Mercury moving retrograde (backwards) through the skies isnÂ’t going to do much to help soothe things, but the pragmatic advice from a friend will!</div>
