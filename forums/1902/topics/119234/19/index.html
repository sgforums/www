Don't put all your cash in one place.<br>You're in the mood to spend money. Be sure to organize events that will keep the children busy. You will be drawn to individuals who can provide you with both intellectual conversation and physical passion.<br>Things could get very interesting in terms of romance today, especially if youÂ’re prepared to listen! A noble gesture or good intentions on your part could lead to some interesting developments, and the best part is that as long as youÂ’re receptive you wonÂ’t have to try too hard!</div>

You can make money but not through harebrained schemes or gambling. Trips will be more than adventurous.<br>Don't put your professional reputation on the line. Trying to deal with your mate will be unproductive and possibly hurtful. Opportunities may come up at prestigious affairs.<br>A fairly relaxed and balanced day for you is likely to end on a positive note today! Thanks to a positive aspect between the sun and the moon you are going to be both charming and bubbly! In terms of romance itÂ’s looking like you canÂ’t go wrong, although the position of Mercury suggests you still need to listen!</div>

Visitors may relieve the tension.<br>Don't get so wrapped up in being rich that you overlook the fact that your plan may not be as solid as you thought. You will gain a lot if you listen. You need time to put your house in order and sort out what you are going to do about your personal direction.<br>At long last the obstructive influence of Mercury shifts today, leaving you more clear-headed and more inclined to hear whatÂ’s being said! A couple of positive influences suggest that your ability to be hugely sympathetic will be called upon today when a friend in distress just wants to talk.</div>
