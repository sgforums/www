You can make a big difference to children if you are understanding of the difficulties they are experiencing. Accommodate others but not before you do your own thing. Do the proper safety checks before you go out.<br>Use your ingenuity to manipulate things to get what you want. Someone you live with will, be impossible. Travel should be on your agenda. Entertainment should include sports events or physical activities.<br>Your money situation will be unpredictable today. Living on credit will only lead to worry -- and you do enough of that without adding to your troubles. Spending will not impress the people you are concerned with.<br></div>
