Be cautious who you deal with financially.<br>You are best not to confide in anyone right now. You might find it difficult to control your emotions. You may want to make changes that will turn your entertainment room into a real family affair.<br>With the sun in Aries and the moon moving into Capricorn you are likely to feel divided today. Your intention to knuckle down and concentrate at work or school will be at odds with your desire to spread your wings a little.
