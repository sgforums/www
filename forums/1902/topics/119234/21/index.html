            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Be careful; your ideas are good but make sure that you're realistic and start off on solid ground. Unique forms of entertainment could capture your attention and bring about a romantic interest. Involvement in fitness clubs will be conducive to engaging roman tic connections.<br>You are best to avoid joint ventures, and whatever you do, don't lend to friends or relatives. You may not want to spend time around family or your home. Make changes to your living quarters that will please the whole family.<br>Thank goodness for Mars in Virgo! With a conjunction between the sun (which now in your sign) and the moon youÂ’re less likely to be as extravagant as you would be today. Even so, keep an eye on your cash and try not to make rash promises that you canÂ’t really keep!</div>

Do not lend money to friends, or contribute more than necessary to groups unworthy of your cash.<br>Later in the week your boss will pat you on the back for a job well done. The experience will be good. Your emotions may get the better of you.<br>Leos are typically too busy doing things to stop and think but today a positive collection of aspects means that youÂ’ll be more reflective than usual. Take your time today to enjoy the simple things in life; youÂ’ll be surprised how invigorating a slower pace can be!</div>

Art investment will pay big dividends in the long term.<br>In contrast to yesterday youÂ’ll be back to your normal Leonine self and on the go again today. This might come as a relief to you but watch out for tactless or thoughtless behavior, especially at home. You may think youÂ’re in the right, but youÂ’ll need to moderate your views!</div>

You may have the day off but your thoughts will be on your work and your cash situation.<br>YouÂ’re likely to be absolutely goal-centered today, especially if youÂ’re back at work or school.

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Try to make arrangements with close friends or relatives to spend a few days away. You are best to work behind the scenes on projects that require detail or precision. All your energy should be directed into moneymaking opportunities.<br>Arguing won't help. Opportunities to make financial gains through investments look promising. You must try to lay your cards on the table. Talk to your mate and tell them how you feel.<br>You could find that youÂ’re pulled in two directions today: the organizer in you will want to exert some control over a situation, while the more reliable side of you will feel a need to go with the flow. But the underlying problem that can resolve this inner tension is a simple lack of self belief!</div>
