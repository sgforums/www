            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Love can be heightened if you sit down and discuss your future plans. You will meet new romantic partners if you get involved in seminars or travel. Plans to make physical improvements may lead to psychological changes, too.<br>You should check out prestigious clubs or groups that have a cause you believe in. Your mind will be wandering to exotic destinations. You may be committed to a group concern, but it's not a good day to cross authority figures.<br>An opportunity to find true love or to make the relationship you are in even better must be taken. A short romantic trip or time spent doing something special will pay off. An idea you have can turn out to be quite lucrative.<br></div>
