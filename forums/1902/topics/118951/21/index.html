            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Don't let your mate force you into making a decision that you aren't ready to make. Any intimate relationships with colleagues will lead to gossip that could easily affect your position. Take a close look at contracts and agreements that have been offered to you.<br>Don't use emotional blackmail on someone you love. Don't offer to pay for others. Romantic encounters will be full of excitement.<br>You should be able to enjoy a sudden burst of energy, which will guarantee you a fun filled day as long as you donÂ’t overindulge in anything. Moderation is the key, although your friends will most likely do their best to keep you firmly on the straight and narrow!</div>

New friendships will develop through group events.<br>Social activities that involve the whole family will be enjoyable. Don't go hog wild when it comes to entertainment or you could find yourself short of funds at the end of the month. Tell them to get out of the mess they are in and then you'll consider getting together with them.<br>Thanks to a certain configuration between the planets you are likely to behave a little out of character today! YouÂ’re not usually one for rash or reckless decisions in romance, but someone catching your eye could make you throw caution to the wind.
