Don't be afraid to confront situations concerning loved ones in order to solve any problems that may exist. Try not to be too emotional with those around you.<br>Two positive aspects could make today a rather interesting day for you. The influences of Pluto and Neptune will have you delving beneath the surface in more ways than one, but think before you share your findings with anyone, because your judgment wonÂ’t be at its sharpest!</div>
