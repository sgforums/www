You are best not to nag or criticize.<br>The moon leaves your sign today and this will leave you feeling very refreshed, particularly in light of the positive impact of Mercury in your life right now.

You have to believe in yourself and your talents.<br>Eliminate situations that are no longer to your advantage. You will be able to work in fine detail and present the best possible proposal. You may enjoy doing something musical for entertainment.<br>Oh dear; a minor but challenging aspect from Mars means that youÂ’re likely to feel the need to make fun seem like hard work today! An offhand or tactless comment could have you taking up someoneÂ’s challenge, but take a step back and recognize it for what it is Â– unimportant!</div>
