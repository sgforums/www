            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Relatives will not agree with the way you are dealing with your personal problems. Property investments, insurance, tax rebates, or inheritance should bring you financial gains. You could be quite erratic regarding your personal relationship.<br>You will be able to get your own way if you use your intellectual charm and know how. Your lack of responsibility and attention has been a key issue in your relationship. Don't forget to let your mate know how much you care.<br>Work or school could prove interesting today, as it is likely that youÂ’ll find yourself on the receiving end of some flattering attention. As long as you donÂ’t read more into it than is intended you should go ahead and flirt back; allow yourself a little fun once in a while.</div>
