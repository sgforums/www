            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/5_dragon.gif"><br>The Dragon is one of the most powerful and lucky Signs of the Chinese Zodiac. Its warm heart makes the Dragon's brash, fiery energy far more palatable. This is a giving, intelligent and tenacious Sign that knows exactly what it wants and is determined to get it. Dragons possess a certain natural, charming charisma that ensures they can always influence their peers and often find themselves the center of attention in social situations. This Sign is truly blessed, too; Dragons are considered to be very lucky in love! The Dragon's friends are always keen to hear what this firebrand has to say and when it comes to dispensing advice, the Dragon has the floor.<br><br>Its ego can get in the Dragon's way, but even so, this larger-than-life creature has a knack for initiating projects and keeping the troops motivated. According to Dragons, it's their natural born right to lead the way -- because who else could do it so surely and so well? As lucky as they are, Dragons have a good chance of achieving considerable material wealth during their lifetimes, although it isn't mere money that's this Sign's main motivation. Power is what the Dragon wants and truly believes it deserves. Dragons are quite the opportunists, forever searching for ways in which to consolidate their considerable power. Contrary to all this strength and fire, a weakened Dragon is a sad sack, a creature that refuses to take defeat with even a modicum of grace.<br><br>The role of leader is the only one the Dragon wants, the better from which to give orders and be king of the hill. They make solid leaders, too, knowing instinctively what needs to be done to stay on top. Crossing the Dragon is never a good idea -- this beast can singe! A valuable life lesson for this clever creature would be to absorb the principles of flexibility, compassion and tolerance. Being high and mighty can serve to inspire others, but it also keeps Dragons from living their lives to the fullest. If Dragons can learn to balance their quest for success with an appreciation for the little things, their life will be more than worthwhile.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Dragon is the Monkey or the Rat.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Dragons</span>: Reese Witherspoon, Russell Crowe, Orlando Bloom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">The Dragon is probably the most flamboyant and vibrant of all the Chinese astrological signs. Highly confident and bold, dragon people are born leaders, and usually do well in careers that give them a position of leadership. They have a sense of imagination, and often dream up wild schemes and ideas, most of which aren't feasible. Fortunately for them however, Dragons seem to be endowed with good fortune, which saves them from making major mistakes and helps them to excel when they apply themselves correctly. </span><br><br>The Dragon is: Extroverted, confident, intelligent, outgoing, opinionated,  energetic, impulsive, assertive, self-sufficient, flamboyant<br><br>Suited as a entrepreneur, doctor, entertainer, architect, salesperson<br><br>Suited with the Rat, Monkey, Rooster, Tiger, Goat</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Outlook for 2006:<br><br>Career<br>For the Dragon this 2006, there may not be much opportunity for windfalls or huge financial gains. There is a clash between the Dragon and the Dog year, and this heralds limited opportunities for money-making. Plus, there may be more than one rainy day in store for the Dragon, so do spend your money very wisely and keep a chunk of it in the bank. Other than this, your success can only come if you work on everything from scratch by yourself. You may not be able to receive assistance from others to help you out.<br><br>Though this is the case, Dragons who are in creative industries such as writers, designers, copywriters and artists should have no problem in the year of the Fire Dog! As a general rule, though the Dragon's wealth luck is weak, his career luck is on a high..<br><br>Relationship<br>The Dragon in a committed relationship may find some strain due to the clash between the Dragon and the Dog. But, this is more likely for couples in the initial stages of getting to know each other, rather than those who have been together for a long time. The Dragon also needs to practice plenty of patience and restraint - there is a possibility of the Dragon succumbing to his volatile ways and wreaking all kinds of havoc! One way to solve this dilemma is for the couple to spend a little time apart. Sometimes, absence makes the heart grow fonder.<br><br>For the solo Dragon, it may be very difficult for you to meet up with someone that clicks perfectly with you, due to the negative arrangement of certain stars.<br><br>Health<br>Because of the clash between the Dragon and the Dog in year 2006, the Dog person may be susceptible to sensitive or weak stomachs, chests and rib-cage areas. Do be careful of what you eat, and stay away from unhygienic eating outlets. You may also risk accidents from high-octane activities such as rock climbing and sky diving.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dragon people are the most eccentric in the Chinese Zodiac. Soaring high into the serene heavens, they can be stubborn, passionate, excitable, honest, and brave, wear purple and walk barefoot in public fountains. They listen to their own drummer, thank you very much, while the rest of the world stands in amazement. People always admire their individuality and feisty personality. Dragons are capable of doing great work for mankind and they inspire trust in almost everyone.

Everything these Dragons touch turns to gold. They hold top positions of responsibility in their careers and are revered for their pearls of wisdom and dynamic leadership. The Metal Dragon, you see, has always had the "right stuff" to make it big, ambition, unflagging enthusiasm, supreme confidence, intelligence, and the quirky creativity necessary to make a beautiful life. Life is beautiful, no worries for the Metal Dragon, who is one of the few who experience the freedom of true security. Love and Romance are anointed, too, by "the touch." Both male and female Metal Dragons make good lovers. The Male is very expressive and needs to be the major focus of attention for his loved one. The female spends hours lost in romantic daydreams about idyllic love affairs, slow dancing under moonlight nights, intoxicated by the headiness of champagne. Love, too, is smooth sailing for these Dragons.<br><br>WATER DRAGON<br><span class="small">Jan 27, 1952 to Feb 13, 1953<br>Jan 23, 2012 to Feb 9, 2013</span><br><br>One thing about being on top of a pedestal is the likelihood of falling off.

Around every turn, luck just seems to fall in their laps. To paraphrase a popular saying, it's really because the harder they work, the luckier they get. Passionate about their work, their determination and visionary zeal lead them to expect, and receive, both personal and monetary awards. Their big secret is having just the right combination of right-brained creativity and left-brained intelligence, a sense of humor, and being open to the concept of Serendipity. Water Dragons also sit on a pedestal when it comes to Love, especially the male who likes, in essence, to be fed peeled white grapes by admiring loved ones. Both male and female Water Dragons are very attractive and very sexy to their partners and Love and Marriage always comes with the butterflies in the stomach feeling.<br><br>WOOD DRAGON<br><span class="small">Feb 16, 1904 to Feb 3, 1905<br>Feb 13, 1964 to Feb 1, 1965</span><br><br>Dragons are majestic creatures. These Dragons are the chivalrous knights and guardian angels of life, generous with their friendship, compassionate, even heroic, in their deeds. Showing great tolerance towards others, they move easily among all social strata and travel extensively, opening their minds to new things. Brave as matadors, their courageous lives are truly inspiring. Natural curiosity leads Wood Dragons to pursue very interesting career paths. The dichotomy is they are successful human beings but not all that successful in their careers, despite all the help they get from friends and mentors. Fortune comes to them anyway! Now, as you know, the chances of winning the lottery are pretty slim, but Wood Dragons just might do it. Rainy days or sunny, good fortune seems to shine on these money magnets, just like magic. The Wood Dragon is steady as a rock when it comes to Love &amp; Relationships. They just don't believe in love at first sight. To them, love, relationships, and marriage follow a progressive course, evolving naturally and slowly out of friendship. Once the love bug catches them, their love is deep and passionate. The Wood Dragon partner is loving and supportive of the loved one's needs and love is never taken for granted.<br><br>FIRE DRAGON<br><span class="small">Feb 3, 1916 to Jan 22, 1917<br>Jan 31, 1976 to Feb 17, 1977</span><br><br>Downright electrifying, Fire Dragons breathe vigor and power. These natural leaders smile at adversity, turn complainers into optimists, and lead lives as inspired as a Beethoven Sonata. They are square shooters in dealing with individuals and are often called upon to mediate disputes. Because they care so much about people, Fire Dragons like to support charitable causes and bring friends together for elegant evening soirees. These Dragons are fired with ambition, unflagging enthusiasm, and intelligence and enjoy most impressive careers as a result. Despite all the money they make, Finance is a big question mark. Money is easy come easy go. Until they control their spending habits, money will just go flying in the wind. Romantics at heart, Fire Dragons can't help playing Matchmaker. They're pretty lucky, too! As for themselves, they ooze charisma and never need anyone to fix them up. Successful in love, often placed on pedestals, Fire Dragons are attractive and have fire in the belly. The opposite sex feels very secure.<br><br>EARTH DRAGON<br><span class="small">Jan 23, 1928 to Feb 9, 1929<br>Feb 17, 1988 to Feb 5, 1989</span><br><br>If you make friends with the Earth Dragon, you have a friend for life! Friendship is a big-time commitment which they show through uncommon kindness, caring, and giving spirit. When youngsters, Earth Dragons are valued by their teachers and playmates and when older, by their superiors, colleagues, and social circle. It's no wonder! Hardworking and talented, these well-rounded Dragons have a lively imagination which transforms the atmosphere. They are able to do many things well and receive many accolades during their very successful careers and good money to boot. These Dragons are wildly impulsive in money matters. If they see it, they buy it. When they buy it, it's out of sight out of mind, forgotten in the toy box. Not too late to change these wasteful spending habits, you know! Like most Dragons, those of the Earth don't like to rush Love. They like doing what comes naturally, steady rhythm, beginning from friendship and igniting into the exhilaration of falling in love when it's time. Earth Dragons want long-lasting relationships, not tumbling tumble weeds. After the male dragon has gotten over his playboy stage, he is the biggest convert of all to the joys of the everlasting Relationship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4 Jul 06<br>You'll have the desire to change your professional horizon, to do a more interesting, more creative job; but can one always do what one likes to? Risk of dispersion; difficulty concentrating on yourself and gathering up your ideas. Satisfy yourself for the moment with carrying out monotonous, repetitive tasks that you're perfectly suited for. You'll try to relive certain events of the past, to rediscover certain atmospheres of the old times; let the past remain in oblivion and don't allow it to clutter up your life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 Jul 06<br>This time, one cannot reproach you for taking everything too seriously; at least in love you'll mainly show the lighter side of your character, and you'll simply enjoy flirting and lighthearted banter. If you hold a subordinate position, you won't bear it any longer and you'll do your best to obtain a post of responsibility; your efforts should be crowned with success. Your entourage will seem to you aggressive and impertinent, and you'll have the impression that your near ones deliberately look for provocation -- try to keep your cool!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>6 Jul 06<br>In your professional or social life, things may not turn out as well as you had hoped, but don't lose heart: the situation will improve quite soon. Refrain from heavy or too rich foods and eat green, raw vegetables so as to help your digestive function. A friend may disappoint you, but if you're not too severe you'll be able to understand their behavior and even condone it. Heartwise, things will be going as well as you could wish; however, you can even improve them by showing much patience and understanding toward the person you love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>7 Jul 06<br>You'll be seized by a strong desire for change in your career; this will be due to the fact that you'll have more difficulty bearing authority and will tend to clash with it head-on; try to be patient. If you discover your minor health problems, don't neglect them, for it's probable they're actual alarm signals from your body. Harmony will reign in couples, and those who recently clashed will patch things up and find a good terrain of understanding; single people will have all chances to make a happy encounter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>8 Jul 06<br>In the career domain, rigor will pay off, be sure of that; you'll have the possibility to strengthen your position progressively thanks to strict discipline and scrupulous respect for deadlines. Don't let yourself be worked up by the animosity of one of your neighbors; try to remain serene in the face of their provocations. You're presently endowed with tremendous energy; but you must absolutely try to control yourself -- especially in business -- in order to avoid excesses that might entail unfortunate consequences.</div>

Everything will go as foreseen if you take the necessary time to think. You'll be inclined toward introversion and this will prevent you from making good decisions. You'll be well decided to make an effort if clashes continue to oppose you to your parents or to certain members of your family. If one of your friends disappoints you, don't dramatize the incident, try to forget it.</div>
