            <div class='col-md body'>28 Sep 06<br>Clandestine love affairs will greatly appeal to you, but serious problems may arise if you don't take care; know how to measure the consequences of your acts. Don't have too much ambition, and be more indulgent toward yourself, otherwise you'll always be edgy. Noticeable decrease of strength. Beware of stimulants as well as of tranquilizers.

            <div class='col-md body'>29 Sep 06<br>You'll be well determined to improve your career situation; however, you'll notice certain tension between you and your colleagues on one hand, and between you and your superiors on the other hand. Your physical form will surprise you and will also agreeably surprise your partner. You won't commit the error of showing smug optimism; you'll be very conscious of the risks in presence. In such conditions, success, material as well as social and sentimental, can't be doubted -- it will come to you easily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>30 Sep 06<br>You'll be able to negotiate a difficult business deal or obtain a good contract. Your conjugal life may be very much agitated: you'll have the impression that your spouse absolutely wants to direct everything, and you absolutely can't accept that; try to find a compromise. Refrain from involving your friends, even the intimate ones, in your sentimental problems; confide only in persons whose function is to counsel. This ambiance is propitious to illusions; you must cling to concrete facts and a rigorously logical reasoning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 Oct 06<br>In your work, it will be necessary to define more clearly the objectives to attain, and to determine what's achievable and what's a castle in the air. Your sleep might be perturbed; avoid all unwarranted use of drugs. Do not give in to your impulses. This day will be propitious to discords, jealousies and stormy loves; you'll make others suffer and will suffer yourself. But your relations with your children will be excellent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 Oct 06<br>Avoid at all costs such situations that might set off your latent aggressiveness; in this way your success will be assured. Familial dissensions will be numerous and can end up in disputes. Be courageous enough to propose your ideas as well as your projects.

In your love life, you'll be less unyielding than usual; you'll even be ready to make concessions in order to preserve a harmonious climate. During this day, speculation and risks won't be favored.

Calm down: You're overdoing things and scattering yourself in all directions; at this pace, you'll soon be incapable of knowing where your objectives are and what they consist of. Beware of a tendency to mull endlessly over your more and more perfect projects without coming to act. Know that, in spite of all, luck will be on your side this time.</div>

In your couple, try to take the other one's desires into account and to settle family matters with tact; don't let money issues tarnish your relationships.

An auspicious day for your heart. If you're married, take time to be alone with your spouse and privilege dialogue. You're still single? Then let yourself be lured, and don't hesitate to make use of your charm. You'll work very hard, all the while giving the impression of being dilettantish.
