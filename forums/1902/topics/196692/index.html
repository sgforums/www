            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/9_monkey.gif"><br>The spunky Monkey is the original party animal! Charming and energetic, Monkeys crave fun, activity and stimulation. They truly know how to have a good time and can often be seen swinging from one group of friends to another, attracting a motley crew in the process. Always upbeat, they are considered minor celebrities in their circle thanks to their sparkling wit and that rapier-sharp mind. Perhaps surprisingly, Monkeys are also good listeners and tackle complicated situations with ease. This Sign's natural curiosity lends it the desire to become knowledgeable on a broad range of topics. Monkeys have a show-off side that loves nothing more than to dazzle their pals with all they know.<br><br>The Monkey tends to be rather accident-prone due to a certain lack of very high morals. This Sign's first interest is pursuing its own pleasure; this is not a malicious interest, it's just the way the Monkey is. However, this kind of carefree self-involvement can lead to all kinds of scrapes. In love, the Monkey makes a fun, exciting lover -- but one that may have the potential to stray romantically. The good news is, the MonkeyÂ’s glib manner and witty repartee can often get this Sign out of a scrape. Perhaps not everyone will be won over by the Monkey -- but do you think the Monkey really cares? The Monkey's world, full of devil-may-care energy and revelry, isn't for everyone. Remember, though, it's not that this Sign is mean; it might just be a bit too curious for its own good. Monkeys often feel the need to try everything at least once, which can make for a merry-go-round of relationships.<br><br>The Monkey's love of self-indulgence can also lead to other types of trouble. This Sign may have limited self-control concerning food, alcohol and other pleasurable activities. It's party time all the time for the Monkey, yet when it leads to a monster hangover or a shattered heart (generally someone else's, not theirs), this Sign might actually show a touch of remorse. They won't flat-out admit the error of their ways, but at least they'll pull back and try to tone things down -- for a while.<br><br>Monkeys must try to learn to think of others ahead of themselves, at least some of the time. This Sign's world will be more complete once it realizes the world doesn't revolve around it.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Monkey is the Rat or the Dragon.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Monkeys</span>: Jennifer Aniston, Celine Dion, Naomi Watts</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">The Monkey is universally perceived as being mischievious and accordingly people born in the year of the Monkey have that characteristic! More than this, Monkey people are also ingenious, imaginative, resourceful and possess a keen intelligence. However, they have tendency to be restless and rather superficial at times. Their natural flair for cunning ensures that they have the ability to slip out of a tight situation as quick as a flash when they fell threatened. </span><br><br>The Monkey is: Imaginative, inquisitive, intelligent, well-read, charming, cunning, confident, helpful, independent, organized, attractive<br><br>Suited as a therapist, journalist, diplomat, counselor, stockbroker<br><br>Suited with the Dragon, Rat, Monkey, Ox and Rabbit</div>

You will be able to meet the perfect partner while on your travels abroad - it's very likely you may fall for someone from a different country, or social background as your own.

These quick-relationships are superficial, and will only serve to sever the love between you are your present partner.<br><br>Health<br>Health prospects will be a little poor for the Monkey this 2006.

Lots of fun, they also possess a serious side and influence a good many people throughout their lifetime. They know how to accomplish the most difficult of tasks with the greatest of enthusiasm, concentration, and ease. Even so, they can easily get discouraged and confused and MUST do things their way! They often become great mathematicians, super chess players, researchers, entrepreneurs or scientists. And, great mentors! Monkeys have a burning passion for knowledge of every kind and they magically are surrounded by the finer things in life.

And Monkeys know the meaning of hard work! What fun the metal monkey is to be around! You can talk about anything under the moon, but beware: they can be pretty persuasive, so stand your ground. Sometimes a Sense of Mischief can rear its head: Sometimes this habit of playing tricks on others leads to a fun round of belly laughter, but other times, too much! They can't always get along with some people because of this mischievous streak. But they don't care. You see, they are quite independent, relying solely on themselves. They have few friends, but great ones. And Grand Romance never takes a holiday with them: a life with Monkeys is Stars in Your Eyes, Romantic High Spirit, and Grand Passion indeed.<br><br>WATER MONKEY<br>Feb 6, 1932 to Jan 25, 1933<br>Feb 4, 1992 to Jan 22, 1993<br><br>Always the center of attention, this headline grabber likes to be noticed, by everybody. This alienates some people because after all, others would like the spotlight once in a while, too. Others willingly gravitate towards the Water Monkey, recognizing a natural born leader when they see one. The Water Monkey is very sensitive to criticism and tends to hide behind an iron mask to protect from barbs, insults, and unkindness which might come their way. They need to control themselves to gain the respect of others. If they use their talent properly, they will become prosperous and know fully the Good Life. The passage of time will be very kind to them. They will know great happiness in their golden years. They will never know what loneliness is because children just love being with the Water Monkey. They will accompany them on their journey all the way.<br><br>WOOD MONKEY<br>Jan 25, 1944 to Feb 12, 1945<br>Jan 22, 2004 to Feb 8, 2005<br><br>A real dynamo, this one! The Wood Monkey wants to do things and never likes to sit around doing nothing. No video watching, instead this one will climb the highest mountains, go on the grand safari, and have one adventure after another, with great creativity and imagination. Whew! Often pioneers in new undertakings, they are sharp and ambitious and make big deals happen. These Gentle Giants can be in charge of all the details and no one ever thinks them bossy or pushy. They are good communicators and give direction without ruffling feathers. Workaholics all the way, they really need to learn to relax a little so their family life does not suffer. When they do take time out to breathe, they are so sympathetic and caring, never leaving their friends and family in the lurch. Love life can be a roller coaster of ups and downs, ranging from a conservative holding back to the unleashing of wild passion.<br><br>FIRE MONKEY<br><span class="small">Feb 12, 1956 to Jan 30, 1957</span><br><br>Like its name, the Fire Monkey is ON FIRE! Combustible Energy spewing like a volcano, they give life to all their undertakings. When they start projects, you can be sure the results will reflect their giant creative imagination - everything bursts with an originality which can never be cloned! Life is alive with reds and yellows, never browns and beige. Super idealistic, they like to take chances and are never satisfied with the status quo. Fire Monkeys are very competitive, with the drive to be the best they can be, always on top. No one resents them, though. They are very well liked and always get a lot of help from others with their projects. They are in love with Love and Love Affairs and need to control the wandering eye. The Male Fire Monkey, especially, tends to be a bit of an unabashed Don Juan playboy type and needs to be wary of hurting others.<br><br>EARTH MONKEY<br><span class="small">Feb 3, 1908 to Jan 21, 1909<br>Jan 30, 1968 to Feb 16, 1969</span><br><br>Optimistic always, nothing will keep the Earth Monkey down for long. They are self starters, both personally and in business. They don't like to work for others and always find opportunities to do it their way, solo. Their entrepreneurial spirit creates very successful business undertakings. They are very shrewd and avoid common pitfalls encountered by others. They possess enormous strengths which lead to a growing reputation for excellence, among them frankness, honesty, dependability and reliability. They sincerely care about others and are very attractive to the opposite sex, particularly the male. The female Earth Monkey needs to be aware of making mountains out of molehills with their constant worry, otherwise they will destroy budding relationships quicker than a wink. Their optimism usually comes to the rescue, however, because problems today, well, there's always tomorrow to make it right!</div>
