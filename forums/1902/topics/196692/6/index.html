Chance will this time be on the side of the arts and sciences: university professors, art amateurs or critics, museum curators, researchers and scientists will be favored. You'll be both more dynamic and more relaxed and, thus, you can multiply activities without feeling fatigue. You'll do things in a serious but relaxed and pleasant manner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>November 18, 2006<br><br>Nice real-estate prospects: You'll buy or sell a property under the best possible conditions. Concerning love, don't surrender under the spell of fancy words, think well and don't engage yourself too hastily or keep yourself at a distance. It's in your family surroundings that major changes are likely to occur; try to adapt yourself to the new situation. Be careful of your utterings, as it will not be necessary to keep silent all the time, but to talk with reserve and circumspection.</div>

Beware of chills and refrain from too fatty or too rich dishes. Learn to communicate with an open heart. Everything will go well heartwise; the adventures that were originally considered as transitory and superficial might take a serious turn. Your family life may cause you problems, but you can solve them easily.</div>

Liver disorders are to be expected if you continue eating too-rich food and drinking more than is reasonable! Your children will do some foolish things, which will annoy you very much; however there'll be no need to raise your voice. For most natives of the sign, this day will be marked by enthralling love affairs and blazing sensual pleasures.</div>
