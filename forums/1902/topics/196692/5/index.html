One can change nothing in the past, whether for good or ill; therefore, it would be better to leave it in oblivion. All activities related to purchasing or selling will be favored. Tackle long-term projects that have been waiting for a conclusion. Also, concentrate your attention on all business that begins to stir and that deserves to be handled.

Try to stifle your critical attitude, otherwise you'll not escape a domestic scene. Pecuniary difficulties. Do not revive bad memories.

Your sense of business and transactions will seem somewhat blunted; don't force your talent, wait some time for recovering all your efficiency. Know that reading is an indispensable food for your mind. Don't read good books -- there're really too many of them; only read the best ones.

Don't be too hard up; it would be time to curb your expenses. Possible liver or stomach problems, so avoid too spicy dishes and seafood, and also refrain from tobacco and alcohol. At work, you'll be confronted with situations, the issue of which you cannot foresee. Some tensions in your friendships, but there will also be some unexpected, interesting encounters.</div>
