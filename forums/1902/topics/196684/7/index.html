            <div class='col-md body'>November 13, 2006<br><br>You'll be inclined to let yourself be taken care of by others; react, assume your responsibilities. Most likely your children will give you some complications, as they'll be turbulent; if they're very young, watch them closely to avoid an accident at home. You're likely to be fidgety; think of reducing tensions and restoring your physical and nervous balance. Your professional life will be fraught with some rather sharp tensions; try to keep a very low profile.</div>

The exchanges of ideas that you'll have this time will prove to be very productive in the long term. If you suffer from diabetes, redouble your precautions. Sentimentally, very nice moments: Maybe an old love affair will surface and you'll find that touching. Ideal moment to deal with an important business matter, sign a contract, seek an engagement or make important choices.</div>

In your sentimental relationships, you'll be more motivated by self-pride than by love, and this might cause you some disappointments. Propitious climate for harmony and understanding in the sphere of friendship. Steps and contacts of all kinds will be favored.</div>

In your professional life, you'll be much more ardent and enthusiastic than usual, and this will lead you to spectacular performances; don't show too much pride, though, for this could get you into trouble.

Money matters could be an apple of discord between love mates, but a money entry will settle everything. Some fits of nervousness, which may result in some moments of anger. Beware of your high blood pressure, which could go up; rest and relax yourself to the maximum. You could be a victim of jealousy or bad intentions; keep calm as much as possible.</div>
