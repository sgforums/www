Don't have your eyes bigger than your belly: greediness is rarely paying! Your ideas will be interesting and their originality can make you to be noticed in a very positive manner. Don't take things too much to heart otherwise your nervous resistance might be harmed. Increased risks of hepatic or cardiovascular troubles; refrain from rich dishes, pastry and butter.</div>

In any case, you'll have the capacity to manage your finances with rigor and seriousness.

Family conflicts without gravity: it would suffice that each one remains calm so that the problem can be solved rapidly, but if one says a word too many, then it would be oil poured over fire. Follow your intuition, for it will be excellent this time; thanks to it, you'll easily supplant tough adversaries, for you'll have an enormous psychological advantage over them.</div>

You'll this time have your heart torn between stability and the need to live new amorous adventures; you'll find it most difficult to find your center of gravity.

            <div class='col-md body'>17 Oct 06<br>Don't count on speculation to get you out of your present money problems. Your emotional life will be highlighted: you'll receive many testimonies of sympathy. It's true that those who give priority to the heart, like you do, can be richly rewarded. Think to avoid food deficiencies, but this does not mean in any way that it's necessary to eat rich or heavy dishes. Your professional projects will have great chances to be a success in the best conditions. Don't insult fate, convince yourself that each one is the architect of his destiny.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>18 Oct 06<br>Your sentimental life will be gay, light, without either tensions or dramas; your relations will be marked with sensuous fervor. If you're single, you'll want to get married. If you yearn for a responsible position or an honorific function, try not to overdo it. Your finances will be well protected; it will be the moment to recover your credits or ask for a raise in pensions or allowances.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>19 Oct 06<br>Crazy and passionate love affairs will be favored. Somewhat shaky health, with some headaches. To achieve your professional goals, it'll be enough to follow the tracks without deviating; even if you caught the train while rolling, it'll be essential to continue from now on in the right direction. Watch out, a person whom you trust will try to put obstacles in your path. Put aside your old habits for a while and go and see new faces. A day that won't be very favorable to financial or real estate transactions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>20 Oct 06<br>Possible financial problems. In case of a litigious affair, ask for an expert's advice instead of trying to sort it out by yourself. You'll lack objectivity, so avoid irrevocable decisions in every domain. One will notice certain nervous weakness resulting in irritability and impatience; you'll need to rest yourself and also to practice some sort of aggressive sport so as to relieve the pressure. This day will be good and even very good for flirting, for love and, why not, for marriage too.</div>
