Steadfast and solid, this powerful Sign is a born leader, being quite dependable and possessing an innate ability to achieve great things. Oxen tend to be plodding and methodical; they approach projects in the step-by-step manner that serves them best, and they never lose sight of their goal. They are tireless workers who are detail-oriented and believe in doing things right the first time.<br><br>The world may perceive Oxen as being far too serious or incapable of loosening up. This sturdy sort is less than social by nature and tends to become introverted in a crowd. To make things worse, they can't be bothered with what other people think and prefer to do what makes them feel best. Behind that calm facade, though, lives an Ox who can feel hurt, lonely and unable to connect with others. Friends and family are a great source of comfort to this beast, even if they don't always understand what makes the Ox tick. As a lover, friend, family member or housemate, the Ox makes a wonderfully strong, tender and affectionate companion who is protective and always reliable.<br><br>Out in the world, though, Oxen tend to be stubborn, dogmatic, my-way-or-the-highway kind of people who have no concept of when to back down. Oxen don't care to be pushed, especially since they think they're the good guys of the Chinese Zodiac. There is some truth to that theory, since the Ox is smart, trustworthy, caring and honorable. If you need honest, steady and unbiased advice, call on the Ox.<br><br>A good lesson for mighty Oxen is to strive to overcome a judgmental nature that keeps them from getting close to others. If they can learn to value their own good qualities, they'll have more room in their hearts to invite others in.<br><br>The most compatible match for an Ox is the Snake or the Rooster.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Oxen</span>: Tyra Banks, Jim Carrey, George Clooney.</div>

But, on the other hand, they can also be stubborn, methodical, and fiercely competitive, with, shudder, fierce tempers to boot. Oxen are natural born mentors and life is filled with examples of people who have gone on to great success because of them. Mentally and physically alert to the point of genius, many Oxen belong to Mensa. They can create the most imposing structures, magnificent sculpture, and homes.

            <div class='col-md body'>2 Jul 06<br>Sweat blood in order to obtain what you want, the stars will give you the means for it; but don't place your objectives too high! It's advised that you practice a somewhat aggressive sport in an intense manner so as to use your overflowing energy constructively. Unexpected events are to be foreseen on the love front, but don't react in an ungainly manner; show more tact, otherwise there will result incidents detrimental to your present amorous relationships.<br><br>3 Jul 06<br>The state of your finances will be solid. You'll attain very good results in your work and could even hope to get a pay raise soon. Pamper yourself so as to keep up your joy of living; give in to all temptations before they fade away; however, don't forget to remain within reasonable limits. This planetary environment is not quite favorable to sentimental relationships -- it may complicate them by creating tensions, jealousies, conflicts -- nevertheless, you can greatly improve things by showing tolerance and understanding.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4 Jul 06<br>Your love affairs will be very much favored; but you must avoid mixing love with work or money. Even though you may hurt someone, it will be necessary to say 'no' without hesitation. This will be the time to find your most influential friends and secure their support in order to promote your various projects. If you're endowed with artistic gifts, think to explore them right now; you'll draw enormous satisfactions from them. Do not reveal your secrets to anyone today, otherwise they won't be secrets anymore!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 Jul 06<br>Sort out your papers and put your affairs in order, otherwise you'll risk a loss or at least some worries. Beware of colds, and refrain from fats as well as too rich dishes. Slow down your life tempo, otherwise you'll lose some of your effectiveness. Everything will go well heartwise; the love affairs considered at the beginning as transitory and superficial might take a serious turn. You'll have to spend more time with your children.</div>

In your work, you show much realism and efficiency thanks to this solar climate.

I do read them for fun and what you said about taking it with the salt is true but its somewhat disconcerting when things are indeed happening.<br><br>I've always argued before that these things happens because you want it to happen and so you actually make it happen. I'm now wary that I do not make it happen but well, it still does. Basically, I have no control of what is to happen. If good, then all well and ok but if bad, then gotta live with it too.<br><br>Attended a feng shui talk yesterday organised by my company and speaking to the master later also revealed certain similiarities that you posted here.<br><br>Hence, reason why I'm here today to take a look.

In love, try not to privilege logic at the expense of feelings; to try to be overly reasonable under all circumstances would be the worst mistake you could make. Go and visit your mother-in-law today if you feel that your life has been too quiet and monotonous. You'll recover a glowing physical form; nevertheless, beware of your greediness, don't eat too much.</div>
