Try to keep your cool under all circumstances even though people may seek to drive you over the edge. You'll have the possibility to obtain an important promotion in your career; be enterprising and diplomatic at the same time. If a friend ask you for help, don't deny it under any pretext.</div>

Beware of jealousy at all costs; this feeling, which makes you compare yourself constantly with others and always to your disadvantage, is not only painful but also futile and dangerous. Beware of sentimental troubles, which you might be led to live! To thorny questions of interest will be added problems concerning the choice of lodgings or the education of your children. Your business affairs will have all chances to prosper.</div>

An important change in the sentimental domain can take place -- probably a renewal, or love at first sight, or quite an unexpected encounter. Try to be thriftier by limiting your everyday expenses; if you do so, the results will enchant you. Be particularly attentive to the ideas that will come to your mind this time; one of these ideas is likely to change your life completely and for the better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>11 Jul 06<br>You won't be at all on the same wavelength as your children, and this will worry you profoundly; no need to make desperate efforts, rather let things straighten themselves out. The stars will make you see life through rose-colored glasses -- no more useless concerns, no more anguishes. Everything will seem to you easy, merry, sunny; try to preserve this state of grace as long as possible and make a good provision of optimism for gloomier days.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>12 Jul 06<br>The stars will give you a renewed taste for physical effort; do some exercise or sport everyday, this will do you a world of good. Don't try to bypass the law with a view to reaching your objectives quickly or more easily -- it's dangerous! You must think to reciprocate if someone has done you a service. You'll correctly fulfill your various responsibilities even though they may annoy you. Someone will show their great affection for you.</div>
