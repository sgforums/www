In all, 33 turtles were seized.<br><br>The cases are still being investigated, said the AVA's senior wildlife enforcement officer Bobby Lee.<br><br>The turtles have been given to the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum in the Chinese Garden in Jurong.<br><br>AVA was acting on a survey by activist group Animal Concerns Research Education Society (Acres), which visited 100 pet shops last month and this, and found 20 selling endangered species.<br><br>Armed with a videocam, Acres staff posed as customers to find out if the shops sold endangered turtles, where they got them and how much they sold them for.<br><br>They found that 20 shops were openly selling five species: Chinese softshell turtle, Chinese stripe-necked turtle, pig-nosed turtle, Australian snake-necked turtle and another unknown species of turtle.<br><br>Depending on size and species, the turtles were sold between $2.50 and $80 each. They are believed to have come from Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan.<br><br>The law states that anyone caught importing or exporting animals that fall under the Endangered Species Act without a Cites permit can be fined up to $5,000 per species and jailed for up to one year.<br><br>Anyone caught displaying the animals without an AVA permit also faces a fine of up to $5,000.<br><br>Acres executive director Louis Ng yesterday called for stricter enforcement laws and greater penalties to deter the pet shops from repeating the offence.<br><br>Mr Ng said fines should be pegged to the number of animals imported and sold, not just number of species.<br><br>Mr Lee did point out, though, that certain turtle species retrieved from the shops had only been listed under Cites in January. It is possible, therefore, that they were imported before they became illegal.<br><br>'The petshop owners may not be well informed of the differences between the species and had accepted lookalike species,' he said. 'In addition, it is sometimes not easy to tell the species apart when the baby turtles are no bigger than a 50-cent coin.'<br><br>In response, Mr Ng said the turtles permitted for sale here have a 'red marking that is apparent'.<br><br>'But the illegal ones don't. Also, how did the turtles which are brought in by the hundreds make it through the checkpoints in the first place? There must be some reinforcement there,' he added.<br><br>On Mr Ng's call for stricter laws, the AVA said it is reviewing the current act and will consider updating the provisions on penalties to maintain an effective deterrent.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE - An animal rights group said that one in five Singapore pet stores it visited over the past two months illegally sold wildlife, including four species of turtles facing extinction.<br><br>They included endangered striped-neck and softshell turtles native to mainland China, as well as the pig-nosed turtle and the Australian snake-necked turtle, which also face extinction.<br><br>Some of the species were sold for as little as S$30. -- AP<br><br><strong>What the law says </strong><br><br>The law states that anyone caught importing or exporting animals that fall under the Endangered Species Act without a Cites permit can be fined up to $5,000 per species and jailed for up to one year.<br><br>And anyone caught displaying the animals without a permit issued by the AVA also faces a fine of up to $5,000.<br><br>The 33 turtles seized from the six pet shops may be commercially traded if the shop owners have proper Cites permits, the AVA clarified.<br><br>This means that these animals can be imported into Singapore for re-export but may not be sold in the pet shops.<br><br>Only dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, gerbils, mice, chinchillas, red-eared sliders, fancy birds and fish are allowed to be sold in pet shops.<br><br></div>
