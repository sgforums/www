            <div class='col-md body'>The butterfly that come out of the cocoon is the big butterfly that has very dark brown wings type . I think lower wings have a " eye " on them type . I ony see it fly ard my plant then i leave it alone liao . Actually the plant that the caterpillar is eating is the rough lemon plant . I luck it from my previous working place and grow it in my pot , but i never expect it to be the favourite food for that particular type of caterillar . Why i say favouirite food ? Because it only lay eggs on that plant and none on others . And it will also only chew on the rough lemon plant leaves . As i don't really have much hope for the rough lemon plant i let it eat lor , its also a good way to see how caterpillar grow , move and feed. Its a very interesting thing to observe lor . too bad that time my camera really suck in macro mode . Do you know that it really looks like a bird droppings when it is very small . Only when it grows up in size then you can see all the green mzarkings on it . I really hope that it will come to my pot and lay eggs agn ley .<br>Anyway as for the cotton , there is still some seeds inside the cotton and you have to remove the seed manually from the cotton . Otherwise will have fungus growing from it due to the moisture of the seed.</div>

I always prefer to grow plants that others don't usually grow cos i like to be unique . Well ashame to say the first seeds for this plant i got it by going into one of lim chu kang farm where they were growing it on a rambutan tree ( you should have seen it as it was a very special sight to see hulu hanging from a big tree ) and pluck 3 hulu from it .

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry forgot to tell you , this is a vine type of plant which means it needs support to climb up . And it will be heavy if any hulu were to really grow on it . If you want to use the hulu as a container or water bottle , you have to let it ripen on the stem till the whole plabnt die off or it has completely ripened which the hulu will become lighter then when it haven ripen cos the core of it will hollow and dry out .</div>
