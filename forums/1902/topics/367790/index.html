              <p><cite class="vcard">By MICHELLE THERIAULT, <span class="fn org">Michelle Theriault, Associated Press Writer</span> </cite> – Mon Jul 6, 11.48 am ET</p>
              <p>JOHANNESBURG – Namibia's annual commercial seal hunt will go on
              despite objections by animal welfare groups, a government official said
              Monday.</p>
              <p>Frans Tsheehama of the Namibian
              fisheries and marine resources ministry said that the season started on
              July 1 and will run until Nov. 15.</p>
              <p>Hunters are expected to club over 90,000 seals, including 85,000 pups.</p>
              <p>The
              hunt was expected to begin last week, but there was confusion over
              whether the killings had begun after numerous media reports that a
              South African-based animal rights activist was in negotiations to halt
              them.</p>
              <p>Namibia is one of only a few remaining countries with a commercial seal harvest. The government argues that the seal population<a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: none ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #000000;"></span></a> needs to be controlled to protect fish stocks.</p>
              <p>However, animal rights activists say the practice is inhumane and outdated.</p>
              <p>Seals are hunted for skins, fur and meat, and seal genitals are sold as traditional medicines and aphrodisiacs in Asia.</p>
              <p>Activist Francois Hugo<a id="KonaLink1" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: none ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #000000;"></span></a> of Seal Alert South Africa said last week that he had made a bid to buy
              out the company that purchases the Namibian seal pelts, effectively
              halting the hunt.</p>
              <p>Hugo said that clubbing an animal to death is cruel, criminal and in defiance of international animal protection laws.</p>
              <p>He
              also challenged the Namibian government's claim that the hunt
              maintained healthy seal populations, saying that in the past whole
              colonies had been devastated.</p>
              <p>Namibia's seals number about 850,000 and live on a dozen remote, rocky islands off the coast of the sparsely populated southern African country.<a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: none ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #000000;"></span></a></p>
              <p>The hunt takes place under clandestine circumstances to avoid the glare of publicity — and to avoid upsetting tourists.</p>
              <p>The
              government has said seals consume 900,000 tons of fish each year, more
              than a third of the fishing industry's catch, and that the cull is
              needed to protect fisheries. Animal welfare groups counter that most of
              the seals killed are still-nursing pups.</p>
              <p>AJ
              Cady of the International Fund for Animal Welfare said that the
              industry is "collapsing" worldwide, citing a recent European Union ban
              on the import of seal products<a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: none ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #000000;"></span></a> combined with the global economic downturn. In this year's Canadian
              harvest, sealers killed less than a third of their quota on weak demand.</p>
              <p>"The great question here is who is really buying these things?" Cady said. "The cruelty is so obvious."</p>

              <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Namibian Cape Fur Seal Hunt</span></h1>
              <h3>This year is the third year that the Namibian government has
              authorized the slaughter of 85,000 cape fur seal pups and 6,000 cape
              fur seal bulls.</h3>
              <p>The Cape fur seals are rounded up on Namibian beaches and
              slaughtered over a period of 20 weeks, starting in July. The pups are
              still nursing when they are clubbed or stabbed to death.</p>
              <p>If
              all these seals are killed, this slaughter will be larger than the
              Canadian harp seal 'hunt' this year, which resulted in the deaths of
              about 60,000 harp seal pups (much lower than the quota, due to the
              European Union ban on all seal product imports, which <a href="http://www.harpseals.org/resources/news_and_press/2009/seal_hunt_political.html#banapproved">reduced demand</a>).</p>
              <p>However, this year, after the EU ban and stockpiling of 20,000 unsold seal skins,  the Australian buyer of cape fur seal skins, <a href="http://www.yavuzgrup.com/hatemyavuz.htm">Hatem Yavuz</a>, has offered the Cape fur seals' major advocate, <a href="http://sealalertsa.wordpress.com/">Francois Hugo of Seal Alert-SA</a> the opportunity to buy him out over the next decade, at a price of
              US$14 million, thus preventing the slaughter of Cape fur seals for this
              span of time.</p>
              <p>This offer, which Francois refers to as
              "blackmail", is due to expire on the 7th of July. The killing of seals
              is being postponed as Francois attempts to raise this "ransom."</p>

              <h1>Pair convicted in Namibia for filming seal hunt</h1>
              <p>AFP - <abbr class="timedate" title="2009-07-17T12:13:52-0700">Fri Jul 17, 3:13 pm ET</abbr></p>
              <p>WINDHOEK (AFP) – 
              Two European journalists were fined on Friday by a court in <span id="lw_1247858205_0" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Namibia</span> for filming the annual <span id="lw_1247858205_1" class="yshortcuts">seal hunt</span> along the coast of the <span id="lw_1247858205_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">southern African nation</span>, their lawyer said.</p>
              <p>British investigative journalist Jim Wilckens and South African
              cameraman Bart Smithers were found guilty of violating the Marine
              Resources Act by entering a restricted area without permission, lawyer
              Raywood Rukoro said.</p>
              <p>Both were released after paying a fine of 5,000 dollars (625 US
              dollars) each, he said, adding that they intended to leave Namibia
              soon, even though they are not being deported.</p>
              <p>"We are happy this is over and we will leave as soon as possible," Wilckens told reporters afterwards.</p>
              <p>The duo was arrested by police whilst documenting the Namibian seal
              cull. They were kept at police cells at Henties Bay, about 400
              kilometres (250 miles) from the capital <span id="lw_1247858205_3" class="yshortcuts">Windhoek</span>.</p>
              <p>Wilckens, a reporter with the British-based Eco-Storm agency, and <span id="lw_1247858205_4" class="yshortcuts">Smithers</span> were working with the Dutch non-governmental organisation Bont Voor Dieren.</p>
              <p>Andrew Wasley, co-director of Eco-Storm, alleged that the two had been beaten up by workers involved in the cull.</p>
              <p>"One of the two reporters laid a charge of physical assault, but no one has been arrested yet", a police officer told AFP.</p>
              <p>The annual commercial seal harvesting season opened on July 1 with a
              quota of 85,000 pups due to be clubbed and killed for their fur on the
              Namibian coast.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>ISTANBUL (AFP) – 
              An Australian-based fur company has begun culling baby seals in <span id="lw_1248453245_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Namibia</span> after <span id="lw_1248453245_1" class="yshortcuts">animal rights activists</span> failed to pay on time the millions of dollars they pledged to buy the company out, the owner said Friday.</p>
              <p>"Nothing came from these associations and we have begun the annual slaughter," Hatem Yavuz -- who has offices both in <span id="lw_1248453245_2" class="yshortcuts">Sydney</span> and <span id="lw_1248453245_3" class="yshortcuts">Istanbul</span> in his native Turkey -- told AFP.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, animal rights activists announced that they had
              launched a campaign to raise 14.2 million US dollars (9.9 million
              euros) to buy out Yavuz's company which buys the pelts.</p>
              <p>Yavuz said that he had been ready to go along with the offer -- made by several associations, including Seal Alert <span id="lw_1248453245_4" class="yshortcuts">South Africa</span> and <span id="lw_1248453245_5" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Humane Society International</span> -- but said he now felt they had been dishonest.</p>
              <p>"I told them 'You want to buy me out, buy me out'. Today, there is
              nothing on the table. They kept the money in their pocket," he said.</p>
              <p>The culling began "about a week ago," after a two-week delay, Yavuz added.</p>
              <p>The annual commercial seal harvesting season in Namibia officially
              began on July 1 with a quota of 85,000 pups due to be clubbed to death
              and 6000 bulls to be shot on the country's coast.</p>
              <p>In May this year, the <span id="lw_1248453245_6" class="yshortcuts">European Union</span> banned <span id="lw_1248453245_7" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">imports and exports</span> of all seal products in their 27 member states, including transporting
              these products through the EU to other parts of the world.</p>
