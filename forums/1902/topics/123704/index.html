            <div class='col-md body'>Eh.. Dunno whether I shld post here anot.. It's about animals, hope I didnt post at the wrong place..<br><br>Hmmm.. Jus wanna share a thought.. I was browsing trailers from an oversea search engine and I saw this movie from Japan, titled Sayonara Kuro. It's really touching.. I was already in tears when I saw the trailer.. It says how this stray dog changed lives of many ppl in a school. It's really nice, friendly, and loyal. It talks about how it was found, and till the day it passed away. I'm not very good with words, dunno how to describe. I'll post the link below, later you guys can go have a look.<br><br>I doubt this is the first movie or show talking about how animals or pets play an important role in our lives. Before this, there's another movie also from Japan which is titled Quil?(correct me if I'm wrong) It's the show about a golden retriever which leads paths for the blind. And long long before, there's even this drama(also in japanese), starred by Tsyoushi Domoto talking about the animals. All these raised awareness that we should live peacefully with the animals cos they contributes to our lives, but why are there still so many adorable animals get killed everyday?<br><br>I personally is a cat lover. It really pains me when I see a cat got tortured or murdered by our own fellow beings. Oh please! Stop giving excuses that they're noisy, sh!tting all over the places or meowing too loudly at night, therefore you have to do something terrible to it! How would you think of we humans are behaving like if you are a cat? In fact I should say, we are the most fake, weird, and cruel animals in this world!! True, we have a great mind, but many often use it to contains dirty thoughts instead of thinking how we should make this world less chaotic; we have a good and strong body, but many use it to abuse other living things!<br><br>Why? Why do our fellow beings did all these? Animals doesn't take up alot of space. Neither do they trying to attack you, or even eat you! But why are we going all the cruel acts against them, even serving them as food when we already have good food? They don't even try attacking you when they're hungry, they rather beg for food! I really can't believe why some of us can't tolerate their existance..<br><br>OK, enough of my "little" thoughts.. Just no longer can carry on.. I'm definately not the first to say it, in fact, I've seen quite some protesting already.. Just pray for a better lives for those little cuties.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Oh ya.. Before I forgot, here's the link to the trailer.. It's in chinese btw, sorry abt it..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> http://tw.movie.yahoo.com/mstory.html?t=movie&amp;id=1128<br><br>Maybe if they bring the show to Singapore, we animal lovers can organised a big event, and go mass support the show.. I think it's really worth watching..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
