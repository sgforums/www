              <p class="first">Discovery News</p>
              <p class="first">A new study has found that mushroom corals can switch
              from male to female and back again, the first to show that coral can
              change sex in either direction.</p>
              <p>Understanding why and when some corals make the switch may
              eventually help scientists protect them from the stresses of a changing
              environment.</p>
              <p>For now, the study remains a fascinating window into the biology and evolution of these corals.</p>
              <p>"We know in detail the reproductive patterns of more than 500 coral
              species, but no one reported before on the fact that some coral species
              may change sex," says lead author professor Yossi Loya, a zoologist at <a href="https://www.telavivuniv.org/Default.aspx">Tel Aviv University</a>.</p>
              <p>"I believe this was quite a big surprise to all coral reef scientists."</p>
              <p>Mushroom corals belong to a family called Fungiidae. They are
              solitary, mobile species that live throughout the Pacific and Indian
              Oceans.</p>
              <p>Mushroom corals are abundant and diverse, but how they reproduce is something scientists haven't known much about.</p>
              <h3>Capturing gametes</h3>
              <p>To
              learn more, Loya and a colleague travelled to a patch reef near
              Okinawa, Japan. The reef is home to tens of thousands of mushroom
              corals, representing a dozen species.</p>
              <p>In 2004, the researchers collected, weighed, measured, and tagged
              about 15 individuals from two species. Each coral then got its own
              aquarium in the lab.</p>
              <p>That July, about five days after the full moon, the mushroom corals
              did what many corals do - simultaneously release sperm and eggs.</p>
              <p>In the ocean, these gamete explosions produce larvae that drift off
              to become new corals. In the lab, the scientists collected the gametes
              and looked at them under a microscope. Then, they returned the corals
              to the sea.</p>
              <p>Initial analyses showed that each coral produced either sperm or
              eggs. Some types of corals are hermaphroditic, with both male and
              female parts. But mushroom corals appeared to be just one or the other.</p>
              <p>The researchers repeated the same experiment in 2006 and 2007 - with
              both the same individuals and new ones. The results grew increasingly
              surprising.</p>
              <p>In 2006, about 25% of one species and 50% of the other had changed sex since they'd been tagged two years earlier.</p>
              <p>In 2007, 80% of the corals had changed sex from the year before. A
              quarter of those had reverted back to the sex they had originally been
              in 2004.</p>
              <p>The results appear in the journal <a href="http://www.pnas.org/"><em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a> .</p>
              <p>"They went back to their notebooks because they thought they had
              made a mistake," says Professor Robert van Woesik, a marine biologist
              at the Florida Institute of Technology.</p>
              <p>"We never realised in our wildest dreams that these corals can undergo sex changes. This is really exciting."</p>
              <h3>Conserving energy</h3>
              <p>When
              mushroom corals are small, it makes more sense to be male, says Loya,
              because it takes less energy to produce sperm than to produce eggs.
              When the corals reach some critical size, however, it's better to be
              female.</p>
              <p>Loya says some plants do the same thing, making this study
              interesting from an evolutionary perspective. Corals may look
              plant-like, but they belong to the Animal Kingdom.</p>
              <p>The transition from male to female seems to be a natural progression with growth, van Woesik adds.</p>
              <p>But the fact that the corals sometimes switch back from female to
              male, might be a sign that they are in distress and need to conserve
              resources.</p>
              <p>Ocean organisms face stress from a number of source, including
              pollution and climate change. If environmental pressures push too many
              mushroom corals towards maleness, a skewed sex ratio could threaten
              their future.</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #008080;">Wednesday, June 17, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #008080;"><br><br>Banning or restricting the use of 
              certain types of fishing gear could help the world's coral reefs and their fish 
              populations survive the onslaughts of climate change according to a study by the 
              ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, the 
              Wildlife Conservation Society, and other groups. <br><br>The international team 
              of scientists has proposed that bans on fishing gear - like spear guns, fish 
              traps, and beach seine nets – could aid in the recovery of reefs and fish 
              populations hard hit by coral bleaching events. <br><br>Around the world corals 
              have been dying at alarming rates, due to unusually warm water events resulting 
              from global warming. <br><br>Research carried out in Kenya and Papua New Guinea 
              has shown that certain types of gear are more damaging to corals, to 
              coral-dependent fish and to the key species of fish that are needed to help 
              reefs recover from bleaching or storm damage. <br><br>"This is creating a double 
              jeopardy for both the corals and certain types of reef fish. They are already on 
              the edge because of overfishing– and the additional impact caused by a bleaching 
              can push them over" Dr Cinner explains. The result can be an accelerated decline 
              of the reef, its fish populations – and their ability to sustain local people. 
              <br><br>"From an ecological perspective, the best response to bleaching is to 
              close reefs to fishing entirely. But that is not feasible everywhere and is a 
              particularly hard sell among the impoverished fishers in developing countries" 
              says co-author Dr. Tim McClanahan of the Wildlife Conservation Society. "In 
              areas where fishery closures are impractical, managers don't have many options 
              and haven't been able to do much but watch the reef die and often not recover." 
              <br><br>"Selective gear restrictions offer reef managers and fishers alike some 
              middle ground, reducing pressure on the reef and its fish while it is in the 
              recovery phase, while also providing fishers with some options for their 
              livelihood" Dr Cinner says. This middle way is also more likely to be taken up 
              by fishers. "In other research we've found that fishers themselves prefer gear 
              restrictions to total closures, because most fishers use several types of gear 
              so they can still earn a living when the use of one sort of gear is banned. They 
              are more likely to comply." <br><br>The team investigated the effects of five 
              main types of gear on different types of fish: spear guns, traps, hook and line, 
              beach seine nets and gill nets. <br><br>They found that spear guns were the most 
              damaging of all – to corals themselves, to susceptible fish species and to the 
              fish needed to help reefs recover, such as parrot, surgeon and trigger fish, 
              which keep seaweeds and urchins in check while the coral re-grows. 
              <br><br>"Spear guns target a high proportion of species that help maintain the 
              resilience of coral reefs, but also can result in a surprising amount of damage 
              to the corals themselves. When a fish is shot with a spear gun, it often hides 
              in the reef, so some fishermen break the corals in their attempts to get it." Dr 
              Cinner says. <br><br>But in developing countries, spear guns can be the fishing 
              tool most used by the poorest fishers because they are cheap to make and the 
              yield can be high, so they are an important source of income for poor fishers. 
              <br><br>"You can't simply impose an arbitrary ban on their use – you need to 
              consider issues like compensation, other fishing options, or alternative 
              livelihoods for the affected fishers," says co-author Dr. Shaun Wilson of the 
              Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation. "One key issue 
              may be educating fishers about the importance of reef habitat and the species 
              that help to maintain reef quality – and the need to be selective in what they 
              shoot. This would mean fishers could still use this cheap and effective fishing 
              tool without necessarily damaging habitat and reef resilience." <br><br>Fish 
              traps also targeted both the most susceptible reef fish and the ones most 
              involved in reef recovery. Beach seine nets didn't target as many key fish 
              species as gill nets, traps, or spear guns, but were damaging both to corals 
              directly and took large amounts of juvenile fish. <br><br>"Where people really 
              depend on reef resources, it may not be possible to permanently ban all of these 
              types of gear. By creating temporary bans for specific types of gear following a 
              coral bleaching event, reef managers could ease pressure on the reef and its 
              fish population for a time when corals ecosystems are most sensitive without 
              causing undue hardship to the human populations that depend on it." Dr Cinner 
              says <br><br>"Of course, where the conditions are right, managers and fishers 
              don't have to wait for a bleaching event- preventative gear bans are a good 
              idea, particularly in areas that are highly susceptible to the impacts of 
              bleaching," says co-author Dr Nick Graham. "And our new research provides 
              managers with some ideas about the trade-offs involved in banning certain gear." 
              <br><br>Dr Cinner says that temporary bans or imposing permanent restrictions on 
              the use of various types of gear can apply to virtually any coral reef 
              management – whether in the developing world or in developed countries such as 
              on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. <br><br>"In principle, it can be used 
              anywhere. It offers both communities and reef managers much greater flexibility. 
              Around the world, communities are increasingly making their own decisions about 
              how to protect their reefs and they could impose voluntary bans on certain 
              gears. <br><br>### <br><br>Wildlife Conservation Society</span></p>

The damaged reefs were quickly smothered by a single species of seaweed – an event that can spell the total loss of the corals. <br><br>However, a lucky combination of rare circumstances meant the reefs were able to achieve a spectacular recovery, with abundant corals re-established in a single year, says Dr Guillermo Diaz-Pulido, from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (CoECRS) and the Centre for Marine Studies at The University of Queensland. <br><br>Dr Diaz-Pulido explains that the rapid recovery is due to an exceptional combination of previously-underestimated ecological mechanisms. <br><br>"Three factors were critical. The first was exceptionally high re-growth of fragments of surviving coral tissue. The second was an unusual seasonal dieback in the seaweeds, and the third was the presence of a highly competitive coral species, which was able to outgrow the seaweed. <br><br>"But this also all happened in the context of a well-protected marine area and moderately good water quality", said Dr Diaz-Pulido. <br><br>"It is rare to see reports of reefs that bounce back from mass coral bleaching or other human impacts in less than a decade or two," he adds <br><br>"The exceptional aspect was that corals recovered by rapidly regrowing from surviving tissue. Recovery of corals is usually thought to depend on sexual reproduction and the settlement and growth of new corals arriving from other reefs. This study demonstrates that for fast-growing coral species asexual reproduction is a vital component of reef resilience" says Dr Sophie Dove, also from CoECRS and The University of Queensland. <br><br>"Coral reefs globally are increasingly being damaged by mass bleaching and climate change, and their capacity to recovery from that damage is critical to their future," explains Prof. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of CoECRS and The University of Queensland. "Our study suggests that managing local stresses that affect reefs such as overfishing and declining water quality can have a big influence on the trajectory of reefs under rapid global change." <br><br>"Clearly, we need to urgently deal with the problem of rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but managing reefs to reduce the impact of local factors can buy important time while we do this," he says. <br><br>Understanding the different mechanisms of resilience is critical for reef management under climate change. "Diversity in processes may well be critical to the overall resilience and persistence of coral reef ecosystems globally," Dr Laurence McCook, from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, says. <br><br>The research was partially funded by a Pew Fellowship in Marine Conservation awarded to Dr McCook, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority as well as the ARC Centre of Excellence program. <br><br>"This combination of circumstances provided a lucky escape for the coral reefs in Keppel Islands, but is also a clear warning for the Great Barrier Reef. As climate change and other human impacts intensify, we need to do everything we possibly can to protect the resilience of coral reefs," he adds. <br><br>### <br><br>ARC Centre of Excellence in Coral Reef Studies</span></p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Tuesday, June 16, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #3366ff;"><br><br>Emergency plans to counteract global 
              warming by artificially shading the Earth from incoming sunlight might lower the 
              planet's temperature a few degrees, but such "geoengineering" solutions would do 
              little to stop the acidification of the world oceans that threatens coral reefs 
              and other marine life, report the authors of a new study in the journal 
              Geophysical Research Letters*. The culprit is atmospheric carbon dioxide, which 
              even in a cooler globe will continue to be absorbed by seawater, creating acidic 
              conditions. <br><br>"There would be a slight reduction in this problem, because 
              land plants would be expected to be able to grow more vigorously in a high CO2, 
              but cool world," says Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution's Department of 
              Global Ecology, a co-author of the study with lead author Damon Matthews of 
              Concordia University, Canada, and Carnegie geochemist Long Cao. Land plants and 
              soils would hold onto more carbon in this scenario, so less would find its way 
              into the oceans. "However this expansion of the land biosphere, while it's a 
              slight help to ocean acidification is not enough to make a big difference." 
              <br><br>A widely-discussed proposal for countering warming with geoengineering 
              involves injecting small, reflective particles into the upper atmosphere. This 
              would partially block incoming sunlight before it reached the Earth's surface, 
              lowering global temperatures just as volcanic ash from the Mount Pinatubo did 
              following its eruption in 1991. But critics have warned that such a scheme might 
              also alter rainfall patterns, damage the planet's ozone layer, or have other 
              unexpected effects. <br><br>Until the current study, which used a computer model 
              of the Earth's climate system and biosphere to simulate the effect of 
              geoengineering on climate and the ocean's chemistry, the potential impact of 
              such a scheme on ocean acidification had never been calculated. In the 
              simulations, reduced sunlight cooled the planet as expected,,and it also 
              slightly slowed the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, as more carbon was 
              absorbed by natural sinks. But this slight change was not enough to 
              significantly mitigate ocean acidification. <br><br>Ocean acidification rivals 
              global warming as a threat to marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs, which 
              need to be surrounded with mineral-saturated water in order to grow. Rising 
              levels of carbon dioxide make seawater more acidic, leading to lower mineral 
              saturation. Recent research has indicated that continued carbon dioxide 
              emissions will cause coral reefs to begin dissolving within a few decades, 
              putting the survival of these ecosystems at extreme risk. 
              <br><br>Geoengineering's minimal effect on ocean acidification adds another 
              factor to the debate over the advisability of intentionally tampering with the 
              climate system. Some see geoengineering as a possibly necessary response to the 
              prospect of devastating climate change caused by increased human emission of 
              greenhouse gases. Others see it as reckless tinkering with the planet's complex 
              and finely tuned climate system that could do more harm than good. 
              <br><br>"Geoengineering approaches come with all sorts of risks," says Caldiera. 
              "It is important we learn about the the full set of these risks and all of their 
              implications." He considers deep cuts in human emissions of carbon dioxide to be 
              the most effective safeguard against a global environmental crisis. "One of the 
              good reasons to prefer CO2 emissions reductions over geoengineering is that CO2 
              emissions reductions will protect the oceans from the threat of ocean 
              acidification, whereas these geoengineering options will not." <br><br>###
