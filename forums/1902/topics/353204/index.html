              <p><span style="color: #993300;"><img src="http://sg-portal-origin.web.aol.com/image-files/reuters/2009/03/2009-03-23T175046Z_01_BTRE52M1C6Z00_RTROPTP_3_OUKWD-UK-VOLCANO-ALASKA.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>By Yereth Rosen</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">ANCHORAGE, AlaskaÂ - Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano erupted for the first time in 20 years, threatening air traffic and nearby villages with a towering burst of ash, and more eruptions were expected.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The first blast occurred at 10:38 p.m. Pacific time on Sunday (5:38 a.m. British time Monday), the Alaska Volcano Observatory said. It was followed by four smaller eruptions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The 10,197-foot (3,108-metre) volcano, in a sparsely populated area 106 miles (170 km) southwest of Anchorage, Alaska's largest city with about 260,000 people, had been showing signs of a possible eruption for about two months. So far Anchorage has been untouched by harmful volcanic ash, which is drifting north from the volcano.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"We expect the pattern of this event to be similar to the 1989 and 1990 eruptions and the activity could continue along those lines for several weeks or several months," said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar on a conference call.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The volcano last rumbled to life in December 1989, erupting multiple times over a period of almost five months, with ash from the first blast nearly downing a KLM jetliner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Ash can hamper visibility, clog machinery, hinder breathing and damage wastewater systems, among other things.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">FIVE ERUPTIONS</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Tina Neal, a geologist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory, said each of the five eruptions lasted 10 to 20 minutes, and the series ended around 4:31 a.m. (8:31 a.m. British time) on Monday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"Each event sent up an ash cloud as high as 50,000 (15,200 meters) and possibly 60,000 feet (18,300 metres)," Neal said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The observatory warned airlines to steer clear of the area. Anchorage-area airports are still open, but Alaska Air Group -- the state's leading carrier -- said it had cancelled 19 flights in and out of Anchorage so far.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"This is changing constantly, depending on how the winds blow," said Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Marianne Lindsey.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The Drift River Oil Terminal, a holding point for crude oil near the foot of the volcano on the western shore of Cook Inlet, was shutting down temporarily.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"At this point in time we believe that everything is safe there," Salazar said. The terminal was inundated by floods and mudslides during the 1989-1990 eruptions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The terminal is owned and operated by Cook Inlet Pipe Line, which is partly owned by Unocal, now a part of oil giant Chevron.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">The bulk of the ash from the most recent eruptions was blown at the 30,000-foot (9,150-metre) level, and is not reaching significantly populated areas, Neal said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Ash was confirmed in one community and reported in a few other spots along the Susitna Valley north of Anchorage, she added. Denali Park and Nikolai also experienced some ash fall.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"We should consider ourselves lucky today that we aren't out sweeping up ash now (in Anchorage)," said John Power, a geophysicist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"If Redoubt erupts again, next time the wind direction may be very different," said Power, who expects more eruptions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">"The volcano is still restless," said Neal. "We'll be watching it very closely. It is highly unstable still and further eruptions are likely."</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Evacuation ordered as Chile volcano erupts</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">By Simon Gardner</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's Llaima volcano, one of the most active in South America, spewed out a river of lava more than 1,100 yards (1,000 metres) long on Saturday in a fresh eruption, prompting officials to order dozens of people to evacuate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Llaima, which lies in Chile's picturesque lake region about 435 miles (700 km) south of the capital Santiago, erupted on January 1, 2008, and has belched rock and ash sporadically since then.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The lava and hot gases from the latest eruption are melting snow on the sides of the volcano, and authorities say some towns are in danger of being hit by mudslides.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"We are going to start the evacuation of some people who live in sectors that are particularly vulnerable to the risk of ... avalanches of mud due to melting snow," Johaziel Jamett, head of the early warning centre at the National Emergency Office, told Reuters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">"It is a spread-out population. We are talking about a few dozen people, not a massive evacuation," he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Twelve people have been evacuated from the Conguillio national park surrounding Llaima, including two tourists. Police have closed the park, and troops have been dispatched to the area, the emergency office said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">MINIMAL DAMAGE</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It said an ash-swollen river near the volcano had swept away a pedestrian bridge, but there was no other damage. Bright red bursts of lava were visible in the night sky as Llaima erupted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The office said on its website that there were "permanent explosions that reach 600 metres (650 yards) above the crater. Falling ash is visible and ... a flow of lava of more than 1,000 metres (1,100 yards) has been observed."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Chile's chain of some 2,000 volcanoes is the world's second-largest after Indonesia. Some 50 to 60 are on record as having erupted, and 500 are potentially active.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The 10,253-foot (3,127-metre) Llaima was the second to erupt in the past year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The Chaiten volcano, 760 miles (1,200 km) south of Santiago in the Patagonia region, erupted last May for the first time in thousands of years, spewing ash, gas and molten rock and prompting the evacuation of thousands of people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Ash from Chaiten soared 20 miles (32 km) into the sky, swelled rivers and caused floods that damaged dozens of houses and destroyed much of the nearby town of the same name.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Chaiten erupted again in February, leading to the evacuation of residents who had rejected a government plan to abandon the town and rebuild it a few miles (km) away.</span></p>
