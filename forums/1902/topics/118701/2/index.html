            <div class='col-md body'>Sagittarius accents that part of your chart related to career, drive, ambitions, prestige, standing in the community and opportunity for success. The Jupiter of Sagittarius and your Neptune significator symbolize new starts, originality and a degree of selfishness. When together, you'll spread out and then perhaps join in one single line, representing an arrow that shoots directly for the mark.<br><br>Generally, the two signs are not considered compatible. But, if determined, this team could build together toward security.<br><br>For Pisces, Sagittarius could stimulate a fire, a drive which might otherwise be dormant. For Sagittarius, Pisces represents home and security. But there is conflict. The solution centers on deciding who is going to do the leading, who the following.<br><br>With Sagittarius, you will want to elevate your position. You'll want independence. You are more direct in your relationship with Sagittarius than is usually the case. There may be sharp rebukes connected with this relationship. There could be disagreements and battles. But, through it all, there is also likely to be progress.<br><br>Listen, Pisces: I would say this is a better relationship on the professional level than it is on a personal one. This means, of course, for starting a business, for promoting a product, for finding room at the top, this combination is favorable. But not so much so for peace, tranquility, emotional stability. There simply is apt to be too much conflict.<br><br>Of course, if you are both mature -and determined - then professional and personal success can be combined. But the odds are against it.<br><br>For beginning a project, for an original approach, for creative endeavors for these things -a Sagittarius is good for a Pisces. For emotional contentment, there might be much to be desired.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you get involved with the other eleven signs or another Fish different reactions occur.<br><br>PISCES &amp; ARIES: - You are far too sensitive for the aggressive Ram. You will be left behind to drown in your sorrows. An unfortunate match.<br><br>PISCES &amp; TAURUS: - This is not a bad connection, however the Bull can get upset with your impractical nature. You, on the other hand, may find that the Bull is too stubborn.<br><br>PISCES &amp; GEMINI: - Your emotional blackmail will usually hold a Gemini, however sorrow almost always prevails. A very destructive union for both parties involved.<br><br>PISCES &amp; CANCER: - You belong together. You are both sensitive, weepy and love to dwell in self-pity. This is a great match, certainly lasting, however someone negative and moody.<br><br>PISCES &amp; LEO: - You are doomed in this alliance. The Lion is too outgoing and you are far too sensitive. A hurtful relationship with little substance.<br><br>PISCES &amp; VIRGO: - This is your polar attraction. It can be extremely perverse in the bedroom, but difficult at a mental level. You are impractical and this will really try the Virgoans patience.<br><br>PISCES &amp; LIBRA: - You are both creatively inclined, however you are just not sophisticated enough for the Scales. Librans also have trouble putting up with your emotional whims.<br><br>PISCES &amp; SCORPIO: - This is a highly sexual union. You love to be possessed and cared for with the deep, warm affection that the Scorpion can provide. Truly a match made in heaven.<br><br>PISCES &amp; SAGITTARIUS: - This is not your best alliance as the Archer's non-committal nature will hurt your tender heart. Your daily melodramas will drive the Sagittarius away.<br><br>PISCES &amp; CAPRICORN: - This is not a bad combo in general however, you will probably run around on the Goat due to loneliness. You are also too wasteful for the Capricorn to deal with.<br><br>PISCES &amp; AQUARIUS: - This is not the best union. The Water-bearer is far too cool and detached for you. Your tears and tantrums will soon tire the Aquarius.<br><br>PISCES &amp; PISCES: - This is an emotional connection. Extremely good in the bedroom, but difficult out of the bedroom. You both crave attention and affection yet you want to do your own thing. Exhausting but exciting.<br><br></div>
