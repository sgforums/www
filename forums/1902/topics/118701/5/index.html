You need to take a good look at all sides of an issue before making a decision. If you haven't already, don't be afraid to start your own small business on the side. You don't like confrontations at the best of times; however, you may find them difficult to avoid. Be financially prudent. Today can be one of those perfect days if you make plans to do something special with the one you love. Do something a little different with your looks and you will be sure to get compliments.</div>
