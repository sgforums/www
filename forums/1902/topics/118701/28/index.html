            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Travel or short trips will probably be your best outlet. Put your time and energy into travel, philosophy, and soul-searching. Tie up your personal papers or push to have legal settlements completed.<br>Don't make mountains out of molehills if you want to avoid conflict. Make plans to attend group discussions or get together with friends who like to talk as much as you do. Travel will be favorable and bring you the greatest rewards.<br>With Mercury moving backwards you could find that you start feeling edgy and restless, which is an unusual state for such a serene sign. ItÂ’s too early to think about a summer vacation, but there is nothing stopping you from taking advantage of the weekend to arrange a trip to somewhere new!</div>
