            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>An older loved one may be having problems. Follow through on some of the good ideas that come up, and you could have a real winner of a deal. Your best efforts will come through making changes in your home.<br>You're intuitive today; however, this attribute could get you in trouble if you tactlessly say what you think. You may find that your anger stems from lending or borrowing money. You are best to work at home, clearing up overdue projects.<br>ItÂ’s possible that youÂ’ll be feeling emotionally neglected today, which could lead to frustration and maybe even some tensions. But the fact is that itÂ’ll be you who blows things out of proportion. A selfless gesture from you, like preparing a special meal, will soothe away all those negative feelings!</div>

Avoid letting children and friends borrow.<br>It's time to reconnect with some of the people you used to know. You may find your mate somewhat perturbed. Jealous colleagues may try to undermine you.<br>The sun and moon are still playing havoc with your feelings, and the rapid change of aspects means that youÂ’re likely to feel a little burdened and put upon in the morning, but by the evening youÂ’re likely to feel more dynamic and energetic.

Your boss won't be too thrilled if you leave things unfinished.<br>Today would be a good day for shopping, particularly for finding some unusual little bargains that jazz up your outfits: gemstone jewelry, originally designed wraps, or even a new complimentary purse will appeal and theyÂ’ll provide a splash of color without breaking the bank!<br>Your attitudes at work will open new avenues for you.

Your tendency to vacillate will drive everyone crazy.<br>Unexpected romantic connections can be made if you go out with friends or take a pleasure trip. Try to understand their point of view. Your own small business on the side could ease your financial stress.<br>Thanks to the four planets in Leo you should be feeling remarkably energetic today. While you can be quite nervous of change as a rule you are unusually keen to access new ideas and novel ways of approaching problems today.

Residential moves look hectic and sudden changes in your life are likely.<br>You might find that youÂ’re pulled in two directions today; all the obligations of work or school will tug one way, while your need for some creative outlet pulls you another way.

Don't overextend your self in order to add luxury items to your entertainment center.

Travel is evident, but be cautious while in transit. Accommodate others but not before you do your own thing. Do the proper safety checks before you go out.<br>Someone could be a bit troublesome today; it could be a close friend or even a partner. The trouble is that their behavior might put you on the defensive, which will put you in a sour mood. However, if a stalemate does develop it can be easily broken if youÂ’re prepared to extend the olive branch.</div>

You will have a little more energy than usual.
