            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You can make money if you concentrate on producing services or goods that will make domestic chores easier. Your tendency to overreact could get you into trouble. Travel should be on your agenda.<br>Do whatever your mate wants; it really doesn't matter as long as you're together. You need to do more things that you enjoy. You can get your point across and make valuable connections.<br>If you find that you have a little too much energy then try taking on some interest that allows you to express yourself to avoid becoming moody or over emotional today. Do this and romantic matters should continue to go well today, especially by the evening, when the moon moves into Libra.</div>

Talk to superiors about problems that you feel are getting out of hand. Try to think things through.<br>Someone you live with may cause drastic alterations in your usual routine. Don't take your frustrations out on the ones you love. Mingle with those who can help you get ahead.<br>It is more than likely that youÂ’ll be feeling as though you should be doing something that makes an impact on the world today. By all means, allow your sensitivity and compassion to guide you to do good things, but make sure that you treat yourself as well, as we all need to indulge ourselves once in a while.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You are best to tuck your money away where no one will be able to touch it, including yourself. Your anger may be impossible to contain if you get into debates with family members. Think twice before you say something you might regret later.<br>You are in a high energy, get it all done, mood and you'll have little patience with those who are slacking off. Take time to help children with projects that may be too hard for them to do on their own. Try to deal with the problems of those less fortunate; however, don't allow them to make unreasonable demands.<br>With the sun moving out of your sign and into Aries you should expect to become more grounded. But be warned: thanks to a minor but negative aspect you might experience certain frustrations regarding your finances. This, however, is temporary and will be resolved soon.</div>

It's time to make professional changes.<br>Business trips might prove unproductive. Do not get involved in joint financial ventures. Get down to business and do the work yourself.<br>The discord between the sun and the moon is likely to have a much lesser effect on you than on other signs, but it will still be present, especially in terms of friendships. ItÂ’s possible that youÂ’ll overstep the mark today, so be prepared to back- pedal! Just try to see other peopleÂ’s point of view!</div>

Uncertainties regarding relatives will make situations uncomfortable if you attend a family function.<br>Your high energy and discipline will enable you to complete any seemingly insurmountable tasks. Children could cost you more than you can afford. Don't overreact if your partner has a poor attitude.<br>Thanks to the influence of Venus and the impact of your ruling planet youÂ’ll probably need to face up to a few home truths today, especially in terms of romance and relationships in general. Try to stop creating ideal situations in your mind and start celebrating the differences that make people so unique!</div>

You may find that doing odd jobs around the house will be successful and appreciated by loved ones. You must use discretion when talking to others. Gambling should not be an option.<br>A minor but negative aspect between your ruling planet and the moon suggests that someone or something will unsettle you today.

You should sit down with someone you trust and work out a budget that will enable you to save a little extra. Relationships may be hard to handle.<br>You could find that youÂ’re feeling in a very excitable mood today, with an inclination towards impulsive behavior.
