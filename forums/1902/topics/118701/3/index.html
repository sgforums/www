            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Listen and formulate your course of action. Either way, you're up for a passionate encounter with someone special. You can get phenomenal returns if you present your ideas to those who can back your interests.<br>Relatives will want to get together. Look into attending seminars that can expand your perception. Curb the impulse to make lavish purchases and maybe spend some time with good friends.<br>You may not know which end is up today, especially if someone you care about is confusing you with his or her actions. Be diplomatic but don't let anyone know where you stand. Being a little mysterious will protect you from malice.<br></div>
