When he sees his food, you can see him keep changing colour right before your eyes... it's a mosaic-like pattern that keeps changing, hard to describe in words but something which i find very fascinating. According to a website, this colour change is supposed to dazzle and confuse it's prey, dunno how true is it. He will then shoot out 2 very long tentacles (which are supposed to have many mini suckers on them) to grab the food and bring it to his mouth. And ya, i keep him alone in the tank with nothing else but sand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Oh as for the turtle he will first sniff the peas with his snout (he will walk/swim around and sniff at practically everything when hungry) for a few seconds, then if he decides to eat them he'll chew them up before swallowing. For big pieces of food that can't be swallowed in one mouthful, he'll take one end of the food in his mouth and push the other end away from him with his flippers, therefore breaking the piece of food into 2 smaller pieces.<br><br>The black-spotted green fish to the left of the turtle is a scat (supposed to eat up the waste products of the other fishes but somehow mine doesn't), and the fish to the right of the turtle is a baby red-tailed catfish.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Just ensure that the tank has been fully cycled (~4 weeks) before adding the first fish. A reef-tank is a very different affair though, just the equipment alone (filtration system etc) is enough to burn a hole in the pocket, usually the total cost adds up to over a thousand dollars for a small one..

He will then shoot out 2 very long tentacles (which are supposed to have many mini suckers on them) to grab the food and bring it to his mouth. And ya, i keep him alone in the tank with nothing else but sand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Oh as for the turtle he will first sniff the peas with his snout (he will walk/swim around and sniff at practically everything when hungry) for a few seconds, then if he decides to eat them he'll chew them up before swallowing. For big pieces of food that can't be swallowed in one mouthful, he'll take one end of the food in his mouth and push the other end away from him with his flippers, therefore breaking the piece of food into 2 smaller pieces.<br><br>The black-spotted green fish to the left of the turtle is a scat (supposed to eat up the waste products of the other fishes but somehow mine doesn't), and the fish to the right of the turtle is a baby red-tailed catfish.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>ohh so interesting...<br>i kept an octopus b4, but was so hard to feed them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>and yup after awhile it died  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>seahorse also.. initially was ok, they stared at their food for a lg lg time b4 eating it... but after awhile they juz refuse to take anymore...<br>and at the end..all gone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>tat scat looks unique... tink i hvn seen it b4...<br>very nice fish u hv n u took care of them really well...<br><br>hmm...are u aiming for any other new unique fishes?<br>if possible do share w us the pics  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
