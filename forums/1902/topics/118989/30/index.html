            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Be careful not to exaggerate when interacting with your lover. You could experience unusual circumstances and meet eccentric individuals. You may want to have a heart-to-heart talk with a close and trusted friend.<br>Try to deal with it quickly; don't dwell on past regrets. You will have to be sure not to burn the candle at both ends. Include friends and family members in your redecorating plans.<br>Taureans are normally regarded as dependable, traditional people, but thanks to the transit of the sun into Aquarius youÂ’ll be more inclined towards being a little flaky, a little unpredictable, and a little bit rebellious! An admirer will love this new you today!</div>

You should include children in your activities.<br>You can help them more than they can help you. Refrain from using the highway as a racetrack. You need to be inspired and have your spirits lifted.<br>Like Aries you should be able to find the time to reflect on a certain situation today. Something thatÂ’s been bugging you recently can be settled once and for all; donÂ’t turn down the offer of a good heart-to-heart with a trusted friend Â– they will help you get your thoughts straight!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You will be in an overly generous mood today. You can make some money if you get involved in a conservative financial prospect that is presented to you. You need an outlet.<br>You can make personal changes that will enhance your appearance and bring you greater popularity. You must look into your options. Visitors are likely to drop by and chances are, they may even stay a little longer than you want them to.<br>Nearly everyone will want what they canÂ’t have today. For you a dull or even non-existent love-life could have you considering what can only be described as a second-best alternative, but ask yourself, Taurus Â– is it really worth it, or would it be better waiting for something more fulfilling?</div>

Your interest in religion and philosophy may lead you to specific destinations. Don't overspend on friends or children.<br>Your interests could lead you down avenues you never realized existed. You just hate waste, and when someone else costs you dearly you see red. Your ability to dazzle others with your unique and innovative ideas will attract attention.<br><br>The challenging square between the sun and the moon, which is now in your sign, suggests that youÂ’ll feel at odds with yourself today. Normally an earth-centered sign youÂ’re likely to feel tempted to break out of your normal routine or change your image. Hold your horses for today, Taurus!</div>

You are best to concentrate on your professional endeavors. You may overspend if you travel today; however, the trip will be one to remember.<br>Watch for empty promises that may give you false hope. You have your own family to consider as well. Go after your professional goals. Ferret out information that will hold them responsible.<br>With a couple of rather stunning aspects influencing your ruling planets you should find that today feels less like a Monday and more like a Friday!
