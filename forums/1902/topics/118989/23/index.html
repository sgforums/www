You are in a high energy, get it all done, mood and you'll have little patience with those who are slacking off.<br>Romance is looking fabulous today, thanks to Jupiter! Attached Taureans are likely to be that little bit more inclined for some cozy but intense intimacy, while singles are likely to meet someone who really lights their fire!

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Focus on your domestic scene. Get together with friends or relatives. Take a second look; difficulties with appliances, water, or electricity in your home may be evident. You would be wise to socialize with as many people as possible.<br>One sided attractions are likely. Relatives will not agree with the way you are dealing with your personal problems. Look into physical activities that will help get rid of some of that tension you may be feeling.<br>YouÂ’re not likely to be in an overly sociable mood today, but you will want to feel cared for and appreciated by your friends, especially since something Â–a minor occurrence that youÂ’d normally shrug off Â– dents your confidence a little.
