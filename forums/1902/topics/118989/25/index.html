            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Do not force your opinions on others the connections will be short lived. New romantic ties can be made; however, you must make sure that your motives are not selfish before you make your move. Do not overspend on entertainment. You could find that children will be a handful.<br>Escapist tendencies will result in a poor reputation and a lack of confidence. You may find yourself in the limelight for the wrong reasons. Family outings that aren't expensive will be enjoyable and help strengthen ties.<br>Work or school should become infinitely easier from today, thanks to the transit of Mars into Libra. The influence of Mars will ensure enough of a go-getting streak, but the harmonizing vibes of Libra will channel that in a productive and beneficial way. In short, success is yours for the taking!</div>

However, this will be offset by the positive sun/moon aspect, which will make you more dynamic than usual, but just in case keep some citrine with you, which will clear those more negative thoughts!</div>
