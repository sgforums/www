            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Take the day to relax and pamper yourself. You will be able to get to the bottom of things today. You may find that your anger stems from lending or borrowing money.<br>Travel may be confusing. You can offer your help to others but back off if they appear to be offended by your persistence. Be careful that you don't overextend yourself.<br>The challenging aspect between the sun and the moon could put you in a sensitive mood, and the Pluto influence is still there. This doesnÂ’t bode so well for romance; youÂ’re likely to misconstrue whatÂ’s being said, and given your extra thin skin today youÂ’re likely to get easily upset. A piece of bloodstone will help you feel less fragile.</div>
