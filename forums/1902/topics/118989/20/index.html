This will be a good day for research and for sitting down with some good, informative reading material.

Secret affairs will eventually backfire on you.<br>With Mars moving into Cancer, which happens to be your third house, you are likely to rise happily to any challenge that comes your way. This new burst of dynamism could be just what you need, but donÂ’t overdo it! The occasional noble and selfless gesture will make you feel much better than you would expect!</div>
