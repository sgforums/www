            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You can solidify your relationship if you plan a special evening with your mate. You will gain valuable insight and knowledge through the experiences you have along the way. Control those desires to cast your fate to the wind.<br>You will be in the mood to socialize. If they're too demanding, reconsider this union. Problems with your partner could be reaching a high level of concern.<br>Prepare yourself for a temporary setback in romance, Scorpio; especially if there is someone you have had your eye on recently, because they are likely to seem too interested in someone else. This might be a huge disappointment, but it will also be a blessing in disguise!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You could be drawn to events that concern children. Try not to skirt issues if you think you'll hurt some one's feelings. Take the time to do your job correctly or you may find yourself looking for a new one.<br>Someone you least expect may not have your best interests at heart. Opportunities for advancement at work are apparent. Try to be honest when dealing with your mate.<br>Thanks to Mercury moving backwards through your sign you might feel inclined to act more thoughtlessly than normal.
