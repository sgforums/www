            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You should make special plans for you and your lover. Emotionally, things may not run so smoothly. Be sure to catch up on overdue correspondence and help those you love find solutions to their dilemmas.<br>Relatives will not agree with the way you are dealing with your personal problems. Anger could lead to problems. Problems with skin, bones, or teeth may mess up your schedule.<br>Unusually for such a dynamic sign youÂ’re likely to be a little narrow in your field of vision today, thanks to a surge of ambition, courtesy of the moon. YouÂ’ll be driven by the need for success or achievement, but taking some time out to enjoy the lighter things in life will provide the break you need!</div>
