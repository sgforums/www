If both individuals have a thorough understanding of their inherent traits, they can have deep sympathy for each other. The dominant, possessive, and jealous temperaments of each are things which both will have to handle with extreme consideration. They both are intense in their love nature, and can get just what they are looking for in each other. If one suddenly gets inconsiderate of the other's tender spots, or does anything to upset the apple cart in the jealousy department, then the storm will began. This can be a very good combination or a very bad one. <span style="color: red;">You could learn fascinating things from this other Scorpio so think about keeping them as a friend if the romance doesn't work out. </span><br><br></div>
