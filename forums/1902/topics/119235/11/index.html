            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>This is a great day to spend with family. Don't overspend on items for your home. Don't let others restrict you from saying how you feel about family issues.<br>You will have some problems with children, but if you are patient you will win their favor. You may have difficulties with in-laws or family members. Dinner with clients or business associates should be successful.<br>You can expect it to take you much longer to do things, especially if you have to drive somewhere or wait in line. Give yourself ample time and you can avoid frustration. Look for something that doesn't require traveling.<br></div>

Romantic encounters are evident through travel or educational pursuits. Your anger may be impossible to contain if you get into debates with family members.<br>The day spotlights your communicative abilities, travel, and neighborhood interests. You need to get out if you want to meet potential partners. Love could develop with someone of a different cultural background.<br>Educational pursuits will be informative but not necessarily helpful in your present situation. Don't believe everything you hear. You probably know more than the person who is giving you information.</div>

Someone you live with will, be impossible.<br>You have worked hard and the payback is now. Help if you can, but more than likely it will be sufficient just to listen. Your personality is a plus factor in career dealings today.<br>You may know what you have to do to make things right at home, but frankly it won't be easy. There is a good chance someone is not telling you the whole story. Legal matters must be dealt with.</div>

Get the whole family involved in a worthwhile cause or cultural event.<br>Watch out for someone who is out to get you. Don't share your wisdom, ideas or your plans.
