            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You might find added popularity with those around you today. Be discreet and don't present your ideas until you're certain that they're foolproof. Good for private talks of a financial nature, bookkeeping, and mental work in general.<br>You are best to work behind the scenes on projects that require detail or precision. Your lover may disappoint you in such a way that estrangement will follow. Someone you live with may cause drastic alterations in your usual routine. Special-interest courses will lead you in an unusual direction but not necessarily in the right direction. Don't overspend on something that may not pan out for you. Don't take chances.<br></div>

Spending on something you want, not something you need, will set you back further than you think. Refrain from getting in over your head financially, emotionally or physically.</div>
