Now is the time to concentrate on building a strong financial future for your family. Don't tell others of your plans.<br>You may be frazzled today. Try not to be too aggressive or judgmental when talking to your mate. You can make excellent investments if you are in the right place at the right time.<br>Your love-life is about to take off again, but some less than encouraging remarks from a friend could end up holding you back! It will be your friendÂ’s feelings of insecurity that provoke these remarks; dig a little deeper and you will find a way to reassure them again!</div>

Your lover may disappoint you in such a way that estrangement will follow.<br>A thoughtless and unkind comment from home could have you feeling rather taken aback today, but if you hold onto the fact that todayÂ’s planetary formation is playing havoc with nearly everyoneÂ’s conduct youÂ’ll find it easier to ignore.
