You're intuitive today; however, this attribute could get you in trouble if you tactlessly say what you think. Your mate may be distressed if you refuse to make a commitment.<br>You, like Aries, will be one of the few signs who wonÂ’t be affected quite so much by todayÂ’s planetary activity. Even so, with the sun in your sign you would be wise to avoid romance today. Singles should postpone any hot dates while attached Scorpios should give their partner a little space!</div>
