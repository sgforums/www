Organize your house and be sure to include the whole family in the projects you have set out to do. Arguments with employers or colleagues will be to your detriment.<br>You could be attracting individuals who are anything but good for you. Advancement can be yours if you put your efforts into work related matters. Close deals that have been up in the air and move on to new ones that appear to be profitable.<br>If you wake to find that youÂ’re feeling depressed and fed up then blame the moon!
