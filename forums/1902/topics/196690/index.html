Energetic, good with money and very fond of travel, Horses are the nomads of the Chinese Zodiac, roaming from one place or project to the next. All of this Sign's incessant activity and searching may be to satisfy a deep-rooted desire to fit in. Paradoxically, Horses feel a simultaneous yearning for independence and freedom.<br><br>Horses crave love and intimacy, which is a double-edged sword since it often leads them to feel trapped. Love connections tend to come easily to Horses, since they exude the kind of raw sex appeal that is a magnet to others. This Sign tends to come on very strong in the beginning of the relationship, having an almost innate sense of romance and seduction. Horses are seducers in general; check out any A-list party and you're bound to find the Horse in attendance. This Sign possesses a sharp wit and a scintillating presence; it really knows how to work a crowd. Surprisingly, Horses tend to feel a bit inferior to their peers, a misconception that causes them to drift from group to group out of an irrational fear of being exposed as a fraud.<br><br>An impatient streak can lead Horses to be less than sensitive to others' needs. These colts would rather take a situation firmly in hand as opposed to waiting for others to weigh in or come to terms with it. The lone wolf inside the Horse can at times push others away, but this also makes this Sign stronger and is a key to its success. Horses are self-reliant and, though they might lose interest fast in a tedious, nine-to-five day job, are willing to do the work necessary to get ahead.<br><br>Horses tend not to look much at the big picture; instead they just follow their whims, which can result in a trail of prematurely ended relationships, jobs, projects and so on. This Sign really knows how to motivate others, though, and get a lot accomplished. Once they find some peace within themselves, they can curb their wandering tendencies and learn to appreciate what's in their own backyard.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Horse is the Dog or the Tiger.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Horses</span>: Ashton Kutcher, Paul McCartney, Babara Streisand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">People who are born in the Horse years are independent, outspoken and sociable. They never seem to run out of conversation. They love the great outdoors, and often enjoy athletic pursuits. There is a constant air of restlessness and impatience about them. Horses are usually quite honest and principled. They reject dishonest behaviour and try to be straight forward in their dealings. However, they maintain a healthy ego too, and this can bring out their selfish side.</span><br><br>The Horse is: Independent, elegant, popular, agile, hot-tempered, loves freedom, economical, vain, protective, friendly<br><br>Suited as a PR, journalist, athlete, politician, technician<br><br>Suited with the Tiger, Dog, Pig, Goat and Snake</div>

Success or glory will be assured in such conditions, but they'll come only later.

Some natives of the sign will have to check their eyesight or the state of their teeth.<br><br>26 June 2006<br>You won't be afraid to solicit the support of influential persons in order to promote your projects. On the amorous plane, you'll have enough courage to make a declaration that has been in the making for a long time. Try to limit yourself to the strictly indispensable spendings and to renounce all the rest. You'll be in very good physical shape. Family concerns may disturb you: You'll have difficulty talking to your children; you'll react to them by locking yourself up in reproving silence, but this won't be a good solution!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Horse people have a balance of the best kind of qualities. Have you ever seen a wild horse on the beach, with flying mane and flaring nostrils, every muscle bursting with life and je ne sais quois? Without a doubt, the Horse is the standard for grace, strength, rhythm and nobility. They have an amazing capacity for hard work. As a result, they know great success and financial security in their lifetimes. Often quite ostentatious, they enjoy being with large crowds and always seek out the grand and magnificent. They need people and have a weakness for those of the opposite sex. You can often find Horses at concerts, music festivals, and the Super Bowls of life.<br><br>Famous Horse People: Duke of Windsor, Princess Margaret, Billy Graham, Igor Stravinsky, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Haydn, Barbra Streisand, Nelson Mandela, Anwar Sadat, Neil Armstrong<br><br>METAL HORSE<br><span class="small">Jan 30, 1930 to Feb 16, 1931<br>Jan 27, 1990 to Feb 14, 1991 </span><br><br>From evening clothes to blue jeans, from the opera to country and western, the Metal Horse is the epitome of a chameleon. Twisting and turning to new experiences, these Horses will go wherever adventure beckons, always bursting with enthusiasm for their very active and productive life. Because of this, their social circle includes some of the most interesting people with opposing and refreshing points of view. Conversation is a high art. Their natural intuition keeps them in lively sync with people they meet. Metal Horses are also very talented people, whether it be in sports, managing the bottom line, or dancing their own interpretation of hip hop. They are most resourceful; if they don't know about a subject, they find the time to learn about it. They never have to lose precious time worrying about what might have been. Although they are very serious and responsible workers and have successful careers, they experience a volatile financial life, up and down, up and down. Although they certainly never have to go begging, they need to exercise financial restraint to keep their lives on a stable course. Love life for the Metal Horse is fine in every respect. They make loyal and understanding partners and they receive the best in return!<br><br>WATER HORSE<br><span class="small">Feb 15, 1942 to Feb 4, 1943<br>Feb 12, 2002 to Jan 31, 2003</span><br><br>Philosophical, with tongue firmly in cheek, the cheerful Water Horses are open to the ironies of life. Their sense of humor permits them to laugh at things they can't control. With infinite patience, they know that most problems are really quite small in the scheme of things. (Traffic jams? No problem!) and they try not to let their own personal feelings get in the way. Like all Horses, those of the Water persuasion are very career minded with a high sense of responsibility and accountability. Their years are filled with many hardworking days and nights. Careers are filled with both storm clouds and tropical tradewinds - Horses simply flow with the wind. Because of wise choices, they experience a pretty stable financial fortune in later years, sometimes with unexpected results. Stability is also a big time word when it comes to Love. Love is like the many splendored thing described in song. For them, love means eternity. When they pledge undying loyalty, devotion, tenderness, and caring, they mean it. A partnership is always built on a strong foundation and, like a masterpiece, is designed for life everlasting.<br><br>WOOD HORSE<br><span class="small">Feb 3, 1954 to Jan 23, 1955</span><br><br>The Wood Horse is a magnificent creature, full of dignity and proud bearing. These very intelligent beings climb to high places by sheer force of personal magnetism and good-natured daring. Because of their extraordinary leadership, Wood Horses have many followers and many admirers. A sturdy oak of society, the life of the Wood Horse always holds up under scrutiny. Under tense deadlines, Wood Horses rear up with conviction and passion and make quick decisions with split-second reflexes. Their judgement is always on the mark. Wood Horses work hard -- they play hard. They make a lot of money -- they spend a lot of money. Generous to a fault, they conceive grand wonderful ways of having fun and always invite friends to raise a toast to memory-making. In Love Life, every day becomes a memory maker, filled with treasures of the mind and spirit. Love partners know the Wood Horse is a "keeper", faithful and loyal to the end of time.<br><br>FIRE HORSE<br><span class="small">Jan 25, 1906 to Feb 12, 1907<br>Jan 21, 1966 to Feb 8, 1967</span><br><br>Through all the moons of many a year, the Fire Horse is a dynamic creature, with a vigor that promises youth and freshness until the very end of life. The will and the spirit of the Fire Horse cannot be broken. This Horse goes through life with philosophical patience and the ability to bounce back from adversity no matter how dire the circumstances. In times of solitude, Fire Horses also have an insatiable need for intellectual stimulation and they satisfy their curiosity for learning through reading, listening, conversing, and travel abroad. Fire Horses make inspiring leaders, revered and respected. They encourage their subordinates with kindness and just the right degree of strictness and work well with people in all stations of life. Financial rewards fall in the middle ground, not too bad, not terrific, but always comfortable. Being in love with the Fire Horse brings pure rapture. These noble Horses are generous with their love, with hugs and kisses. Loved ones always know where they stand because Fire Horses demonstrate every day through their actions the love they feel deep within. Each day is a soft and tender love poem.<br><br>EARTH HORSE<br><span class="small">Feb 11, 1918 to Jan 31, 1919<br>Feb 7, 1978 to Jan 27, 1979</span><br><br>With head held high, the mighty Earth Horse never has to apologize, never has the pangs of a guilty conscience gnawing away the very soul. The life of the Earth Horse passes all scrutiny. Earth Horses are elegant, spirited, and adventurous creatures. Poetry in motion! Earth Horses are among the most generous and caring of friends, tolerant of their friends' shortcomings, never judging, never showing cynicism. They blend the right balance of sympathy and empathy. As faithful and unwavering as the Horses are in their devotion to friends, it is important to tell you that they are never weaklings or martyrs. Their inherent dignity and pride demand honor and admiration. Earth Horses appreciate the good things of life and because of their dedication to their careers, have the financial resources to keep life on a steady keel. When it comes to Love &amp; Relationships, life for the Earth Horse is exceedingly sad and dreary without love. The Earth Horse will go the extra length to please their partners. They love wild and romantic weekends and traditional whisperings of sweet nothings. They pass a happy life, their blood coursing with life bursting cadence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4 Jul 06<br>Take all necessary precautions to ensure your safety. You'll enjoy strong astral support, so don't hesitate to launch your projects. Don't give up what you've undertaken, as you'll have every chance to reach your objective. If you're in a stable relationship, this astral climate will be favorable to a strengthening of your ties; and if you're single, you'll meet a person who may stay in your life for a very long time. Your children will give you many satisfactions, but they will also cause you some concerns.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 Jul 06<br>The professional domain will be subject to great uncertainty; this won't necessarily provoke a brutal upheaval, but a corner will surely be rounded. Try to be more open, more frank in your approach of people and things, for, it should be admitted, it's not always easy to deal with you. Be on your guard; beware particularly of advertisements that sing the merits of weight-reducing products bringing miraculous effects, or of gadgets that will bring chance in love and money. Your love affairs will have the benediction of the stars: You'll be lucky and happy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>6 Jul 06<br>You'll hatch out a good plan with a view to obtaining a promotion in your work or some additional earnings. Be careful about your spending; if you're too easygoing, you may not escape bothersome problems very easily. Your vitality will be at a peak and you'll have the impression of being able to conquer the world! Try to cut down your sweet foods so as to prevent additional health problems. On the love front, effort (and not sheer luck) will be the essential factor of success.</div>
