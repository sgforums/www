            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Pisces Friendship Profile</span><br><br>They may seem to be wandering about in their own little world sometimes, but Pisces is one of the most caring friends you'll ever have. This Water Sign has emotions to spare, so prepare yourself for long evenings of heart-to-heart talks with your Pisces pal. This friend will truly want to know the real you, and they'll probably be able to pick up on how you're feeling no matter what you tell them. They're a great friend when you're in need. If nothing else, they'll have an open ear for your troubles and a handy box of tissues for your tears. Watch out, though. Pisces can be easily manipulated, and their feelings can be hurt by the slightest misguided comment from a friend's mouth. What they need is for you, as their friend, to reassure them and help them past their insecurities. They will always be open with their emotions, so the biggest favor you can do for them is return that trust by revealing yourself. You'll never be bored with your creative Pisces buddy if you just keep an open mind and let them whisk you away into their world for a while.<br><br>Best Friends Bets: Capricorn, Taurus<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pisces and Capricorn<br><br>When Capricorn and Pisces form a friendship, it's a union of opposite natures attracting. Capricorn is practical and down to earth, scrupulous and possessed of a strong work ethic. Pisces is very spiritual and dreamy, taking on the needs and concerns of those around them. These friends together form a sincere and devoted pair, and both have good morals. They admire each other: Capricorn likes Pisces' ephemeral and kind nature, and Pisces appreciates Capricorn's quick mind and tenacity.<br><br>This is a friendship that may take time to develop, but it will grow stronger and closer. The Capricorn-Pisces duo is based on cooperation and the reciprocal fulfillment of each other's needs. Difficulties can arise if Capricorn is too brooding for Pisces' easily-hurt feelings. Pisces needs to understand that this is Capricorn's style and not a personal attack on them. Pisces might dislike Capricorn's stubborn streak but can learn to be patient and understanding. Additionally, Pisces enjoys indulging Capricorn -- the Pisces commitment to service combines well with Capricorn's desire for preservation of assets.<br><br>Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, and Pisces is ruled by a combination of Jupiter and Neptune. Saturn is the planet of dedication, authority and responsibility. Higher learning, ethics and standards are ruled by Jupiter, and Neptune influences Pisces' take on popular media, dreams and illusions. These three Planets complement one another because they have a good sense of compassionate justice and dedication.<br><br>Capricorn is an Earth Sign, and Pisces is a Water Sign. Earth Signs are about possessions, and the Capricorn and Pisces friends will usually surround themselves with items reflecting their sophisticated taste. The Water Sign relies on emotion and intuition, making the Pisces the fueling force behind the friendship in a quiet way.<br><br>Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. While Capricorn tends to focus on one thing at a time, Pisces likes to float from one thing to another as the feeling takes them. Because of their flexibility, it's easy for Pisces to become interested in the things to which Capricorn is devoted. In turn, Capricorn needs to give Pisces the freedom to enjoy many things and learn not to take it personally when Pisces gets bored with something Capricorn enjoys. Pisces can hold on to Capricorn's ideas and produce results even if Capricorn has moved on; in turn, Pisces can show Capricorn that flexibility is sometimes better than a stealthy determination to do things their way.<br><br>The best aspect of the Capricorn-Pisces friendship is their wonderful blend of temperaments. Pisces likes helping Capricorn achieve their goals. Their difference in temperaments make theirs a very warm and complementary friendship, each providing something the other desperately needs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pisces and Taurus<br><br>When Taurus and Pisces form a friendship, it's generally a positive combination. They are two positions apart within the Zodiac, and such signs tend to have karmic ties and empathy for each other. Taurus is more practical, prefers the facts and a clear direction, while Pisces is idealistic and looks for the feeling of a situation. Both signs work toward a harmonious relationship and are basically tolerant and sympathetic people. Taurus can help Pisces fulfill dreams and ambitions -- to turn ideas into reality. On the other hand, Pisces offers gentleness, kindness and sympathy which Taurus admires and appreciates. Taurus is interested in material comforts and at times cannot understand the simplistic attitude of Pisces. Their priorities can be very different when it comes to their life's aspirations. Once they can understand and overcome this difference, theirs will be a very rewarding friendship.<br><br>Taurus is ruled by Venus, and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter and Neptune. When Venus and Neptune meet, a beautiful spiritual connection is made. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Together, they represent an idealistic friendship that borders on the divine. Pisces is also ruled by Jupiter. This adds a masculine energy to the combination and represents philosophy, expansion and excesses. The nature of this planetary combination offers a dream-come-true friendship with harp players and white fluffy clouds. The downside is that this can be called an illusion.<br><br>Taurus is an Earth Sign, and Pisces is a Water Sign. Generally they're very compatible, as both Water and Earth are tangible, physical entities. Pisces, as a Water Sign, is born to connect mankind, and when it blends with Taurean Earth there is no stronger natural bond. In turn, Taurus may have a more rational view of life, less prone to the emotional ambiguity of Pisces. Taurus can help Pisces stabilize their sensitivity. But too much of a good thing can turn to mud if both partners aren't careful. Taurus may tire of Pisces' instability, and Pisces may in turn feel that Taurus is insensitive to their needs. It will be easy for them to find a way to overcome their differences.<br><br>Taurus is a Fixed Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Taurus is practical and focused, but Pisces likes to move from project to project as feeling dictates. Pisces will be very supportive of the things that interest their Taurean friend. In turn, Taurus needs to give Pisces the freedom to enjoy other things. Pisces can show Taurus that mutability is sometimes better than a fixed determination to do things one way.<br><br>The best aspect of the Taurus-Pisces friendship is that they have different emotional natures that complement and harmonize very well with one another. The overall empathy and commitment these two signs value in friendships is what will keep the ties strong and long-lasting between the Bull and Fish.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Aquarius Friendship Profile</span><br><br>Aquarius rules the Eleventh House of Friends, so it's no wonder that they appear to be friends with absolutely everyone. You'll only be deceived by this circumstantial evidence until you try to get close to the Water Bearer, however. Though they have many acquaintances, Aquarius rarely lets people get to know them on a deep level. They are somewhat aloof when it comes to their actual feelings. If you're ever down, though, Aquarius will jump at the chance to buy you dinner -- or buy you anything for that matter. They're not trying to buy your friendship. Why should they? They are, however, very generous individuals and happy to help anyone in times of need. Don't let this make you too clingy. If an Aquarian sees a possible loss of freedom, or if they feel cloistered, they're bound to make a bolt for the door. The Water Bearer is an adventurer. Be sure to keep an open mind, and they'll take you to some exciting new places. The perfect Aquarius companion is one with whom they can make an intellectual connection. If you give them their space while keeping conversation lively, they'll be your friend forever.<br><br>Best Friend Bets: Sagittarius, Aries<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aquarius and Sagittarius<br><br>When Sagittarius and Aquarius form a friendship, the combination of Aquarian vision and Sagittarian knowledge tend to make them a highly inventive and original pair. This pairing is free from constraint, and while it can be competitive, it's never dull! They can be great friends; their Signs are two apart, and this tends to make them compatible and able to communicate well. Both of them are idealistic and enthusiastic about life, and together they enjoy hijinks. This pair can fly without fear of falling.<br><br>Many Sagittarius-Aquarius friendships enjoy a feeling of mutual admiration. Sagittarius admires the uniqueness, vision and inventiveness characteristic of Aquarius. In turn, Aquarius admires the Sagittarian brilliance and initiative -- Sagittarius always has new ideas, but they don't always have the drive to carry them out the way Aquarius does. Both Signs enjoy their independence, and there aren't many conflicts because this is the perfect arrangement for both of them. At times, Sagittarius may seem too self-indulgent for Aquarius, who may, in turn, be too eccentric for their Sagittarian partner. As long as they are open about their positive feelings about their friendship, they will be able to overcome the negative ones.<br><br>Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter, and Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn and Uranus. These three Planets form a sort of cycle that is indicative of the Sagittarius-Aquarius compatibility and their ability to come together to create and nurture one another. Uranus is the Planet of new ideas and creativity; it's from this Planet that Aquarius gets its unique vision. Jupiter steps in with its influences toward higher learning, expansion and abundance. Finally, Saturn keeps these friends moving forward in their plans to completion, following up after Uranus' inspiration has been exhausted and Jupiter's energy moves on to new things.<br><br>Sagittarius is a Fire Sign, and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and keeps it going. In turn, Fire is sustained by the energy of Air. Sagittarius can keep up with the Water Bearer's tendency to initiate diverse experiments based on futuristic ideas. When they spend time together, they are an interesting, inventive pair! Aquarius and Sagittarius use intellect and adventure to stimulate new ideas -- they encourage each other's creativity. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and Sagittarius' desire to physically participate gives them great aptitude for putting the ideas of the quick-witted Aquarius into action.<br><br>Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign, and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Sagittarius can easily roll with the punches and is happy to initiate or put on pause whatever plans the two have. Aquarius is slightly less yielding, but happy to keep any plan in progress as long as they are passionate about its completion. Aquarius can help stabilize and finish things rather than jumping into new projects without completing the old ones, whereas Sagittarius is happy to drift from one thing to another as the mood takes them. They are both loyal and devoted to each other, and they can accomplish a lot together.<br><br>The best aspect of the Sagittarius-Aquarius friendship is their ability to achieve a great deal when they spend time together. Mutable Fire and Fixed Air cover all the bases: These partners can come up with an idea, figure out how to get it going and stick with it until it's realized. This formidable combination makes theirs a friendship of motion as well as resourcefulness.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scorpio and Virgo<br><br>When Virgo and Scorpio form a friendship, it's a union of two signs that are two apart in the Zodiac. This will tend to endow the friendship with an intense karmic bond. The Virgo-Scorpio friendship is based on loyalty and deep, strong ties. Usually, this pair will keep to themselves; they aren't much inclined to hang out with the group at parties or dances, but together they can form a very fulfilling partnership.<br><br>Virgo and Scorpio enjoy working together toward aquisition: Virgo wants order, and Scorpio wants power. Both of these signs are preoccupied with assets and resources, including inheritances and property. Virgo is more about ministering to others, and Scorpio is about the group, thus this pair is very service-oriented and known to be dependable, lending a hand to a friend or to the community. Additionally, Virgo can be shy and reserved -- while Scorpio is more opaque. Because of their differences, both signs can grow and learn from each other if they can agree to meet each other halfway.<br><br>Virgo is ruled by Mercury, and Scorpio is ruled by Mars and Pluto. This combination is very intense, thanks to Pluto's influence. The two signs coming together form the basic foundation of human relationships -- Mercury's communication and Mars' passion. Mercury and Mars go well together; Mercury is about the conscious mind, and Mars is about passion. Scorpio is smoldering and intense, and Virgo is attracted to this intensity. In turn, Scorpio enjoys the devotion and practicality inherent in Virgo.<br><br>Virgo is an Earth Sign, and Scorpio is a Water Sign. Scorpio is a very deep sign; it's an ocean, and too much upset will cause a violent storm! Scorpio emotionally sucks in, then, when the pressure becomes too intense, suddenly explodes out. Virgo and Scorpio's mutual need for emotional security fosters extreme loyalty to each other. While Virgo is simplistic, with everything laid bare on the surface, Scorpio is more focused on the undercurrents of life. Scorpio can show Virgo beyond the literal surface, and Virgo is attentive enough to pick up on this hidden conversation. Virgo can teach Scorpio that facts and numbers are sometimes quite literal and can be dismissed at face value. Scorpio appreciates Virgo's practicality and Virgo enjoys Scorpio's devotion -- it proves they are appreciated.<br><br>Virgo is a Mutable Sign, and Scorpio is a Fixed Sign. Once they have a common goal, nothing can get in the way. When the opinions of these friends differ, Virgo is adaptable enough to take a step backward and not allow an argument to happen. Scorpio often gets its own way due to a stubborn streak. It's important for these friends to discuss what is truly important to them so they can have equal roles. This is not a friendship riddled with conflict. Both would rather work together than fight.<br><br>The best aspect of the Virgo-Scorpio friendship is their powerful teamwork when they agree on their goals. When Scorpio realizes that Virgo is an asset and a leveling force in their life, this friendship can blossom. Mutual determination and organization makes theirs a friendship of formidable strength.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scorpio and Capricorn<br><br>When Scorpio and Capricorn form a friendship, they can help each other to mature as individuals and to learn the value of a loving connection. Shyness, reservations and distrust of others may dampen the initial impact of this friendship. It takes a long time for this duo to open up to one another and feel comfortable together. However, once they have learned to trust, share and care for another person, their connection will be secure and strong.<br><br>Scorpio and Capricorn have a lot to learn from one another, as well as a lot to work through together. Scorpio can learn to cool their heated emotions through Capricorn's proficient and stable behavior. However, this sentiment may also backfire for Scorpio who may become irritated at Capricorn's apparent lack of emotional depth. Capricorn can learn to probe more deeply within themselves and all aspects of life from their more intense friend. Both Signs share a love of committing to a task.<br><br>Scorpio is ruled by the Planets Mars and Pluto, and Capricorn is ruled by the Planet Saturn. Mars and Pluto represent aggression, courage, sexual energy, rebirth and renewal. Saturn teaches the great lessons in life -- hard work, diligence, ambition and responsibility. Both Signs combine to form an industrious union bound by Scorpio's fierce emotion and Capricorn's ambitious action.<br><br>Scorpio is a Water Sign, and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. The Earth is in touch with practical matters and material possessions. This is a good balance for the Water element, who tends to take on the shape of a given situation in the form of an emotional reaction. If stability and flexibility are practiced by Capricorn and Scorpio, respectively, then each is able to effectively share their knowledge and qualities with their close friend.<br><br>Scorpio is a Fixed Sign, and Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign. Capricorn usually initiates new and useful projects for themselves and the world around them. Scorpio is happy to follow suit and work on their friend's ideas, but will want to interject their own opinions. It would be wise for Capricorn to stop a moment, listen and open their channels of communication as much as possible for their friend. Both Signs are stubborn, and this could lead to some potential conflict. Also, Scorpio is much more emotionally involved in the friendship than the SeaGoat, and perhaps more than the SeaGoat is capable. Both friends must recognize this and accept it if their connection is to be fortuitous.<br><br>The best aspect of the Scorpio-Capricorn friendship is their determination to shared ideas and their strong devotion to one another. They can strive to teach one another about different ways of perception.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Capricorn Friendship Profile</span><br><br>If a Capricorn thinks you can't do anything for them, it may be difficult to break into their inner circle. If, however, you've managed to work your way up the corporate ladder or have something to offer, the Goat will embrace you for life. Expect yours to be a structured friendship. If you make plans, your Capricorn buddy will schedule an itinerary for you, and you had better be on time and ready to go along with the plan. At times, the Goat may seem to you more like a parent figure than a friend. They might think they have all the answers and will try to impress you with the extent of their knowledge on any subject they think will help you. If you have impeccable manners, are successful in your own right and manage to win the affections of Capricorn, you will find that you have earned an extremely devoted friend who will be kind to you no matter what happens in your life. Don't be alarmed if they test your loyalty over and over again. A Capricorn who has once had their trust betrayed, by anyone, takes a long time to heal.<br><br>Best Friend Bets: Scorpio, Pisces<br><br></div>
