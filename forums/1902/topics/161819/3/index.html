            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Libra Friendship Profile</span><br><br>You'll be doing a lot of looking at your watch and tapping your foot impatiently if you befriend a Libra. It's not that the Scales enjoy being late, it's just that they take their time to decide anything in enough time to make it anywhere. They may make you wait, but Libra is a great friend to have. They can charm the socks off even the stodgiest of people, and, as their friend, you'll never be able to stay mad at them for very long. Libra hates being alone, so expect your friend to be a bit demanding of your time and attention. They'll make up for it, though. Libra will be able to talk their way into the swankiest restaurants and hottest clubs. If you ever need anything, they know exactly who to call, and the person on the other end will feel honored to help them out. Even if they do need to stand in front of their closet for hours, whatever they wear will be in perfect taste, and you can count on them to help you look just as chic. Don't worry if your Libra buddy seems a little down at times. They'll leap out of that soon enough, ready to take on another fun adventure.<br><br>Best Friend Bets: Leo, Sagittarius<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Libra and Leo<br><br>When Leo and Libra form a friendship, they make a cooperative combination. Leo and Libra are two Signs apart in the Zodiac, which gives each friend an innate understanding of the workings of the other. When the Lion's energy is combined with Libra's natural sense of harmony, this is a friendship of great balance. Leo and Libra are flashy versus refined, direct versus peace-loving. Leo and Libra can have a very successful friendship because each of them can appreciate and benefit from the attributes of the other.<br><br>Libra calms and smooths Leo's flamboyant style. As a combination, Leo and Libra are well-balanced. Libra is charming and cultural, and has good manners which offset Leo's direct and acerbic personality. On the other hand, Leo is far more decisive than Libra. Leo can help their Libra friend to make decisions more easily and act on them, and they can teach the art of spontaneity.<br><br>Leo is ruled by the Sun, and Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus. The two Signs coming together form the basic foundation of interpersonal relationships -- warmth and passion. The Sun and Venus go well together. The Sun is a masculine energy and Venus a feminine, so this friendship is a good balance of charged energies. Venus is about beauty of romance, and the Sun is about sustaining life and propagating light. This pair is resilient and can fortify one another for a long time.<br><br>Leo is a Fire Sign, and Libra is an Air Sign. These two elements together either fuel each other beautifully or extinguish one another's efforts. Libra can work diplomatically with the impetus and ambition of Leo, and both tend to participate in each other's efforts. They have learned a perfect balance and click together like clockwork! When they are a team anything is within the realm of possibility, but these friends must be mindful of one another's feelings and individual desires. Leo's action-oriented approach to projects may conflict with Libra's more cerebral approach. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and Leo's desire to get into the mix gives them great stories to share with the more reserved Libra.<br><br>Leo is a Fixed Sign, and Libra is a Cardinal Sign. Leo's stamina outlasts the fleeting fancies of Libra, the initiator. They have to cooperate for their dreams to come true. Leo will be the leader because of their energy and forceful nature. Libra will gently take the reins from an intellectual and team-oriented standpoint. Leo likes to give orders through personal authority, while Libra charms others into doing things and is satisfied in placating Leo's giant ego. It's important for Leo to understand compromise. Libra, able to see both sides of the argument, can compromise easily, while Leo may be more unhappy about yielding.<br><br>The best aspect of the Leo-Libra friendship is the harmony resulting from the union of Venus and the Sun. The balance between self and other represented by this relationship is a great learning experience for both friends. Each brings to the friendship what the other is missing, so theirs is a highly compatible combination.<br></div>

Reaching new horizons is important to both Libra and Sag, and personal experience is priceless.<br><br>Libra and Sagittarius make very good friends.

Libra will be the first to step down rather than provoking a conflict or a confrontation. Even when they do have problems, these friends can forgive and forget easily. Both can get over their disagreements quickly and completely.<br><br>Libra is ruled by Venus, and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. Venus' femininity and Jupiter's masculinity make these signs compatible and balanced. Jupiter is about philosophy, teaching and understanding, so Sagittarius likes to understand new and different things. Venus is about love, romance and beauty. Whenever Libra comes up with a new idea -- as they are wont to do -- Sagittarius is eager to go along with their friend and become familiar with this new concept.<br><br>Libra is an Air Sign, and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. This friendship is full of kinetic energy. This tends to be an animated and emotional friendship.

Libra is the initiator of new projects and ideas, and Sagittarius will accept these ideas as long there is a spot for Sag to participate. When these friends combine their energies to work toward a goal, they won't argue over who gets the glory for their achievements.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Cancer Friendship Profile</span><br><br>The Crab is likely to send you frequent invitations to dinner. Of course, they enjoy your company, but they love it when you come over and complement them on their house, decorations and excellent cooking skills. They make loyal friends, so long as you do nothing to betray their trust. If you can handle a super emotional pal who is likely to call you up and cry into the phone for no reason, you will have a devoted buddy who is just as likely to arm themselves with a box of tissues and come to your aid when you're feeling blue. Though the Crab would usually rather sit around the house tending the garden and organizing their bits of nostalgia, they will still occasionally be in the mood to go out for dinner and a movie. As a friend of a Cancer, you'll never need to worry about recording important events. Your favorite Crab will always be there with a camera. As your friendship grows, your Cancer buddy will likely invite you to family dinners as a matter of course.

            <div class='col-md body'>Cancer and Taurus<br><br>When Taurus and Cancer form a friendship, it's generally a good combination. They are two positions apart within the Zodiac, and such Signs tend to have karmic ties and a good understanding of each other. These friends have a lot in common and both crave security: Taurus in a more material sense and Cancer in an emotional sense. They can nurture one another.<br><br>The Taurus-Cancer friendship tends to be a happy one because they both enjoy the feelings of security and comfort. They enjoy a solid base, strong friendships, nice possessions, good food: all the comforts of a good, stable life. Their family lives are often idyllic, the kind that others strive for. They have strong ties between them and an friendship that is oriented toward a family dynamic rather than an exclusive, clique-ish aesthetic. Their only major problems arise when Taurus insists on getting their way, which can cause Cancer to sulk and pout in the corner. Taurus needs to understand Cancer's emotional sensitivity, and Cancer needs to be more open about their requirments instead of relying on passive aggressiveness.<br><br>Taurus is ruled by Venus, and Cancer is ruled by the Moon. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Taurus has an open, honest nature that appeals to Cancer, who often keeps emotions and feelings inside. Cancer can possess intense feminine energy, and Taurus can help them learn to channel this energy into the ventures that could really pay off. The Moon controls tides of the Earth, quietly affecting all life; so it goes that Cancer manipulates the setting while Taurus works more conspicuously on their plans. Cancer tends to be sentimental, and both tend to hang out together rather than socializing with groups of friends.<br><br>Taurus is an Earth Sign, and Cancer is a Water Sign. They form a compatible union, as both Water and Earth are tangible, physical entities. Cancer, as a Water Sign, is born to nurture and can assist an Earthy Taurus the way rain sustains the Earth. In turn, Taurus may have a more stable view of life, less prone to the emotional turmoil of Cancer. Taurus can help Cancer stabilize their tumultuous feelings and to learn to take criticism less personally. Too much of a good thing can turn to mud if these friends aren't careful. Taurus may tire of Cancer's mood swings, and Cancer may in turn feel that Taurus is insensitive. They need to learn the art of compromise.<br><br>Taurus is a Fixed Sign, and Cancer is a Cardinal Sign. Taurus has Fixed habits, and they won't change an opinion once it's formed. This can provide Cancer with an emotional rock in a sometimes cruel world, as Taurus is entirely dedicated to the friendship. In turn, Cancer can bring new inspiration to the pair and initiate all kinds of plans that Taurus will enjoy taking over later. These Signs will get along well if Cancer can initiate ideas and Taurus can keep them going.<br><br>The best aspect of the Taurus-Cancer friendship is how solid, steady and reliable they become when together. Both Signs are dependable and nurturing, strongly oriented to cooperation. A mutual love of security makes theirs a warm and ideal friendship.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Taurus Friendship Profile</span><br><br>When they say they're your best friend forever, the Bull means it. They take childhood friendship oaths seriously, and still have the other half of that charm necklace in which are inscribed the words "Best Friends Forever." Their friendship stands the test of time, and many Taurean friends have been this devoted since childhood. Constant, steady, loyal and devoted, this friend will stand by you through life. If you need to call someone to pick you up in the middle of a snowy night because your car broke down, Taurus will be there in a flash, hot cocoa in gloved hand. Be warned, though, this is only if you've proven yourself to be as loyal a friend to them as they are to you. It's a case of them scratching your back if you scratch theirs. Taurus makes a steady friend, but be careful not to arouse their jealousy. This Fixed Sign will be possessive of their buddies and aren't so likely to understand the old adage that "absence makes the heart grow fonder." You'll find a wonderful friend in Taurus, so long as you don't cancel any plans at the last minute.<br><br>Best Friend Bets: Pisces, Cancer<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taurus and Pisces<br><br>When Taurus and Pisces form a friendship, it's generally a positive combination. They are two positions apart within the Zodiac, and such signs tend to have karmic ties and empathy for each other. Taurus is more practical, prefers the facts and a clear direction, while Pisces is idealistic and looks for the feeling of a situation. Both signs work toward a harmonious relationship and are basically tolerant and sympathetic people. Taurus can help Pisces fulfill dreams and ambitions -- to turn ideas into reality. On the other hand, Pisces offers gentleness, kindness and sympathy which Taurus admires and appreciates. Taurus is interested in material comforts and at times cannot understand the simplistic attitude of Pisces. Their priorities can be very different when it comes to their life's aspirations. Once they can understand and overcome this difference, theirs will be a very rewarding friendship.<br><br>Taurus is ruled by Venus, and Pisces is ruled by Jupiter and Neptune. When Venus and Neptune meet, a beautiful spiritual connection is made. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Together, they represent an idealistic friendship that borders on the divine. Pisces is also ruled by Jupiter. This adds a masculine energy to the combination and represents philosophy, expansion and excesses. The nature of this planetary combination offers a dream-come-true friendship with harp players and white fluffy clouds. The downside is that this can be called an illusion.<br><br>Taurus is an Earth Sign, and Pisces is a Water Sign. Generally they're very compatible, as both Water and Earth are tangible, physical entities. Pisces, as a Water Sign, is born to connect mankind, and when it blends with Taurean Earth there is no stronger natural bond. In turn, Taurus may have a more rational view of life, less prone to the emotional ambiguity of Pisces. Taurus can help Pisces stabilize their sensitivity. But too much of a good thing can turn to mud if both partners aren't careful. Taurus may tire of Pisces' instability, and Pisces may in turn feel that Taurus is insensitive to their needs. It will be easy for them to find a way to overcome their differences.<br><br>Taurus is a Fixed Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Taurus is practical and focused, but Pisces likes to move from project to project as feeling dictates. Pisces will be very supportive of the things that interest their Taurean friend. In turn, Taurus needs to give Pisces the freedom to enjoy other things. Pisces can show Taurus that mutability is sometimes better than a fixed determination to do things one way.<br><br>The best aspect of the Taurus-Pisces friendship is that they have different emotional natures that complement and harmonize very well with one another. The overall empathy and commitment these two signs value in friendships is what will keep the ties strong and long-lasting between the Bull and Fish.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taurus and Cancer<br><br>When Taurus and Cancer form a friendship, it's generally a good combination. They are two positions apart within the Zodiac, and such Signs tend to have karmic ties and a good understanding of each other. These friends have a lot in common and both crave security: Taurus in a more material sense and Cancer in an emotional sense. They can nurture one another.<br><br>The Taurus-Cancer friendship tends to be a happy one because they both enjoy the feelings of security and comfort. They enjoy a solid base, strong friendships, nice possessions, good food: all the comforts of a good, stable life. Their family lives are often idyllic, the kind that others strive for. They have strong ties between them and an friendship that is oriented toward a family dynamic rather than an exclusive, clique-ish aesthetic. Their only major problems arise when Taurus insists on getting their way, which can cause Cancer to sulk and pout in the corner. Taurus needs to understand Cancer's emotional sensitivity, and Cancer needs to be more open about their requirments instead of relying on passive aggressiveness.<br><br>Taurus is ruled by Venus, and Cancer is ruled by the Moon. Both of these celestial bodies vibrate with feminine energy. Taurus has an open, honest nature that appeals to Cancer, who often keeps emotions and feelings inside. Cancer can possess intense feminine energy, and Taurus can help them learn to channel this energy into the ventures that could really pay off. The Moon controls tides of the Earth, quietly affecting all life; so it goes that Cancer manipulates the setting while Taurus works more conspicuously on their plans. Cancer tends to be sentimental, and both tend to hang out together rather than socializing with groups of friends.<br><br>Taurus is an Earth Sign, and Cancer is a Water Sign. They form a compatible union, as both Water and Earth are tangible, physical entities. Cancer, as a Water Sign, is born to nurture and can assist an Earthy Taurus the way rain sustains the Earth. In turn, Taurus may have a more stable view of life, less prone to the emotional turmoil of Cancer. Taurus can help Cancer stabilize their tumultuous feelings and to learn to take criticism less personally. Too much of a good thing can turn to mud if these friends aren't careful. Taurus may tire of Cancer's mood swings, and Cancer may in turn feel that Taurus is insensitive. They need to learn the art of compromise.<br><br>Taurus is a Fixed Sign, and Cancer is a Cardinal Sign. Taurus has Fixed habits, and they won't change an opinion once it's formed. This can provide Cancer with an emotional rock in a sometimes cruel world, as Taurus is entirely dedicated to the friendship. In turn, Cancer can bring new inspiration to the pair and initiate all kinds of plans that Taurus will enjoy taking over later. These Signs will get along well if Cancer can initiate ideas and Taurus can keep them going.<br><br>The best aspect of the Taurus-Cancer friendship is how solid, steady and reliable they become when together. Both Signs are dependable and nurturing, strongly oriented to cooperation. A mutual love of security makes theirs a warm and ideal friendship.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Aries Friendship Profile</span><br><br>As fire can be a fleeting thing, so can be the friendship of a Ram. If you want to call an Aries up for a night on the town, you'll have an exciting companion for the evening -- but don't try to make plans for next week. This Sign needs variety in their friendships. If one group of people can't keep up with their constantly changing interests, they'll move on to new friends. Not that they ever lack for companionship: The Ram is well liked for their edge, so making new friends is never a big problem. Friends are nice, but not exactly necessary for independent Aries, who doesn't need a big group to have fun. When they are in one, though, their competitive nature is liable to get the better of them. Don't try to borrow even a cup of sugar from this one. Ruled by the First House of Self, selfishness can sometimes take the upper hand when it's a choice between people and possessions. On the other hand, the Ram can be very warm toward their friends. As long as Aries feels that they are the number one friend in your life, you can count on having an exciting, albeit brief, whirlwind of fun.<br><br>Best Friend Bets: Gemini, Aquarius<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aries and Gemini<br><br>When Aries and Gemini form a friendship, the partnership is one of physical as well as intellectual strength. There is a lot of movement and optimism in this relationship. Signs that are two apart in the Zodiac often enjoy excellent communication. Aries has a pioneering spirit that is interesting to Gemini, who also values independence. Arguments may arise if Aries takes Gemini's changeable nature too seriously or if Gemini feels that Aries is being too controlling. The two are well matched, though: Aries wants to experience things and Gemini would rather discuss them. Together they can make new discoveries they might have missed alone.<br><br>Both Aries and Gemini have a lot of energy, and by spending time together, they can come up with great ideas and common goals. Aries likes the freedom to jump into things and get their hands dirty. Gemini wants intellectual freedom and is able to look at all sides of an argument and see Aries' reasons for decisions. When Gemini gets wishy-washy, Aries can help them make up their mind but must be careful to allow Gemini intellectual space and not be overly possessive.<br><br>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars, and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury. These Planets represent communication and physical action. Because of different attitudes, Aries and Gemini get a lot done when they're together -- they are good at communicating and getting their point across in different ways. They may also have fevered debates, but where Gemini does it for fun and intellectual challenge, Aries takes it more seriously. The two Signs need to learn how personally they each may take harsh words and take care to avoid arguments that become too involved.<br><br>Aries is a Fire Sign, and Gemini is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and keeps it going; Gemini can keep up with the action and energy of Aries and the Ram's tendency to start new adventures and endeavors. When their energies combine, anything is possible! Gemini is able to follow Aries' action-oriented lead and jump from one idea or plan to the next, while maintaining an intellectual outlook. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and Aries' desire to physically participate gives them great stories to share with the more intellectually-oriented Gemini.<br><br>Aries is a Cardinal Sign, and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Aries is the initiator of the friendship, the one with enough get-up-and-go for the both of them, and Gemini will accept these ideas as long as they are not forced into it. They never really argue over who gets to take the credit for good ideas or eventual successes. Aries enjoys the glory, of course, and Gemini is happy to be in the background pulling the strings. Both Signs are better at starting things than ending them, so if one friend gets bored with something, the other won't resent moving on to something more exciting.<br><br>The best aspect of the Aries-Gemini friendship is the way they can combine their strengths and energies and function as a single unit. Together they can learn much more than either Sign would alone. Their complementary qualities make theirs a highly beneficial and successful alliance.<br></div>

This pair can be great friends; their Signs are two apart, and this tends to make them compatible and able to communicate well.

In turn, Aquarius admires the Aries energy and initiative -- Aquarians always have new ideas, but they don't always have the drive to carry them out the way Aries does.

This Water Sign has emotions to spare, so prepare yourself for long evenings of heart-to-heart talks with your Pisces pal. This friend will truly want to know the real you, and they'll probably be able to pick up on how you're feeling no matter what you tell them. They're a great friend when you're in need. If nothing else, they'll have an open ear for your troubles and a handy box of tissues for your tears. Watch out, though. Pisces can be easily manipulated, and their feelings can be hurt by the slightest misguided comment from a friend's mouth. What they need is for you, as their friend, to reassure them and help them past their insecurities. They will always be open with their emotions, so the biggest favor you can do for them is return that trust by revealing yourself. You'll never be bored with your creative Pisces buddy if you just keep an open mind and let them whisk you away into their world for a while.<br><br>Best Friends Bets: Capricorn, Taurus<br><br></div></blockquote>capricorn born in what mth? taurus born in what mth?</div>
