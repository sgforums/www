            <div class='col-md body'>Capricorn and Scorpio<br><br>When Scorpio and Capricorn form a friendship, they can help each other to mature as individuals and to learn the value of a loving connection. Shyness, reservations and distrust of others may dampen the initial impact of this friendship. It takes a long time for this duo to open up to one another and feel comfortable together. However, once they have learned to trust, share and care for another person, their connection will be secure and strong.<br><br>Scorpio and Capricorn have a lot to learn from one another, as well as a lot to work through together. Scorpio can learn to cool their heated emotions through Capricorn's proficient and stable behavior. However, this sentiment may also backfire for Scorpio who may become irritated at Capricorn's apparent lack of emotional depth. Capricorn can learn to probe more deeply within themselves and all aspects of life from their more intense friend. Both Signs share a love of committing to a task.<br><br>Scorpio is ruled by the Planets Mars and Pluto, and Capricorn is ruled by the Planet Saturn. Mars and Pluto represent aggression, courage, sexual energy, rebirth and renewal. Saturn teaches the great lessons in life -- hard work, diligence, ambition and responsibility. Both Signs combine to form an industrious union bound by Scorpio's fierce emotion and Capricorn's ambitious action.<br><br>Scorpio is a Water Sign, and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. The Earth is in touch with practical matters and material possessions. This is a good balance for the Water element, who tends to take on the shape of a given situation in the form of an emotional reaction. If stability and flexibility are practiced by Capricorn and Scorpio, respectively, then each is able to effectively share their knowledge and qualities with their close friend.<br><br>Scorpio is a Fixed Sign, and Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign. Capricorn usually initiates new and useful projects for themselves and the world around them. Scorpio is happy to follow suit and work on their friend's ideas, but will want to interject their own opinions. It would be wise for Capricorn to stop a moment, listen and open their channels of communication as much as possible for their friend. Both Signs are stubborn, and this could lead to some potential conflict. Also, Scorpio is much more emotionally involved in the friendship than the SeaGoat, and perhaps more than the SeaGoat is capable. Both friends must recognize this and accept it if their connection is to be fortuitous.<br><br>The best aspect of the Scorpio-Capricorn friendship is their determination to shared ideas and their strong devotion to one another. They can strive to teach one another about different ways of perception.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Capricorn and Pisces<br><br>When Capricorn and Pisces form a friendship, it's a union of opposite natures attracting. Capricorn is practical and down to earth, scrupulous and possessed of a strong work ethic. Pisces is very spiritual and dreamy, taking on the needs and concerns of those around them. These friends together form a sincere and devoted pair, and both have good morals. They admire each other: Capricorn likes Pisces' ephemeral and kind nature, and Pisces appreciates Capricorn's quick mind and tenacity.<br><br>This is a friendship that may take time to develop, but it will grow stronger and closer. The Capricorn-Pisces duo is based on cooperation and the reciprocal fulfillment of each other's needs. Difficulties can arise if Capricorn is too brooding for Pisces' easily-hurt feelings. Pisces needs to understand that this is Capricorn's style and not a personal attack on them. Pisces might dislike Capricorn's stubborn streak but can learn to be patient and understanding. Additionally, Pisces enjoys indulging Capricorn -- the Pisces commitment to service combines well with Capricorn's desire for preservation of assets.<br><br>Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, and Pisces is ruled by a combination of Jupiter and Neptune. Saturn is the planet of dedication, authority and responsibility. Higher learning, ethics and standards are ruled by Jupiter, and Neptune influences Pisces' take on popular media, dreams and illusions. These three Planets complement one another because they have a good sense of compassionate justice and dedication.<br><br>Capricorn is an Earth Sign, and Pisces is a Water Sign. Earth Signs are about possessions, and the Capricorn and Pisces friends will usually surround themselves with items reflecting their sophisticated taste. The Water Sign relies on emotion and intuition, making the Pisces the fueling force behind the friendship in a quiet way.<br><br>Capricorn is a Cardinal Sign, and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. While Capricorn tends to focus on one thing at a time, Pisces likes to float from one thing to another as the feeling takes them. Because of their flexibility, it's easy for Pisces to become interested in the things to which Capricorn is devoted. In turn, Capricorn needs to give Pisces the freedom to enjoy many things and learn not to take it personally when Pisces gets bored with something Capricorn enjoys. Pisces can hold on to Capricorn's ideas and produce results even if Capricorn has moved on; in turn, Pisces can show Capricorn that flexibility is sometimes better than a stealthy determination to do things their way.<br><br>The best aspect of the Capricorn-Pisces friendship is their wonderful blend of temperaments. Pisces likes helping Capricorn achieve their goals. Their difference in temperaments make theirs a very warm and complementary friendship, each providing something the other desperately needs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Leo Friendship Profile</span><br><br>The Lion can never be accused of hiding behind their mane. They're happiest when people surround them, especially as they're likely to be the center of attention in any crowd. Leo has a ton of friends. After all, anyone who thinks so highly of themself must have something good to offer! The Lion makes a great friend, though. They can be playful as a kitten and are always ready to spread their sunshine around. Beware of their competitive side, though. As your friend, Leo wants to be proud of you and will do everything in their power to ensure your success -- so long as you don't outshine them. As long as you're the underdog, you'll have a loyal friend. Everyone can be friends with a Leo. They don't really discriminate, preferring to have a big mix of people to play with. Leo always wants the best and might take you out for fancy dinners and such. Don't worry if you can't quite afford it -- the generous Lion is quite willing to chip in. Make sure you remind them again and again how grateful you are for their help, though. A friend who is not appreciative enough of the Leo's charms and generosity may not get the chance to show it later.<br><br>Best Friend Bets: Gemini, Libra<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Leo and Gemini<br><br>When Gemini and Leo form a friendship, it is a playful and high-spirited connection. There is a lot of movement and optimism in this friendship. Leo has a spirit of creativity that is attractive to Gemini, who enjoys mental stimulation. Arguments may arise if Leo takes Gemini's flirtatious nature too seriously, or if Gemini feels that Leo wants total control of their friendship. They are well matched, though Leo wants to experience things firsthand, and Gemini would rather examine them from several different angles. Together they can discover and understand more than they would alone.<br><br>Both Leo and Gemini have a lot of energy, and when spending time together they can come up with great ideas and common goals. Neither Sign is a slacker! Leo likes the freedom to jump into projects and give the orders. Gemini wants intellectual freedom and is able to look at all sides of an argument and see the reasoning behind their Leo friend's choices. When Geminis vacillate, Leo can help them make decisions, but they also need to be careful to allow Gemini intellectual space and not be too overbearing or bossy.<br><br>Leo is ruled by the Sun, and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury. These Planets represent communication and individual expression. Due to the compatible nature of these planetary energies, Leo and Gemini get along well as unit -- they are skilled at getting their point across in different ways. They may also have heated debates, but where Gemini does it for fun and intellectual challenge, Leo takes it more seriously. The Twins need to learn how seriously their friend takes such repartee and be careful not to cross boundaries.<br><br>Gemini is an Air Sign, and Leo is a Fire Sign. Air fuels Fire and keeps it going; Gemini can keep up with the creativity and energy of Leo and the Lion's tendency to see a plan through to completion. Gemini is able to follow Leo's action-oriented lead and jump into multiple activities with an intellectual outlook. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and Leo's desire to be at the center of an activity gives them great experiences to talk about later with the more mentally stimulated Gemini.<br><br>Leo is a Fixed Sign, and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Leo is the leader of ideas, and Gemini will accept them as long as they don't feel pressured. When they spend time together, they won't bicker over who gets to take the credit for their achievements. Leo's vain nature likes glory, and Gemini is happy to be less conspicuous. Leo can see something through to the end, whereas Gemini will become bored if there is a lack of mental stimulation.<br><br>The best aspect of the Gemini-Leo friendship is their youthful, even childlike view of the world. They can truly understand and value each other's input to the world. Together they can discover aspects of life that they would have missed separately. Together, this duo will enjoy a successful and mutually beneficial friendship.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Leo and Libra<br><br>When Leo and Libra form a friendship, they make a cooperative combination. Leo and Libra are two Signs apart in the Zodiac, which gives each friend an innate understanding of the workings of the other. When the Lion's energy is combined with Libra's natural sense of harmony, this is a friendship of great balance. Leo and Libra are flashy versus refined, direct versus peace-loving. Leo and Libra can have a very successful friendship because each of them can appreciate and benefit from the attributes of the other.<br><br>Libra calms and smooths Leo's flamboyant style. As a combination, Leo and Libra are well-balanced. Libra is charming and cultural, and has good manners which offset Leo's direct and acerbic personality. On the other hand, Leo is far more decisive than Libra. Leo can help their Libra friend to make decisions more easily and act on them, and they can teach the art of spontaneity.<br><br>Leo is ruled by the Sun, and Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus. The two Signs coming together form the basic foundation of interpersonal relationships -- warmth and passion. The Sun and Venus go well together. The Sun is a masculine energy and Venus a feminine, so this friendship is a good balance of charged energies. Venus is about beauty of romance, and the Sun is about sustaining life and propagating light. This pair is resilient and can fortify one another for a long time.<br><br>Leo is a Fire Sign, and Libra is an Air Sign. These two elements together either fuel each other beautifully or extinguish one another's efforts. Libra can work diplomatically with the impetus and ambition of Leo, and both tend to participate in each other's efforts. They have learned a perfect balance and click together like clockwork! When they are a team anything is within the realm of possibility, but these friends must be mindful of one another's feelings and individual desires. Leo's action-oriented approach to projects may conflict with Libra's more cerebral approach. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and Leo's desire to get into the mix gives them great stories to share with the more reserved Libra.<br><br>Leo is a Fixed Sign, and Libra is a Cardinal Sign. Leo's stamina outlasts the fleeting fancies of Libra, the initiator. They have to cooperate for their dreams to come true. Leo will be the leader because of their energy and forceful nature. Libra will gently take the reins from an intellectual and team-oriented standpoint. Leo likes to give orders through personal authority, while Libra charms others into doing things and is satisfied in placating Leo's giant ego. It's important for Leo to understand compromise. Libra, able to see both sides of the argument, can compromise easily, while Leo may be more unhappy about yielding.<br><br>The best aspect of the Leo-Libra friendship is the harmony resulting from the union of Venus and the Sun. The balance between self and other represented by this relationship is a great learning experience for both friends. Each brings to the friendship what the other is missing, so theirs is a highly compatible combination.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Gemini Friendship Profile</span><br><br>The social butterfly of the Zodiac has lots of friends. In fact, the Twins should have twice as many as any other Sign. One side of a Gemini will want to go hang-gliding and run around outside, while the other is keen on sitting cozily at home and playing a board game. Their friends need to be as diverse as they are in order to keep up, or they just need to know when to let Gemini go free. The Twins can bond well with lots of different kinds of groups. If they get bored with one set of people, they always have a few more groups that will be more interesting -- for awhile. Gemini is a sociable creature who enjoys having friends. If you can match their pace and mercurial temperament, you and your friend will have a blast. The best way to develop a bond with a Gemini is to make an intellectual connection. Interested in exploring anything at all? Take along your Gemini pal and enjoy the new perspective they give to even the most ordinary situations. If you can match wits with this one, they'll respect your intellect and work to develop this worthwhile friendship.<br><br>Best friend Bets: Aries, Leo<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gemini and Aries<br><br>When Aries and Gemini form a friendship, the partnership is one of physical as well as intellectual strength. There is a lot of movement and optimism in this relationship. Signs that are two apart in the Zodiac often enjoy excellent communication. Aries has a pioneering spirit that is interesting to Gemini, who also values independence. Arguments may arise if Aries takes Gemini's changeable nature too seriously or if Gemini feels that Aries is being too controlling. The two are well matched, though: Aries wants to experience things and Gemini would rather discuss them. Together they can make new discoveries they might have missed alone.<br><br>Both Aries and Gemini have a lot of energy, and by spending time together, they can come up with great ideas and common goals. Aries likes the freedom to jump into things and get their hands dirty. Gemini wants intellectual freedom and is able to look at all sides of an argument and see Aries' reasons for decisions. When Gemini gets wishy-washy, Aries can help them make up their mind but must be careful to allow Gemini intellectual space and not be overly possessive.<br><br>Aries is ruled by the Planet Mars, and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury. These Planets represent communication and physical action. Because of different attitudes, Aries and Gemini get a lot done when they're together -- they are good at communicating and getting their point across in different ways. They may also have fevered debates, but where Gemini does it for fun and intellectual challenge, Aries takes it more seriously. The two Signs need to learn how personally they each may take harsh words and take care to avoid arguments that become too involved.<br><br>Aries is a Fire Sign, and Gemini is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and keeps it going; Gemini can keep up with the action and energy of Aries and the Ram's tendency to start new adventures and endeavors. When their energies combine, anything is possible! Gemini is able to follow Aries' action-oriented lead and jump from one idea or plan to the next, while maintaining an intellectual outlook. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and Aries' desire to physically participate gives them great stories to share with the more intellectually-oriented Gemini.<br><br>Aries is a Cardinal Sign, and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Aries is the initiator of the friendship, the one with enough get-up-and-go for the both of them, and Gemini will accept these ideas as long as they are not forced into it. They never really argue over who gets to take the credit for good ideas or eventual successes. Aries enjoys the glory, of course, and Gemini is happy to be in the background pulling the strings. Both Signs are better at starting things than ending them, so if one friend gets bored with something, the other won't resent moving on to something more exciting.<br><br>The best aspect of the Aries-Gemini friendship is the way they can combine their strengths and energies and function as a single unit. Together they can learn much more than either Sign would alone. Their complementary qualities make theirs a highly beneficial and successful alliance.<br></div>

Together they can discover and understand more than they would alone.<br><br>Both Leo and Gemini have a lot of energy, and when spending time together they can come up with great ideas and common goals. Neither Sign is a slacker! Leo likes the freedom to jump into projects and give the orders. Gemini wants intellectual freedom and is able to look at all sides of an argument and see the reasoning behind their Leo friend's choices. When Geminis vacillate, Leo can help them make decisions, but they also need to be careful to allow Gemini intellectual space and not be too overbearing or bossy.<br><br>Leo is ruled by the Sun, and Gemini is ruled by the Planet Mercury. These Planets represent communication and individual expression. Due to the compatible nature of these planetary energies, Leo and Gemini get along well as unit -- they are skilled at getting their point across in different ways. They may also have heated debates, but where Gemini does it for fun and intellectual challenge, Leo takes it more seriously. The Twins need to learn how seriously their friend takes such repartee and be careful not to cross boundaries.<br><br>Gemini is an Air Sign, and Leo is a Fire Sign. Air fuels Fire and keeps it going; Gemini can keep up with the creativity and energy of Leo and the Lion's tendency to see a plan through to completion. Gemini is able to follow Leo's action-oriented lead and jump into multiple activities with an intellectual outlook. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and Leo's desire to be at the center of an activity gives them great experiences to talk about later with the more mentally stimulated Gemini.<br><br>Leo is a Fixed Sign, and Gemini is a Mutable Sign. Leo is the leader of ideas, and Gemini will accept them as long as they don't feel pressured. When they spend time together, they won't bicker over who gets to take the credit for their achievements. Leo's vain nature likes glory, and Gemini is happy to be less conspicuous. Leo can see something through to the end, whereas Gemini will become bored if there is a lack of mental stimulation.<br><br>The best aspect of the Gemini-Leo friendship is their youthful, even childlike view of the world. They can truly understand and value each other's input to the world. Together they can discover aspects of life that they would have missed separately. Together, this duo will enjoy a successful and mutually beneficial friendship.<br><br></div>

As a bonus, their knowledge of travel, philosophy and culture makes them fascinating conversationalists.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sagittarius and Libra<br><br>The friendship of Libra and Sagittarius can be paradise found for both friends; this combination is a harmonious one, to say the least. Sagittarius is a journeyer, constantly in search of wisdom. Libra contributes the findings of a keen mind to the friend's shared experiences. Lots of action helps to keep their friendship feeling new, but a strong current of understanding will make it even better as the two share more adventures. Libra must be constantly wary of being led into questionable activities by the ever-impetuous Sagittarius. Reaching new horizons is important to both Libra and Sag, and personal experience is priceless.<br><br>Libra and Sagittarius make very good friends. They understand each other, and both view life with optimism and enthusiasm. Problems are rare, but sometimes Libra may be too emotionally controlling for Sagittarius. On the other hand, Libra is more sensitive; Sagittarius must be careful to think before they speak and say something too blunt or hurtful. Libra will be the first to step down rather than provoking a conflict or a confrontation. Even when they do have problems, these friends can forgive and forget easily. Both can get over their disagreements quickly and completely.<br><br>Libra is ruled by Venus, and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. Venus' femininity and Jupiter's masculinity make these signs compatible and balanced. Jupiter is about philosophy, teaching and understanding, so Sagittarius likes to understand new and different things. Venus is about love, romance and beauty. Whenever Libra comes up with a new idea -- as they are wont to do -- Sagittarius is eager to go along with their friend and become familiar with this new concept.<br><br>Libra is an Air Sign, and Sagittarius is a Fire Sign. This friendship is full of kinetic energy. This tends to be an animated and emotional friendship. Sagittarius thinks they are steering the rudder, but Libra controls the flow of events with a quiet hand. Both have boundless energy, so it's rare for one friend to get tired while the other still is up and running. Although the two may disagree, their differences of opinion don't last long -- Libra moves on to the next challenge, while Sagittarius won't be resentful if their Libra friend allows them enough freedom.<br><br>Libra is a Cardinal Sign, and Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign. Libra is the initiator of new projects and ideas, and Sagittarius will accept these ideas as long there is a spot for Sag to participate. When these friends combine their energies to work toward a goal, they won't argue over who gets the glory for their achievements. Libra is better at starting things than ending them, while Sagittarius is happiest to go along with other's ideas. If Libra gets bored with a project, Sagittarius will offer support and move onto the next item of the agenda with Libra.<br><br>The best aspect of an Libra-Sagittarius friendship is their mutual interest in cultivating knowledge and utilizing intellect. They are well matched in their enthusiasm, energy and drive. Their common interests and similar personalities makes theirs a very compatible friendship.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sagittarius and Aquarius<br><br>When Sagittarius and Aquarius form a friendship, the combination of Aquarian vision and Sagittarian knowledge tend to make them a highly inventive and original pair. This pairing is free from constraint, and while it can be competitive, it's never dull! They can be great friends; their Signs are two apart, and this tends to make them compatible and able to communicate well. Both of them are idealistic and enthusiastic about life, and together they enjoy hijinks. This pair can fly without fear of falling.<br><br>Many Sagittarius-Aquarius friendships enjoy a feeling of mutual admiration. Sagittarius admires the uniqueness, vision and inventiveness characteristic of Aquarius. In turn, Aquarius admires the Sagittarian brilliance and initiative -- Sagittarius always has new ideas, but they don't always have the drive to carry them out the way Aquarius does. Both Signs enjoy their independence, and there aren't many conflicts because this is the perfect arrangement for both of them. At times, Sagittarius may seem too self-indulgent for Aquarius, who may, in turn, be too eccentric for their Sagittarian partner. As long as they are open about their positive feelings about their friendship, they will be able to overcome the negative ones.<br><br>Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter, and Aquarius is ruled by the Planets Saturn and Uranus. These three Planets form a sort of cycle that is indicative of the Sagittarius-Aquarius compatibility and their ability to come together to create and nurture one another. Uranus is the Planet of new ideas and creativity; it's from this Planet that Aquarius gets its unique vision. Jupiter steps in with its influences toward higher learning, expansion and abundance. Finally, Saturn keeps these friends moving forward in their plans to completion, following up after Uranus' inspiration has been exhausted and Jupiter's energy moves on to new things.<br><br>Sagittarius is a Fire Sign, and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Air fuels Fire and keeps it going. In turn, Fire is sustained by the energy of Air. Sagittarius can keep up with the Water Bearer's tendency to initiate diverse experiments based on futuristic ideas. When they spend time together, they are an interesting, inventive pair! Aquarius and Sagittarius use intellect and adventure to stimulate new ideas -- they encourage each other's creativity. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, and Sagittarius' desire to physically participate gives them great aptitude for putting the ideas of the quick-witted Aquarius into action.<br><br>Sagittarius is a Mutable Sign, and Aquarius is a Fixed Sign. Sagittarius can easily roll with the punches and is happy to initiate or put on pause whatever plans the two have. Aquarius is slightly less yielding, but happy to keep any plan in progress as long as they are passionate about its completion. Aquarius can help stabilize and finish things rather than jumping into new projects without completing the old ones, whereas Sagittarius is happy to drift from one thing to another as the mood takes them. They are both loyal and devoted to each other, and they can accomplish a lot together.<br><br>The best aspect of the Sagittarius-Aquarius friendship is their ability to achieve a great deal when they spend time together. Mutable Fire and Fixed Air cover all the bases: These partners can come up with an idea, figure out how to get it going and stick with it until it's realized. This formidable combination makes theirs a friendship of motion as well as resourcefulness.<br></div>
