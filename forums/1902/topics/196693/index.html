These quick thinkers are practical and resourceful, preferring to stick to what is tried and true rather than taking messy, unnecessary risks. Roosters are keenly observant. It's hard to slip anything past a Rooster, since they seem to have eyes in the backs of their heads! This quality can lead others to think the Rooster is psychic, but that's not generally the case; instead, this Sign enjoys a keen attention to detail that makes it a whiz at anything requiring close analysis. Roosters make great lawyers, brain surgeons and accountants, to name a few of this Sign's possible occupations. Above all else, the Rooster is very straightforward and rewards others' honesty in kind.<br><br>Roosters aren't shifty or cagey and have no interest in hiding behind a facade. They are the proverbial open book, telling the truth and keeping their word. If you show your hand, the Rooster will respect you for it. This kind of trusting behavior can tempt tricksters to pull a fast one on the Rooster, but that would be a bad move! Remember, this Sign doesn't indulge in flights of fancy and keeps those eyes wide open at all times.<br><br>Roosters tend to be perfectionists and expect to be in control, especially over their appearance. Primping and posing for the Rooster can go on forever! Being noticed and admired is an aphrodisiac for Roosters, and they can go a long time on a few kind words. Roosters also adore being out on the town, especially if they're in the company of adoring friends. The Rooster will also be the best-dressed one of the bunch -- style counts with this Sign, regardless of the cost.<br><br>Roosters also expect to be in control of their surroundings, including whoever happens to be in those surroundings. Roosters keep an impeccably neat house and expect their lovers, housemates and family members to maintain the same high standards of dress and conduct as they do. This can cause problems with other, more relaxed types who just want to be accepted as is. The Rooster needs the right partner, one who understands this Sign's basically conservative nature. With the right person, the Rooster can be the most loyal, trusting and supportive mate around, one who bends over backward to please its loved ones. Some Signs may just end up feeling hen-pecked, however.<br><br>Roosters need to learn to value their heart and soul as much as their good looks. Their excellent people skills and sharp minds are qualities that others will appreciate as much as a pretty face. This Sign would also do well to learn to adopt the philosophy of "live and let live"; perhaps an appeal to the Rooster's logic -- that it's inefficient to waste time nagging others -- will help this Sign learn to let others be whomever and however they are.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Rooster is the Ox or the Snake.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Roosters</span>: Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">People born in Rooster years are brash, passionate, honest and outspoken. They have a tendency to be too blunt for their own good, and this, coupled with disdain for those who don't share their own high ideals, make them appear abrasive and aggressive - even rude - to others. They are diligent and efficient, typically succeeding in anything they set their mind on doing.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rooster is often seen as the original strong silent type, not unlike the Humphrey Bogart and Greto Garbo prototypes. Most people consider them quite eccentric. Sad to say, relationships with other people are often strained. They are quite moody and can be too outspoken. They are often self-centered, but can be quite brave when the situation calls for it. On the other hand, Rooster People are quite talented and capable. They are always devoted to their work and have a reputation for being the hardest of workers. Rooster People are deep thinkers and are pioneers in spirit. They can experience the greatest of joy in complete solitude. Even though often alone, they rarely experience loneliness. Instead, they enjoy their own company and feel solitude helps them in their quest after knowledge.<br><br>Famous Rooster people: Suharto, Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov, D. H. Lawrence, John Glenn, Emperor Akihito, Yoko Ono, Eudora Welty, Bette Midler<br><br>METAL ROOSTER<br><span class="small">Feb 8, 1921 to Jan 27, 1922<br>Feb 5, 1981 to Jan 24, 1982 </span><br><br>Sometimes this one walks around with its head in the cumulus clouds, higher than the stars. You see, this rooster struts around with peac<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>ock feathers and they never ever ruffle. So much arrogance can make it hard to get along with others, especially when the Rooster is also intolerant of those who are less talented and a bit slower than normal. On the other hand, the Metal Rooster is extraordinarily talented. Of all twelve Zodiac signs, this one is probably the most high-minded of them all, with a very clean line of thought. The Metal Roosters can distinguish right from wrong very clearly and it doesn't matter which direction they pursue, they always wind up going the right way. If they confront a maze, or big problem, they will immediately see a solution because of their analytical, logical way of thinking. Through their perseverance, any hurricane becomes an orderly thing of beauty, just like that! When it's time for romance, the male Metal Rooster has no trouble at all, love just abounds; the female has a tendency to keep to herself, making connections less freely, but lastingly when they happen.<br><br>WATER ROOSTER<br><span class="small">Jan 26, 1933 to Feb 13, 1934<br>Jan 23, 1993 to Feb 9, 1994 </span><br><br>Whispered sweet nothings lead to trouble for this one! Oh, my! Their very soft hearts relish love and the heartbreaking poetry of love trysts. They pamper their senses with indulgences and when they're not looking, they sink into a love trap more powerful than quicksand. Their relationships will last forever because they take very good care of their other half. They have a love for life, too, and want to right every wrong. Their idealism will lead them to become involved in life, oftentimes through political action or volunteer work, and they work hard to make life problem-free, for themselves and others. The Water Rooster is very intelligent, with quick reflexes, and has inexhaustible energy. For one thing, this Rooster rations its energy, in a leisurely, never hurried manner, taking all the time necessary to make decisions, rationally and analytically, whether it comes to business, friendship, or love relationship.<br><br>WOOD ROOSTER<br><span class="small"> Feb 13, 1945 to Feb 1, 1946<br>Feb 9, 2005 to Jan 28, 2006</span><br><br>You can often find the Wood Rooster behind the scenes or in solitary activities. They love bookshops with strong espresso and offbeat music groups, particularly modern jazz or chamber work. They are reserved but at the same time can be quite sociable, too, when the occasion calls for it, always considerate, gentle, and easy going, always liking to please others. They can quickly overcome bad feelings. No one ever feels threatened by their company. On a bad day, the Wood Rooster can be so mild-mannered, it's easy to ignore them. But on a good day -- and there are many good days -- they are proud and very articulate in expressing their views. In fact, their quiet exterior belies an intense talent in persuading others to their point of view. People are amazed they can talk so much! Most days, Wood Roosters depend on others way too much. The most important thing Wood Roosters MUST do is to develop an independent streak, to look inside themselves for strength; their careers, financial life, relationships, and very happiness depends on this!<br><br>FIRE ROOSTER<br><span class="small">Jan 31, 1957 to Feb 17, 1958 </span><br><br>Fire Roosters have adrenaline coursing through their veins! These self-promoters enjoy jumping the goal posts and therefore engage in competition of all kinds. When there's a target to pursue, enemy to conquer, and goal to achieve, they know how to make big things happen. Big magnificent things do happen in career and finances, such as having a fulfilling cozy security. These are influential, powerful people always trustworthy, and the world stands up and salutes! In the dance of love, Roosters need to learn it takes two to tango. Very adept at making Romance sizzle like wildfire, the male Rooster nevertheless occasionally encounters problems in getting his message understood. Sandpaper friction results, they argue and two egos wind up getting hurt, but not for long. They always manage to work it out somehow. What will help in the future is to fully understand that your partner's needs are just as important to your partner as your own needs are important to you. With work, your tango of love can become the most passionate and ultimate love dance.<br><br>EARTH ROOSTER<br><span class="small">Jan 22, 1909 to Feb 9, 1910<br>Feb 17, 1969 to Feb 5, 1970 </span><br><br>The Earth Rooster epitomizes the very essence of one of Robert Browning's most popular poems, "Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be." Despite early adversity and rough times, their philosophical bent has led them to expect and therefore to achieve the good life. They have a very analytical way of looking at problems and they can pierce the most daunting of tasks with utmost efficiency. With saint-like patience, they are consistent in everything they do and always answer to their own counsel, which hasn't failed them yet. As a result, their careers are forever anchored in smooth sailing, and as life passes, they will know peace, abundance, and complete fulfillment. The same goes for their love life. There are difficulties at the very beginning but as time goes by, they understand each other perfectly, and receive "the best" love has to offer.</div>

You'll have success on more than one front.<br><br>3 Jul 06<br>Be firm: never lend money to a friend even if they're really in need of it and even if you have the means to help them, otherwise you could lose both your friend and your money. At your work, you'd better make use of resignation and flexibility this time, for the present astral ambiance will leave very little chance for those who attempt to rebel against authority. Avoid overestimating your strength and possibilities. Don't embark on hazy financial operations</div>
