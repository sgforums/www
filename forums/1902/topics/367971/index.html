              <p>Reuters - Thursday, July  2 01:05 am</p>
              <p><cite class="auth">Deborah Zabarenko, Environment Correspondent</cite></p>
              <p class="ynw-standfirst">More than 800 animal and plant species have
              gone extinct in the past five centuries with nearly 17,000 now
              threatened with extinction, the International Union for Conservation of
              Nature reported on Thursday. </p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">A
              detailed analysis of these numbers indicates the international
              community will fail to meet its 2010 goal of bolstering biodiversity --
              maintaining a variety of life forms -- a commitment made by most
              governments in 2002.</p>
              <p>Based on data released in 2008 in the
              union's Red List, the new IUCN analysis is being released now to
              precede the 2010 target year and to draw a connection between crises in
              the financial and environmental realms, said report editor
              Jean-Christophe Vie.</p>
              <p>"We don't want to make a choice between
              nature and the economy; we just want to bring nature to the same level
              when you have to take a decision," Vie said by telephone from
              Switzerland.</p>
              <p>"Jobs are important but not jobs to the detriment of
              nature," he said. "We have done that too much and look where we have
              arrived."</p>
              <p>The new analysis shows 869 species became extinct or
              extinct in the wild since the year 1500 while 290 more species are
              considered critically endangered and possibly extinct.</p>
              <p>At least
              16,928 species are threatened with extinction, including nearly
              one-third of amphibians, more than one in eight birds and nearly a
              quarter of mammals.</p>
              <p>By comparison, the 2004 Red List showed 784 extinctions since 1500.</p>
              <p>PROSPERITY AND BIODIVERSITY</p>
              <p>The report said this is not a comprehensive list with only 2.7 percent of the 1.8 million described species analyzed.</p>
              <p>The
              number of extinctions is "a gross underestimate but it does provide a
              useful snapshot of what is happening to all forms of life on Earth,"
              the study authors wrote.</p>
              <p>"It's much more severe than the economic
              crisis or the bank crisis," Vie said. "You can lose a core industry but
              you can rebuild one. In nature, if you lose it, you lose it, and you're
              losing a lot of capital that cannot be replaced."</p>
              <p>He said the notion that biodiversity is secondary to economic health is largely a view held by countries in North America, Europe and elsewhere, where the connection to natural products is less direct.</p>
              <p>In less developed areas, there is a direct line between human prosperity and biodiversity.</p>
              <p>In
              much of the world, Vie said, "The main problem every day is not to find
              a job, it's to find food ... and in most places this comes from
              biodiversity, from nature, from fish and plants."</p>
              <p>For land-based species, the main threat is habitat destruction through farming, logging and development.</p>
              <p>Climate change is not now the main threat to biodiversity but that could change, the report said.</p>
              <p>In
              examining 17,000 species of birds, amphibians and reef-building corals,
              the report found a significant proportion that are not now threatened
              are susceptible to climate change, including 30 percent of birds, 51 percent of corals and 41 percent of amphibians that are not threatened now.</p>
