              <p><em>Wednesday, June 10, 2009</em><br><br>How fast can evolution take place? In 
              just a few years, according to a new study on guppies led by UC Riverside's 
              Swanne Gordon, a graduate student in biology. <br><br>Gordon and her colleagues 
              studied guppies — small fresh-water fish biologists have studied for long — from 
              the Yarra River, Trinidad. They introduced the guppies into the nearby Damier 
              River, in a section above a barrier waterfall that excluded all predators. The 
              guppies and their descendents also colonized the lower portion of the stream, 
              below the barrier waterfall, that contained natural predators. <br><br>Eight 
              years later (less than 30 guppy generations), the researchers found that the 
              guppies in the low-predation environment above the barrier waterfall had adapted 
              to their new environment by producing larger and fewer offspring with each 
              reproductive cycle. No such adaptation was seen in the guppies that colonized 
              the high-predation environment below the barrier waterfall. 
              <br><br>"High-predation females invest more resources into current reproduction 
              because a high rate of mortality, driven by predators, means these females may 
              not get another chance to reproduce," explained Gordon, who works in the lab of 
              David Reznick, a professor of biology. "Low-predation females, on the other 
              hand, produce larger embryos because the larger babies are more competitive in 
              the resource-limited environments typical of low-predation sites. Moreover, 
              low-predation females produce fewer embryos not only because they have larger 
              embryos but also because they invest fewer resources in current reproduction." 
              <br><br>Study results appear in the July issue of The American Naturalist. 
              <br><br>Natural guppy populations can be divided into two basic types. 
              High-predation populations are usually found in the downstream reaches of 
              rivers, where they coexist with predatory fishes that have strong effects on 
              guppy demographics. Low-predation populations are typically found in upstream 
              tributaries above barrier waterfalls, where strong predatory fishes are absent. 
              Researchers have found that this broad contrast in predation regime has driven 
              the evolution of many adaptive differences between the two guppy types in color, 
              morphology, behavior, and life history. <br><br>Gordon's research team performed 
              a second experiment to measure how well adapted to survival the new population 
              of guppies were. To this end, they introduced two new sets of guppies, one from 
              a portion of the Yarra River that contained predators and one from a 
              predator-free tributary to the Yarra River into the high-and low-predation 
              environments in the Damier River. <br><br>They found that the resident, locally 
              adapted guppies were significantly more likely to survive a four-week time 
              period than the guppies from the two sites on the Yarra River. This was 
              especially true for juveniles. The adapted population of juveniles showed a 
              54-59 percent increase in survival rate compared to their counterparts from the 
              newly introduced group. <br><br>"This shows that adaptive change can improve 
              survival rates after fewer than ten years in a new environment," Gordon said. 
              "It shows, too, that evolution might sometimes influence population dynamics in 
              the face of environmental change." <br><br>### <br><br>University of California
