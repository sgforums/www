Its three instruments will work together to observe GRBs and their afterglows in the gamma-ray, X-ray, ultraviolet, and optical wavebands. This mission is part of NASA's "Medium Explorer program" and the satellite was developed by an international consortium from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy.<br><br>During its nominal mission of two years about 200 GRBs should be observed, and as with many other NASA missions, once the two years are concluded successfully the mission will probably be extended. A dedicated telescope will be used to locate the position of each event with an accuracy of 1 to 4 arc-minutes within 15 seconds. The satellite is then able to reorient itself automatically in about 20 to 75 seconds to point all of its instruments at the burst location. This ability is the reason for the mission's name "Swift." In order to achieve this fast slew rate, the observatory is equipped with momentum wheels as part of its reaction control system. These wheels are more massive than any used on past spacecraft, and are therefore more effective at reorienting the spacecraft when they spin.<br><br>In the time between GRB events the instruments on board will conduct an all-sky survey in the hard X-ray. After its successful completion, the survey is anticipated to yield new black hole candidates in the sky.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instruments</span><br><br>There are three observing instruments on board:<br><br>* Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), 15 - 150 keV energy range. It initially detects a new GRB event and computes its coordinates in the sky.<br>* X-Ray Telescope (XRT), 0.3 - 3 keV energy range. It can take images and perform spectral analyses of the GRB afterglow. This data will provide a more precise location of the GRB and the red-shift of the source.<br>* UV/Optical Teslescope (UVOT), 170 - 650 nm wavelength range. This instrument will also provide images and spectra. It will be used for follow-up observation of the GRB.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Science goals</span><br><br>This mission has multiple science goals:<br><br>* Determine the origin of GRBs. There seem to be at least two types of GRBs, only one of which can be explained with a hypernova, creating a gamma-ray beam. More data is needed to explore other explanations.<br>* GRBs seem to take place at "cosmological distances," which means they can be used to probe the distant, and therefore young, universe.<br>* The all-sky survey will be more sensitive than any previous one, and will add significantly to our knowledge of astronomical X-ray sources. Thus, it could also yield unexpected results.<br><br><strong>Mission progress</strong><br><br>* <span style="font-style: italic;">Swift</span> was launched on November 20, 2004, and reached its design orbit of 584x601 km.<br>* On December 4 the power up of the on-board devices hit a snag, when the Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC) for the X-ray CCD did not turn on as expected. Mission members are evaluating in what way the science data will be affected, if the TEC is off for the rest of the mission.<br>* December 17 at 7:28:30 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and located on-board an apparent gamma-ray burst. The spacecraft did not autonomously slew to the burst since automated slewing was not yet enabled.<br>* <span style="font-style: italic;">Swift</span> had its first GRB trigger during a period when the automatic slew was allowed on January 17, 2005, at about 12:55 UT. It pointed the XRT telescope to the on-board computed coordinates and observed a bright source in the field of view.<br>* On February 1, 2005 the mission team released the "first light" picture of the UVOT instrument and declared Swift operational.<br>* As of April 7, 2005, Swift has detected about two dozen GRBs and X-ray afterglows for about 15 of them, and optical afterglows for a few. Optical afterglows are important for providing distance estimates.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Swift_m101_combined_low.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/Swift_m101_combined_low.jpg/180px-Swift_m101_combined_low.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First light image of the Swift UVOT instrument (Credit: NASA/GSFC)<br><br>This UVOT image combines both ultraviolet and visible light from a number of filters. Each filter is sensitive to light of a different color, ranging from ultraviolet light beyond the range of human eyesight through the blue to yellow portion of the visible spectrum. This is a 'false-color' image with the shortest wavelength ultraviolet rays being represented as blue, and the longest visible light wavelengths as red. The image shows that hot young stars are being formed in abundance in M101, especially in the spiral arms of the galaxy, where they show up in ultraviolet light. The central regions of the galaxy have more cool, old stars, which appear 'red' in the picture. A number of foreground stars, located in our own Galaxy, also reveal themselves by their red color.</span><br><br><strong>Important events and results</strong><br><br>On May 9, 2005, <span style="font-style: italic;">Swift</span> detected the flash of two neutron stars crashing together, a burst of gamma rays that lasted one-twentieth of a second. The craft slewed to look towards the direction of the flash and about 53 seconds after the initial burst, the X-ray telescope caught the rapidly fading afterglow of the event. The detection marks the first time that the location of a short-duration gamma-ray burst has been identified. (Cowen, 2005)<br><br>Issue #162</div>

While these stars are at a relatively tender age, only about a million years old, it is likely that our own Sun formed in a similar stellar nursery some five billion years ago. Most noticeable in the striking image are the lovely bluish dust clouds that reflect the youthful starlight, but the smaller, deep red crescent shapes are also markers of energetic, young stellar objects. Known as Herbig-Haro objects, their shape and color is characteristic of glowing hydrogen gas shocked by jets streaming away from newborn stars. Ultimately the natal gas and dust in the region will be dispersed, the stars drifting apart as the loose cluster orbits the center of the Galaxy. NGC 7129 is about 10 light-years across.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Robert Gendler</div>

Tonight is the peak of the month-long Perseid Meteor Shower. Although visible every year at this time, the Perseids are expected to appear particularly active this year due to the relative absence of glare from the Moon during the peak. Tonight, a thin moon will set a few hours after the Sun, leaving a moonless and dark sky. All through the night, all over the sky, meteors will appear to shoot out the constellation Perseus and across the sky. The rate of meteors and fireballs is not known for sure, but expected by some to be as high as one meteor flash every minute. Lucky sky gazers might be treated to a bright fireball like the one pictured above. That fireball was captured by a digital recorded over Wise Observatory during the 2001 Perseids. The meteor shower poses no danger as few, if any, of the sand-sized flaring bits are expected to reach the ground.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> D.

The network also supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Deep-space-op.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Deep Space Network</strong> operations center</span><br><br><strong>General information</strong><br><br>DSN currently consists of three deep-space communications facilities placed approximately 120 degrees apart around the world at:<br><br>- the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex outside of Barstow, California, United States;<br>- a complex in Robledo de Chavela, 60 kilometres (37 miles) west of Madrid, Spain; and<br>- the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (CDSCC) in the Australian Capital Territory, 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Canberra, Australia near the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.<br><br>Each facility is situated in semi-mountainous, bowl-shaped terrain to shield against radio frequency interference. This strategic placement permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates, and helps to make the DSN the largest and most sensitive scientific telecommunications system in the world.<br><br>NASA's scientific investigation of the Solar System is being accomplished mainly through the use of unmanned spacecraft. The DSN provides the vital two-way communications link that guides and controls these planetary explorers, and brings back the images and new scientific information they collect. All DSN antennas are steerable, high-gain, parabolic reflector antennas.<br><br>The antennas and data delivery systems make it possible to:<br><br>- Acquire telemetry data from spacecraft.<br>- Transmit commands to spacecraft.<br>- Track spacecraft position and velocity.<br>- Perform very-long-baseline interferometry observations.<br>- Measure variations in radio waves for radio science experiments.<br>- Gather science data.<br>- Monitor and control the performance of the network.<br><br>The network is a facility of the JPL and is managed and operated for NASA by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The Interplanetary Network Directorate (IND) manages the program within JPL.<br><br><strong>Antennae</strong><br><br>Each complex consists of at least four deep space stations equipped with ultrasensitive receiving systems and large parabolic dish antennas. There are:<br><br>- One 34-metre (111-foot) diameter High Efficiency antenna.<br>- One 34-metre Beam Waveguide antenna (Three at the Goldstone Complex and two at the Madrid complex).<br>- One 26-metre (85-foot) antenna.<br>- One 70-metre (230-foot) antenna.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Goldstone_DSN_antenna.jpg/761px-Goldstone_DSN_antenna.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Goldstone_DSN_antenna.jpg/250px-Goldstone_DSN_antenna.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">70 m antenna at Goldstone</span><br><br>Five new 34-metre beam waveguide antennas were added to the system in the late 1990s. Three were located at Goldstone, and one each in both Canberra and Madrid. A second 34-metre beam waveguide antenna was completed at the Madrid complex in 2004.<br><br>The ability to array several antennas was installed to improve the data returned from the Galileo spacecraft. The array electronically links the 70-metre antenna at the Deep Space Network complex in Goldstone, California, with an identical antenna located in Australia, in addition to two 34-metre (111-foot) antennas at the Canberra complex. The California and Australia sites concurrently pick up communications with Galileo.<br><br>All the stations are remotely operated from a centralized Signal Processing Center at each complex. The Centers house the electronic subsystems that point and control the antennas, receive and process the telemetry data, transmit commands, and generate the spacecraft navigation data.<br><br>Once the data are processed at the complexes, it is transmitted to JPL for further processing and distribution to science teams over a modern ground communications network.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The forerunner of the DSN was established in January, 1958, when JPL, then under contract to the U.S. Army, deployed portable radio tracking stations in Nigeria, Singapore, and California to receive telemetry and plot the orbit of the Army-launched Explorer 1, the first successful U.S. satellite. NASA was officially established on October 1, 1958, to consolidate the separately developing space-exploration programs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force into one civilian organization.<br><br>On December 3, 1958, JPL was transferred from the Army to NASA and given responsibility for the design and execution of lunar and planetary exploration programs using automatically operated spacecraft. Shortly afterward, NASA established the concept of the Deep Space Network as a separately managed and operated communications facility that would accommodate all deep space missions, thereby avoiding the need for each flight project to acquire and operate its own specialized space communications network. The Deep Space Network was given responsibility for its own research, development, and operation in support of all of its users. Under this concept, it has become a world leader in the development of low-noise receivers, tracking, telemetry and command systems, digital signal processing, and deep space navigation.<br><br>Issue #164</div>

Incorporated into future stars and planets, these are the elements ultimately necessary for life.

Judging from the measured size of the expanding outer ring of shock-heated gas, about 150 light-years, light from the original supernova explosion would have first reached Earth about 10,000 years ago. Hundreds of supernova remnants have been identified as much sought after astronomical laboratories for studying the cycle of element synthesis and enrichment, but the x-ray data also show that the hot gas at the center of this particular supernova remnant is exceptionally rich in neon and oxygen.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> S.Park, D.

Extending above the photosphere or visible surface of the Sun, the faint, tenuous solar corona can't be easily seen from Earth, but it is measured to be hundreds of times hotter than the photosphere itself. Astronomers have long sought the source of the corona's heat in magnetic fields which loft monstrous loops of solar plasma above the photosphere. Detailed observations of coronal loops from the orbiting TRACE satellite are pointing more closely to the unidentified energy source. Recorded in extreme ultraviolet light, this and other TRACE images indicate that significant heating occurs low in the corona, near the bases of the loops as they emerge from and return to the solar surface. This tantalizing TRACE image shows clusters of the majestic, hot coronal loops which span 30 or more times the diameter of planet Earth.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> M.

Led by the California Institute of Technology, GALEX will conduct several first-of-a-kind sky surveys, including an extra-galactic (beyond our galaxy) ultraviolet all-sky survey. During its 29-month mission GALEX will produce the first comprehensive map of a Universe of galaxies under construction, bringing more understanding of how galaxies like the Milky Way were formed.

A galaxyÂ’s ultraviolet brightness tells us how fast its stars are forming. Mission scientists will be trying to find stars that have recently formed, so they will be looking for stars whose appearance reveals them to be young. These are the most massive stars, which are so hot they shine in ultraviolet wavelengths.<br><br>Scientists would like to understand when the stars that we see today were formed, and when the chemical elements that make up our Milky Way galaxy formed.

Sky enthusiasts who trekked outside for the Perseid meteor shower that peaked over the past few days typically had this question on their mind. The above movie, where the time-line has been digitally altered, captures part of that very mystery. Eight meteors from the night of August 12 and the morning of August 13 have been identified in the movie so far, seven of which are Perseids. Can you identify the non-Perseid meteor? Since all Perseid meteors appear to come from the constellation of Perseus, the non-Perseid meteor is the one that streaks in a different direction. Early reports are that this year's Perseids were unfortunately a bit disappointing. The above digital mosaic was taken from Alsace, France, with the photogenic band of our Milky Way Galaxy far in the background.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Stefan Seip</div>

It was originally situated at Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex, England, which was the site of the Royal Greenwich Observatory after it moved away from Greenwich due to light pollution. It was inaugurated in 1967 by Elizabeth II.

In 1979, the INT was shipped to La Palma, where it has remained ever since. The move was beset with difficulties, and it is widely recognised that it would have been cheaper to have built a new telescope rather than moving an existing one. As is customary for astronomical telescopes, the telescope foundations were entirely separate from the foundations of the dome and the rest of the structure in order to minimise telescope vibrations from movements of the dome (with an air gap of a few centimeters inbetween, going down many meters below the telescope platform). When the local construction workers on La Palma saw this air gap, they filled it with concrete under the assumption that this would be helpful (in making it stronger). It was impossible to remove this concrete, and it has been very difficult to keep telescope vibrations at a bearable level as a result.<br><br>Today, it is used mostly with the Wide Field Camera (WFC), a four CCD instrument with a field of view of 0.5 square degrees which was commissioned in 1997. The other main instrument available at the INT in earlier times was the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS).<br><br><strong>Technical details</strong><br><br>The INT is a Cassegrain telescope, with a 2.54 m diameter primary mirror and a focal length of 7.5 m. The mirror weighs 4,361 kg, and is supported by a polar disc/fork type equatorial mounting. The total weight of the telescope is around 90 tonnes. The f/3.29 Prime focus, used with the WFC, allows an unvignetted field of view of 40 arcminutes (approximately 0.5 square degrees). There is also a secondary focal station, the f/15 Cassegrain focus, which possesses a 20 arcminute field of view and was the mount point for the IDS.<br><br>The pointing accuracy of the telescope is around 5 arcseconds, but a sophisticated autoguider, which tracks a given guide star and makes small corrections to the telescope tracking, allows a guiding accuracy of better than 0.3 arcseconds.<br><br>Issue #167</div>

Also shown in recent years to be one in a growing list of double asteroids, new observations during August and October 2004 made at the Paranal Observatory convincingly demonstrate that 87 Sylvia in fact has two moonlets - the first known triple asteroid system. At the center of this composite of the image data, potato-shaped 87 Sylvia itself is about 380 kilometers wide. The data show inner moon, Remus, orbiting Sylvia at a distance of about 710 kilometers once every 33 hours, while outer moon Romulus orbits at 1,360 kilometers in 87.6 hours. Tiny Remus and Romulus are 7 and 18 kilometers across respectively. Because 87 Sylvia was named after Rhea Silvia, the mythical mother of the founders of Rome, the discoverers proposed Romulus and Remus as fitting names for the two moonlets. The triple system is thought to be the not uncommon result of collisions producing low density, rubble pile asteroids that are loose aggregations of debris.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> F.

NGC 2266 is, for example, the 2,266th item in his New General Catalog of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars. Noting that "every book has a first page", modern day astronomer Jay GaBany wondered what NGC 1 might look like - and found it, along with NGC 2 in the constellation Perseus. Pictured above, both are more or less typical-sized (50-100 thousand light-years across) spiral galaxies with estimated distances of over 150 million light-years for NGC 1 (top) and about twice that for NGC 2. NGC ordering is based on an astronomical coordinate system, so these otherwise unremarkable spirals appear first in the NGC listing because their location in the sky translates to the smallest Right Ascension coordinate in the catalog.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> R Jay GaBany (Cosmotography.com)</div>

The inner region of the galaxy is pictured, spanning about 7,500 light-years. At its center is the bright, densely packed galactic core surrounded by a loose array of dark dust lanes mixed with the stars in the galactic plane. NGC 300 lies 6.5 million light-years away and is part of a group of galaxies named for the southern constellation Sculptor. Hubble's unique ability to distinguish so many stars in NGC 300 can be used to hone techniques for making distance measurements on extragalactic scales.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Hubble Heritage Team (AURA / STScI), ESA, NASA</div>

Actually, pictured above are several clouds all stacked up into one striking lenticular cloud. Normally, air moves much more horizontally than it does vertically. Sometimes, however, such as when wind comes off of a mountain or a hill, relatively strong vertical oscillations take place as the air stabilizes. The dry air at the top of an oscillation may be quite stratified in moisture content, and hence forms clouds at each layer where the air saturates with moisture. The result can be a lenticular cloud with a strongly layered appearance. The above picture was taken last week near Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Peter Michaud (Gemini Obs.)</div>

Traveling two kilometers south of Endurance Crater, the robotic rover Opportunity now exploring Mars stopped and took a 360 degree panorama of a desolate and rusted Martian landscape. The site was dubbed Rub al Khali for its similarity to a barren part of the Saudi Arabian desert on Earth. In the center of the frame, the tracks from the rover's grated wheels can be seen receding far into the distance. Near the bottom, several parts of Opportunity itself are recorded, including, on the far right, a Martian sundial. Nearly 100 images in three colors to generate the above spectacular real-color image mosaic. To display the full high-resolution image would require about 300 computer monitors -- or one good large format printer.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Mars Exploration Rover Mission, JPL, NASA</div>

Prominent features include a small open cluster of stars, a diffuse red-glowing emission nebula, large lanes of obscuring gas and dust, and dense knots of dust and gas in which stars may still be forming. The open cluster of stars IC 1590 visible around the center has formed only in the last few million years. The brightest member of this cluster is actually a multiple-star system shining light that helps ionize the nebula's gas, causing the red glow visible throughout. The lanes of dust visible left of center are likely homes of future star formation. Particularly striking in the above photograph are the dark Bok globules visible against the bright nebula. The NGC 281 system, dubbed the Pacman nebula for its overall shape, lies about 10 thousand light years distant.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Steve Cannistra (StarryWonders)</div>
