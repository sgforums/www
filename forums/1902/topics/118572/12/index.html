The Sun also illuminated three planets gathered in the western sky, Mercury, Venus, and Saturn. From this perspective Mercury is at the highest point in the celestial triangle, brilliant Venus is just below, and Saturn stands farther to the left and below the close pair. Of course, the planets only appear close together on the sky but are actually quite far apart in space. The orbits of Mercury and Venus are both interior to Earth's orbit, while gas giant Saturn lies in the outer solar system, over nine astronomical units from the Sun. Late next week, Venus and Mercury will share western skies with the young crescent Moon.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Damian Sparkes</div>

Cameras on the impactor probe and the flyby spacecraft will capture close-up images of the event - expected to produce a crater on the surface of the comet's nucleus. Of course, Earth-orbiting and ground-based telescopes will be watching too, including instruments on the Swift satellite normally used to spot gamma-ray bursts in the distant universe. Swift's ultraviolet telescope recorded this picture of Tempel 1 on June 29th. Because the image is registered on the comet, the background stars appear as short trails. Want to follow the encounter?

The detector target is 1,000 tonnes of heavy water contained in a 6 meter radius acrylic vessel, and the detector cavity is filled with light water to provide buoyancy for the vessel and radioactive shielding. The heavy water is viewed by 9,600 single photon detectors known as Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) mounted on a geodesic sphere at a radius of about 850 cm.<br><br>The experiment does not directly detect neutrinos, but rather observes the light produced by relativistic electrons in the water. As relativistic electrons lose energy they produce a cone of blue light through the Cerenkov effect, and it is this light that is directly detected.<br><br>The detector was designed to solve the solar neutrino problem, as well as to search for evidence of neutrino flavour change (neutrino oscillation). SNO is capable of detecting all three neutrino flavours unlike other detectors such as Super-Kamiokande that can only detect the electron and tau types.<br><br>The first measurements of the number of solar neutrinos reaching the earth were taken in the 1960s, and all experiments prior to SNO observed a third to a half fewer neutrinos than were predicted by the Standard Solar Model. One of the possible explanations for the reduced flux was the theory of neutrino flavor oscillation: the neutrinos emitted by the sun would undergo fundamental changes into other types of neutrinos as they travel through the sun. On June 18th, 2001, the first scientific results of the Observatory were published, bringing the first clear evidence that this theory was correct. The actual flux of neutrinos measured by SNO coincides with the theoretical output. Further measurements carried out by the Observatory have since confirmed this result.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/SNO_KDEmini.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/SNO_KDEmini.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">SNO in action</span><br><br>SNO is also capable of detecting a supernova within our galaxy. As neutrinos emitted by a supernova are released earlier than the photons, it would be possible to alert the astronomical community before the supernova was visible.

Within minutes of recording the rugged view, the landscape had changed dramatically though, as the impactor smashed into the surface near the two large, half kilometer-sized craters at picture center. Indications are that the probe penetrated well below the surface before vaporizing, sending a relatively narrow plume of debris blasting back into space. Researchers are still speculating on the final size of the crater produced by the July 4th comet crash, but material continues to spew from the impact site and has caused the faint comet to brighten significantly. Determining the crater dimensions and analyzing the debris ejected from the comet's interior will provide premier insights into the formation of comet Tempel 1, a primordial chunk of our own solar system.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Univ.

A recent camping trip with family and friends to Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, near Flagstaff, Arizona, USA produced the opportunity to record the subtle lighting from Earth and sky. Pointed south with the shutter held open for five minutes, camera and tripod were fixed to planet Earth, producing the gently curving, concentric star trails - a reflection of the planet's daily rotation about its axis. Rising beyond the forest fire's glow is the slope of Sunset Crater, a cinder cone produced by volcanic eruptions some 900 years ago.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Rick Scott</div>

This sharp color image reveals the galaxy's bulging central core dominated by light from a population of older, yellowish stars. The core is dramatically cut by obscuring dust lanes which lace NGC 4565's thin galactic plane. A large island universe similar to our own Milky Way Galaxy, NGC 4565 is only about 30 million light-years distant, but over 100,000 light-years in diameter. In fact, some consider NGC 4565 to be a prominent celestial masterpiece Messier missed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Robert Gendler</div>

The blue regions shine primarily by reflected light. Blue light from the star Rho Ophiuchi and nearby stars reflects more efficiently off this portion of the nebula than red light. The Earth's daytime sky appears blue for the same reason. The red and yellow regions shine primarily because of emission from the nebula's atomic and molecular gas. Light from nearby blue stars - more energetic than the bright star Antares - knocks electrons away from the gas, which then shines when the electrons recombine with the gas. The dark regions are caused by dust grains - born in young stellar atmospheres - which effectively block light emitted behind them. The Rho Ophiuchi star clouds, well in front of the globular cluster M4 visible above on far lower left, are even more colorful than humans can see - the clouds emits light in every wavelength band from the radio to the gamma-ray.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Adam Block (KPNO Visitor Program), NOAO, AURA, NSF</div>

A group hiking at 6 am near the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro watched the rising sun peak above the clouds and the horizon light up red. Don't worry -- in this case the highest volcano in Africa is not even erupting. The spectacular sunrise colors are caused by light scattering off the atmosphere and small cloud particles. If all of the scattered light that makes the sky blue were added back into the scene, the sunrise would appear Sun-colored and not so red. A similar light scattering effect involving small airborne dust particles causes sunsets on Mars to be red and has been used to determine the sizes of particles in the rings of Saturn. During this trek in 2000 November, a group of about 30 reached the Kilomanjaro summit after a six-day climb.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Clayton Hogen-Chin (U.

The dramatic picture was taken at the Uchinoura Space Center on July 10 at 12:30 JST. For dedicated astronomers, a celebration is definitely in order as this launch is a reflight of the Astro-E payload, originally destroyed in a launch failure in February 2000. Now being checked out in Earth orbit, the innovative instrumentation on board the satellite will explore the Universe in energetic x-rays. Following a tradition of renaming satellites after their successful launch, Astro-E2 has been newly dubbed Suzaku. Suzaku, a phoenix-like deity in mythology associated with the southern part of the sky, is a 'Red Bird'.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Image Credit:</span> Dr. F.

But the trick to imaging an analemma of the Moon is to understand that on average the Moon returns to the same position in the sky about 51 minutes later each day. So, if you photograph the Moon 51 minutes later on successive days, over one lunation or lunar month it will trace out an analemma-like curve as the actual position of the Moon wanders compared to the average -- due to the Moon's tilted and elliptical orbit. For this excellent demonstration of the lunar analemma, astronomer Rich Richins chose the lunar month containing this year's northern hemisphere summer solstice. The southernmost Full Moon rises at the lower right above the Organ Mountains in southern New Mexico, USA, with the New Moon phase at the upper left. The multiple exposure image required some digital manipulation, particularly to include thin crescent phases in daytime skies.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Rich Richins</div>
