The plural of planetarium is <span style="font-style: italic;">planetariums</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">planetaria</span>.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b6/Planetarium-building.jpg/800px-Planetarium-building.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b6/Planetarium-building.jpg/200px-Planetarium-building.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Planetarium</strong> of PlanetÃ¡rio Calouste Gulbenkian, in Lisbon, part of the Museum of Navy</span><br><br><strong>Overview</strong><br><br>Planetariums typically use a large dome shape for the projection screen, with inclined chairs for comfortable viewing "straight up". A large projector in the center of the dome creates the scene, using a number of movable projectors projecting the images of stars or planets onto the screen. The various projectors are geared to provide an accurate relative motion of the sky, and the entire system can be set to display the sky at any point in time.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Planetarium-dome.jpg/800px-Planetarium-dome.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3a/Planetarium-dome.jpg/200px-Planetarium-dome.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Planetarium dome</span><br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>Archimedes is attributed with possessing a primitive planetarium device that could predict the movements of the Sun, the Moon and the planets. The discovery of the Antikythera mechanism proved that such devices already existed during antiquity.<br><br>The first modern planetarium projectors were designed and built by Carl Zeiss in 1924, and have grown more complex. Smaller projectors include a set of fixed stars, Sun, Moon, and planets, and various nebulae. Larger machines also include comets and a far greater selection of stars. Additional projectors can be added to show twilight around the outside of the screen (complete with city or country scenes) as well as the Milky Way. Still others add coordinate lines and constellations, photographic slides, laser displays, and other images. The OmniMax movie system (now known as IMAX Dome) was originally designed to operate on planetarium screens.<br><br>In recent years, planetariums Â— or dome theaters Â— have broadened their offerings to include wide-screen or "wraparound" films, all-sky video, and laser shows that combine music with laser-drawn patterns. The newest generation of planetariums has moved to a fully digital projection system, in which a single large projector with a fish eye lens, or a system of digital video projectors around the edge of the dome, are used to create any scene provided to it from a computer. This gives the operator tremendous flexibility in showing not only the modern night sky as visible from Earth, but any other image they wish (including the night sky as visible from points far distant in space and time).<br><br>A portable class of planetariums can be set up for programs at schools, for example, on a temporary basis. Easily transported and quickly erected inflatable structures have been used for this purpose.<br><br>The term "planetarium" can also be used to describe the projector itself, or other devices to illustrate the solar system, like a computer simulation or an orrery.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Qm2_planetarium.jpg/800px-Qm2_planetarium.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Qm2_planetarium.jpg/200px-Qm2_planetarium.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Planetarium aboard cruise liner Queen Mary 2</span><br><br><strong>Notable planetariums</strong><br><br>- Adler Planetarium, Chicago, Illinois<br>- <a href="http://www.artis.nl/international/cultural/4.html" rel="nofollow">Artis Planetarium</a>, Amsterdam<br>- Cernan Earth and Space Center, Triton College, River Grove, Illinois<br>- <a href="http://www.mdsci.org/shows/davis/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">Davis Planetarium</a> at the <a href="http://www.mdsci.org" rel="nofollow">Maryland Science Center</a><br>- Eise Eisinga Planetarium, Franeker, 1774<br>- Fels Planetarium at the Franklin Institute (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)<br>- Charles Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Science (Boston, Massachusetts)<br>- Hayden Planetarium, at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY; James Stewart Polshek, architect, 2000.<br>- London Planetarium, Marylebone Road, London (part of Madame Tussaud's)<br>- Montreal Planetarium, Montreal, Quebec, Canada<br>- H.R.

Recorded here in exquisite detail by the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys, the big, beautiful face-on spiral does steal the show, but the sharp image also reveals an impressive array of background galaxies in the field, strewn across the more distant Universe. Looking within NGC 3370, the image data has proved sharp enough to study individual pulsating stars known as Cepheids which can be used to accurately determine this galaxy's distance. NGC 3370 was chosen for this study because in 1994 the spiral galaxy was also home to a well studied stellar explosion -- a type Ia supernova. Combining the known distance to this standard candle supernova, based on the Cepheid measurements, with observations of supernovae at even greater distances, can reveal the size and expansion rate of the Universe itself.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Hubble Heritage Team, A.

[prash-skee or-loi]) is a medieval astronomical clock located in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. The Orloj is mounted on the southern wall of Old Town City Hall in the Old Town Square and is a popular tourist attraction.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Prague_Apr04_015a.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Prague_Apr04_015a.jpg/300px-Prague_Apr04_015a.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Prague Orloj</strong>, the astronomical clock in the Old Town Square of Prague, Czech Republic</span><br><br>The Orloj is composed of three main components: the astronomical dial, representing the position of the Sun and Moon in the sky and displaying various astronomical details; "The Walk of the Apostles", a clockwork hourly show of figures of the Apostles and other moving sculptures; and a calendar dial with medallions representing the months.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The oldest part of the Orloj, the mechanical clock and astronomical dial, dates back to 1410 when it was made by clockmaker Mikulas of Kadan and Jan Sindel, the latter a professor of mathematics and astronomy at Charles University. The Prague Orloj was the third clock of its kind, the first having been constructed in Padua in 1344.<br><br>Later, presumably around 1490, the calendar dial was added and clock facade decorated with gothic sculptures.<br><br>In 1552 it was repaired by Jan Taborsky, clockmaster of Orloj, who also wrote a report on the clock where he mentioned Hanus as maker of the clock. This was a mistake, and was corrected during the 20th century.<br><br>The Orloj stopped working many times in the centuries after 1552, and was repaired many times. In the 17th century moving statues were added, and figures of the Apostles were added after major repair in 1865-1866.<br><br>The Orloj suffered heavy damage in last days of WW II when Germans directed artillery fire at the Old-Town Hall. The hall completely burned along with wooden sculptures of the Orloj and the calendar dial face of great artistic value made by Josef Manes. The authentic machinery was repaired and the Orloj started working again in 1948, but only after significant effort.<br><br>There exists a good deal of misinformation relating to the construction of the Orloj. For a long time it was believed that the Orloj was constructed in 1490 by clockmaster Jan Ruze (also called Hanus) and his assistant Jakub Cech. Another fictitious story involves the clockmaker Hanus being blinded on the order of the Prague Councillors to prevent him from constructing another similar clock.<br><br><strong>Astronomical dial</strong><br><br>The astronomical dial is a form of mechanical astrolabe, a device used in medieval astronomy. Alternatively, one may consider the Orloj to be a primitive planetarium, displaying the current state of universe.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Orloj-AstronomicalDial.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d2/Orloj-AstronomicalDial.jpg/300px-Orloj-AstronomicalDial.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The astronomical dial</span><br><br>The astronomical dial has a background that represents the standing Earth and sky, and surrounding it operate four main moving components: the zodiacal ring, an outer rotating ring, an icon representing the Sun, and an icon representing the Moon.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stationary background</span><br><br>The background represents the Earth and the local view of the sky. The blue circle directly in the center represents the Earth, and the upper blue is the portion of the sky which is above the horizon. The red and black areas indicate portions of the sky below the horizon. During the daytime, the sun sits over the blue part of the background and at night it sits over the black. During dawn or dusk, the mechanical sun is positioned over the red part of the background.<br><br>Written on the eastern (left) part of the horizon is <span style="font-style: italic;">aurora</span> (dawn in Latin) and <span style="font-style: italic;">ortus</span> (rising). On the western (right) part is <span style="font-style: italic;">occasus</span> (sunset), and <span style="font-style: italic;">crepusculum</span> (twilight).<br><br>Golden Roman numbers at the outer ege of blue circle are the timescale of a normal 24 hour day and indicate time in local Prague time, or Central European Time. Curved golden lines dividing the blue part of dial into 12 parts are marks for unequal hours. These hours are defined as 1/12 of the time between sunrise and sunset, and vary as the days grow longer or shorter during the year.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zodiacal ring</span><br><br>Inside the large black outer circle lies another movable circle marked with the signs of the zodiac and indicating the movement of the stars. The small golden star shows the position of the vernal equinox, and sidereal time can be read on the scale with golden Roman numbers.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Old Czech time scale</span><br><br>At the outer edge of the clock, golden Swbach numerals are set on a black background.

This ring moves during the year to coincide with the time of sunset.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sun</span><br><br>The golden Sun moves around the zodiacal circle, thus showing its position on the ecliptic. The sun is attached to an arm with a golden hand, and together they show the time in three different ways:<br><br>1.

Some astronomers now suggest that neutron-rich heavy elements such as gold might be most easily made in rare neutron-rich explosions such as the collision of neutron stars. Pictured above is a computer-animated frame depicting two neutron stars spiraling in toward each other, just before they collide. Since neutron star collisions are also suggested as the origin of short duration gamma-ray bursts, it is possible that you already own a souvenir from one of the most powerful explosions in the universe.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drawing Credit:</span> Stephan Rosswog (University of Leicester) et al., UKAFF</div>

That was a question considered by astronomers when they designed the Deep Impact mission, launched in January. This coming July 4, the Deep Impact spaceship will reach its target - Comet Tempel 1 -- and release an impactor over five times the mass of a person toward its surface. The mothership will photograph the result. The remaining crater may tell how Tempel 1 is constructed. If, for example, Comet Tempel 1 is an extremely loose pile of debris, the impactor may leave little or no discernable crater. On the other hand, if the comet's surface is relatively firm, the impactor's ripple may leave quite a large crater. A contest is even being held to predict the size of the resulting crater. Pictured above is an artist's impression of the initial encounter between the spacecraft and the comet.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drawing Credit:</span> Pat Rawlings, U.

For scientific uses, a modern planetary ephemeris comprises software that generates positions of the planets and often of their satellites, or of asteroids or comets at virtually any time desired by the user. Often there is an option to find the velocities of the bodies of interest, as well. Typically, such ephemerides cover several, or even many centuries, past and future; the future ones can be covered because celestial mechanics is an accurate theory. The biggest uncertainties, nowadays, are due to the perturbations on the planets of numerous asteroids, most of whose masses are poorly known, rendering their effect a bit uncertain.<br><br>Solar system ephemerides are essential for the navigation of spacecraft and for all kinds of space observations of the planets, their natural satellites, stars and galaxies.<br><br>An ephemeris also sometimes provides data on astronomical phenomena of interest to astrologers and astronomers such as solar and lunar eclipses, apparent retrogradation/planetary stations, planetary ingresses, sidereal time, positions for the Mean and True nodes of the moon, the phases of the Moon, and sometimes even the position(s) of Chiron, Lilith, and other minor celestial bodies. Some ephemerides also contain a monthly aspectarian, while others often include the declination of the planets as well as their longitudes, right ascensions or Cartesian coordinates.<br><br>Though astrology is and always has been geocentric, Heliocentric Astrology is an emerging field; for this purpose a standard ephemeris cannot be utilized, and because of this specialized heliocentric ephemerides must be calculated and used instead of the default geocentric ephemerides that are used in standard Western astrology to construct the astrological chart/natal chart.<br><br>Issue #84</div>

The lookout occurs near the peak of Husband Hill in the Columbia Hills. The summit of Husband Hill is visible 200 meters in the distance toward the center of the 360-degree near-true-color picture. The robot rover Spirit took images that compose the above mosaic over four Martian days. After taking the image sequence, Spirit carefully picked its way to toward Husband Hill's summit. On the far right, near distant rover tracks, is a recently investigated area dubbed Paso Robles that was found to contain high amounts of sulfur.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Mars Exploration Rover Mission, JPL, NASA</div>

It is a bronze disk of around 30cm diameter, patinated blue-green and inlaid with gold symbols interpreted by some as a sun or full moon, stars (including a cluster interpreted as the Pleiades) and a crescent with multiple strokes, interpreted as a sun boat with many oars.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/636px-Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/250px-Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The <strong>Nebra skydisk</strong> before restoration</span><br><br>If authentic, the find sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the people of the European Bronze Age, such as the builders of Stonehenge. Judging from the angles set by gilded arcs along the sky disk's circumference, it may be that the Bronze Age cultures in Central Europe made far more sophisticated celestial measurements far earlier than has been suspected.<br><br>The object is not without controversy. Richard Harrison, professor of European prehistory at the University of Bristol and an expert on the Beaker people allowed his initial reaction to be quoted in a BBC documentary (see <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2004/stardisctrans.shtml" rel="nofollow">link</a>):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"When I first heard about the Nebra Disc I thought it was a joke, indeed I thought it was a forgery. Because itÂ’s such an extraordinary piece that it wouldnÂ’t surprise any of us that a clever forger had cooked this up in a backroom and sold it for a lot of money."</span><br><br>Though Harrison had not seen the skydisk when he was interviewed, it was a reasonable skepticism at that point. The disk had appeared as if from nowhere on the international antiquities market in 2001. Its seller claimed that it had been looted by illegal treasure hunters with a metal detector in 1999. Archaeological artefacts are the property of the state in Saxony-Anhalt and following a police sting operation in Basel, Switzerland, the disk was acquired by the state archaeologist. As part of a plea bargain, the illicit owners led police and archaeologists to the site where they had found it; though no witnesses were present at the first discovery, archaeologists have opened a dig at the site and have uncovered further remains (though nothing similar) that support the looters' claim. The disk and its accompanying finds have come to rest in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Landesmuseum fÃ¼r Vorgeschichte</span> (State Museum for Prehistory) of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.<br><br>The discovery site identified by the arrested metal detectorists is a prehistoric enclosure encircling the top of a hill. Strikingly, the hill is still called the Mittelberg ('Central Hill'), a 252 m hill in the Ziegelroda Forest, 180 km southwest of Berlin. The enclosure is orientated in such a way that the sun seems to set every equinox behind the Brocken, the highest peak of the Harz mountains. The nearby forest is said to contain around 1,000 barrows. It was claimed by the treasure-hunters that the artifacts were discovered within a pit inside the bank-and-ditch enclosure.<br><br>As the item was not excavated using archaeological methods, even its claimed provenance may be made up, authenticating it has depended on microphotography of the corrosion crystals, which produced images that could not be reproduced by a fakerÂ—and which, incidentally, are very beautiful scientific micrographs in themselves. The more precise dating of the Nebra skydisk, however, depended upon the dating of a number of Bronze Age weapons which were offered for sale with the disk and said to be from the same site. These axes and swords can be typologically dated to the mid 2nd millennium BC (Unetice culture). Those who have examined the disk point out that its patina indicates the disk's antiquity, and the interested reader may want to look at the micrographs in the article linked below and assess whether such effects could be produced chemically by a counterfeiter. One skeptic has suggested parallels with the controversy surrounding the Shroud of Turin. According to an analysis of trace elements by x-ray fluorescence by E. Pernicka, University of Freiberg, the copper originated at the Mitterberg in Austria, while the gold is from the Carpathian Mountains. Copper from Bottendorf in the immediate vicinity of Nebra has definitely not been used. But few copper objects are found where they were originally smelted.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/Nebra-4.jpg/611px-Nebra-4.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/74/Nebra-4.jpg/250px-Nebra-4.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Diagram of the disk in its current condition (a star and a part of the full moon was restored)</span><br><br>If the disk is authentic then it may be argued that quantitative astronomy in central Europe may possibly date back 3,600 years. Egyptian representations of the sky are purely schematic at this time. The lack of a secure archaeological context for the disk however, means that it is difficult to accurately date or even authenticate it. It is unlike any known artistic style from the period and has been described as a fake by some archaeologists.<br><br>Possibly a scientific instrument as well as an item of religious significance, the disk is a beautiful object; the blue-green patina of the bronze may have been an intentional part of the original artifact.<br><br>The disk has only just begun to attract the kind of pseudoarchaeology, Wiccan and paranormal speculation that hangs over Stonehenge. Recently, its authenticity has again been attacked by the archaeologist Prof. Peter Schauer, university of Regensburg, who interprets it as a shaman drum of unknown, but late, date.<br><br>Issue #85</div>

In January the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn released a probe through the dense cloud decks of one of the Solar System's most mysterious moons. Below the clouds, as it descended, the probe took images of the approaching surface as well as several images from the surface itself. Many of the images have now been digitally merged and scaled into the above perspective from 3,000 meters high. The above stereographic projection shows a 360-degree wide-angle view of the surface of Titan. The bright areas toward the top and left of the image are thought to be relatively high ground laced with drainage channels cut by rivers of methane. The bright shapes on the right are now hypothesized to be ridges of ice gravel. Huygen's landing site, labeled, appears to be on a type of dark dry lakebed, once fed by a large dark flow channel on the left. The Huygen's probe lasted an unexpectedly long three hours on Titan's harsh surface.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> ESA, NASA, Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer Team (LPL)</div>

In fact, it was likely similar to some of the stars found in this false-color x-ray composite of the Orion Nebula region from the Chandra Observatory. The image is centered on bright stars of the nebula's Trapezium star cluster, and while analyzing the Chandra data astronomers have now found examples of young, sun-like stars producing intense x-ray flares. It sounds dangerous, but the situation may actually favor the formation of hospitable planetary systems like our own. Energetic flares can produce turbulence in the planet-forming disks surrounding the stars - preventing rocky earth-like planets from spiraling uncomfortably close to and even falling into their active, young parent stars. About 1,500 light-years away, the Orion Nebula is the closest large stellar nursery. At that distance, this Chandra image spans about 10 light-years.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> E.Feigelson &amp; K.Getman (PSU) et al. CXC / NASA</div>

Telescopes increase the apparent angular size of objects, as well as their apparent brightness. Galileo Galilei is credited with being the first to use a telescope for astronomical purposes in 1609, calling it at first a <span style="font-style: italic;">perspicillum</span>, and then using the terms <span style="font-style: italic;">telescopium</span> in Latin and <span style="font-style: italic;">telescopio</span> in Italian (from which the English word derives). Later, Johannes Kepler described the optics of lenses (see his books <span style="font-style: italic;">Astronomiae Pars Optica</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dioptrice</span>), including a new kind of astronomical telescope with two convex lenses (a principle often called Kepler telescope).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Telescope.jpg/389px-Telescope.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Telescope.jpg/180px-Telescope.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">50 cm refracting <strong>telescope</strong> at Nice Observatory.</span><br><br>Telescopes used for non-astronomical purposes are often referred to as <span style="font-style: italic;">theodolites, transits, spotting scopes, monoculars, binoculars, camera lenses, microscopes</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">spyglasses</span>.<br><br>The word "telescope" usually refers to optical telescopes, but there are telescopes for most of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.<br><br>Radio telescopes are focused radio antennas, usually shaped like large dishes. The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. Radio telescopes are often operated in pairs, or larger groups to synthesize large "virtual" apertures that are similar in size to the separation between the telescopes: see aperture synthesis. The current record is many times the width of the Earth, utilizing space-based VLBI telescopes such as the Japanese <a href="http://www.vsop.isas.ac.jp/" rel="nofollow">VSOP satellite</a>. Aperture synthesis is now also being applied to optical telescopes using optical interferometers.<br><br>X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes have a problem because these rays go through most metals and glasses. They use ring-shaped "glancing" mirrors, made of heavy metals, that reflect the rays just a few degrees. The mirrors are usually a section of a rotated parabola.<br><br><strong>Telescope mountings</strong><br><br>A simple telescope mount is an <span style="font-style: italic;">altazimuth</span> mount. It is similar to that of a surveying transit. A fork rotates in azimuth (in the horizontal plane), and bearings on the tips of the fork allow the telescope to vary in altitude (in a vertical plane). A <span style="font-style: italic;">dobsonian</span> mount is a type of altazimuth mount which has proven to be very popular as it is simple and cheap to make.<br><br>The major problem with using an altazimuth for astronomy is that both axes must be continuously adjusted to compensate for the Earth's rotation. Even if this is done, by computer control, the image rotates at a rate that varies depending on the angle of the star from the celestial pole. The last effect especially makes an altazimuth mount impractical for long-exposure photography with small telescopes.<br><br>The preferred solution for astronomical telescopes is to tip the altazimuth mount so that the azimuth axis is parallel with the axis of the Earth's rotation; this is known as an <span style="font-style: italic;">equatorial</span> mount.<br><br>Recently constructed large telescopes use a computer-controlled altazimuth mount, and for long exposures, they have (usually computer-controlled) variable-rate rotating erector prisms at the focus.<br><br>There are mountings even simpler than altazimuth, typically for specialised instruments.

It is also listed as Barnard 72 (B72), one of 182 dark markings of the sky cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard. Unlike bright emission nebulae and star clusters, Barnard's nebulae are interstellar dark clouds of obscuring gas and dust. Their shapes are visible in cosmic silhouette only because they lie in the foreground along the line of sight to rich star fields and glowing stellar nurseries near the plane of our Galaxy. Many of Barnard's dark nebulae are themselves likely sites of future star formation.

This absolute limit is called Sparrow's resolution limit. This limit depends on the wavelength of the studied light (so that the limit for red light comes much earlier than the limit for blue light) and on the diameter of the telescope mirror. This means that a telescope with a certain mirror diameter can resolve up to a certain limit at a certain wavelength, so if you want more resolution at that very wavelength, you have to build a wider mirror.<br><br><strong>Famous optical telescopes</strong><br><br>-- The Hubble Space Telescope is in orbit outside of the Earth's atmosphere to allow for observations not distorted by refraction, in this way they can be diffraction limited, and used for coverage in the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Hst_sts82.jpg/740px-Hst_sts82.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Hst_sts82.jpg/180px-Hst_sts82.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hubble Space Telescope as seen from the Space Shuttle Discovery.</span><br><br>-- The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is currently (2002) the record holder in size, with four telescopes each 8 metres in diameter.

Observations of rings bordering the Keeler gap in Saturn's rings showed unusual waves. Such waves were first noticed last July and are shown above in clear detail. The picture is a digitally foreshortened image mosaic taken earlier this month by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn. The rings, made of many small particles, were somehow not orbiting Saturn in their usual manner. Close inspection of the image shows the reason - a small moon is orbiting in the Keeler gap. The previously unknown moon is estimated to span about seven kilometers and appears to have the same brightness as nearby ring particles. The gravity of the small moon likely perturbs the orbits of ring particles that come near it, causing them to shimmer back and forth after the moon passes. Since inner particles orbit more quickly than outer particles, only the leading particles of the inner rings and the trailing particles of the outer rings show the wave effect.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Cassini Imaging Team, SSI, JPL, ESA, NASA</div>

The British scientist Sir Isaac Newton designed the first reflector circa 1670. He designed the reflector in order to solve the problem of chromatic aberration, a serious degradation in all refracting telescopes before the perfection of achromatic lenses. The traditional two-mirrored reflector is known as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Newtonian reflector</span>.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/RitcheyTelescope.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/RitcheyTelescope.JPG/180px-RitcheyTelescope.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ritchey 24" <strong>reflecting telescope</strong></span><br><br>While the Newtonian focus design still used in amateur astronomy, professionals now tend to use <span style="font-style: italic;">prime focus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cassegrain focus</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">coudÃ© focus</span> designs. By 2001, there were at least 49 reflectors with primary mirrors having diameters of 2 m+.<br><br><strong>Technical considerations</strong><br><br>The primary mirror is the reflector telescope's basic optical element and creates an image at the focal plane. The distance from the mirror to the focal plane is called the focal length. Film or a digital sensor may be located here to record the image, or an eyepiece for visual observation.<br><br>Reflector mirrors eliminate chromatic aberration but still contain other types of aberrations. Expensive telescopes will have additional optical elements to correct some of these aberrations:<br><br>-- spherical aberration when a non-parabolic mirror is used (the image plane is not flat)<br>-- coma<br>-- distortion over the field of view<br><br>Nearly all large research-grade astronomical telescopes are reflectors. There are several reasons for this:<br><br>-- In a lens the entire volume of material has to be free of imperfection and inhomogeneities, whereas in a mirror, only one surface has to be perfectly polished.<br>-- Light of different wavelengths travels through a medium other than vacuum at different speeds. This causes chromatic aberration in uncorrected lenses and creating an aberration-free large lens is a costly process. A mirror can eliminate this problem entirely.<br>-- There are structural problems involved in manufacturing and manipulating large-aperture lenses. A lens can only be held by its edge, which means that the sag due to gravity can be sufficient to distort the image. In contrast, a mirror can be supported by the whole side opposite its reflecting face.<br><br><strong>Reflecting telescope designs</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Schmidt camera</span><br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Schmidt camera</span>, invented by Bernhard Schmidt, is not technically a telescope since the light path does not exit to an eyepiece. Therefore it is strictly a camera, with a photographic plate, film or a CCD placed at the prime focus. The Schmidt camera corrects for spherical aberration by placing a correcting lens at the center of curvature of the mirror. The corrector, which is thicker in the middle and the edges, corrects the light paths so that the outer and inner parts of the mirror focus at the same distance. A simpler lensless Schmidt can be made by placing an aperture stop at the center of curvature, stopping the aperture to f/8 or longer. This degrades the light gathering ability of the telescope but produces a sharp image while preserving the wide field of the shorter focal length mirror. The 48" telescope at Palomar Observatory is actually a Schmidt camera.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Newtonian focus</span><br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Newtonian</span> usually has a paraboloid primary mirror but for small apertures, say 12 cm or less, if the focal ratio if f/8 or longer a spherical primary mirror is sufficient for high visual resolution. A flat secondary mirror reflects the light to a focal plane at the side of the top of the telescope tube. It is one of the simplest and least expensive designs for a given size of primary, and is popular with amateurs as a home-build project. Since the light path is unfolded, the tube is often quite long and heavy. The difficulty in making the paraboloid mirror with accuracy is proportional to its diameter. Amateurs often begin by producing a mirror of modest size (up to six inches/15 cm diameter) and progressing to larger sizes once they have some experience. Some amateurs produce a spherical mirror, and live with the spherical aberration, which is acceptable in longer focal length mirrors, where the difference between a spheroid and a paraboloid is very small. However, amateurs can grind and polish diffraction-limited paraboloid mirrors of substantial size (over 12 inches/300 mm diameter). If straight <span style="font-style: italic;">spider</span> vanes support the secondary mirror they cause diffractive effects making stars appear to "flare" in four or six directions--curved spiders can markedly reduce flares.<br><br>A Newtonian telescope placed on a simple altazimuth mounting is known as a Dobsonian. This variant (popularized by John Dobson in the 1970s) allows for a large primary mirror in a relatively cheap and lightweight telescope which is simple to build and use. For photographic use, an equatorial mount is needed, in which the telescope rotates around an axis parallel to the Earth's axis, allowing it to follow the apparent motion of stars.<br><br>Issue #91</div>

These instruments have a very wide field in sharp focus, about 30 times greater than Ritchey-ChrÃ©tien, with the drawbacks that the focus is inaccessible, making them usable only as cameras, and to Cassegrain, they have their physical length at least twice their focal length. Their optical performance comes from the use of a spherical mirror which reintroduces the spherical and field curvature aberrations, but avoids all the others. The spherical aberration is overcome by using a corrector lens in front of the telescope at the radius of the curvature of the mirror.

Three different wavelengths were used: approximately 1 centimeter, 3.5 centimeters, and 13 centimeters. The results are coded into the above false-color digitally reconstructed image. In the above image, the color purple indicates regions populated predominantly by ring particles larger than 5 centimeters, while the color green indicates regions with a significant population of small ring particles less than even 1 centimeter. The white center of Saturn's B-ring indicates that the density of ring particles was too high to make a good determination. Other radio observations indicate that some ring particles can be as large as several meters across. The impressive nature and clarity of the above sharp image may help determine clues about the origin of Saturn's beautiful but enigmatic ring system.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> RSS, JPL, ESA, NASA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Refracting telescope</strong></span><br><br>A <strong>refracting</strong> or <strong>refractor telescope</strong> is a type of optical telescope which refracts light at each end using lenses. This refraction causes parallel light rays to converge at a focal point; while those which were not parallel converge upon a focal plane. This can enable a user to view a distant object as if it were brighter, clearer, and/or larger. These are similar to microscopes. The monocular is a type of refractor. A typical refractor has two lenses, an objective lens and an eyepiece lens. The objective lens has two pieces of glass (with different densities), "crown" and "flint glass". Each side of each piece is ground and polished, and then the two pieces are glued together. The curvatures are designed to cancel (limit?) chromatic and spherical aberration.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Telescope.jpg/389px-Telescope.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Telescope.jpg/100px-Telescope.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The 50 cm <strong>refractor</strong> at Nice Observatory.</span><br><br><strong>Technical difficulties</strong><br><br>While initially the most common type of telescope, these are today used primarily by amateur astronomers and solar astronomers, and have been supplanted in professional night-time astronomy by reflecting telescopes. However, some relatively small instruments with 100-150 mm objective lenses regularly produce astrophotography that rivals images created by professionals as recently as 20 years ago using what were then the largest telescopes on Earth. Vacuum solar telescopes such as the Swedish Solar Telescope often use the vacuum entrance window as a lens, and are thus refractor telescopes. The vacuum solar telescope design has produced the highest resolution images of the Sun currently available.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/TwentyInchTelescope.JPG/450px-TwentyInchTelescope.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/TwentyInchTelescope.JPG/100px-TwentyInchTelescope.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">20 inch refractor at the Observatories at Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland, California.</span><br><br>Refractors are criticized for their relatively high-degree of chromatic and spherical aberration. There is also the problem of lens sagging, a result of gravity affecting glass. There is a further problem of mis-refraction; caused by air bubbles trapped within the lenses. In addition, glass is opaque to certain wavelengths, and even visible light is dimmed when it passes through glass. Many of these problems are avoided by using reflecting telescopes.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/EightInchTelescope.JPG/450px-EightInchTelescope.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/EightInchTelescope.JPG/100px-EightInchTelescope.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">8 inch refractor at the Observatories at Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland, California.</span><br><br><strong>Notable refracting telescopes</strong><br><br>-- Yerkes Observatory (102 cm)<br>-- Swedish Solar Telescope (100 cm)<br>-- Lick Observatory (91 cm)<br>-- Paris Observatory (83 cm + 62 cm)<br>-- Nice Observatory (76 cm)<br><br>Issue #93</div>
