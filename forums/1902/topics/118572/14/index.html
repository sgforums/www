Well within our own Milky Way galaxy, the cosmic sphere is roughly 7,000 light-years distant toward the constellation Hercules. Abell 39 is a planetary nebula, formed as a once sun-like star's outer atmosphere was expelled over a period of thousands of years. Still visible, the nebula's central star is evolving into a hot white dwarf. Although faint, the nebula's simple geometry has proven to be a boon to astronomers exploring the chemical abundances and life cycles of stars. In this deep image recorded under dark night skies, very distant background galaxies can be found -- some visible right through the nebula itself.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Jim Misti (Misti Mountain Observatory)</div>

It's the International Space Station (ISS) docked with the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS-114. In the past, many skygazers have spotted the space station and space shuttles as bright stars gliding through twilight skies, still glinting in the sunlight while orbiting 200 kilometers or so above the Earth's surface. But here, astronomer Anthony Ayiomamitis took advantage of a rarer opportunity to record the spacefaring combination moving quickly in silhouette across the solar disk on Thursday, July 28th from Athens, Greece. Launched on Tuesday, Discovery joined with the ISS Thursday, causing the already large space station seem to loom even larger.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Image Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Anthony Ayiomamitis</div>

Later, it was added to the catalog of his friend and colleague Charles Messier as M106. Modern deep telescopic views reveal it to be an island universe -- a spiral galaxy around 30 thousand light-years across located only about 21 million light-years beyond the stars of the Milky Way. Youthful blue star clusters and reddish stellar nurseries trace the striking spiral arms of M106. Seen so clearly in this beautiful image, the galaxy's bright core is also visible across the spectrum from radio to x-rays, making M106 a nearby example of the Seyfert class of active galaxies.

Prior to successful launch, the Chandra Observatory was known as AXAF, the Advanced X-ray Astronomical Facility.<br><br>Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, they are not detectable from Earth-based telescopes, requiring a space-based telescope to make these observations.<br><br><strong>Discoveries</strong><br><br>The data gathered by Chandra have greatly advanced the field of X-ray astronomy.<br><br>- The first light image, of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, gave astronomers their first glimpse of the compact object at the center of the remnant, probably a neutron star or black hole.<br>- In the Crab Nebula, another supernova remnant, Chandra showed a never-before-seen ring around the central pulsar and jets that had only been partially seen by earlier telescopes.<br>- The first X-ray emission was seen from the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, at the center of the Milky Way.<br>- Chandra found much cooler gas than expected spiralling into the center of the Andromeda Galaxy.<br>- Pressure fronts were observed in detail for the first time in Abell 2142, where clusters of galaxies are merging.<br>- The earliest images in X-rays of the shock wave of a supernova were taken of SN 1987A.<br>- Chandra showed for the first time the shadow of a small galaxy as it is being cannibalized by a larger one, in an image of Perseus A.<br>- A new type of black hole was discovered in galaxy M82, mid-mass objects purported to be the missing link between stellar-sized black holes and supermassive black holes.<br>- X-ray emission lines were associated for the first time with a gamma-ray burst, GRB 991216.<br>- High school students, using Chandra data, discovered a neutron star in supernova remnant IC 443.<br>- Observations by Chandra and BeppoSAX suggest that gamma-ray bursts occur in star-forming regions.<br>- Chandra data suggested that RXJ1856 and 3C58, previously thought to be pulsars, might be even denser objects: quark stars. These results are still debated.<br>- TWA 5B, a brown dwarf, was seen orbiting a binary system of Sun-like stars.<br>- Sound waves from violent activity around a supermassive black hole were observed in the Perseus Cluster.<br>- The X-ray shadow of Titan was seen when it transitted the Crab Nebula.<br><br><strong>Technical description</strong><br><br>Unlike optical telescopes which possess simple silvered parabolic surfaces (mirrors), X-ray telescopes generally have nested cylindrical paraboloid and hyperboloid surfaces coated with iridium. X-ray photons would be absorbed by normal mirror surfaces, so mirrors with a low grazing angle are necessary to reflect them. Chandra uses four pairs of nested mirrors, together with their support structure, called the High Resolution Mirror Assembly (HRMA).<br><br>Chandra's high elliptical orbit allows it to observe continuously for up to 55 hours of its 65 hour orbital period.<br><br>With an angular resolution of 0.5 arcsecond (2.4 Âµrad), Chandra possesses a resolution over one thousand times better than that of the first orbiting X-ray telescope, which had less precise gold-coated mirrors.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instruments</span><br><br>The Science Instrument Module (SIM) holds the two focal plane instruments, the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) and the High Resolution Camera (HRC), moving whichever is called for into position during an observation.<br><br>ACIS consists of 10 CCD chips and provides images as well as spectral information of the object observed. It operates in the range of 0.2 - 10 keV. HRC has two micro-channel plate components and images over the range of 0.1 - 10 keV. It also has a time resolution of 16 microseconds. Both of these instruments can be used on their own or in conjunction with one of the observatory's two transmission gratings.<br><br>The transmission gratings, which swing into the optical path behind the mirrors, provide Chandra with high resolution spectroscopy. The High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) works over 0.4 - 10 keV and has a spectral resolution of 60-1000. The Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (LETGS) has a range of 0.09 - 3 keV and a resolution of 40-2,000.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>In 1976 the Chandra X-ray Observatory (called AXAF at the time) was proposed to NASA by Riccardo Giacconi and Harvey Tananbaum. Preliminary work began the following year at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). In the meantime, in 1978, NASA launched the first imaging X-ray telecope, Einstein (HEAO-2), into orbit. Work continued on the Chandra project through the 1980's and 1990's. In 1992, to reduce costs, the spacecraft was redesigned. Four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. Chandra's planned orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one third of the way to the Moon's at its farthest point. This eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair by the space shuttle but put the observatory above the Earth's radiation belts for most of its orbit.<br><br>AXAF was renamed Chandra in 1998 and launched in 1999 by the shuttle Columbia (STS-93). It was the heaviest payload ever launched by the shuttle, a consequence of the Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket system needed to transport the spacecraft to its high orbit.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Chandra_X-ray_telescope_prepared_for_launch.jpg/400px-Chandra_X-ray_telescope_prepared_for_launch.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Chandra_X-ray_telescope_prepared_for_launch.jpg/300px-Chandra_X-ray_telescope_prepared_for_launch.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chandra X-ray Observatory sits inside the payload bay on Space Shuttle Columbia mission STS-93.</span><br><br>Chandra has been returning data since the month after it launched. It is operated by the SAO at the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with assistance from MIT and Northrop Grumman Space Technology. The ACIS CCDs suffered particle damage during early radiation belt passages. To prevent further damage, the instrument is now removed from the telescope's focal plane during passages.<br><br>In 2004 Chandra celebrated its fifth year of operation.<br><br>Issue #154</div>

A faint, slowly moving dot discovered by computer shows clear signs of being a deep Solar System object at least as large as Pluto. The object, designated 2003 UB313, is currently situated nearly 100 times the Earth-Sun distance -- over twice the average Pluto-Sun distance. That far out, the only way a single round object could be as bright as 2003 UB313 would be if it is at least as large as Pluto and completely reflective. Since 2003 UB313 is surely not completely reflective, it could be substantially larger. One of the discovery frames is shown above digitally expanded and artificially brightened. 2003 UB313 was identified initially on frames taken by the automated 1.2-meter Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory in California, USA.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> M.

A newly discovered object, designated 2003 UB313 and located more than twice the distance of Pluto, is expected to be at least as large as Pluto and probably larger, given current measurements. 2003 UB313's dimness and highly tilted orbit (44 degrees) prevented it from being discovered sooner. Many astronomers speculate that numerous other icy objects larger than Pluto likely exist in the Kuiper Belt of the far distant Solar System. If so, and if some are found closer in than 2003 UB313, it may be premature to call 2003 UB313 the tenth planet. Illustrated above is an artist's drawing showing what 2003 UB313 might look. The unusually bright star on the right is the Sun. Much of the world eagerly await the decision by the International Astronomical Union on whether 2003 UB313 will be designated a planet or given a name without subscripts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Illustration; Discovery Credit:</span> M.

Also known as M8, this photogenic nebula is visible even without binoculars towards the constellation of Sagittarius. The energetic processes of star formation create not only the colors but the chaos. The red-glowing gas results from high-energy starlight striking interstellar hydrogen gas. The dark dust filaments that lace M8 were created in the atmospheres of cool giant stars and in the debris from supernovae explosions. This spectacular portion of the Lagoon Nebula was created in scientifically-assigned colors from light emitted in very specific colors by hydrogen, silicon, and oxygen. The light from M8 we see today left about 5,000 years ago. Light takes about 50 years to cross this section of M8.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Michael Sherick</div>

Around 300 million years young M46 contains a few hundred stars in a region about 30 light-years across. Aged 80 million years, M47 is a smaller but looser cluster of about 50 stars spanning 10 light-years. But this portrait of stellar youth also contains an ancient interloper. The small, colorful patch of glowing gas in M46 is actually the planetary nebula NGC 2438 - the final phase in the life of a sun-like star billions of years old. NGC 2438 is estimated to be only 3,000 light-years distant and likely represents a foreground object, only by chance appearing along our line of sight to youthful M46.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Chris Hetlage</div>

From this perspective, the closest, hottest and most massive star in the triple system, a star only a little hotter than the Sun, has set below distant peaks. The two other suns nearing the horizon are both cooler and farther from the large planet.

So, while enjoying the anticipated space weather, astronomer Fred Bruenjes recorded a series of many 30 second long exposures spanning about six hours on the night of August 11/12 using a wide angle lens. Combining those frames which captured meteor flashes, he produced this dramatic view of the Perseids of summer. Although the comet dust particles are traveling parallel to each other, the resulting shower meteors clearly seem to radiate from a single point on the sky in the eponymous constellation Perseus. The radiant effect is due to perspective, as the parallel tracks appear to converge at a distance. Bruenjes notes that there are 51 Perseid meteors in the composite image, including one seen nearly head-on. This year, the Perseids Meteor Shower will peak in the early morning hours on Friday, August 12.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Fred Bruenjes</div>

To achieve this, sensors of unparalleled sensitivity will be used, which in turn requires that the entire spacecraft be particularly cold, and that major sources of IR interference (notably the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon) be blocked. To this end, JWST will be accompanied by a large metalized fanfold sunshield, which will unravel to block infrared radiation from these sources. The telescope's lagrangian orbit (see below) ensures that the Earth and Sun occupy the same relative position in the telescope's view, and thus make the operation of this shield possible.<br><br><strong>Optics</strong><br><br>Although JWST has a planned weight half that of the Hubble, its primary mirror (a 6.5 meter beryllium reflector) is more than 5 times larger. As this diameter is much larger than any current launch vehicle, the mirror is composed of 18 segments, which will unfold after the telescope is launched. Sensitive micromotors and wavefront sensors will position the mirror segments in the correct location, but subsequent to this initial configuration they will only rarely be moved; unlike terrestrial telescopes like the Keck which continually adjust their mirror segments using active optics to overcome the effects of gravitational loading and wind loading.<br><br><strong>Current Status</strong><br><br>Funding difficulties caused partly by the increased cost of JWST and of other NASA missions such as for Mars exploration and potential servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope mean that the JWST mission is likely to be reduced in scope. The proposed descope of the JWST from 6.5m to 4m has been abandoned, but other cost-cutting measures are still on the table.<br><br><strong>Construction &amp; Engineering</strong><br><br>Northrop Grumman Space Technology serves as the primary contractor for the development and integration of the Observatory. They are responsible for developing and building the <span style="font-style: italic;">Spacecraft</span>, which includes both the spacecraft bus and sunshield. Ball Aerospace has been subcontracted to develop and build the <span style="font-style: italic;">Optical Telescope Element</span> (OTE). Goddard Space Flight Center is responsible for providing the <span style="font-style: italic;">Integrated Science Instrument Module</span> (ISIM).<br><br>For the present architecture, the ISIM contains four science instruments. The primary instrument of the Observatory, the NIRcam (<span style="font-style: italic;">Near InfraRed Camera</span>), will be built by a team led by the University of Arizona, with Principal Investigator Dr. Marcia Rieke.

No. Regardless of numerous urban legends circulating, Mars will a relatively normal August. October is the best month to see Mars this year. The red planet is now visible in the morning before sunrise. As Earth catches up to Mars in their respective orbits around the Sun, Mars will keep rising earlier in the night. On 2005 October 30, Earth will have caught up to Mars and the planets will be the nearest to each other in their orbits -- this time around. On October 30, Mars will be nearly opposite to the Sun, rise at sunset, set at sunrise, and appear highest and brightest around midnight. Also on October 30, Mars will appear brighter than it has in the past two years, although still over 10,000 times smaller and fainter than the full Moon. Earth will then pass Mars, and Mars will appear to fade. Pictured above, Mars is shown as it appeared 2003 August 27, when it appeared slightly brighter than it had in nearly 60,000 years. The foreground setting is in the Valley of Fire state park in Nevada, USA. The ellipticity of orbits primarily determines the closeness and brightness of Mars during opposition.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Wally Pacholka (Astropics.com)</div>

Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared wavelengths or frequencies, both the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) strongly. This necessitates lengthy calibrations of all images and will decrease the ability to detect faint objects. Previous space-based satellites (such as IRAS, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite) were operational during the 1980s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.<br><br><strong>Results</strong><br><br>The first images taken by SST were designed to show off the abilities of the telescope and showed a glowing stellar nursery; a swirling, dusty galaxy; a disc of planet-forming debris; and organic material in the distant universe. Since then, monthy press releases have shown off Spitzer's capabilities, as the Hubble Heritage images do for the HST. As one of its most noteworthy observations, in 2005, SST became the first to directly capture the light from extrasolar planets; the "hot Jupiter" planets HD 209458b and TrES-1 respectively. This was the first time extrasolar planets had actually been visually seen, and earlier observations had been indirectly made by drawing conclusions from behaviors of the star the planets were orbiting.The telescope also discovered in April 2005 that Cohen-kuhi Tau/4 had a planetary disk that was vastly younger and contained less mass than previously theorized leading to new understandings of how planets are formed.<br><br>While some time on the telescope is reserved for participating institutions and crucial projects, astronomers around the world also have the opportunity to submit proposals for observing time.

The telescope was trained on a core of gas of dust known as L1014 which had perviously appeared completely dark to ground based observatories and to the ISO (Infrared Space Observatory), predecessor to Spitzer. The advanced technology of Spitzer revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014.<br><br>Scientists from the University of Texas who discovered the object believe the hot spot to be an example of early star development with the young star collecting gas and dust from the cloud around it. Early speculation about the hot spot was that it might have been the faint light of another core that lies 10 times further from Earth but along the same line of sight as L1014. Follow-up observation from ground-based near infrared observatories detected a faint fan-shaped glow in the same location as the object found by Spitzer. That glow is too feeble to have come from the more distant core leading to the conclusion that the object is located within L1014.

The Heart Nebula, officially dubbed IC 1805 and visible above on the right, has a shape reminiscent of a classical heart symbol. Both nebulas, shown above in false color, shine brightly in the light of energized hydrogen. Several young open clusters of stars populate the image and are visible above in and around the nebula centers. Light takes about 6,000 years to reach us from these nebulas, which together span roughly 300 light years.
