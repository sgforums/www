As little as 2,000 years ago, light from a massive stellar explosion in the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC) first reached planet Earth. The LMC is a close galactic neighbor of our Milky Way Galaxy and the rampaging explosion front is now seen moving out - destroying or displacing ambient gas clouds while leaving behind relatively dense knots of gas and dust. What remains is one of the largest supernova remnants in the LMC: N63A. Many of the surviving dense knots have been themselves compressed and may further contract to form new stars. Some of the resulting stars may then explode in a supernova, continuing the cycle. Pictured above is a close-up of one of the largest remaining knots of dust and gas in N63A taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. N63A spans over 25 light years and lies about 150,000 light years away toward the southern constellation of Dorado.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> NASA, ESA, HEIC, and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA);<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acknowledgment:</span> Y.-H.

The observatory is part of the University of Manchester and has played an important role in the research of quasars and pulsars. In 1979, scientists of Jodrell Bank announced the first detection of a gravitational lens; which confirmed one of Einstein's theories.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Jodrell_Bank_Observatory.Lovell_telescope.jpg/539px-Jodrell_Bank_Observatory.Lovell_telescope.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Jodrell_Bank_Observatory.Lovell_telescope.jpg/180px-Jodrell_Bank_Observatory.Lovell_telescope.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The 76m Lovell Telescope at <strong>Jodrell Bank Observatory</strong>.</span><br><br>The observatory was established in 1945 by Dr. Bernard Lovell, who wanted to investigate cosmic rays after his work on radar in World War II. One of the telescopes of the observatory honours his name.<br><br><strong>General information</strong><br><br>The first radio telescope was built in 1947, but the famous "Mark I" telescope, at the time the largest steerable dish radio telescope in the world, 76.2 m (250 ft) in diameter, was constructed in the mid 1950s, becoming operational in the summer of 1957, just in time for the launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. Jodrell Bank was the only installation in the world able to track Sputnik's booster rocket by radar, and the fame and income this brought in enabled the considerable construction debts to be paid off.<br><br>In February 1966, Jodrell Bank tracked the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and listened in on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.<br><br>The Mark I telescope has been updated twice, to allow greater sensitivity and make structural repairs. At the time of its construction in 1957, it was the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope and was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years. It was therefore upgraded in 1970-71 and 2001-2003. In 1987, on its 30th anniversary, the telescope was renamed <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lovell Telescope</span> in Sir Bernard's honour. A second radio telescope, the Mark II, was built at Jodrell Bank in 1964, with a diameter of approximately 25 metres (it's parabolic, not circular), while a third telescope, the Mark III, located some 20 miles away near Nantwich is part of the Jodrell Bank Observatory. Other radio telescopes are also located at the Jodrell Bank Observatory - one which is 42 ft (13 m) in diameter, and a 7 m one which is generally used for undergraduate teaching purposes for students of the University. Webcams of these are available for viewing on the Jodrell Bank webpage.<br><br>Jodrell Bank Observatory is also the base of the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN), a National Facility run by the University of Manchester on behalf of PPARC.<br><br><strong>Visitor facilities</strong><br><br>The much-visited site was planted as an arboretum by Sir Bernard. Jodrell Bank Arboretum houses the UK's national collections of <span style="font-style: italic;">Malus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sorbus</span> species and the Heather Society's Calluna collection, on 35 acres (140,000 mÂ²). The arboretum also features a small scale model of the solar system, the scale being approximately 1:5,000,000,000. In 2005, as part of the <a href="http://www.spacedout-uk.com" rel="nofollow">SpacedOut</a> project, Jodrell Bank became the location of the Sun in a 1:15,000,000 scale model of the solar system covering the UK.<br><br>There is an educational visitors' centre at the site. In 2003 the old science centre was demolished to make way for a new one, expected to open in approximately 2007. In the interim, visitor facilities are very limited. However, visitors have access to a new path wrapping around the telescope, approximately 20 m from the telescope's outer railway.<br><br><strong>Statistics of the Lovell Telescope</strong><br><br>Location:<br>- Latitude 53 deg 14 min 13.2 s north<br>- Longitude 2 deg 18 min 25.74 s west<br><br>Mass of telescope:                       3200 t<br>Mass of bowl:                            1500 t<br>Diameter of bowl:                        76.2 m<br>Surface area of bowl:                    5270 mÂ²<br>Collecting area of bowl:                 4560 mÂ²<br>Height of elevation axis:                50.5 m<br>Maximum height above ground:             89.0 m<br>Radius of wheel girders:                 38.5 m<br>Outer diameter of railway track:        107.5 m<br>Amount of paint for 3 coats of the bowl: 5200 L<br><br>Issue #107</div>

It also features Venus, third brightest celestial object after the Sun and Moon. For casual skygazers, this month marks Venus' return to the evening sky as the brilliant 'star', shining low in the west-northwest shortly after sunset. In the picture, astrophotographer and APOD translator Laurent Laveder notes that Venus is easily mistaken for a light atop a sailboat's tall mast, giving the otherwise stunning celestial beacon an unremarkable appearance. Of course, a year ago Venus' appearance was quite remarkable. On June 8, 2004, Venus crossed the Sun's disk, the first transit of Venus since 1882. Late this week Venus shares the evening sky with the young crescent Moon, and will next transit the Sun on June 6, 2012.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Laurent Laveder (Version franÃ§aise officielle de l'APOD)</div>

Since Titan's surface temperature is around -180 degrees Celsius, 'lava' welling up to form the volcanic mound would be icy indeed - possibly a slurry of methane, ammonia, and water ice combined with other ices and hydrocarbons. The circular feature is roughly thirty kilometers in diameter. If its volcanic nature is confirmed, the discovery of cryovolcanism on Titan could explain the origin of methane in Titan's atmosphere. Before the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn, a popular explanation for replenishing Titan's concentration of atmospheric methane was the presence of an extensive, methane-rich, hydrocarbon sea. But Cassini's instruments and the Huygens surface probe have failed to find such a global ocean.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> VIMS Team, U. Arizona, ESA, NASA</div>

Actually, stars usually create their most artistic displays as they die. In the case of low-mass stars like our Sun and M2-9 pictured above, the stars transform themselves from normal stars to white dwarfs by casting off their outer gaseous envelopes. The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousand of years. M2-9, a butterfly planetary nebula 2,100 light-years away shown in representative colors, has wings that tell a strange but incomplete tale. In the center, two stars orbit inside a gaseous disk 10 times the orbit of Pluto. The expelled envelope of the dying star breaks out from the disk creating the bipolar appearance. Much remains unknown about the physical processes that cause planetary nebulae.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> B. Balick (U.

The Sun, peaking through a clear patch of sky to the left, illuminates some buildings in the foreground. Sunlight reflects off raindrops to form a rainbow. By coincidence, the tornado appears to end right over the rainbow. Streaks in the image are hail being swept about by the high swirling winds. Over 1,000 tornadoes, the most violent type of storm known, occur on Earth every year, many in tornado alley.

The antennae are arrayed along the three arms of a Y-shape (each of which measures 21 km). Using the railroad tracks that follow each of these arms Â– and that, at one point, intersect with U.S. Highway 60 at a level crossing Â– and a specially designed lifting locomotive, the antennae can be physically relocated to a number of prepared positions, allowing aperture synthesis interferometry with a maximum baseline of 36 km: essentially, the array acts like a single antenna with that diameter. The highest angular resolution that can be reached is about 0.05 arcseconds.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Very_Large_Array_dish_detail.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Very_Large_Array_dish_detail.jpg/300px-Very_Large_Array_dish_detail.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Detail of one dish.</span><br><br>There are four commonly used configurations, designated A (the largest) through D (the tightest, when all the dishes are within 600 m of the center point). The observatory normally cycles through all the various possible configurations (including several hybrids) every 16 months: in other words, once the massive efforts needed to move two dozen 230-ton highly sensitive scientific instruments have been made, the antennae are not moved again for a period of three to four months.<br><br>The VLA site also currently serves as the control center for the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), a VLBI array of ten 25-meter dishes located from Hawaii in the west to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the east that constitutes the world's largest dedicated, full-time astronomical instrument.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ca/USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.01.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ca/USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.01.jpg/300px-USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.01.jpg"></a><br><br><strong>Past and future</strong><br><br>Congressional approval for the VLA project was given in August 1972, and construction began some six months later.

The upgrade would enhance the instrument's sensitivity, frequency range, and resolution, and would entail installing new hardware at the San Agustin site and the construction and installation of up to eight additional dishes in other parts of the state of New Mexico, up to 300 km away, connected to the hub via fiber-optic links.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Vla_maintenance.jpg/800px-Vla_maintenance.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Vla_maintenance.jpg/225px-Vla_maintenance.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Maintanance barn at the very large array.

In continuing efforts to answer this question, astronomers have now discovered an Earth-like planet orbiting a distant normal star. Previously over 150 gas-giant planets like Jupiter had been so discovered. Slight, fast, but regular wobbles of nearby small M-dwarf star Gliese 876 showed evidence for a planet with a likely mass slightly higher than a minimum six times the mass of Earth. The planet's small mass indicates that it is likely terrestrial in nature, similar in composition to the inner planets of our Solar System. If indeed made predominantly of rock, the planet's surface gravity would not even be able to contain the gasses of a Jupiter-like planet. The newly discovered planet would not make a good vacation spot for humans, however, as it orbits so close that the surface temperature probably tops a searing 200 degrees Celsius. The system is illustrated in the above drawing as seen from a hypothetical moon orbiting one of the two Jupiter-like planets already known. The newly discovered terrestrial-like planet is depicted in the insert. Gliese 876 lies only 15 light-years away and is visible with binoculars toward the constellation of Aquarius.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Illustration Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Lynette Cook (spaceart.org);<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery Credit:</span> E.

Two images of the nearby supernova remnant taken a year apart in infrared light appear to show outward motions at tremendous speeds. This was unexpected since the supernova that created the picturesque nebula was seen 325 years ago. The reason is likely light echoes. Light from the supernova heated up distant ambient dust that is just beginning to show its glow. As time goes by, more distant dust lights up, giving the appearance of outward motion. The above image is a composite of X-ray, optical, and infrared light exposures that have been digitally combined. The infrared light image was taken by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope and was used in the discovery of the light echo.

In a decade of editing the APOD web pages, the industrious Robert Nemiroff (left) and persistent Jerry Bonnell (right) have enjoyed exploring compelling images of the cosmos that are not limited to those taken from earth orbit, much less to those taken by professional astronomers. In fact, seen in this recently released Vermeer, the editors are extremely grateful for the continued large volume of gracious e-mail and APOD submissions. Today, they would like to offer a sincere <span style="font-style: italic;">thank you</span> to all. And while these APOD editors are definitely not getting any younger, tomorrow's picture may actually be ...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apologies to:</span> Vermeer's Astronomer and Geographer<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Image Composite:</span> Richard Taillet (Univ. de Savoie, LAPTH, LPNHE)</div>

The observatory is built out of 362 pieces of cut granite which represent the 362 days of the lunar year. As can be seen from the photograph, it has 27 circular layers of stones (Queen Seondeok was the 27th ruler of the Silla Dynasty) surmounted by a square structure. 12 of the layers are below the window level and 12 are above. There are 12 large base stones set in a square, with three stones on each side. These sets of 12 may symbolize the months of the year.<br><br>The tower is 5.7 meters wide at the base and 9.4 meters tall, and filled with dirt up to the level of the window. Its construction style parallels that used at the Bunhwangsa Temple in Gyeongju and was likely a product of contact with the Tang Dynasty of China, with which Queen Seondeok allied her country.<br><br>Cheomseongdae is the oldest surviving observatory in its geographic region. It has been designated by the South Korean government as the country's 31st national treasure since December 20th, 1968.<br><br>Issue #115</div>

As a result, two celestial wonders easily visible for southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the Clouds of Magellan. These cosmic clouds are now understood to be dwarf irregular galaxies, satellites of our larger spiral Milky Way Galaxy. The Small Magellanic Cloud pictured above actually spans 15,000 light-years or so and contains several hundred million stars. About 210,000 light-years distant in the constellation Tucana, it is the forth closest of the Milky Way's known satellite galaxies, after the Canis Major and Sagittarius Dwarf galaxies and the Large Magellanic Cloud. This gorgeous view also includes two foreground globular, star clusters NGC 362 (top left) and 47 Tucanae. Spectacular 47 Tucanae is a mere 13,000 light-years away and seen here to the right of the Small Magellanic Cloud.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Josch Hambsch, Robert Gendler</div>

Both the building and dome, made by Warner and Swasey Co, are double walled.<br><br>The mirror weighs 1,960 pounds and was made by the St. Gobain in their Charleroi glass works in Antwerp, Belgium and shipped only a week before the start of World War I. It was then ground in the United States at the John A. Brashear company in Pittsburg. The mirror had to be reground twice, once due to a mysterious scratch and the 2nd time due to a flaw in the grinding. This added 2 years to the completion time of the telescope, pushing the date back to 1918.

From top left to bottom right are the lovely but distant galaxies M61, NGC 4449, NGC 4725, NGC 5068, NGC 5247, and NGC 5775/5774. Most are spiral galaxies more or less like our own Milky Way. The color images reveal distinct pink patches marking the glowing hydrogen gas clouds in star forming regions along the graceful spiral arms. While Virgo cluster galaxy M61 is perhaps the most striking of these spirals, the interesting galaxy pair NGC 5775/5774 neatly contrasts the characteristic spiral edge-on and face-on appearance. The one exception to this parade of photogenic spiral galaxies is the small and relatively close irregular galaxy NGC 4449 (top middle). Similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud, companion galaxy to the Milky Way, NGC 4449 also sports young blue star clusters and pink star forming regions. All the galaxies in this gallery were imaged with a small (16 inch diameter) reflecting telescope and digital camera by public participants in the Kitt Peak National Observatory Visitor Center's Advanced Observing Program.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Courtesy Adam Block (KPNO Visitor Program), NOAO, NSF</div>

As the Earth rotates to eclipse the Sun, sunset rises up from the ground. Therefore, at sunset on the ground, sunlight still shines on clouds above. Under usual circumstances, a pretty sunset might be visible, but unusual noctilucent clouds float so high up they can be seen well after dark. Pictured above, a network of noctilucent clouds casts a colorful but eerie glow visible above the dark. Although noctilucent clouds are thought to be composed of small ice-coated particles, much remains unknown about them. Recent evidence indicates that at least some noctilucent clouds result from freezing water exhaust from Space Shuttles.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Pekka Parviainen (Polar Image)</div>
