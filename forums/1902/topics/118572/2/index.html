Though sometimes difficult to discern, such as in flocculent spirals, these arms distinguish spiral galaxies from their lenticular counterparts, which exhibit a disk structure but no evident spiral.<br><br>The disks of spiral galaxies tend to be surrounded by large spheroid halos of Population II stars, many of which are concentrated in globular clusters that orbit the galactic center.<br><br>Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is a spiral, with a Hubble sequence classification of Sbc (possibly SBb).<br><br><strong>Origin of the spiral structure</strong><br><br>The early pioneer of studies on the formation of the spiral arms was Bertil Lindblad. He realised that the idea of stars arranged permanently in a spiral shape was untenable due to the "winding dilemma". Since the speed of rotation of the galactic disk varies with distance from the centre of the galaxy, a radial arm (like a spoke) would quickly become curved as the galaxy rotates. The arm would, after a few galactic rotations, become increasingly curved and wind around the galaxy ever tighter. This is not what is observed.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Spiral_galaxy_arms_diagram.png/800px-Spiral_galaxy_arms_diagram.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Spiral_galaxy_arms_diagram.png/180px-Spiral_galaxy_arms_diagram.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Diagram of orbits that form the appearance of spiral arms</span><br><br>The first acceptable theory was devised by C. C. Lin and Frank Shu in 1964. They suggested that the spiral arms were manifestations of spiral density waves. They assumed that the stars travel in slightly elliptical orbits and that the orientations of their orbits is correlated i.e. the ellipses vary in their orientation (one to another) in a smooth way with increasing distance from the galactic centre. This is illustrated in the diagram. It is clear that the elliptical orbits come close together in certain areas to give the effect of arms. Stars therefore do not remain forever in the position that we now see them in, but pass through the arms as they travel in their orbits.<br><br>Issue #10</div>

Over 20,000 light-years long and similar to the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 1427A is speeding through the Fornax cluster's intergalactic gas at around 600 kilometers per second.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Galaxy</strong></span><br><br>A <strong>galaxy</strong> is a large gravitationally bound system of stars, interstellar gas and dust, unseen dark matter, and possibly dark energy. Typical galaxies contain 10 million to one trillion (10^7 to 10^12) or more stars, all orbiting a common center of gravity. In addition to single stars and a tenuous interstellar medium, most galaxies contain a large number of multiple star systems and star clusters as well as various types of nebulae. Most galaxies are several thousand to several hundred thousand light years in diameter and are usually separated from one another by distances on the order of millions of light years.<br><br>Although so called dark matter and dark energy appear to account for well over 90% of the mass of most galaxies, the nature of these unseen components is not well understood.

A slightly more extensive description of galaxy types is given by the Hubble sequence. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, sometimes simply called the Galaxy (with uppercase), is a large barred spiral galaxy about 30 kiloparsecs or 100,000 light years in diameter and 3,000 light years in width, contains about 300 billion stars and has a total mass of about a trillion times the mass of the Sun.<br><br>In spiral galaxies, the spiral arms have the shape of approximate logarithmic spirals, a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars.<br><br>Like the stars, the spiral arms also rotate around the center, but they do so with constant angular velocity. That means that stars pass in and out of spiral arms. The spiral arms are thought to be areas of high density or density waves. As stars move into an arm, they slow down, thus creating a higher density; this is akin to a "wave" of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars. The arms are visible because the high density facilitates star formation and they therefore harbor many bright and young stars.<br><br>A new type of galaxy, Ultra Compact Dwarf Galaxies was discovered in 2003 by Dr Michael Drinkwater of the University of Queensland et al.<br><br><strong>Larger scale structures</strong><br><br>The space between galaxies is relatively empty, except for intergalactic gas clouds.<br><br>Only few galaxies exist by themselves; these are known as field galaxies. Most galaxies are gravitationally bound to a number of other galaxies. Structures containing up to about 50 galaxies are called groups of galaxies, and larger structures containing many thousands of galaxies packed into an area a few megaparsecs across are called clusters. Superclusters are giant collections containing tens of thousands of galaxies, found in clusters, groups and sometimes individually; as far as we can tell the universe is uniform at scales above this.<br><br>Our galaxy is a member of the Local Group, and together with the Andromeda Galaxy dominates it; overall the Local Group contains about 30 galaxies in a space about one megaparsec across. The Local Group is part of the Local Supercluster, also known as the Virgo Supercluster.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>In 1610, Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky Way and discovered that it was composed of a huge number of faint stars. In a treatise in 1755, Immanuel Kant, drawing on earlier work by Thomas Wright, speculated (correctly) that the galaxy might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars, held together by gravitational forces akin to the solar system but on much larger scales. The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. Kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate galaxies.<br><br>Towards the end of the 18th century, Charles Messier compiled a catalog containing the 109 brightest nebulae, later followed by a catalog of 5,000 nebulae assembled by William Herschel. In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture. However, the nebulae were not universally accepted as distant separate galaxies until the matter was settled by Edwin Hubble in the early 1920s using a new telescope. He was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant to be part of the Milky Way. In 1936, Hubble produced a classification system for galaxies that is used to this day, the Hubble sequence.<br><br>The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun within it was carried out by William Herschel in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter ~15 kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloging of globular clusters lead to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter ~70 kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the center. Both analyses failed to take into account the absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane; once Robert Julius Trumpler had quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters, the present picture of our galaxy as described above emerged.<br><br>In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst predicted microwave radiation at a wave length of 21 centimetres, resulting from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; this radiation was observed in 1951. This radiation allowed for much improved study of the Galaxy, since it is not affected by dust absorption and its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in the Galaxy. These observations led to the postulation of a rotating bar structure in the center of the Galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies. In the 1970s it was realized that the total visible mass of galaxies (from stars and gas) does not properly account for the speed of the rotating gas, thus leading to the postulation of dark matter.<br><br>Beginning in the 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope yielded improved observations. Among other things, it established that the missing dark matter in our galaxy cannot solely consist of inherently faint and small stars. It photographed the Hubble Deep Field, providing evidence for hundreds of billions of galaxies in existence in the visible universe alone.<br><br>In 2004, the galaxy Abell 1835 IR1916 became the most distant galaxy ever seen by humans.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Pr3_400galaxypix.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d7/Pr3_400galaxypix.jpg/225px-Pr3_400galaxypix.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Galaxy Abell 1835 IR1916 is seen as a tiny dot in this photo of distant galaxies. </span><br><br>Issue #12</div>

This detailed close-up of the full Moon features two prominent ray craters, Copernicus (upper left) and Tycho (lower right), each with extensive ray systems of light colored debris blasted out by the crater-forming impacts. In general, ray craters are relatively young as their rays overlay the lunar terrain. In fact, at 85 kilometers wide, Tycho, with its far reaching rays, is the youngest large crater on the nearside.

It is also simply known as <strong>the Galaxy</strong>, as our Solar System is a part of it. The Milky Way appears brightest in the direction of Sagittarius, where the galactic center lies. Relative to the celestial equator, the Milky Way passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux. This reflects the fact that the Earth's equatorial plane is highly inclined to the galactic plane, as is the Sun's equator and the ecliptic (the plane in which the Earth and the other significant planets orbit the Sun). The galactic pole lies at right ascension 12 h 51,42 m, declination 27Â° 7,8' (epoch 2000.0; this is a conventional value adopted by the IAU in 1959). The fact that the Milky Way divides our night sky into two roughly equal hemispheres reflects the fact that the solar system lies close to the galactic plane.<br><br><strong>Structure</strong><br><br>The Milky Way galaxy is a large spiral galaxy of Hubble type SBbc (loosely wound barred spiral) with a total mass of about 10^12 solar masses, comprising 200-400 billion stars. The galactic disk has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years. The distance from the Sun to the galactic center is about 27,700 light-years.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/Milky.way.arp.300pix.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/250px-Milky.way.arp.300pix.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The approximate shape of the <strong>Milky Way</strong> Galaxy and the position within it of our solar system.</span><br><br>The stars in the Galaxy's disk rotate around the Galaxy's center, which is suspected to harbour a supermassive black hole. Sagittarius A* is thought to be the most plausible candidate for the location of this supermassive black hole. It takes the solar system about 226 million years to complete one orbit ("galactic year"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>), and so has completed about 25 orbits during its lifetime. The orbital speed is 217 km/s, i.e. 1 light-year in ca. 1400 years, and 1 AU in 8 days. The orbital speed of stars in the Milky Way does not depend much on the distance to the center: it is always between 200 and 250 km/s for the Sun's neighbours. Hence the orbital period is approximately proportional to the distance from the star to the Galaxy's center (without the power 1.5 which applies in the case of a central mass). The disk has a bulge at the center.<br><br>There are believed to be four major spiral arms and at least two smaller ones which all start at the Galaxy's center. These are named as follows, counting outwards from the centre along a radius through our solar system:<br><br>- Norma Arm, or 3 kpc Arm<br>- Scutum-Crux or Centaurus Arm<br>- Sagittarius or Sagittarius-Carina Arm<br>- Orion or Local Arm - labeled "0"; a minor spiral arm. The Earth's solar system may be found close to the inner rim of the Local Arm, in the Local Fluff, 8.0Â±0.5 kpc from the galactic center.<br>- Perseus Arm<br>- Cygnus or Outer Arm<br><br>The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the Perseus Arm, is about 6,500 light-years. Each spiral arm describes a logarithmic spiral (as do the arms of all spiral galaxies) with a pitch of approximately 12 degrees.<br><br>The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of old stars and globular clusters.

(The team consisted of Luca Pasquini, Piercarlo Bonifacio, Sofia Randich, Daniele Galli, and Raffaele G. Gratton.) The team used the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope to measure, for the first time, the Beryllium content in two stars in Globular Cluster NGC 6397. This allowed them to deduce the time elapsed between the rise of first generation of stars in the entire Galaxy and the first generation of stars in the Globular Cluster, at 200 million to 300 million years. They added that estimate to an estimated age of the stars in the Globular Cluster: 13,400 Â± 800 million years. The sum is their estimated age of the Milky Way Galaxy: 13,600 Â± 800 million years.<br><br><strong>The galactic neighborhood</strong><br><br>The Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy are the major members of the Local Group, a group of some 35 closely bound galaxies; The Local Group is part of the Virgo Supercluster.<br><br>The Milky Way is orbited by a number of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. The largest of these is the Large Magellanic Cloud with a diameter of 20,000 light years. The smallest, Carina Dwarf, Draco Dwarf, and Leo II are only 500 light years in diameter. The other dwarfs orbiting our galaxy are the Small Magellanic Cloud; Canis Major Dwarf, the closest; Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, previously thought to be the closest; Ursa Minor Dwarf; Sculptor Dwarf, Sextans Dwarf, Fornax Dwarf, and Leo I.<br><br><strong>Mythology</strong><br><br>There are numerous legends in many traditions around the world regarding the creation of the Milky Way. In particular, there are two similar ancient Greek stories, that explain the etymology of the name <span style="font-style: italic;">Galaxias</span> and its association with milk. One legend describes the Milky Way as a smear of milk, created when the baby Herakles suckled from the goddess Hera. When Hera realized that the suckling infant was not her own but the illegitimate son of Zeus and another woman, she pushed it away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way.<br><br>Another story tells that the milk came from the goddess Rhea, the wife of Cronus, and the suckling infant was Zeus himself. Cronus swallowed his children to ensure his position as head of the Pantheon and sky god, and so Rhea conceived a plan to save her newborn son Zeus: She wrapped a stone in infant's clothes and gave it to Cronus to swallow. Cronus asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed it, and the milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way.<br><br>Older mythology associates the constellation with a herd of dairy cows/cattle, whose milk gives the blue glow, and where each cow is a star. As such, it is intimately associated with legends concerning the constellation of Gemini, which it is in contact with. Firstly, with Gemini, it may form the origin of the myth of Castor and Polydeuces, concerning cattle raiding. Secondly, again with Gemini, but also with other features of the Zodiac sign of Gemini (i.e. Canis Major, Orion, Auriga, and the deserted area now regarded as Camelopardalis), it may form the origin of the myth of the Cattle of Geryon, one of The Twelve Labours of Herakles.<br><br>Issue #13</div>

This week might be a good time. Because Mercury orbits so close to the Sun, it never wanders far from the Sun in Earth's sky. If trailing the Sun, Mercury will be visible low on the horizon for only a short while after sunset. If leading the Sun, Mercury will be visible only shortly before sunrise. So at certain times of the year an informed skygazer with a little determination can usually pick Mercury out from a site with an clear horizon. Above, a lot of determination has been combined with a little digital trickery to show Mercury's successive positions during March of 2004. Each picture was taken from the same location in Leeds, England exactly 33 minutes after sunset. Over the next two weeks, Mercury will again be well placed for viewing above the western horizon at sunset, but by the third week in March it will have faded and dropped into the twilight.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Tony Cook</div>

Globular clusters are fairly numerous; there are about 150 currently known globulars of the Milky Way (with perhaps 10-20 more undiscovered), and larger galaxies like Andromeda have more (Andromeda may have as many as 500). Some giant elliptical galaxies (e.g., M87) may have as many as 10 thousand globular clusters. These globular clusters orbit the galaxy out to large radii, 100 kiloparsecs or more.<br><br>With a few notable exceptions, each globular cluster appears to have a definite age. That is, all the stars in the cluster formed at virtually the same time. It was the recognition of this fact, studying Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams of globulars, that led to the earliest understanding of stellar evolution.<br><br>Some globular clusters (like Omega Centauri in our Milky Way, and G1 in M31) are truly massive clusters, with several million times the mass of our Sun. Such globular clusters may be the former nuclei of galaxies that once orbited their host galaxy, but were totally engulfed and tidally stripped of their stars save for the dense nucleus. However, most globular clusters are much smaller, having on the order of a few hundred thousand stars.<br><br>In many galaxies (especially massive elliptical galaxies) there appear to be two populations of globular clusers, which appear to be of similar ages (nearly as old as the universe itself) but of different metal abundances. These subpopulations are generally known as "metal-poor" and "metal-rich", although the metallicities of the metal-rich clusters are generally less than that of the Sun. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain these subpopulations, including violent gas-rich galaxy mergers, the accretion of dwarf galaxies, and multiple phases of star formation in a single galaxy. In our Milky Way, the metal-poor clusters are associated with the halo and the metal-rich clusters with the Bulge.<br><br>It was through the study of globular clusters that the Sun's position in the Milky Way galaxy became known. Until the 1930s, it was thought that the Sun was near the middle of the galaxy because the distribution of stars in the observable Milky Way appeared uniform. However, the distribution of globular clusters was strongly asymmetric. Assuming a roughly spherical distribution of globular clusters around the galaxy's center, one can estimate the direction from the Sun to the galactic center. By further estimating the distances to the clusters, the distance of the Sun to the galactic center can be estimated as well. It thus became clear that the part of the Milky Way seen from Earth was only a small part of the total galaxy, most of which was obscured by gas and dust.<br><br>Although most globular clusters are very old, some young clusters appear to form in a variety of star-forming events at the present day. These include major spiral-spiral galaxy mergers, starbursts in dwarf galaxies, and even in quiescent disk galaxies.<br><br>Globular clusters have a very high star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars do sometimes occur. Some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries are much more common in globulars.<br><br>Issue #16<br></div>

In the above case, however, there are actually millions of lenses: ice crystals. As water freezes in the upper atmosphere, small, flat, six-sided, ice crystals might be formed. As these crystals flutter to the ground, much time is spent with their faces flat, parallel to the ground. An observer may pass through the same plane as many of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset. During this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens, refracting sunlight into our view. The above image was taken near sunset last month Winter Solstice near Nashville, Tennessee, USA.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Open cluster</strong></span><br><br>An <strong>open cluster</strong> is a group of stars (star cluster) that were born at the same time from a molecular cloud, and are still near to each other. They are also called galactic clusters since they exist within the galaxy's disk.<br><br>Open clusters are usually young (in astronomical terms), and so contain many hot and luminous stars. This makes open clusters visible from large distances and one of the preferred objects by amateur astronomers. The "parent" molecular cloud is sometimes still associated with the cluster, which illuminates parts of the cloud that are then visible as one or more nebulae.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Pleiades_large.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/Pleiades_large.jpg/250px-Pleiades_large.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Pleiades is one of the most famous <strong>open clusters</strong>.</span><br><br>All the stars in an open cluster are more or less the same age and have the same chemical composition, so any difference between them is solely due to their mass. Most open clusters are dominated by their O-type and B-type giant blue stars, which are very luminous but short-lived. An analysis of the light from an open cluster can lead to an estimation of its age by looking at the ratio between blue, yellow and red stars; the more blue stars there are, the younger the cluster is. The uniformity of a cluster's stars makes them a perfect test for stellar evolution models, because when comparing one star to another, most of the variable parameters are now fixed. Testing the model is therefore easier.<br><br>The closest open cluster is in Ursa Major, or to be more correct, it is Ursa Major. Most of the stars in this famous constellation are members of an old and mostly dispersed open cluster. Sirius is a former member of this cluster and our sun is in the outskirts of what is called The Ursa Major Stream, a group of stars that are all ex-members of the Ursa Major Cluster spanning over a thousand light years in space. Our Sun is not a member, however; it is just passing through. Considering its location in the galaxy, our Sun has a very strange velocity; it probably had a close encounter with another star a few billion years ago which gravitationally accelerated the Sun and the solar system.<br><br>Stars inside an open cluster are at first tighly packed, moving at the same speed around the center of the Galaxy. Every half-billion years or so, a classic open cluster such as the Pleiades or the Hyades (both in Taurus) tends to be disturbed by external factors (such as molecular clouds passing by), setting its stars moving at slightly different speeds and so causing them to drift apart exactly like the ones in Ursa Major have done. When this happens, the cluster becomes a stream of stars, not close enough to be a cluster but all related and moving in very similar directions at similar speeds.<br><br>After a billion or so years, the cluster is totally lost. Some stars will be on the far side of the galaxy, some on the near side. The sun's original cluster met the same fate; there is no way to tell which are former members and which just happened to have been created at the same time but in a different location.<br><br>The exact timeline of this evolution is believed to vary according to the cluster's initial density: more tighly packed clusters will survive for longer, but no known cluster has lasted more than a few billion years.<br><br>Issue #17</div>

Our own Sun also lies within the Milky Way's Orion Arm, only about 1,500 light-years from the California Nebula. Also known as NGC 1499, the classic emission nebula is around 100 light-years long. It glows with the red light characteristic of hydrogen atoms recombining with long lost electrons, stripped away (ionized) by energetic starlight. In this case, the star most likely providing the energetic starlight is the bright, hot, bluish Xi Persei, just right of the nebula and above picture center. Fittingly, this composite picture was made with images from a telescope in California - the 48-inch (1.2-meter) Samuel Oschin Telescope - taken as a part of the second National Geographic Palomar Observatory Sky Survey.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Caltech, Palomar Observatory, Digitized Sky Survey<br>Courtesy Scott Kardel</div>

This extinction is caused by refraction and absorption of photons in certain wavelengths.<br><br>For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic hydrogen lies at ca. 121.5 nm, the Lyman-alpha transition. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star, because most of it is absorbed during the trip to Earth by Lyman-alpha absorption.<br><br>The interstellar medium is usually divided into three phases, depending on the temperature of the gas: hot (millions of kelvins), warm (thousands of kelvins), and cold (tens of kelvins).

The graceful spiral structure seen in this computer visualization does not portray winding spiral arms in a distant galaxy of stars. Instead, the graphic shows spiral shock waves in a three dimensional simulation of an accretion disk -- material swirling onto a compact central object that could represent a white dwarf star, neutron star, or black hole. Such accretion disks power bright x-ray sources within our own galaxy. They form in binary star systems which consist of a donor star (not shown above), supplying the accreting material, and a compact object whose strong gravity ultimately draws the material towards its surface. For known x-ray binary systems the size of the accretion disk itself might fall somewhere between the diameter of the Sun (about 1,400,000 kilometers) and the diameter of the Moon's orbit (800,000 kilometers). One interesting result of the virtual reality astrophysics illustrated here is that the simulated disk develops instabilities which tend to smear out the pronounced spiral shocks.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Michael Owen, John Blondin (North Carolina State Univ.)</div>

The most commonly accepted theory of these type of supernovae is that they are the result of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting matter from a nearby companion star, typically a red giant, until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit. The increase in pressure raises the temperature near the center, and a period of convection, lasting ~100 years begins. At some point in this simmering phase, a fusion flame is born, although the details of the ignition---the location and number of points where the flame begins---is still unknown. This flame accelerates dramatically, through the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate as to whether this flame transitions into a detonation. The energy release from the thermonuclear burning (~10^44 joules) causes the star to explode violently and to release a shock wave in which matter is typically ejected at speeds on the order of 10,000 km/s. The energy released in the explosion also causes an extreme increase in luminosity.<br><br>The theory of these type of supernovae is similar to that of novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does not reach the Chandrasekhar limit. In the case of a nova, the infalling matter causes a fusion reaction of material near its surface but does not cause the star to collapse.<br><br>Type Ia supernovae have a characteristic light curve (graph of luminosity as a function of time after the explosion). Near the time of maximum luminosity, the spectrum contains lines of intermediate-mass elements from oxygen to calcium; these are the main constituents of the outer layers of the star. Months after the explosion, when the outer layers have expanded to the point of transparency, the spectrum is dominated by light emitted by material near the core of the star: heavy elements synthesized during the explosion, most prominently iron-group elements. The radioactive decay of Nickel-56 through Cobalt-56 to Iron-56 produces high-energy photons which dominate the energy output of the ejecta at intermediate to late times.<br><br>Unlike the other types of supernove, Type Ia supernovae are generally found in all types of galaxies, including ellipticals. They show no preference for regions of current star formation.<br><br>The similarity in the shapes of the luminosity profiles of all known Type Ia supernovae has led to their use as a standard candle in extragalactic astronomy. The cause of this similarity in the luminosity curve is still an open question mark. In the late 1990s, observations of type Ia supernovae produced the unexpected result that the universe seems to undergo an accelerating expansion.<br><br>The Type Ia supernova releases the highest amounts of energy amongst all known classifications of supernovae.

These events, like supernovae of Type II, are probably massive stars running out of fuel at their centers; however, the progenitors of Types Ib and Ic have lost most of their envelopes due to strong stellar winds or interaction with a companion. Type Ib supernovae are thought to be the result of a Wolf-Rayet star collapsing.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Type II</span><br><br>Stars far more massive than our sun evolve in far more complex fashions. In the core of our sun, 589 teragrams of hydrogen fuse into 584 teragrams of helium every second, the extra 4.3 teragrams of mass converted into pure energy which then radiates outwards. The helium produced in the core accumulates there since temperatures in the core are not yet high enough to cause it to fuse. Eventually, as the hydrogen at the core is exhausted, having been either fused to helium or progressively diluted by the ongoing build-up of helium "ash", fusion begins to slow down and gravity begins to cause the core to contract. This contraction spikes the temperature high enough to initiate a shorter phase of helium burning, this accounts for less than 10% of the star's total lifetime. In stars with less than about 10 solar masses, the carbon produced by helium fusion does not ignite, and the star gradually cools to being a "white dwarf". White dwarf stars can become Type I supernovae as described above.<br><br>A much larger star, however, has the kind of gravity needed to create temperatures and pressures sufficient to cause the carbon in the core to begin to fuse once the star contracts. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, sinking down on a layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, with the helium sinking down into a layer of helium fusing into carbon, with the carbon sinking down to fuse into ever heavier elements. These stars go through progressive stages where the core will shrink, built-up atomic nuclei which were previously unfusable begin to fuse, and the core springs back into equilibrium with gravity. This causes them to be irregular variablesÂ—as each new burst of fusion pushes elements out of the fusing core into what is called the "stellar envelope", and dims the star, causing gravity to pull mass back into the fusing core and begin the cycle over again.<br><br>The limiting factor in this process is the amount of energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy of these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively and progressively heavier nuclei, which is also more and more tightly bound by the strong force, this means it releases less energy per fusion reaction than lighter elements fusing.<br><br>The most tightly bound of all nuclei is iron, chemical symbol Fe. It represents the "bottom of the hill" for lighter elements to fuse, and for heavier elements to fission. Lighter elements release energy when they fuse and heavier elements release energy when they fission. As iron "ash" begins to accumulate in the core of the star, gravity pulls more and more mass into the area of fusion, which, in turn, goes through all of the steps of fusion: Hydrogen to helium by the Proton chain, helium to carbon by the triple-alpha process, carbon and helium combine into oxygen, oxygen fuses into neon, neon into magnesium, magnesium into silicon and silicon into iron.<br><br>The iron (Fe) core is under huge gravitational pressure, and since there is no fusion and cannot be supported by ordinary gas pressure, it is supported by electron degeneracy pressure, the electrons pushing against other electrons. If it builds up to the Chandrasekhar limit at which electron degeneracy pressure cannot sustain it, the iron core begins to collapse. The collapsing core produces high energy gamma rays, which decompose some iron nuclei into 13 He plus 4 neutrons, a process known as photodisassociation. However, no nuclear reaction of an iron nucleus can create energy; it can only absorb it. Thus, where reactions in the core have for millions of years been radiating energy outward, balancing the star against gravity, they suddenly begin sucking energy inwards, joining hands with gravity to cause the core, a massive structure the size of our sun, to collapse within a fraction of a second.<br><br>Issue #20</div>

This combination, a process called "electron capture", creates a neutron and releases a neutrino. The neutrinos escape from the core, carrying away energy and further accelerating the collapse, which proceeds in milliseconds as the core detaches from the outer layers of the star and reaches the density of nuclear matter, where the neutrons press against each other and the entire core is the density of an atomic nucleus. This is the core collapse. At this point neutron degeneracy pressure is sufficient to balance gravity; however the core has actually overshot the equilibrium point and undergoes a slight bounce, creating a shock wave which slams into the collapsing outer layers of the star. A "proto-neutron star" begins to form at the core, though if it is massive enough, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole.<br><br>Currently it is not understood how this shock wave completes the process of pressuring the outer layer of the star. This is the "supernova problem", and various models suggest different ways that the huge amounts of energy present are formed into a single explosion. One such model is the convective overturnmodel, which suggests that convection, either from neutrinos from below, or infalling matter from above, completes the process of destroying the progenitor star. Heavier elements than iron are formed during this explosion by neutron capture, and from the pressure of the neutrinos pressing into the boundary of the "neutrinosphere<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>", seeding the surrounding space with a cloud of gas and dust which is richer in heavy elements than the one the star originally formed from.<br><br>Neutrino physics, which is not well understood, is crucial to the understanding of this process, since half of the energy of the core collapse is radiated out in the form of neutrinos. The other crucial area of investigation is the "hydrology" of the plasma that makes up the dying star, how it behaves during the core collapse determines when and how the "shock wave" forms and when and how it "stalls" and is re-energized.<br><br>The remaining core of the star may become a neutron star or a black hole, depending on its mass, although because the processes of supernova collapse are poorly understood, it is unknown what the cutoff mass is.<br><br>Type II supernovae can be further classified based on the shape of their light curves into Type II-P and Type II-L. Type II-P reach a "plateau" in their light curve while II-Ls have a "linear" decrease in their light curve ("linear" in magnitude versus time, or exponential in luminosity versus time). This is believed to result from differences in the envelope of the stars. II-Ps have a large hydrogen envelope that traps energy released in the form of gamma rays and releases it slowly, while II-Ls are believed to have much smaller envelopes converting less of the gamma ray energy into visible light.<br><br>One can also sub-divide supernovae of Type II based on their spectra. While most Type II supernova show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of km/s, some have relatively narrow features which may be produced by the interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material; these are called Type IIn, where the "n" stands for "narrow".<br><br>A few supernovae, such as SN 1987K and 1993J, appear to change types: they show lines of hydrogen at early times, but, over a period of weeks to months, become dominated by lines of helium. The term "Type IIb" is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with Types II and Ib. These are likely massive stars which have lost most, but not all, of their hydrogen envelopes. As the ejecta expand, the hydrogen layer quickly becomes optically thin and reveals the deeper layers.<br><br>Some exceptionally large stars may instead produce a "hypernova" when they die, a theoretical type of explosion. In the hypernova mechanism, the core of a very massive star collapses directly into a black hole and two extremely energetic jets of plasma are emitted from its rotational poles at nearly light speed. These jets emit intense gamma rays, and are one of many candidate explanations for gamma ray bursts.<br><br><strong>Naming of Supernovae</strong><br><br>Supernova discoveries are reported to the International Astronomical Union's <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/cbat.html" rel="nofollow">Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams</a>, which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to it.

The above message was broadcast from Earth towards the globular star cluster M13 in 1974. During the dedication of the Arecibo Observatory - still the largest radio telescope in the world - a string of 1's and 0's representing the above diagram was sent. This attempt at extraterrestrial communication was mostly ceremonial - humanity regularly broadcasts radio and television signals out into space accidentally. Even were this message received, M13 is so far away we would have to wait almost 50,000 years to hear an answer. The above message gives a few simple facts about humanity and its knowledge: from left to right are numbers from one to ten, atoms including hydrogen and carbon, some interesting molecules, DNA, a human with description, basics of our Solar System, and basics of the sending telescope. Several searches for extraterrestrial intelligence are currently underway, including one where you can use your own home computer.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Frank Drake (UCSC) et al., Arecibo Observatory (Cornell, NAIC)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Quasar</strong></span><br><br>A <strong>quasar</strong> (from <span style="font-style: italic;">quasi-stellar radio source</span>) is an astronomical object that looks like a star in optical telescopes (i.e. it is a point source), and has a very high redshift. The general consensus is that this high redshift is cosmological, the result of Hubble's law, which implies that quasars must be very distant and must emit more energy than dozens of normal galaxies.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/QuasarStarburst.jpg/600px-QuasarStarburst.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/21/QuasarStarburst.jpg/180px-QuasarStarburst.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This view, taken with infrared light, is a false-color image of a quasar-starburst tandem with the most luminous starburst ever seen in such a combination. The quasar-starburst was found by a team of researchers from six institutions.</span><br><br>Some quasars display rapid changes in luminosity, which implies that they are small (an object cannot change faster than the time it takes light to travel from one end to the other). The highest redshift currently known for a quasar is <a href="http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20030109.quasar.html" rel="nofollow">6.4</a>, which is significant because it implies a maximum distanceÂ—more distant quasars should be easily observable if they existed. This is taken to mean that the oldest observed quasars correspond to the beginning of galaxy formation. The first quasars marked the end of the dark age, the period after the emission of the cosmic microwave background radiation where there are no observable sources of radiation.<br><br><strong>Properties of Quasars</strong><br><br>Of the several hundred quasars observed, all spectra have shown considerable redshifts, ranging from 0.06 to the recent maximum of 6.4. Therefore, all known quasars lie at great distances from us, the closest being 240 Mpc away and the farthest being 5500 Mpc away. Most quasars are known to lie above 1000 Mpc in distance; since light takes such a long time to cover these great distances, we are seeing quasars as they existed long ago - the universe as it was in the distant past. Although faint when seen optically, their high redshift and great distance imply that quasars are the brightest objects in the known universe. In a general sense, quasars range in luminosity from 10^38 W (the luminosity of the brightest radio galaxy) to 10^42 W. The average quasar is found to be 10^40 W, which is comparable to 1000 Milky Way galaxies, or 10 trillion Suns.<br><br>When compared to active galaxies, quasars exhibit much of the same properties. Radiation is nonthermal and some are shown to have emission jets and lobes. Quasars can be observed in many parts of the electromagnetic spectrum including radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray and even gamma rays while most quasars are found to emit in the infrared.<br><br>Quasars are also found to vary in luminosity in differing time periods. Some vary in brightness every few months, weeks, days, or hours. This recent evidence has allowed scientists to theorize that quasars exhibit energy in a very small region, since each part of the quasar would have to be in contact with other parts on such a timescale to coordinate the luminosity variations. As such, a quasar varying on the time scale of a few weeks cannot be larger than a few light weeks across.<br><br><strong>Quasar Emission Generation</strong><br><br>Since quasars exhibit properties of all active galaxies, many scientists have compared the emissions from quasars to those of small active galaxies due to their likeness. The best explanation for quasars is that they are powered by supermassive black holes. Scientists theorize to create the luminosity of 10^40 W (average brightness of a quasar), a super-massive black hole would have to consume 10 stars per year. The brightest known quasars are thought to devour 1000 solar masses of material every year. Quasars are thought to 'turn on' and off depending on their surroundings. One implication is that a quasar would not, for example, continue to feed at that rate for 10 billion years, which nicely explains why there are no nearby quasars. In this framework, after a quasar finishes eating up gas and dust, it becomes an ordinary, normal galaxy.<br><br>Quasars also provide some clues as to the end of the Big Bang's reionization. The oldest quasars (z &gt; 4) display a Gunn-Peterson trough and clearly have absorption regions in front of them indicating that the intergalactic medium at that time was neutral gas. More recent quasars show no absorption region but rather their spectra contain a spiky area known as the Lyman-alpha forest. This indicates that the intergalactic medium has undergone reionization into plasma, and that neutral gas exists only in small clouds.<br><br>One other interesting characteristic of quasars is that they show evidence of elements heavier than helium. This is taken to mean that galaxies underwent a massive phase of star formation creating population III stars between the time of the Big Bang and the first observed quasars. However, this prediction has the problem in that, as of 2004, no evidence for such stars have been found, and it may seriously undermine our current views of the universe if no such stars are found in the next few years, and alternate mechanisms for producing heavy elements cannot be found.<br><br>Issue #21</div>
