The star Polaris, commonly known as the North Star, made the very short bright circle near the NCP. Full circle star trails are pictured over Vienna, Austria. This image, a relatively short exposure followed by a digital trick, could not have been taken during a single night because 24-hours are needed for one full rotation, and the Sun is sure to dominate the frame at some time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> Peter Wienerroither (U.

The interferometer will include a set of 1.8 meter diameter telescopes dedicated to interferometric observations. The 8 meter telescopes have been named after the names of some astronomical objects in the local Mapuche language: Antu (The Sun), Kueyen (The Moon), Melipal (The Southern Cross), and Yepun (Venus).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Vlt.kueyen.arp.750pix.jpg/497px-Vlt.kueyen.arp.750pix.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/38/Vlt.kueyen.arp.750pix.jpg/180px-Vlt.kueyen.arp.750pix.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">One of the four telescopes that make up the VLT, named Kueyen. The 8.2 m mirror can be seen below the large horizontal grey beam (as an oval patch of lightness). Image courtesy of the European Southern Observatory.</span><br><br>The VLT 8 meter telescopes can be operated in three modes:<br><br>- as a set of independent telescopes (this is the primary mode of operation)<br>- as a single large incoherent instrument, for extra light-gathering capacity (this mode has now been abandoned)<br>- as a single large coherent interferometric instrument (the <span style="font-style: italic;">VLT Interferometer</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">VLTI</span>), for extra resolution (this is occasionally used, usually for observations of relatively bright sources)<br><br>The principle role of the VLT is to operate as four independent telescopes, and the interferometry (combining light from multiple telescopes) is a minor secondary role.<br><br>The VLT is operated by the European Southern Observatory.<br><br>In 2005, VLT telescopes produced some of the first infrared images of extrasolar planets GQ Lupi b and 2M1207b.<br><br><strong>Interferometry and the VLTI</strong><br><br>Most interferometry will be done using 1.8 meter Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs), which will be dedicated to full-time interferometric measurements. The first observations using a pair of ATs were conducted in February 2005, and additional ATs are expected to be installed soon. For many interferometric observations there is little benefit in using 8 meter telescopes rather than 1.8 meter telescopes.<br><br>In its full interferometric operating mode, the four telescopes provide the same light gathering ability (neglecting light losses from the throughput of the instrument) as a single 16 m telescope, making it theoretically the largest optical telescope in the world (the interferometric technique used at the VLTI is not suitable for observing very faint sources, so it actually has poorer sensitivity than the single 8m telescopes). The light from the telescopes is reflected off mirrors and directed through tunnels to a central beam combining laboratory. The VLT is intended to achieve an effective angular resolution of 0.001 arcsecond at a wavelength of 1 Âµm, comparable to that achieved using other arrays such as the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer and the CHARA Array.<br><br>The poor brightness sensitivity of interferometric observations mean that they could not be used for imaging objects with low surface brightness such as the moon. Only targets which are at temperatures of more than 1000 Â°C have a surface brightness high enough to be observed in the mid-infrared, and objects must be at several thousands of degrees for near-infrared observations using the VLTI. This sensitivity limit rules out interferometric observations of most solar-system objects apart from the Sun. All the stars visible to the naked eye have temperatures of several thousand degrees, and have large enough surface brightnesses and angular sizes to be observed by the VLTI. Although the use of large telescope diameters and adaptive optics correction can improve the sensitivity a small amount, this cannot extend the reach of optical interferometry beyond nearby stars and the brightest active galactic nucleii.<br><br>The first two instruments at the VLTI were VINCI and MIDI, which only allowed two telescopes to be used at any one time. With the installation of the three-telescope AMBER closure-phase instrument in 2005, the first imaging observations from the VLTI are expected soon. In 2008 the PRIMA instrument will further enhance the imaging capabilities of the VLTI by allowing phase-referenced imaging.<br><br>After falling drastically behind schedule and failing to meet some specifications, in December 2004 the VLT Interferometer became the target of a second ESO <span style="font-style: italic;">recovery plan</span>. This involves additional effort concentrated on more rapid improvements to fringe tracking and the performance of the main delay lines. Note that this only applies to the interferometer and not other instruments on Paranal.<br><br>Issue #142</div>

This mosaic of Hubble Space Telescope images taken in blue, green, and red light has been processed to present a natural color picture of this cosmic maelstrom. Infrared images from the Hubble have also shown that hidden at the center of this activity are what seem to be disks of matter spiraling into a black hole with a billion times the mass of the Sun! Centaurus A itself is apparently the result of a collision of two galaxies and the left over debris is steadily being consumed by the black hole. Astronomers believe that such black hole central engines generate the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray energy radiated by Centaurus A and other active galaxies. But for an active galaxy Centaurus A is close, a mere 10 million light-years away, and is a relatively convenient laboratory for exploring these powerful sources of energy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> E.J.

The British astronomical community saw the need for telescopes of comparable power in the Northern Hemisphere. Planning began in 1974, but by 1979 the project was on the verge of being scrapped due to a ballooning budget. A re-design cut the price-tage substantially, and Dutch astronomers took a 20% stake in the project, allowing the project to be given the go-ahead in 1981. That year was the 200th anniverary of the discovery of Uranus by William Herschel, and it was decided to name the telescope in his honour. The telescope is a member of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cd/Moonrise_over_the_William_Herschel_Telescope.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/Moonrise_over_the_William_Herschel_Telescope.jpg/240px-Moonrise_over_the_William_Herschel_Telescope.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Moonrise over the <strong>William Herschel Telescope</strong>, La Palma, Spain.<br>The telescopes are (from left to right):<br>1.

At the direction of terrestrial scientists, a refrigerator-sized probe from the Deep Impact mission struck Comet Tempel 1 on July 4 at over 35,000 kilometers per hour. The unexpectedly bright explosion was not nuclear but rather originated from a large plume that reflected back sunlight. Pictured above is how the event looked to the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. A large cloud of bright material is seen emanating from the comet's nucleus and then dispersing. The area encompassing the comet became over three times brighter in the hours after the impact. Astronomers will continue to study the images and data returned by Deep Impact to better determine the nature of Comet Tempel 1 and discern clues about the formation dynamics of the early Solar System.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> P.

It is visible on the right of the above before and after images of the picturesque spiral. Can you spot it? The supernova, discovered originally by Wolfgang Kloehr and now dubbed 2005cs, is still near its maximum brightness and visible with a telescope toward the constellation of the Hunting Dogs (Canes Venatici). The supernova has been identified as a Type II but has an unusual brightness history, creating speculation that is similar in nature to the brightest supernova of modern times: 1987A. The progenitor star has been identified as a bright blue star. Although hundreds of supernovas are discovered each year by automated searches, nearby supernova are rare and important because they frequently become bright enough to be studied by many telescopes and are near enough for their (former) host star and immediate surroundings to be spatially resolved. Supernova 2005cs may have left behind a core that has been compressed into a neutron star or black hole.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> R Jay GaBany (Cosmotography.com)</div>

A frozen patch of water ice. The robotic Mars Express spacecraft took the above image in early February. The ice pocket was found in a 35-kilometer wide crater that resides 70 degrees north of the Martian equator. There, sunlight is blocked by the 300-meter tall crater wall from vaporizing the water-ice on the crater floor into the thin Martian atmosphere. The ice pocket may be as deep as 200 meters thick. Frost can be seen around the inner edge on the upper right part of the crater, while part of the lower left crater wall is bathed in sunlight. The existence of water-ice pockets inside craters near the Martian North Pole, like that pictured above and others noted previously, give clues not only about surface conditions in the Martian past but also possible places where future water-based astronauts might do well to land.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> G.

This Chandra false-color x-ray view of central 47 Tuc also shows the cluster is a popular neighborhood for x-ray stars, many of which are "normal" stars co-orbiting with extremely dense neutron stars -- stars with the mass of the Sun but the diameter of Manhattan Island. One of the most remarkable of these exotic binary systems is cataloged as 47 Tuc W, a bright source near the center of this image. The system consists of a low mass star and a a neutron star that spins once every 2.35 milliseconds. Such neutron stars are known to radio astronomers as millisecond pulsars, believed to be driven to such rapid rotation by material falling from the normal star onto its dense companion. In fact, x-ray observations of the 47 Tuc W system link this spin-up mechanism observed to operate in other x-ray binary stars with fast rotating millisecond pulsars.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> C.Heinke (Northwestern U.) et al.

No one is sure. Galaxy NGC 1275 is the central dominant galaxy of the Perseus Cluster of Galaxies, a cluster with many member galaxies visible in the above image. In visible light, NGC 1275 appears to show a spectacular collision between two distinct galaxies. The galaxy and cluster are also bright emitters of X-rays. The unusual gas filaments are shown above in a very specific color of light emitted by hydrogen, here artificially colored pink. Possible origins for the filaments may involve details of the collision between the two galaxies, or alternatively, interactions between a galactic center black hole and the surrounding intracluster gas. NGC 1275, pictured above, spans about 100,000 light years and lies about 230 million light years distant toward the constellation of Perseus.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit &amp; Copyright:</span> C.

Recent high-resolution images from the robot Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn show Hyperion to be an even stranger place than thought before. Previously, it was known that the length of a day on Hyperion is unpredictable. The moon's highly elliptical orbit around Saturn, its highly non-spherical shape, and its locked 4:3 orbital resonance with Titan torque Hyperion around so much it is hard to predict when the Sun will rise next. The newly imaged craters on the unusually coarse surface are surely the result of impacts, but for some reason have dark centers. The low density of Hyperion indicates it might even be a spelunker's paradise, riddled with tremendous caverns.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit:</span> Cassini Imaging Team, SSI, JPL, ESA, NASA</div>
