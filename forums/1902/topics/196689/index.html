            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Snake people are very shrewd and wise, and often achieve success through their wits. Snake people are discreet, restrained and refined. they never come across as pushy, and instead get their way through subtle manipulation. Cautious and intelligent, they possess analytical mids, but often also have a well developed gut instinct. There' an air of elegance and magnetism about Snakes that make them very attractive to the opposite sex. They are quite aware of their appeal, and thus can be rather vain. Snakes enjoy flirting, but when it comes ot their partners they are often possessive. </span><br><br>The Snake is: A planner, organized, calm &amp; placid, a loner, humorous, a hard worker, a perfectionist, very jealous, attractive<br><br>Suited as an ambassador, professor, designer, writer, PR<br><br>Suited with the Rooster, Ox, Dragon, Dog and Horse</div>

This year sees prosperity for Snakes who turn to friendships and colleagues for assistance. Do avoid speculative activities and investments, and be careful when receiving tips from business insiders!<br><br>Relationship<br>Married Snakes, this will be a time of some friction (not the good kind!) for you and your partner.

Keep your marriage together by exercising patience, and being kind to your partner at all times.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>22 June 2006</strong><br>Don't do useless favors for your friends. If you show yourself to be tolerant and receptive, then the current tension within your family will quickly disappear. Some dark clouds in your amorous sky are possible, but they'll make you better appreciate the happy days that are already in the offing. No particular health problem for the time being; you even seem to be invulnerable to viruses; if actually you don't feel in good shape, it may rather be due to a psychic cause.</div>

Your love life will undergo sudden blooming: inhibitions, taboos, every such thing will be dispelled as if by a magic wind; you'll be entering an absolute state of grace! No health problem should come to trouble your serenity. You'll have a good appetite and marked cravings for candy and chocolate. Well, pamper yourself a little bit and make the most of life.<br><br>26 June 2006<br>You'll make a fortuitous encounter that can prove useful to you on the professional or personal plane. Your digestive system may be weakened; think to moderate the intake of heavy or salty foods. Even if you've sworn that single life has suited you perfectly, you'll risk changing your ideas now, but nobody will complain about that! Beware of disputes with your close ones, as these dissentions might turn out badly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>29 June 2006<br>You'll have the possibility to achieve a feat and to win a great professional victory. The tendency of the day will be the maintenance of a good general state of health. Persevere in spite of certain difficulties; you'll realize that you have resources that you were not aware of. If you hope for a promotion, then show imagination. You'll have to choose between two solutions in a family issue; opt for the more reasonable one, although it will demand more sacrifices.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>30 June 2006<br>You'll be in a position to carry out an excellent financial operation; you can even strengthen your material situation by making long-term investments. Don't be afraid to express your ideas by all the means at your disposal, and, for once, discard the opinion of advisers of all kinds: you'll be right this time. Dialogue between you and your spouse will prove rather difficult to come about, and you'll have to make an effort to overcome it.</div>

You'll be able to carry out fruitful transactions, but on the condition that you heed the advice of specialists. A slight lowering of your vitality and morale; don't worry, everything will turn out all right. Try to have a dialogue with your nearest and dearest instead of flying into an anger at the slightest provocation. You'll be able to make some extravagant expenses this time so as to keep up your joy of living.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Snake people enter a room and there is Music, Music, Joy! Everyone dances! Such high spirit! The Snake is so intense and passionate, just as likely to take out the castanets as to climb mountains of snow. Snake year people are charming and romantic, often planning delightful hideaway surprises. Possessing tremendous wisdom, they are deep, quiet thinkers, calm by nature, but most intense. They often get involved in great causes, bigger than life, and often serve as mentors to the young. To paraphrase Confucius, they have a kind of inner beauty that arises, hovers, then comes to nest. They will have an abundance of good fortune and a long and prosperous life.<br><br>Famous Snake People: Mao Tse-tong, Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, Ferdinand Marcos, Abraham Lincoln, Lady Pamela Mountbatten, Martin Luther King, Grace Kelly, Jacqueline Kennedy, Edgar Allen Poe, Prime Minister Tony Blair, Bob Dylan<br><br>METAL SNAKE<br><span class="small">Jan 27, 1941 to Feb 14, 1942<br>Jan 24, 2001 to Feb 11, 2002</span><br><br>Sleeves rolled up, Metal Snakes get down to this business of living with a courageous will to risk everything for the greater good to come. Their farsighted nature has led them to predict what it takes to have a successful life and do what it takes to make it happen. Talent, personality, intelligence, compassion, these are just a few of the Metal Snake's outstanding attributes. Not afraid of having their noses to the grindstone, they've had their share of long weary days and tidal wave exhaustion. Their careers took off like gangbusters. Life is easier now, and Metal Snakes are proud of their many accomplishments. Their strong sense of responsibility and dedication to work has led to financial fortune, fulfillment, and security for themselves and their family. The Metal Snake is a Snake Charmer when it comes to love. Metal Snakes have no trouble attracting the opposite sex who are generous with their love, gifts, and spoiling kindnesses.

They are the practical, useful, dependable people of earth who are tinged with enough imagination themselves to make life very interesting indeed. Water Snakes exude warmth and never lack for friends, who are always invigorated by the Snakes' boundless optimism and playfulness. Water Snakes possess a wealth of sterling attributes that bring career success within their grasp - eventually. From small to big, they are always moving up in their career ladder and sooner or later, they will reach the top. Financial life is not great, but not bad, bulls and bears always striving for even balance. Water Snakes take great care of their relationships with friends and they make excellent companions to while away the hours. Love Life is somewhat of a teeter-totter, going up, coming down, gradually striking a healthy balance. Eventually, they find someone to love who will fully commit to them in return. Once this happens, setbacks will be a thing of the past.<br><br>WOOD SNAKE<br><span class="small">Feb 4, 1905 to Jan 24, 1906<br>Feb 2, 1965 to Jan 20, 1966</span><br><br>Wood Snakes dream of success, fame, and fortune, but without really having the wherewithal to make things happen. Even though they are strongly career minded, they have trouble making goals and too many opportunities pass them by. Dreams of better jobs lead them into changing positions several times through their working years. Despite it all, life is good for the Wood Snake. They generally have good fortune and they have "abundance" through other means, such as good health, wonderful friends, strength of character, an elegant lifestyle, and resilient spirit. What about Romance? Hmmmm? Of all creatures, Wood Snakes are most in need of knowing how to tango (as in,"it takes two"to do so!). Relationships always have cracks. Snakes have to learn how to give a little and how to hold back in order to accommodate the needs of the partner as well as themselves. A stubborn streak and a tendency towards self-absorption make communication difficult. Through the cracks, flowers grow and when they do, Wood Snakes are very responsible and sensual lovers and beautiful to behold.<br><br>FIRE SNAKE<br><span class="small">Jan 23, 1917 to Feb 10, 1918<br>Feb 18, 1977 to Feb 6, 1978</span><br><br>The Fire Snake is like a meteor in the sky, brilliant and alive. With spellbinding eloquence, the Snake converses with conviction on a broad range of topics, but realizes that good conversation lies as much in the listening as the talking. The Snake does both very well, raising communication to a very high and elegant art. People love to be in the company of this very graceful Fire Snake, who is always pleasant, provocative, humorous, and quick witted. With split second reflexes, they are constantly conceiving new ideas and coming up with new schemes. This entrepreneurial spirit makes headlines and the Fire Snake is much admired. Because of their ambition, perseverance, and infinite patience, and wise financial moves made early in life, their fortunes grow steadily. By the time middle age arrives, financial fortune is truly theirs. Relationships follow the same path, through faithfulness, perseverance, and willingness to make relationships really work, the future is always bright.<br><br>EARTH SNAKE<br><span class="small">Feb 10, 1929 to Jan 29, 1930<br>Feb 6, 1989 to Jan 26, 1990</span><br><br>Before we get to the good things, let's get this out of the way: The Earth Snake can be, in a word, snaky. Seductive and alluring, they can wrap their prey in a clever web almost impossible to escape. Their disarming manner has its charms but can backfire, when people run like crazy for blessed relief. But, oh, my, how Earth Snakes can shine. Their inborn magnetism, quick response to the needy, and unaffected love for their fellow men compel support from high and low alike. People generally gravitate towards these very graceful creatures who are citizens of the world, as much at home on the tennis court as in a museum or taking part in a street festival. Earth Snakes do well in school and lead a privileged life throughout their later career years. Golden years promise good financial fortune. In the Romance &amp; Relationship Department, Snakes are not at all snaky, in fact they are a bit too cautious, afraid that if they give their love away, they won't get it back. Nonsense! Once the love bug bites, they are very ingenuous and imaginative in keeping the romantic flame burning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 Jul 06<br>The stars will give you a great sentiment of contentment. You'll feel more balanced and more inclined toward making concessions and confidences, for you've been a bit too severe and discreet lately. You'll won't know which attitude to take toward your children, and they'll immediately be aware of it. As a result, you'll have difficulty with being obeyed; don't give them too many orders but always the good example. Try to forget the wrong one of your friends has done you and you'll feel much better: Forgiveness is not only a moral virtue, it's also a psychological virtue!<br><br>3 Jul 06<br>This will be the time for unexpected amorous encounters and passionate liaisons. However, since nobody is endowed with unlimited energy, try to moderate your amorous ardor so as not to suffer from physical and nervous exhaustion. Your sentimental and friendly relationships will give you most vivid satisfactions. And you'll devote more of your time to your private life than to your work. In your family, lively discussions that will make the atmosphere very merry.</div>

Your appetite will be unstable and capricious, and intestinal disorders may ensue if you don't control it. Your life as a couple will be under the sign of harmony; single natives of this sign will feel an irresistible desire to seduce and will have no difficulty succeeding.

At work, you'll assume your responsibilities well and this will open the door to a promotion or a pay raise. Don't forget that nobody is perfect; therefore be sparing of your criticisms. Beware of your tendency toward perfectionism, which might cause you nervous exhaustion this time. If you want, you can make as many friends today as you have in the last three months!</div>
