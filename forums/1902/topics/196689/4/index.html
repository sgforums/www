            <div class='col-md body'>28 Aug 06<br>Your social life will prove disappointing this time, and you'll realize that true friends are rare; think to be a true friend yourself. This astral environment will stimulate your creative imagination; numerous projects will take form in your mind, and you'll only have difficulty choosing the best of them. Less centered than usual on what's useful, you'll lose nothing of your efficiency. Indeed, benefiting from a larger and more global vision of the surrounding realities, you'll display much more cleverness than usual.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>29 Aug 06<br>In love, your desires will be near the point of being fulfilled and your hopes will be crowned with success. Take up a healthier food diet before it's too late. Your relationships with your close ones will prove rather difficult; beware of your brutal frankness, as it may hurt those whom you love; put some honey on your tongue and then everything will turn out well. You'll be inclined to indulge in impossible hopes or utopian desires; try to come back quickly to reality. This day will be rather unfavorable to the purchase of a house or the settlement of an inheritance issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 Sep 06<br>You'll feel a rather strong inner tension, which may lead to clumsy movements; practice yoga or some other relaxation exercises. Sufficiently tense relationships in the family domain. On the financial or real estate plane, take a maximum of warranties and precautions.

It'll be difficult to be immune to backaches, but basic precautions will allow you to limit the discomfort. Propitious climate for settling differences with the state as well as with individuals.

You'll enjoy increased cleverness in all fields. However, be cautious, as your excess of self-confidence might play dirty tricks on you.

            <div class='col-md body'>18 Sep 06<br>In love, don't try to do two things at once. Adopt a firm attitude with your children; if they're still small and if they begin their schooling, impose very strict sleep hours on them, otherwise they'll be tired, nervous and uncontrollable. Your professional activities will be fluctuating, but you'll finally establish a situation that will assure your future. Take your problems for what they actually are, that is not for catastrophes, but for challenges to be met. Your health will be strongly influenced by your moods.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>19 Sep 06<br>Don't wallow in your recent unhappy love affairs. In work, you'll give precedence to originality and independence, even if these two qualities are generally frowned upon by the firm that employs you; but this time you'll be appreciated and it will be made known to you. Fluctuating humors, but you won't have to be concerned about them. Be vigilant where your food is concerned. A vitamin cure would do you good by allowing you to recover your strength.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>20 Sep 06<br>This time, you'd better heed the advice of your close ones. Many natives of the sign will try to legalize their love; there'll be marriage projects in the air for sincere, or foolish, amorous ones. As for established couples, they'll redouble their tenderness. Risks of tremblings and palpitations. You'll work well and will obtain good results; but don't make a total obsession of your job. Show open-mindedness and tolerance in your relationships.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>21 Sep 06<br>Don't fear to take a difficult step, for you'll have the support of the stars. Try to be modest, flexible and tolerant in your relationships and you'll avoid many a conflict. Let your mate have more freedom, for your possessiveness may smother him or her. Your liver, a little overcharged, could show some dysfunction that will provoke increased sensitivity to cold; cover yourself sufficiently, do some exercise and take a very hot drink from time to time. Everything you build up this time will prove useful to your future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>22 Sep 06<br>Your physical and mental balance will need good quality melodies. You'll be right to smile to life. You'll be romantic, sentimental and tender, expressing your love for your dear one with ease and delicacy; your feelings will be particularly intense and profound. Beware, you'll tend to make a great thesis to be defended out of each subject of current conversation! You can count on the support of the stars to find a job or obtain a pay raise.</div>
