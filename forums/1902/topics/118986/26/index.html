You can make some money if you get involved in a conservative financial prospect that is presented to you.<br>You could be tempted to overspend on unnecessary items. Social functions will bring you in touch with new lovers. Cutbacks at work will be a cause for worry.<br>With the moon moving into your sign today you could find that youÂ’re feeling a little more sensitive than usual. You might want to talk things through with a friend, but the presence of Saturn is likely to have you tongue-tied! Be patient with yourself, and treat yourself to a soothing massage!</div>
