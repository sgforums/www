Hassles with your boss are sure to erupt if you speak your mind.<br>Good day for romance. Follow your gut feeling regarding your business ventures. Don't be too quick to judge.<br>YouÂ’ll probably feel a little tense today for no other reason than a couple of aspects influencing your twelfth house.

You can make headway if you share your intentions with someone you care about. You may find yourself in an opportune position if you are willing to take a bit of a risk.<br>Verbal abuse may lead to walkouts; don't make any rash statements you may regret later. Get busy doing all those things at home that you have been putting off for so long. Your outgoing nature might work against you today.<br>ItÂ’s a big day for you. Your ruling planet, Mercury, will move into your sign, which will bring out the best, and worst, of your Gemini traits. But rest assured that your mercurial quick thinking will get you out of most situations, and keeping your interests alive will help prevent those feelings of restlessness.</div>
