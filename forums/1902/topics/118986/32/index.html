            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You can pick up information that will give you an edge. Set the ball in motion and be relentless until you complete the project. Real estate investments could be to your advantage.<br>You will meet potential new mates through business. Romantic relationships should stabilize. This will not be the best day to make changes or renovations to your residence.<br>The minor, but significant sun/moon clash suggests that your mind will be focused more on shopping and fashion than on an overdue assignment or duty today. YouÂ’ll want to have lots of fun and chase away those Monday morning blues; unfortunately youÂ’ll have to knuckle down and honor those commitments first!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Today will be rather hectic on the domestic scene. Let your boss know your goals. You may not want to spend time around family or your home.<br>Try to curb your bad habits, and compromise if your partner gives you an ultimatum. You are best not to say too much to colleagues. Take care of yourself or you can expect to suffer from minor illness.<br>A minor but negative effect from Pluto suggests a need to tread over some old ground with a loved one or possibly even an ex! The presence of Pluto indicates that there is a slight level of resentment coming from some quarter, but it can be easily resolved with a little straight talking!</div>
