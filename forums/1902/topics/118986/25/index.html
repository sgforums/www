Do your work at home, if you can. Someone may be trying to make you look bad. Finish up any correspondence by early afternoon.<br>DonÂ’t be surprised if your thoughts start turning to matters of home improvement today. Thanks to Mars in Virgo youÂ’re likely to feel the sudden urge for a massive clear out, but a word of warning Â– be careful what you throw away in your desire for a more streamlined, minimalist environment!</div>
