You may have been too agreeable to someone who just wanted to use you. You will be appreciated for the competence you exhibit and for taking on responsibilities.<br>You can make it up to them later. Your lover may be annoyed if you have been flirtatious or not attentive to their needs. You can get others to do things for you but be sure not to overpay them or lend them money.<br>As the most quick-witted sign of the zodiac you are used to being able to see a number of different points of view all at the same time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>New interests are preoccupying your time. Take action. You are best not to discuss your personal life with others.<br>You can continue to make gains if you call a few people who can help you close an important deal. You will be in the mood for competition, and your ability to lead a group will bring you popularity. You are in a high energy, get it all done, mood and you'll have little patience with those who are slacking off.<br>Your ruling planet, Mercury, will start moving backwards today, which is likely to impact on work or school over the next few weeks, so donÂ’t be surprised if you suddenly find yourself a little overloaded today. Just make sure that you reserve a couple of hours to unwind browsing in the mall!</div>
