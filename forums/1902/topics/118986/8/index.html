            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Make plans to meet again in the near future. You will easily capture the interest of those you talk to. Do not make rash decisions about your personal life.<br>Take a break; you can finally mend any disputes on the home front. Your charm and generosity will bring new friends and romantic opportunities. Don't let someone take the credit for a job you did. Put on the brakes before it's too late. Difficulties will surface if you have taken on too much. Unexpected events will leave you unsure of which way to go. Personal changes need to be made.<br></div>
