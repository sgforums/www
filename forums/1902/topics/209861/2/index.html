As it orbits the earth on its 28-day circuit, the shape of the reflected light varies according to its position. We say there is a new moon or no moon when it is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun. Then, as it moves away from the earth's shadow, it begins to reflect light from its right side and waxes to become a full moon before waning, or losing shape, to appear as a sliver on the left side. You can use this information to identify direction.<br><br>*     If the moon rises before the sun has set, the illuminated side will be the west.<br><br>*     If the moon rises after midnight, the illuminated side will be the east.<br><br>This obvious discovery provides us with a rough east-west reference during the night.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"></div>

Always rub in one direction only.<br><br>If you have a battery and some electric wire, you can polarize the metal electrically. The wire should be insulated. If not insulated, wrap the metal object in a single, thin strip of paper to prevent contact. The battery must be a minimum of 2 volts. Form a coil with the electric wire and touch its ends to the battery's terminals. Repeatedly insert one end of the metal object in and out of the coil.<br><br>The needle will become an electromagnet.

Actually, growth is more lush on the side of the tree facing the south in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa in the Southern Hemisphere.<br><br>If there are several felled trees around for comparison, look at the stumps. Growth is more vigorous on the side toward the equator and the tree growth rings will be more widely spaced. On the other hand, the tree growth rings will be closer together on the side toward the poles.<br><br>Wind direction may be helpful in some instances where there are prevailing directions and you know what they are.<br><br>Recognizing the differences between vegetation and moisture patterns on north- and south-facing slopes can aid in determining direction.<br><br>In the northern hemisphere, north-facing slopes receive less sun than south-facing slopes and are therefore cooler and damper. In the summer, north-facing slopes retain patches of snow. In the winter, the trees and open areas on south-facing slopes are the first to lose their snow, and ground snowpack is shallower.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">BASIC PRINCIPLES OF COLD WEATHER SURVIVAL</span></strong><br><br>It is more difficult for you to satisfy your basic water, food, and shelter needs in a cold environment than in a warm environment. Even if you have the basic requirements, you must also have adequate protective clothing and the will to survive. The will to survive is as important as the basic needs. There have been incidents when trained and well-equipped individuals have not survived cold weather situations because they lacked the will to live. Conversely, this will has sustained individuals less well-trained and equipped.<br><br>There are many different items of cold weather equipment and clothing available, e.g. newer, lightweight gear such as polypropylene underwear, GORE-TEX outerwear and boots, and other special equipment. Remember, however, the older gear will keep you warm as long as you apply a few cold weather principles. If the newer types of clothing are available, use them. If not, then your clothing should be entirely wool, with the possible exception of a windbreaker.<br><br>You must not only have enough clothing to protect you from the cold, you must also know how to <strong>maximize the warmth</strong> you get from it. For example, always keep your head covered. You can lose 40 to 45 percent of body heat from an unprotected head and even more from the unprotected neck, wrist, and ankles. These areas of the body are good radiators of heat and have very little insulating fat. The brain is very susceptible to cold and can stand the least amount of cooling. Because there is much blood circulation in the head, most of which is on the surface, you can lose heat quickly if you do not cover your head.<br><br>There are four basic principles to follow to keep warm. An easy way to remember these basic principles is to use the word COLD--<br><br>C -  Keep clothing clean.<br><br>O -  Avoid overheating.<br><br>L -  Wear clothes loose and in layers.<br><br>D -  Keep clothing dry.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">C -</span></span></strong><br>Keep clothing clean. This principle is always important for sanitation and comfort. In winter, it is also important from the standpoint of warmth. Clothes matted with dirt and grease lose much of their insulation value. Heat can escape more easily from the body through the clothing's crushed or filled up air pockets.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">O -</span></span></strong><br>Avoid overheating. When you get too hot, you sweat and your clothing absorbs the moisture. This affects your warmth in two ways: dampness decreases the insulation quality of clothing, and as sweat evaporates, your body cools. Adjust your clothing so that you do not sweat. Do this by partially opening your parka or jacket, by removing an inner layer of clothing, by removing heavy outer mittens, or by throwing back your parka hood or changing to lighter headgear. The head and hands act as efficient heat dissipaters when overheated.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">L -</span></span></strong><br>Wear your clothing loose and in layers. Wearing tight clothing and footgear restricts blood circulation and invites cold injury. It also decreases the volume of air trapped between the layers, reducing its insulating value. Several layers of lightweight clothing are better than one equally thick layer of clothing, because the layers have dead-air space between them. The dead-air space provides extra insulation. Also, layers of clothing allow you to take off or add clothing layers to prevent excessive sweating or to increase warmth.<br><br><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">D -</span></span></strong><br>Keep clothing dry. In cold temperatures, your inner layers of clothing can become wet from sweat and your outer layer, if not water repellent, can become wet from snow and frost melted by body heat. Wear water repellent outer clothing, if available. It will shed most of the water collected from melting snow and frost. Before entering a heated shelter, brush off the snow and frost.<br><br>Despite the precautions you take, there will be times when you cannot keep from getting wet. At such times, drying your clothing may become a major problem. On the march, hang your damp mittens and socks on your rucksack. Sometimes in freezing temperatures, the wind and sun will dry this clothing. You can also place damp socks or mittens, unfolded, near your body so that your body heat can dry them. In a campsite, hang damp clothing inside the shelter near the top, using drying lines or improvised racks. You may even be able to dry each item by holding it before an open fire. Dry leather items slowly. If no other means are available for drying your boots, put them between your sleeping bag shell and liner. Your body heat will help to dry the leather.<br><br>A heavy, down-lined sleeping bag is a valuable piece of survival gear in cold weather. Ensure the down remains dry. If wet, it loses a lot of its insulation value. If you do not have a sleeping bag, you can make one out of parachute cloth or similar material and natural dry material, such as leaves, pine needles, or moss. Place the dry material between two layers of the material.<br><br>Other important survival items are a knife; waterproof matches in a waterproof container, preferably one with a flint attached; a durable compass; map; watch; waterproof ground cloth and cover; flashlight; binoculars; dark glasses; fatty emergency foods; food gathering gear; and signaling items.<br><br>Remember, a cold weather environment can be very harsh. Give a good deal of thought to selecting the right equipment for survival in the cold. If unsure of an item you have never used, test it in an "overnight backyard" environment before venturing further. Once you have selected items that are essential for your survival, do not lose them after you enter a cold weather environment.<br><br><span class="small">Based on 'U.S. Army Survival Manual', a public domain work published by the U.S. Department of Defense.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">WATER PROCUREMENT </span></strong><br><br>Water is one of your most urgent needs in a survival situation. You can' t live long without it, especially in hot areas where you lose water rapidly through perspiration. Even in cold areas, you need a minimum of 2 liters of water each day to maintain efficiency.<br><br>More than three-fourths of your body is composed of fluids. Your body loses fluid as a result of heat, cold, stress, and exertion. To function effectively, you must replace the fluid your body loses. So, one of your first goals is to obtain an adequate supply of water.<br><br><strong>PART I : WATER SOURCES</strong><br><br>Almost any environment has water present to some degree. Figure 1 lists possible sources of water in various environments. It also provides information on how to make the water potable.<br><br><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/procurewater1a.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/procurewater1b.jpg"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: If you do not have a canteen, a cup, a can, or other type of container, improvise one from plastic or water-resistant cloth. Shape the plastic or cloth into a bowl by pleating it. Use pins or other suitable items--even your hands--to hold the pleats. </span><br><br>If you do not have a reliable source to replenish your water supply, stay alert for ways in which your environment can help you.<br><br><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/procurewater1c.jpg"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"></div>

Tie rags or tufts of fine grass around your ankles and walk through dew-covered grass before sunrise. As the rags or grass tufts absorb the dew, wring the water into a container. Repeat the process until you have a supply of water or until the dew is gone. Australian natives sometimes mop up as much as a liter an hour this way.<br><br>Bees or ants going into a hole in a tree may point to a water-filled hole. Siphon the water with plastic tubing or scoop it up with an improvised dipper. You can also stuff cloth in the hole to absorb the water and then wring it from the cloth.<br><br>Water sometimes gathers in tree crotches or rock crevices. Use the above procedures to get the water. In arid areas, bird droppings around a crack in the rocks may indicate water in or near the crack.<br><br>Green bamboo thickets are an excellent source of fresh water. Water from green bamboo is clear and odorless. To get the water, bend a green bamboo stalk, tie it down, and cut off the top (Figure 6-3). The water will drip freely during the night. Old, cracked bamboo may contain water.<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig6-3.gif"><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">CAUTION</span></strong><br>Purify the water before drinking it.<br><br>Wherever you find banana or plantain trees, you can get water. Cut down the tree, leaving about a 30-centimeter stump, and scoop out the center of the stump so that the hollow is bowl-shaped. Water from the roots will immediately start to fill the hollow. The first three fillings of water will be bitter, but succeeding fillings will be palatable. The stump (Figure 6-4) will supply water for up to four days. Be sure to cover it to keep out insects.<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig6-4.gif"><br><br>Some tropical vines can give you water. Cut a notch in the vine as high as you can reach, then cut the vine off close to the ground. Catch the dropping liquid in a container or in your mouth (Figure 6-5).<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig6-5.gif"><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">CAUTION</span></strong><br>Do not drink the liquid if it is sticky, milky, or bitter tasting.<br><br>The milk from green (unripe) coconuts is a good thirst quencher. However, the milk from mature coconuts contains an oil that acts as a laxative. Drink in moderation only.<br><br>In the American tropics you may find large trees whose branches support air plants. These air plants may hold a considerable amount of rainwater in their overlapping, thickly growing leaves. Strain the water through a cloth to remove insects and debris.<br><br>You can get water from plants with moist pulpy centers. Cut off a section of the plant and squeeze or smash the pulp so that the moisture runs out. Catch the liquid in a container.<br><br>Plant roots may provide water. Dig or pry the roots out of the ground, cut them into short pieces, and smash the pulp so that the moisture runs out. Catch the liquid in a container.<br><br>Fleshy leaves, stems, or stalks, such as bamboo, contain water. Cut or notch the stalks at the base of a joint to drain out the liquid.<br><br>The following trees can also provide water:<br><br>Palms. Palms, such as the buri, coconut, sugar, rattan, and nips, contain liquid. Bruise a lower frond and pull it down so the tree will "bleed" at the injury.<br><br>Traveler's tree. Found in Madagascar, this tree has a cuplike sheath at the base of its leaves in which water collects.<br><br>Umbrella tree. The leaf bases and roots of this tree of western tropical Africa can provide water.<br><br>Baobab tree. This tree of the sandy plains of northern Australia and Africa collects water in its bottlelike trunk during the wet season. Frequently, you can find clear, fresh water in these trees after weeks of dry weather.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">CAUTION</span></strong><br>Do not keep the sap from plants longer than 24 hours. It begins fermenting, becoming dangerous as a water source.<br><br><span class="small">Based on 'U.S. Army Survival Manual', a public domain work published by the U.S. Department of Defense.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"></div>

They draw moisture from the ground and from plant material. You need certain materials to build a still, and you need time to let it collect the water. It takes about 24 hours to get 0.5 to 1 liter of water.<br><br><strong>Aboveground Still</strong><br>To make the aboveground still, you need a sunny slope on which to place the still, a clear plastic bag, green leafy vegetation, and a small rock (Figure 6-6).<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig6-6.gif"><br><br>To make the still :<br><ul>Fill the bag with air by turning the opening into the breeze or by "scooping" air into the bag.<br><br>Fill the plastic bag half to three-fourths full of green leafy vegetation. Be sure to remove all hard sticks or sharp spines that might puncture the bag.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="color: red;">CAUTION</span></strong><br><span style="color: olive;">Do not use poisonous vegetation. It will provide poisonous liquid</span>.</span><br><br>Place a small rock or similar item in the bag.<br><br>Close the bag and tie the mouth securely as close to the end of the bag as possible to keep the maximum amount of air space. If you have a piece of tubing, a small straw, or a hollow reed, insert one end in the mouth of the bag before you tie it securely. Then tie off or plug the tubing so that air will not escape. This tubing will allow you to drain out condensed water without untying the bag.<br><br>Place the bag, mouth downhill, on a slope in full sunlight. Position the mouth of the bag slightly higher than the low point in the bag.<br><br>Settle the bag in place so that the rock works itself into the low point in the bag. </ul><br><br>To get the condensed water from the still, loosen the tie around the bag's mouth and tip the bag so that the water collected around the rock will drain out. Then retie the mouth securely and reposition the still to allow further condensation.<br><br>Change the vegetation in the bag after extracting most of the water from it. This will ensure maximum output of water.<br><br><strong>Belowground Still </strong><br>To make a belowground still, you need a digging tool, a container, a clear plastic sheet, a drinking tube, and a rock (Figure 6-7).<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig6-7.gif"><br><br>Select a site where you believe the soil will contain moisture (such as a dry stream bed or a low spot where rainwater has collected). The soil at this site should be easy to dig, and sunlight must hit the site most of the day.<br><br>To construct the still:<br><ul>Dig a bowl-shaped hole about 1 meter across and 60 centimeters deep.<br><br>Dig a sump in the center of the hole. The sump's depth and perimeter will depend on the size of the container that you have to place in it. The bottom of the sump should allow the container to stand upright.<br><br>Anchor the tubing to the container's bottom by forming a loose overhand knot in the tubing.<br><br>Place the container upright in the sump.<br><br>Extend the unanchored end of the tubing up, over, and beyond the lip of the hole.<br><br>Place the plastic sheet over the hole, covering its edges with soil to hold it in place.<br><br>Place a rock in the center of the plastic sheet.<br><br>Lower the plastic sheet into the hole until it is about 40 centimeters below ground level. It now forms an inverted cone with the rock at its apex. Make sure that the cone's apex is directly over your container. Also make sure the plastic cone does not touch the sides of the hole because the earth will absorb the condensed water.<br><br>Put more soil on the edges of the plastic to hold it securely in place and to prevent the loss of moisture.<br><br>Plug the tube when not in use so that the moisture will not evaporate. </ul><br><br>You can drink water without disturbing the still by using the tube as a straw.<br><br>You may want to use plants in the hole as a moisture source. If so, dig out additional soil from the sides of the hole to form a slope on which to place the plants. Then proceed as above.<br><br>If polluted water is your only moisture source, dig a small trough outside the hole about 25 centimeters from the still's lip (Figure 6-8 ). Dig the trough about 25 centimeters deep and 8 centimeters wide. Pour the polluted water in the trough. Be sure you do not spill any polluted water around the rim of the hole where the plastic sheet touches the soil. The trough holds the polluted water and the soil filters it as the still draws it. The water then condenses on the plastic and drains into the container. This process works extremely well when your only water source is salt water.<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig6-8.gif"><br><br>You will need at least three stills to meet your individual daily water intake needs.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: orange;"><span class="large">FIRECRAFT</span></span></strong><br><br>In many survival situations, the ability to start a fire can make the difference between living and dying. Fire can fulfill many needs. It can provide warmth and comfort. It not only cooks and preserves food, it also provides warmth in the form of heated food that saves calories our body normally uses to produce body heat. You can use fire to purify water, sterilize bandages, signal for rescue, and provide protection from animals. It can be a psychological boost by providing peace of mind and companionship. You can also use fire to produce tools and weapons.<br><br>Fire can cause problems, as well. The enemy can detect the smoke and light it produces. It can cause forest fires or destroy essential equipment. Fire can also cause burns carbon monoxide poisoning when used in shelters.<br><br>Remember weigh your need for fire against your need to avoid enemy detection.<br><br><strong>PART I : BASIC FIRE PRINCIPLES</strong><br><br>To build a fire, it helps to understand the basic principles of a fire. Fuel (in a nongaseous state) does not burn directly. When you apply heat to a fuel, it produces a gas. This gas, combined with oxygen in the air, burns.<br><br>Understanding the concept of the fire triangle is very important in correctly constructing and maintaining a fire. The three sides of the triangle represent air, heat, and fuel. If you remove any of these, the fire will go out. The correct ratio of these components is very important for a fire to burn at its greatest capability. The only way to learn this ratio is to practice.<br><br><span class="small">Based on 'U.S. Army Survival Manual', a public domain work published by the U.S. Department of Defense that is available for sale at Amazon.com.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: orange;">FIRECRAFT</span></strong></span><br><br><strong>PART II : SITE SELECTION AND PREPARATION</strong><br><br>You will have to decide what site and arrangement to use. Before building a fire consider :<br><br>- The area (terrain and climate) in which you are operating.<br>- The materials and tools available.<br>- Time: how much time you have?<br>- Need: why you need a fire?<br>- Security: how close is the enemy?<br><br>Look for a dry spot that :<br><br>- Is protected from the wind.<br>- Is suitably placed in relation to your shelter (if any).<br>- Will concentrate the heat in the direction you desire.<br>- Has a supply of wood or other fuel available. (See Figure 7-4 for types of material you can use.)<br><br><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/fire7_4.jpg"><br><br>If you are in a wooded or brush-covered area, clear the brush and scrape the surface soil from the spot you have selected. Clear a circle at least 1 meter in diameter so there is little chance of the fire spreading.<br><br>If time allows, construct a fire wall using logs or rocks. This wall will help to reflector direct the heat where you want it (Figure 7-1). It will also reduce flying sparks and cut down on the amount of wind blowing into the fire. However, you will need enough wind to keep the fire burning.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;">CAUTION</span><br>Do not use wet or porous rocks as they may explode when heated.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig7-1.gif"><br><br>In some situations, you may find that an underground fireplace will best meet your needs. It conceals the fire and serves well for cooking food. To make an underground fireplace or Dakota fire hole (Figure 7-2) :<br><br>-  Dig a hole in the ground.<br><br>-  On the upwind side of this hole, poke or dig a large connecting hole for ventilation.<br><br>-  Build your fire in the hole as illustrated.<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig7-2.gif"><br><br>If you are in a snow-covered area, use green logs to make a dry base for your fire (Figure 7-3). Trees with wrist-sized trunks are easily broken in extreme cold. Cut or break several green logs and lay them side by side on top of the snow. Add one or two more layers. Lay the top layer of logs opposite those below it.<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig7-3.gif"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: orange;">FIRECRAFT</span></strong></span><br><br><strong>PART III : FIRE MATERIAL SELECTION</strong><br><br>You need three types of materials (Figure 7-4) to build a fire--tinder, kindling, and fuel.<br><br>Tinder is dry material that ignites with little heat--a spark starts a fire. The tinder must be absolutely dry to be sure just a spark will ignite it. If you only have a device that generates sparks, charred cloth will be almost essential. It holds a spark for long periods, allowing you to put tinder on the hot area to generate a small flame. You can make charred cloth by heating cotton cloth until it turns black, but does not burn. Once it is black, you must keep it in an airtight container to keep it dry. Prepare this cloth well in advance of any survival situation. Add it to your individual survival kit.<br><br>Kindling is readily combustible material that you add to the burning tinder. Again, this material should be absolutely dry to ensure rapid burning. Kindling increases the fire's temperature so that it will ignite less combustible material.<br><br>Fuel is less combustible material that burns slowly and steadily once ignited.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: orange;">FIRECRAFT</span></strong></span><br><br><strong>PART IV : HOW TO BUILD A FIRE</strong><br><br>There are several methods for laying a fire, each of which has advantages. The situation you find yourself in will determine which fire to use.<br><br><strong>Tepee</strong><br>To make this fire (Figure 7-5), arrange the tinder and a few sticks of kindling in the shape of a tepee or cone. Light the center. As the tepee burns, the outside logs will fall inward, feeding the fire. This type of fire burns well even with wet wood.<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig7-5.gif"><br><br><strong>Lean-To</strong><br>To lay this fire (Figure 7-5), push a green stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle. Point the end of the stick in the direction of the wind. Place some tinder deep under this lean-to stick. Lean pieces of kindling against the lean-to stick. Light the tinder. As the kindling catches fire from the tinder, add more kindling.<br><br><strong>Cross-Ditch</strong><br>To use this method (Figure 7-5), scratch a cross about 30 centimeters in size in the ground. Dig the cross 7.5 centimeters deep. Put a large wad of tinder in the middle of the cross. Build a kindling pyramid above the tinder. The shallow ditch allows air to sweep under the tinder to provide a draft.<br><br><strong>Pyramid</strong><br>To lay this fire (Figure 7-5), place two small logs or branches parallel on the ground. Place a solid layer of small logs across the parallel logs. Add three or four more layers of logs or branches, each layer smaller than and at a right angle to the layer below it. Make a starter fire on top of the pyramid. As the starter fire burns, it will ignite the logs below it. This gives you a fire that burns downward, requiring no attention during the night.<br><br>There are several other ways to lay a fire that are quite effective. Your situation and the material available in the area may make another method more suitable.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"></div>

Make sure to lay your tinder, kindling, and fuel so that your fire will burn as long as you need it. Igniters provide the initial heat required to start the tinder burning. They fall into two categories: modern methods and primitive methods.<br><br><strong>Modern Methods</strong><br>Modem igniters use modem devices--items we normally think of to start a fire.<br><br><strong>Matches</strong><br>Make sure these matches are waterproof. Also, store them in a waterproof container along with a dependable striker pad.<br><br><strong>Convex Lens</strong><br>Use this method (Figure 7-6) only on bright, sunny days. The lens can come from binoculars, camera, telescopic sights, or magnifying glasses. Angle the lens to concentrate the sun's rays on the tinder. Hold the lens over the same spot until the tinder begins to smolder. Gently blow or fan the tinder into flame, and apply it to the fire lay.<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig7-6.gif"><br><br><strong>Metal Match</strong><br>Place a flat, dry leaf under your tinder with a portion exposed. Place the tip of the metal match on the dry leaf, holding the metal match in one hand and a knife in the other. Scrape your knife against the metal match to produce sparks. The sparks will hit the tinder. When the tinder starts to smolder, proceed as above.<br><br><strong>Battery</strong><br>Use a battery to generate a spark. Use of this method depends on the type of battery available. Attach a wire to each terminal. Touch the ends of the bare wires together next to the tinder so the sparks will ignite it.<br><br><strong>Gunpowder </strong><br>Often, you will have ammunition with your equipment. If so, carefully extract the bullet from the shell casing, and use the gunpowder as tinder. A spark will ignite the powder. Be extremely careful when extracting the bullet from the case.<br><br><strong>Primitive Methods</strong><br>Primitive igniters are those attributed to our early ancestors.<br><br><strong>Flint and Steel</strong><br>The direct spark method is the easiest of the primitive methods to use. The flint and steel method is the most reliable of the direct spark methods. Strike a flint or other hard, sharp-edged rock edge with a piece of carbon steel (stainless steel will not produce a good spark). This method requires a loose-jointed wrist and practice. When a spark has caught in the tinder, blow on it. The spark will spread and burst into flames.<br><br><strong>Fire-Plow</strong><br>The fire-plow (Figure 7-7) is a friction method of ignition. You rub a hardwood shaft against a softer wood base. To use this method, cut a straight groove in the base and plow the blunt tip of the shaft up and down the groove. The plowing action of the shaft pushes out small particles of wood fibers. Then, as you apply more pressure on each stroke, the friction ignites the wood particles.<br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig7-7.gif"><br><br><strong>Bow and Drill </strong><br>The technique of starting a fire with a bow and drill (Figure 7-8 ) is simple, but you must exert much effort and be persistent to produce a fire. You need the following items to use this method:<br><br><ul>Socket. The socket is an easily grasped stone or piece of hardwood or bone with a slight depression in one side. Use it to hold the drill in place and to apply downward pressure.<br><br>Drill. The drill should be a straight, seasoned hardwood stick about 2 centimeters in diameter and 25 centimeters long. The top end is round and the low end blunt (to produce more friction).<br><br>Fire board. Its size is up to you. A seasoned softwood board about 2.5 centimeters thick and 10 centimeters wide is preferable. Cut a depression about 2 centimeters from the edge on one side of the board. On the underside, make a V-shaped cut from the edge of the board to the depression.<br><br>Bow. The bow is a resilient, green stick about 2.5 centimeters in diameter and a string. The type of wood is not important. The bowstring can be any type of cordage. You tie the bowstring from one end of the bow to the other, without any slack. </ul><br><br><img src="http://www.survivaliq.com/survival/PIC/fig7-8.gif"><br><br>To use the bow and drill, first prepare the fire lay. Then place a bundle of tinder under the V-shaped cut in the fire board. Place one foot on the fire board. Loop the bowstring over the drill and place the drill in the precut depression on the fire board. Place the socket, held in one hand, on the top of the drill to hold it in position. Press down on the drill and saw the bow back and forth to twirl the drill (Figure 7-8 ). Once you have established a smooth motion, apply more downward pressure and work the bow faster. This action will grind hot black powder into the tinder, causing a spark to catch. Blow on the tinder until it ignites.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Primitive fire-building methods are exhaustive and require practice to ensure success. </span><br><br><strong>HELPFUL HINTS</strong><br><br>Use nonaromatic seasoned hardwood for fuel, if possible.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Collect kindling and tinder along the trail.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Add insect repellent to the tinder.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Keep the firewood dry.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Dry damp firewood near the fire.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Bank the fire to keep the coals alive overnight.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Carry lighted punk, when possible.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Be sure the fire is out before leaving camp.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Do not select wood lying on the ground.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mosquitoes, The why and how they find and bite you!</strong><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/AnophelesGambiaemosquito.jpg/200px-"><br><br>Now let me just say right off the bat, that I am in no way a mosquito expert! I donÂ’t have any special training nor am I a scientist or entomologist (bug specialist). BUT, I can read, AND I have done my research on the how and why of mosquitoes. HereÂ’s what the scientists and experts have found out so far.<br><br>Only female mosquitoes bite. (why)? They need a blood meal to develop and lay their eggs. How do they find the blood they need? As with all of natureÂ’s creatures mosquitoes have evolved to survive by highly developing only the exact senses they need to live long enough to reproduce. So do they see better than other creatures? NO! It has been proven that a mosquito can not only find you in complete and total darkness, but will go strait for you!<br><br>HereÂ’s how they do it. Scientist have known for some time that mosquitoes sense carbon dioxide in the air. Not only do they sense it they home in on certain chemicals carried in that carbon dioxide. ItÂ’s called a carbon dioxide signature.<br><br>Plants, animals, water, and almost everything has its own carbon dioxide signature. It is now known that different plants can be identified by this signature. By the same rules even humans all have a different carbon dioxide signature. ItÂ’s even being called a carbon dioxide fingerprint and is being used in crime labs to identify people!<br><br>Ever wonder why the mosquitoes bite you and not the guy next to you? They are attracted to certain chemicals in the carbon dioxide being released from your body and the guy next to you doesn't have as much of these chemicals in his carbon dioxide as you do. However, there are thousands of chemicals already identified in human carbon dioxide release! What are these certain chemicals that attract mosquitoes? Have they been identified? Yes! but the scientists who discovered them aren't telling us exactly what they are! ThatÂ’s right they are keeping these facts a secret! All they will say is that three key chemical signatures found in the release of human carbon dioxide will attract mosquitoes at a rate of 100%.<br><br>Other scientist have proven that these chemicals are Lactic Acid related and another attractant is fatty acids being released in the human carbon dioxide signature.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Aedes_aegypti_biting_human.jpg/180px-"><br><br><strong>There is no such thing as a mosquito repellent!</strong><br><br>So, now we know more about what attracts mosquitoes. What do we know about what repels them? Get this, the truth is "mosquitoes aren't repelled by anything!" They simply cannot sense anything that sends them running, is irritating, disgusting or repulsive! Therefore there is no such thing as a mosquito repellent! They are either attracted or they aren't!<br><br>So if it isn't the disgusting stench of DEET that keeps them off of you what is it? The truth is out there, all one has to do is look for it! HereÂ’s what I found. DEET inhibits the lactic acid receptor cells, (it masks the lactic acids, changes it) confuses the mosquito and prevents the blood feeding response. In other words, the mosquito will not bite when you wear DEET because it cannot smell lactic acid and cannot identify you as a meal. Most insect repellents work in the same way, no matter what the source, they confuse the olfactory receptors and the mosquito simply cannot smell you.<br><br>How does it do this? DEET contains plant chemicals that when placed on the skin evaporate and are released with your carbon dioxide. This changes your carbon dioxide signature to that of a plant! The mosquito sees a plant, not what she is looking for so she looks elsewhere. BUT, DEET also contains allot of other unnecessary poisons intended to KILL the mosquitoes. It has been proven these same chemicals will KILL YOU!<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/DEET_products.jpg/200px-"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">DEET is available in many insect repellents</span><br><br>LetÂ’s stop right here and look at this a minute. How many mosquitoes do we have to kill so that we never get bit by one that is carrying some awful disease? DonÂ’t get me wrong, I hate the bloody little buggers as much as the next guy, but is it even possible to kill that many? And if we managed to kill too many mosquitoes, what then? What happens to the creatures who survive by eating mosquitoes? They starve to extinction! Then the creatures who survive by eating the creatures who eat mosquitoes die also. This is the way nature works and some of these same creatures pollinate our plants! How long before we realize we are killing ourselves? Trying to kill mosquitoes is not only futile but is doing irreparable damage to our entire ecology. Already people are asking "what happened to all the Purple Martins that used to be around?" How much of natureÂ’s beauty have we already destroyed with this vendetta?<br><br>ALL you need to keep the mosquitoes from biting you is a disguise, something that makes you undetectable, an anti-mosquito cloak that conceals or hides you, so mosquitoes don't recognize you as a meal. This would give you a protective shield. Some plants oils contain chemicals which when applied to the skin evaporate and are carried into the air with your carbon dioxide thereby changing your signature. Nepetalactone, found in Catnip oil is one of the most recently discovered plant chemicals which is proving to be very effective in masking the human signature. It is not an irritant as reported.<br><br><span class="small">Copyright Â© 1999 - 2006. All Rights Reserved by Alternative Nature</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;"><span class="large">Cold-Weather Dangers</span></span></strong><br><br><img src="http://j4tb.com/weather/wxicon/windy.gif"><br><br>Let's face it, the weather strongly influences how we plan our day and often what we wear! If it is raining, we carry an umbrella and some outdoor activities may be cancelled. If it's cold and snowing, we dress in extra layers to keep warm and dry. Temperature alone may not provide enough information, though, to help us make good decisions about what to wear or whether to cancel outdoor activities. If there is a strong wind blowing on a cold winter's day, we will feel colder than if there is no wind at all. Based on temperature and wind speed, wind chill is a good indicator of how cold we feel outside and allows us to make better decisions to help avoid cold-weather dangers.<br><br>Prevention is always the key! To protect yourself from any cold-weather danger, always dress appropriately. If your local meteorologist says to expect an extremely low <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Wind Chill Index</strong></span>, don't go outside in shorts! Be careful to remove wet clothing quickly and exchange it for dry garments. Protect your extremities! Fingers, noses, toes, and ears are usually the most susceptible areas to cold-weather injuries. Wear gloves, warm socks that will not cause excessive sweating, and a hat or earmuffs.<br><br><img src="http://www.jokesandpictures.com/pictures/images/windy.jpg">     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So what are these cold-weather dangers? One of them is <span style="color: blue;"><strong>hypothermia</strong></span>. This is a condition where the core body temperature decreases to a level at which normal muscle and brain functions are impaired. Any prolonged exposure to temperatures less than 98.6 degrees (37 degrees C) can be linked to hypothermia! Here are some of the conditions that can lead to hypothermia:<br><br><ol type="*">Cold temperatures<br>Wetness<br>Improper dress/equipment<br>Alcohol intake<br>Poor food intake </ol><br>The severity of hypothermia can vary, depending on how low the core body temperature gets. There are specific signs and symptoms to look for. The condition worsens as the <strong><span style="color: blue;">core body temperature </span></strong>lowers.<br><br><img src="http://www.fotosearch.com/comp/CRT/CRT239/15297-11ER.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mild Hypothermia</span> (core body temperature ranges from 99-95 degrees Fahrenheit):<br>*  Involuntary shivering<br>*  Inability to perform complex motor functions (such as skiing)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moderate Hypothermia</span> (core body temperature ranges from 95-90 degrees Fahrenheit):<br>*  Slurred speech<br>*  Violent shivering<br>*  Dazed consciousness<br>*  Irrational behavior (for example, the person may begin undressing and is unaware of being cold)<br>*  Loss of fine motor coordination<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Severe Hypothermia</span> (core body temperature ranges from 90-75 degrees Fahrenheit):<br>*  Pupils are dilated<br>*  Skin is pale<br>*  Pulse rate decreases<br>*  Muscle rigidity develops<br>*  Shivering occurs in waves, it is violent and then pauses; the pauses eventually grow longer and longer until shivering ceases<br>*  Person falls to the ground and cannot walk; may curl into a fetal position to conserve heat<br>*  Person loses consciousness, heartbeat and respiration are erratic<br>*  Cardiac and respiratory failure, then death<br><br>It is important to be able to recognize the symptoms of hypothermia before it is too late. To determine whether someone is suffering from hypothermia, ask the person questions that require higher reasoning skills. For example, someone who is hypothermic will probably be unable to count backward by sixes from 100. Shivering that can be stopped voluntarily is probably an indication of mild hypothermia. If you suspect severe hypothermia and the person is curled into the fetal position, pull back on one arm. If the arm curls back up, the person is still alive, but in need of immediate medical treatment.<br><br><img src="http://www.fotosearch.com/comp/ITS/ITS231/itf136023.jpg"><br><br><strong>GLOSSARY:</strong><br><span style="color: blue;">Wind Chill Index </span>- Wind chill is based on the rate of heat loss from exposed skin caused by the combined effects of wind and cold. As the wind speed increases, heat is carried away from the body at an accelerated rate, driving down the body temperature. The wind chill temperature, an "apparent" temperature, gives us a better estimate of how cold it really feels outside. The measure of the rate of heat loss based on air temperatures and wind speeds is not a temperature, but it allows us to understand how quickly heat is lost to the wind.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Hypothermia</span> - This is a condition where the core body temperature decreases to a level at which normal muscle and brain functions are impaired. There are many factors that can influence susceptibility to hypothermia, including prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. Hypothermia may cause drowsiness, unconsciousness, and lower heart and breathing rates. Severe hypothermia, left untreated, may cause death.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Core Body Temperature</span> - This is the temperature of the core of the body, including the heart, lungs, and brain, that is essential to the overall metabolic rate of the body. The optimum core body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Next:  Treating Hypothemia</span></div>

The most important things to remember are to reduce heat loss, add fuel and fluids, and add heat.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">To Treat Mild to Moderate Hypothermia</span></strong>:<br><br><ul>Add layers of dry clothing.<br><br>Increase physical activity.<br><br>Find shelter.<br><br>Keep the hypothermic person fed and hydrated. Carbohydrates, with five calories per gram, are released quickly in the bloodstream, creating a momentary heat surge. Proteins, with four calories per gram, and fats, containing nine calories per gram, are slowly released into the bloodstream. These types of food supply a heat source over a longer period of time. Hot liquids and sugars are also good. Avoid caffeine, tobacco/nicotine, and alcohol.<br><br>Add heat (light a fire or use some other external heat source). Try body-to-body contact (the hypothermic person should be in dry clothing, in a sleeping bag, and the <span style="color: blue;">normothermic</span> person should be in dry, lightweight clothing). </ul><br><img src="http://homepage.eircom.net/%7Eballinloughscouts/Photos/Shielbaggan33.jpg"><br><span class="small">Onset of hypothemia</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>To Treat Severe Hypothermia:</strong></span><br><br><ul>Try a hypothermia wrap. Be sure that the hypothermic person is dry and has a layer of clothing to minimize sweating. Use multiple sleeping bags, wool blankets, wool clothing, and an aluminum "space" blanket to create at least four inches of insulation around the person, especially between the person and the ground. Wrap this entire ensemble in plastic to prevent wind or water intrusion.<br><br><img src="http://wzus.ask.com/r?t=a&amp;d=us&amp;s=a&amp;c=p&amp;ti=1&amp;ai=30751&amp;l=dir&amp;o=0&amp;sv=0a300512&amp;ip=cb75b808&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww1.umn.edu%2Fumnnews%2Fimg%2Fassets%2F11500%2Fhypothemia_suits.jpg"><br><span class="small">Hypothemia suits</span><br><br>Keep the hypothermic person hydrated and fueled. A severely hypothermic person will be unable to digest solid food because the stomach may have shut down. Try warm sugar-water or diluted Jello (TM).<br><br>The hypothermic person will have to urinate from <span style="color: blue;">cold diuresis</span>; a full bladder can mean additional heat loss. Urinating will conserve some heat. You will have to help the hypothermic person do this. Be careful to wrap him/her back up tightly in the hypothermia wrap when finished.<br><br>Add heat using chemical heat packs, hot water bottles, warm rocks, or compresses. Rescue breathing for the severely hypothermic person can increase oxygen and provide internal heat.</ul><br><br>It is important not to rewarm the peripheral areas of any hypothermic victim! The core area of the body should be rewarmed to prevent a situation called <span style="color: blue;">afterdrop</span>. Afterdrop can occur when very cold blood from a peripheral area, such as the legs or arms, returns to the core of the body and lowers the core temperature even further! This blood may be <span style="color: blue;">acetic</span>, as well, and letting it return to the core of the body can cause cardiac <span style="color: blue;">arrhythmias</span> and death.<br><br>Although a hypothermic victim may exhibit all the signs of being clinically dead, such as blue skin, fixed and dilated pupils, rigid muscles, and no noticeable breathing, he or she may still be alive! The victim may be in a state of "metabolic icebox," which occurs when the body temperature drops to 86 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. If this is the case, it is necessary to rewarm the victim and possibly perform CPR. DO NOT perform CPR if a heartbeat is detectable, even at a rate of 2-3 beats per minute. The heart is beating slowly, but it is still distributing blood. The heart is hyperexcitable during severe hypothermia and stimulation through CPR, or simply moving a victim, can cause <span style="color: blue;">fibrillation</span> leading to death.<br><br><img src="http://www.centenarycardiology.com/Conditions/atrial_fibrillation_01.jpg"><br><br><strong>GLOSSARY</strong>:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Hypothermia</span> - This is a condition where the core body temperature decreases to a level at which normal muscle and brain functions are impaired. There are many factors that can influence susceptibility to hypothermia, including prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. Hypothermia may cause drowsiness, unconsciousness, and lower heart and breathing rates. Severe hypothermia, left untreated, may cause death.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Normothermic</span> - This refers to the normal state of the core body temperature.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Cold diuresis</span> - A condition where the surface blood vessels constrict in response to cold. This constriction causes greater volume pressure in the bloodstream which is detected by the kidneys. The kidneys will "pull off" the excess fluid to reduce the pressure. The kidneys then excrete the fluid, causing the bladder to fill. This is one way in which the body protects the amount of heat lost at the surface.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Afterdrop</span> -  A condition where cold blood from the peripheral areas of the body, such as the arms and legs, is returned to the core, causing a drop in the core temperature. The cold blood returning to the heart may also cause a frenzied and irregular heart rhythm disturbance (ventricular fibrillation). This condition can be avoided by not rewarming peripheral areas of the body before the core has been warmed.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Acetic</span> - This refers to the acid waste products from cell metabolism in the peripheral areas of the body. If the peripheral areas of the body are rewarmed, this acetic blood may return to the heart and may cause cardiac arrest.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Arrhythmias</span> - Abnormalities of the heartbeat and the absence of cardiac rhythm. Any disturbance in the normal cardiac rhythm or any markedly irregular rhythm, block, or the presence of premature contraction. This includes functional abnormalities such as tachycardia, bradycardia, premature ventricular beats, ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, flutter, and heart block.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Fibrillation</span> - A type of cardiac arrhythmia characterized by rapid, unsynchronized quivering of atria or ventricles. Atrial fibrillation may be asymptomatic, but ventricular fibrillation is typically fatal if not corrected within minutes. A disorder of heart rate and rhythm in which the upper heart chambers (atria) are stimulated to contract in a very rapid and/or disorganized manner; this usually also affects contraction of the ventricles.</div>
