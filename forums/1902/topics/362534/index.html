              <p>KOMODO ISLAND, Indonesia – Komodo dragons have shark-like teeth and
              poisonous venom that can kill a person within hours of a bite. Yet
              villagers who have lived for generations alongside the world's largest
              lizard were not afraid — until the dragons started to attack.</p>
              <p>The stories spread quickly across this smattering of tropical islands in southeastern <span id="lw_1243213512_0" class="yshortcuts">Indonesia</span>,
              the only place the endangered reptiles can still be found in the wild:
              Two people were killed since 2007 — a young boy and a fisherman — and
              others were badly wounded after being charged unprovoked.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1243213512_1" class="yshortcuts">Komodo dragon attacks</span> are still rare, experts note. But fear is swirling through the fishing
              villages, along with questions on how best to live with the dragons in
              the future.</p>
              <p>Main, a 46-year-old park ranger,
              who like many Indonesians goes by a single name, was doing paperwork
              when a dragon slithered up the stairs of his wooden hut in <span id="lw_1243213512_2" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Komodo National Park</span> and went for his ankles dangling beneath the desk. When the ranger
              tried to pry open the beast's powerful jaws, it locked its teeth into
              his hand.</p>
              <p>"I thought I wouldn't survive... I've
              spent half my life working with Komodos and have never seen anything
              like it," said Main, pointing to his jagged gashes, sewn up with 55
              stitches and still swollen three months later. "Luckily, my friends
              heard my screams and got me to hospital in time."</p>
              <p>Komodos,
              which are popular at zoos in the United States to Europe, grow to be 10
              feet (3 meters) long and 150 pounds (70 kilograms). All of the
              estimated 2,500 left in the wild can be found within the
              700-square-mile (1,810-square-kilometer) Komodo National Park, mostly
              on its two largest islands, Komodo and Rinca. The lizards on
              neighboring Padar were wiped out in the 1980s when hunters killed their
              main prey, deer.</p>
              <p>Though poaching is illegal,
              the sheer size of the park — and a shortage of rangers — makes it
              almost impossible to patrol, said Heru Rudiharto, a biologist and
              reptile expert. Villagers say the dragons are hungry and more
              aggressive toward humans because their food is being poached, though
              park officials are quick to disagree.</p>
              <p>The giant
              lizards have always been dangerous, said Rudiharto. However tame they
              may appear, lounging beneath trees and gazing at the sea from
              white-sand beaches, they are fast, strong and deadly.</p>
              <p>The
              animals are believed to have descended from a larger lizard on
              Indonesia's main island Java or Australia around 30,000 years ago. They
              can reach speeds of up to 18 miles (nearly 30 kilometers) per hour,
              their legs winding around their low, square shoulders like egg beaters.</p>
              <p>When
              they catch their prey, they carry out a frenzied biting spree that
              releases venom, according to a new study this month in the journal
              Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors, who used
              surgically excised glands from a terminally ill dragon at the <span id="lw_1243213512_3" class="yshortcuts">Singapore Zoo</span>, dismissed the theory that prey die from blood poisoning caused by toxic bacteria in the lizard's mouth.</p>
              <p>The long, jagged teeth are the lizard's primary weapons, said Bryan Fry of the University of Melbourne.</p>
              <p>"They
              deliver these deep, deep wounds," he said. "But the venom keeps it
              bleeding and further lowers the blood pressure, thus bringing the
              animal closer to unconsciousness."</p>
              <p>Four people
              have been killed in the last 35 years (2009, 2007, 2000 and 1974) and
              at least eight injured in just over a decade. But park officials say
              these numbers aren't overly alarming given the steady stream of
              tourists and the 4,000 people who live in their midst.</p>
              <p>"Any
              time there's an attack, it gets a lot of attention," Rudiharto said.
              "But that's just because this lizard is exotic, archaic, and can't be
              found anywhere but here."</p>
              <p>Still, the recent attacks couldn't have come at a worse time.</p>
              <p>The
              government is campaigning hard to get the park onto a new list of the
              Seven Wonders of Nature — a long shot, but an attempt to at least raise
              awareness. The park's rugged hills and savannahs are home to
              orange-footed scrub fowl, wild boar and small wild horses, and the
              surrounding <span id="lw_1243213512_4" class="yshortcuts">coral reefs</span> and bays harbor more than a dozen whale species, dolphins and sea turtles.</p>
              <p>Claudio
              Ciofi, who works at the Department of Animal Biology and Genetics at
              the University of Florence in Italy, said if komodos are hungry, they
              may be attracted to villages by the smell of drying fish and cooking,
              and "encounters can become more frequent."</p>
              <p>Villagers wish they knew the answer.</p>
              <p>They say they've always lived peacefully with Komodos. A popular
              traditional legend tells of a man who once married a dragon "princess."
              Their twins, a human boy, Gerong, and a lizard girl, Orah, were
              separated at birth.</p>
              <p>When Gerong grew up, the story goes, he met a fierce-looking
              beast in the forest. But just as he was about to spear it, his mother
              appeared, revealing to him that the two were brother and sister.</p>
              <p>"How could the dragons get so aggressive?" Hajj Amin, 51,
              taking long slow drags off his clove cigarettes, as other village
              elders gathering beneath a wooden house on stilts nodded. Several
              dragons lingered nearby, drawn by the rancid smell of fish drying on
              bamboo mats beneath the blazing sun. Also strolling by were dozens of
              goats and chickens.</p>
              <p>"They never used to attack us when we walked alone in the
              forest, or attack our children," Amin said. "We're all really worried
              about this."</p>
              <p>The dragons eat 80 percent of their weight and then go without
              food for several weeks. Amin and others say the dragons are hungry
              partly because of a 1994 policy that prohibits villagers from feeding
              them.</p>
              <p>"We used to give them the bones and skin of deer," said the fisherman.</p>
              <p>Villagers recently sought permission to feed wild boar to the
              Komodos several times a year, but park officials say that won't happen.</p>
              <p>"If we let people feed them, they will just get lazy and lose
              their ability to hunt," said Jeri Imansyah, another reptile expert.
              "One day, that will kill them. "</p>
              <p>The attack that first put villagers on alert occurred two years
              ago, when 8-year-old Mansyur was mauled to death while defecating in
              the bushes behind his wooden hut.</p>
              <p>People have since asked for a 6-foot-high (2-meter) concrete
              wall to be built around their villages, but that idea, too, has been
              rejected. The head of the park, Tamen Sitorus, said: "It's a strange
              request. You can't build a fence like that inside a national park!"</p>
              <p>Residents have made a makeshift barrier out of trees and broken
              branches, but they complain it's too easy for the animals to break
              through.</p>
              <p>"We're so afraid now," said 11-year-old Riswan, recalling how
              just a few weeks ago students screamed when they spotted one of the
              giant lizards in a dusty field behind their school. "We thought it was
              going to get into our classroom. Eventually we were able to chase it up
              a hill by throwing rocks and yelling 'Hoohh Hoohh.'"</p>
              <p>Then, just two months ago, 31-year-old fisherman Muhamad Anwar
              was killed when he stepped on a lizard in the grass as he was heading
              to a field to pick fruit from a sugar tree.</p>
              <p>Even <span id="lw_1243213512_5" class="yshortcuts">park rangers</span> are nervous.</p>
              <p>Gone are the days of goofing around with the lizards, poking
              their tails, hugging their backs and running in front of them,
              pretending they're being chased, said Muhamad Saleh, who has worked
              with the animals since 1987.</p>
