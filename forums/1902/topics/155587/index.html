            <div class='col-md body'>Oct 2, 2005<br>In the calm of Kusu<br><br>It's a quiet island getaway for most times of the year, but come the ninth lunar month, Kusu will bustle with pilgrims<br>By Ng Hui Hui<br><br>A WALK along the golden beach on Kusu Island does wonders for technician Jimmi Ong.<br><br>Gazing at the faraway ships with the sea breeze caressing his hair is a priceless experience, he says.<br><br>'The peaceful surroundings recharge me and allow me to reflect on my life without any distractions,' says Mr Ong, 28, who paid $9 for a return ferry ticket from Sentosa to Kusu Island last Wednesday.<br><br>Such is the tranquillity of the 8ha island, the size of 13 football fields, before throngs of Buddhist devotees descend on it tomorrow. During the ninth lunar month each year, about 120,000 people will converge on the deserted southern island to pray for health, wealth, prosperity and fertility.<br><br>Carting plastic bags of fruit and joss sticks, they stop by the island's Chinese temple, which houses Tua Pek Gong (Merchant God) and Guan Yin (Goddess of Mercy), to pray and make donations.<br><br>Some also climb the 152 steps of a knoll to reach the Kramat, a Malay shrine to commemorate a pious man named Syed Abdul Rahman, his mother and sister.<br><br>The shrine is famous for answering childless couples' prayers for children.<br><br>Kusu Island, which is Hokkien for 'Tortoise' Island, owes its name to several myths and legends. The most prevalent one tells of how a tortoise turned into an island to save two shipwrecked sailors. To give thanks, they returned the following year to make offerings.<br><br>When LifeStyle visited last Wednesday, a few workers were setting up tents under which 12 souvenir vendors will set up shop during the annual pilgrimage period, which ends on Nov 1.<br><br>The island houses a food centre but it was devoid of life except for mynahs. But from tomorrow, six food and four drinks vendors will start operations.<br><br>The only inhabitants on the island are Madam Sim Chwee Eng, her son Seet Seng Huat and their Indonesian maid. They man the Chinese temple and live there.<br><br>Madam Sim, 76, moved to the island with her late husband when she was 16. His ancestors built the temple 300 years ago. Her smooth complexion radiates a rosy tint and the only telltale signs of her age are the wrinkles around her eyes.<br><br>She says the secret to her youthful looks is the pollution-free environment of the island. 'The only beauty product I use is hair dye to hide my greying mane. The rest is all works of nature,' she says in Mandarin.<br><br>About 20 visitors drop by the island every week-day, mostly tourists. It is rare to spot Singaporeans although a handful converge there on weekends to fish or picnic.<br><br>They are mostly older people, adds Mr Seet. 'There's nothing to do here, so it doesn't attract the younger crowd,' says the 57-year-old father of two young children.<br><br>His wife and children live in a five-room flat in Telok Blangah but he prefers to live on the island. He sells prayer paraphernalia such as joss sticks to visitors.<br><br>'If you think about it, there's nothing much to do in the city too. I can't shop every day. I'm better off here,' he says.<br><br>'City life is very stressful. My Mum and I probably look much younger than our age because we're very happy here.'<br></div>
