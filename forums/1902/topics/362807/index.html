              <p>STERKSEL, Netherlands – The 2,700 pigs on the farm that John Horrevorts manages yield more than ham and bacon. A <span id="lw_1243794897_0" class="yshortcuts">biogas plant</span> makes enough electricity from their waste to run the farm and feeds extra wattage into the Dutch national grid.</p>

              <p>As the world struggles to reduce pollution causing <span id="lw_1243794897_2" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">climate change</span>, attention has focused on the <span id="lw_1243794897_3" class="yshortcuts">burning of fossil fuels</span> in factories, power stations, and vehicles. But U.N. scientists says
              farming and forestry account for more than 30 percent of the <span id="lw_1243794897_4" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">greenhouse gases</span> that are gradually heating the earth. Much of that pollution comes from
              cattle, sheep and pigs that belch or excrete methane, a heat-trapping
              gas more than 20 times as potent as <span id="lw_1243794897_5" class="yshortcuts">carbon dioxide</span>, the most common <span id="lw_1243794897_6" class="yshortcuts">global warming</span> gas.</p>
              <p>Negotiators from 190 countries have been working to reach a new <span id="lw_1243794897_7" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">climate change agreement</span> in December on ways to reduce emissions and help countries adapt to changes in climate. They will reconvene June 1 in <span id="lw_1243794897_8" class="yshortcuts">Bonn, Germany</span>, for another two-week session.</p>
              <p>Yet
              it is uncertain whether cutting agricultural emissions will be part of
              the agreement expected to emerge at the final meetings in Copenhagen,
              Denmark. The subject is complex, emissions are difficult to measure,
              and the whole question is politically sensitive, touching on the
              distrust between the world's rich and poor countries.</p>
              <p>Scientists say it is too important to be left out.</p>
              <p>"It would be absolutely nuts to ignore agriculture and forestry in any future climate deal," said Pete Smith, professor of <span id="lw_1243794897_9" class="yshortcuts">soils and global change</span> at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p>
              <p>U.N.
              studies say agriculture is the main source of income for one of every
              three working people. It also is a growing source of pollution, as the <span id="lw_1243794897_10" class="yshortcuts">global population increases</span> and living standards rise in developing countries where more people are eating meat.</p>
              <p>The latest research by the U.N.'s <span id="lw_1243794897_11" class="yshortcuts">Food and Agriculture Organization</span> says <span id="lw_1243794897_12" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">animal husbandry</span> accounts for 18 percent of all greenhouse gases, when taking into
              account the grassland and forests that are cleared for raising
              livestock.</p>
              <p>When the FAO report came out in
              2006, "people in the livestock sector were shocked because they thought
              they did a good job," says Akke van der Zijpp, a professor of animal
              husbandry at <span id="lw_1243794897_13" class="yshortcuts">Wageningen University</span>, a premier Dutch technical facility. Now they "are becoming slowly aware that this problem has to be solved."</p>
              <p>One way to deal with it is to reduce the methane animals produce by changing their diet or through breeding.</p>
              <p>Another is to make use of it and burn it.</p>
              <p>Horrevorts
              says Wageningen University's Praktijkcentrum, or Sterksel Research
              Center, creates 5,000 megawatts a year, enough to power 1,500 homes.
              The farm uses the electricity it needs and feeds the rest into the <span id="lw_1243794897_14" class="yshortcuts">national grid</span>, for which the government pays up to euro177 ($238) per megawatt as a <span id="lw_1243794897_15" class="yshortcuts">green energy</span> subsidy.</p>
              <p>Pigs
              can be remarkably house-broken animals. Here, they drop their waste
              through slats on the floor in the middle of the barn while spending
              most of their time in open stalls to the side. The slurry is channeled
              into three 4,000 <span id="lw_1243794897_16" class="yshortcuts">cubic meter</span> (141,250 cubic feet) tanks, then mixed into a thick goo with other <span id="lw_1243794897_17" class="yshortcuts">organic waste</span> like low-quality grain and <span id="lw_1243794897_18" class="yshortcuts">carrot juice</span> to increase the methane potential. Bacteria break down the material in
              a digester tank and the gas is siphoned off into a generator to produce
              electricity.</p>
              <p>Horrevorts says a group including
              his operation and four other commercial farms avoids methane emissions
              equivalent to 40,000 tons of carbon a year. Dozens of private or
              nonprofit companies known as offset providers will "buy" those tons as
              a way of supporting renewable energy or other projects that reduce <span id="lw_1243794897_19" class="yshortcuts">carbon emissions</span>, then resell the credits to individuals or companies who want to shrink their carbon footprint.</p>
              <p>Last
              year, Horrevorts said, a British offset provider paid euro5 ($6.70) per
              ton for people wanting to neutralize plane travel or rock concert
              tickets. This year, the farm was negotiating with a Dutch company
              seeking to become carbon neutral to promote a green image.</p>
              <p>Though <span id="lw_1243794897_20" class="yshortcuts">operating expenses</span> for the <span id="lw_1243794897_21" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">biogas plant</span> are considerable, the combination of electricity savings, power production and <span id="lw_1243794897_22" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">carbon credits</span> makes it profitable, Horrevorts says.</p>
              <p>Horrevorts, who is a biological researcher rather than a professional farmer, says that with <span id="lw_1243794897_23" class="yshortcuts">financial incentives</span> through electricity subsidies, it could become standard practice for ordinary farmers. About 50 commercial <span id="lw_1243794897_24" class="yshortcuts">biogas plants</span> operate on farms in <span id="lw_1243794897_25" class="yshortcuts">the Netherlands</span>, and the practice is spreading across industrial livestock farms around the world.</p>
              <p>"I think in the future every <span id="lw_1243794897_26" class="yshortcuts">pig farm</span> will have a biogas plant," he says.</p>
              <p>But at euro1 million ($1.3 million) for a big plant like Sterksel's, it's a rich man's answer to <span id="lw_1243794897_27" class="yshortcuts">climate change</span>.</p>
              <p>About 70 percent of the world's agriculture is on small land holdings
              in the developing world, which complicates climate politics, says
              Antonio Hill of the nonprofit group Oxfam International.</p>
              <p>"It sounds like a big pot," Hill said, but dealing with farming
              is tougher than with industries. "You're talking about tens of
              thousands of sources of industrial emissions in rich countries. That's
              a lot more manageable than hundreds of millions of agricultural
              operations."</p>
              <p>Measuring and verifying carbon reductions from <span id="lw_1243794897_28" class="yshortcuts">soil conservation</span>,
              grassland management and livestock is complicated, and those reductions
              may not be permanent. Trees planted to soak up carbon from the air, for
              example, can always be cut down and burned.</p>
              <p>In the past year, much effort has gone into quantifying
              emissions from deforestation in the tropics and ways to compensate
              countries like <span id="lw_1243794897_29" class="yshortcuts">Brazil</span> or <span id="lw_1243794897_30" class="yshortcuts">Indonesia</span> for protecting their rainforests. But no comparable effort has gone into accounting for the vast farming sector.</p>
              <p>Another obstacle to an agreement in the U.N. talks is the suspicion
              that rich countries will meet a large part of their emissions
              reductions by buying credits on the international carbon market rather
              than constraining their own industries. In other words, they would buy
              credits from farmers to reduce their carbon footprint, in the same way
              the offset company bought credits from the Sterksel pig farm.</p>
              <p>"If the idea is that rich countries will do most of their
              reductions through offsets, a lot of developing countries have a big
              problem with that," says Hill, speaking from his home base in <span id="lw_1243794897_31" class="yshortcuts">Bolivia</span>.</p>
              <p>Hill says he expected nothing more in the Copenhagen agreement than
              "place holders," or general statements that can be filled in later with
              details. But Smith, the scientist from Aberdeen who co-wrote the
              agriculture section in the 2007 report by the U.N's <span id="lw_1243794897_32" class="yshortcuts">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span>, says including agriculture in the Copenhagen agreement would provide a source of capital from rich countries to poor ones.</p>
              <p>"It would be a desperate shame if it were blocked for political reasons," he says.</p>

              <span>green energy</span> subsidy.</p>
              <p>Pigs can be remarkably house-broken animals. Here, they drop
              their waste through slats on the floor in the middle of the barn
              while spending most of their time in open stalls to the side. The
              slurry is channeled into three 4,000 <span>cubic
              meter</span> (141,250 cubic feet) tanks, then mixed into a thick
              goo with other <span>organic waste</span> like low-quality
              grain and <span>carrot juice</span> to increase the
              methane potential. Bacteria break down the material in a digester
              tank and the gas is siphoned off into a generator to produce
              electricity.</p>
              <p>Horrevorts says a group including his operation and four other
              commercial farms avoids methane emissions equivalent to 40,000 tons
              of carbon a year. Dozens of private or nonprofit companies known as
              offset providers will "buy" those tons as a way of supporting
              renewable energy or other projects that reduce <span>carbon emissions</span>, then resell the credits to individuals
              or companies who want to shrink their carbon footprint.</p>
              <p>Last year, Horrevorts said, a British offset provider paid euro5
              ($6.70) per ton for people wanting to neutralize plane travel or
              rock concert tickets. This year, the farm was negotiating with a
              Dutch company seeking to become carbon neutral to promote a green
              image.</p>
              <p>Though <span>operating expenses</span> for the
              <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">biogas
              plant</span> are considerable, the combination of electricity
              savings, power production and <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">carbon
              credits</span> makes it profitable, Horrevorts says.</p>
              <p>Horrevorts, who is a biological researcher rather than a
              professional farmer, says that with <span>financial
              incentives</span> through electricity subsidies, it could become
              standard practice for ordinary farmers. About 50 commercial
              <span>biogas plants</span> operate on farms in
              <span>the Netherlands</span>, and the practice is
              spreading across industrial livestock farms around the world.</p>
              <p>"I think in the future every <span>pig farm</span> will
              have a biogas plant," he says.</p>
              <p>But at euro1 million ($1.3 million) for a big plant like
              Sterksel's, it's a rich man's answer to <span>climate
              change</span>.</p>
              <p>About 70 percent of the world's agriculture is on small land
              holdings in the developing world, which complicates climate
              politics, says Antonio Hill of the nonprofit group Oxfam
              International.</p>
              <p>"It sounds like a big pot," Hill said, but dealing with farming
              is tougher than with industries. "You're talking about tens of
              thousands of sources of industrial emissions in rich countries.
              That's a lot more manageable than hundreds of millions of
              agricultural operations."</p>
              <p>Measuring and verifying carbon reductions from <span>soil conservation</span>, grassland management and livestock is
              complicated, and those reductions may not be permanent. Trees
              planted to soak up carbon from the air, for example, can always be
              cut down and burned.</p>
              <p>In the past year, much effort has gone into quantifying
              emissions from deforestation in the tropics and ways to compensate
              countries like <span>Brazil</span> or <span>Indonesia</span> for protecting their rainforests. But no
              comparable effort has gone into accounting for the vast farming
              sector.</p>
              <p>Another obstacle to an agreement in the U.N. talks is the
              suspicion that rich countries will meet a large part of their
              emissions reductions by buying credits on the international carbon
              market rather than constraining their own industries. In other
              words, they would buy credits from farmers to reduce their carbon
              footprint, in the same way the offset company bought credits from
              the Sterksel pig farm.</p>
              <p>"If the idea is that rich countries will do most of their
              reductions through offsets, a lot of developing countries have a
              big problem with that," says Hill, speaking from his home base in
              <span>Bolivia</span>.</p>
              <p>Hill says he expected nothing more in the Copenhagen agreement
              than "place holders," or general statements that can be filled in
              later with details. But Smith, the scientist from Aberdeen who
              co-wrote the agriculture section in the 2007 report by the U.N's
              <span>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span>,
              says including agriculture in the Copenhagen agreement would
              provide a source of capital from rich countries to poor ones.</p>
              <p>"It would be a desperate shame if it were blocked for political
              reasons," he says.</p>
