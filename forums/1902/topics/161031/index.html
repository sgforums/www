            <div class='col-md body'>ARIES<br>21 MarchÂ–20 April<br>Pioneering, hot-blooded, hasty, individual<br><br>Aries woman<br>Ruled by Mars, planet of action and desire, youÂ’re not the sort to waste time. When you fall for someone, you want him now. Fiery and passionate, youÂ’re totally faithful while the flames are burning but rapidly cool off and move on when you hit cinders. Your best chance of staying faithful is to hitch up with a guy whoÂ’s away a lot, doing long stints abroad. That way, when heÂ’s home on leave youÂ’ll be sizzling. When heÂ’s away, youÂ’re free to play.<br><br>Aries man<br>The male Ram sees things from a straightforward point of view Â– his own. ThereÂ’s an animal in there and heÂ’ll follow his instincts without a second thought, so heÂ’s easy to lead astray. HeÂ’s a wham-bam, thank you maÂ’am type of guy, and a longer term vision of faithfulness tends not to register. But heÂ’ll fight for his rights Â– especially his right to his partner Â– and be blazingly loyal if thereÂ’s a threat from any other predator.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TAURUS<br>21 AprilÂ–20 May<br>Steady, sensuous, practical, productive<br><br>Taurus woman<br>Ruled by sensuous Venus, a close, physical encounter is your way of creating a sense of loyalty. Intimate images of being together often warm your thoughts and make you smile. You work hard to build a relationship, so you wonÂ’t easily let it go. For you, being faithful sometimes gets tied up with possessiveness. If you donÂ’t get enough loving, it expresses itself in your need for loads of cash instead. Your stickability means youÂ’re one of the most faithful zodiac signs, and because you donÂ’t like change, once youÂ’ve made a commitment youÂ’ll even stick with a crummy relationship, come hell or high water.<br><br>Taurus man<br>The male Bull makes a great lover because heÂ’s got such a hunky warm touch and feel. You can wind him up emotionally or intellectually and he wonÂ’t even notice, but betray him with your physical body and he sees it as a cardinal sin. At heart he believes he owns his woman and her body, like a piece of property. Once your relationship is established heÂ’ll be solid as a rock and he will rarely forfeit what he has built up for the sake of a one-night stand.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GEMINI<br>21 MayÂ–20 June<br>Curious, quick, communicative, tricksy<br><br>Gemini woman<br>Ruled by quick-thinking Mercury, the Trickster planet, you know how to trick and treat any man youÂ’re after, so fidelity isnÂ’t exactly top of your shopping list. The key to togetherness for you is communication. The more you can share ideas and rap with the man in your life, the more loyal youÂ’ll become. You canÂ’t bear to be tied down, so you need to convince, or con, yourself that youÂ’ve kept your options open. Only then can you be really happy, playing the love-game with just one partner.<br><br>Gemini man<br>Women whoÂ’ve had grief from a Gemini man often think heÂ’s a two-timing so-and-so, but this prankster truly doesnÂ’t know what all the fuss is about. The duality in this sign of the Twins means itÂ’s in his nature to want two of everything. He can run two cars, two jobs and two women and be absolutely faithfully committed to them both Â– when he happens to be around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CANCER<br>21 JuneÂ–22 July<br>Protective, maternal, romantic, home-loving<br><br>Cancer woman<br>Ruled by the mysterious and feminine Moon, as a Cancer woman you know your most intense experience of loyalty in the mother-role, and fidelity equates with living for the ones you love. Love like this doesnÂ’t seem to ask for anything in return, but in practice you can get so hurt and weepy when you feel rejected that you try to control the emotional agenda in your family or working group. Bonds of love can easily turn into binds, but in your heart-of-hearts you know that true fidelity also means giving your partner the space to be free.<br><br>Cancer man<br>The male Crab sometimes disguises his shy, sensitive feelings under a defensive donÂ’t-worry-about-me or I-donÂ’t-care-anyway shell, but this man is a tender turn as a lover: warm, caring and kind. Show him affection and youÂ’ll be rewarded with faithful friendship and love in return. Once he sees you as one of his Cancerian clan, youÂ’re family and you know heÂ’s in this for life. Infidelity is just not an option. Great if you love him. A pain if youÂ’re trying to escape!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LEO<br>23 JulyÂ–22 August<br>Courageous, proud, loyal, dominant<br><br>Leo woman<br>Fiery Leo, ruled by the Sun and the Lion, is the sign of loyalty and faithfulness. Once you have declared your love, as a matter of personal pride and dignity youÂ’ll stay true. The words of the marriage vow sum a Leo in love up: to love, honour and obey Â– thatÂ’s so long as he obeys you, of course. Being authentic and following your heart matters a lot to you, too, and because you see love and loyalty as inseparable, when you fall out of love, you donÂ’t hesitate to move on.<br><br>Leo man<br>The male Lion loves to love and loves to be loved, strutting around like a peacock to prove it to the rest of the world. ItÂ’s a treat to be courted by a Leo because heÂ’ll make you feel like a million dollars, and heÂ’s generous to boot. But this man has affairs and heÂ’ll only stay faithful if he feels heÂ’s in charge and life together is still fun in the sun.</div>

Togetherness for you ties in with serving and tending but youÂ’re no doormat and you wonÂ’t let your fidelity be abused. The zodiac image of the Virgin is a bit of a joke because underneath that demure exterior youÂ’re hot as mustard. You see nothing wrong in picking and mixingcasual relationships before you settle on your one true love.<br><br>Virgo man<br>When heÂ’s relaxed with a woman heÂ’s fun and charming and thereÂ’s no more attentive lover, but heÂ’ll be just the same with other women so donÂ’t be fooled. Gush and mush is out, but he will try to get the little things you like right, and thatÂ’s how he shows that heÂ’s faithful. If it all gets too intense heÂ’ll crack little jokes about you and him, as if heÂ’s being fickle, but thatÂ’s when you know heÂ’s seeing you and him as something special.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LIBRA<br>23 SeptemberÂ–22 October<br>Cultured, graceful, persuasive, seductive<br><br>Libra woman<br>Libra comes under Venus, planet of love, and because its symbol is the see-saw Scales, needing a twosome, you are never fully happy without a relationship on the go. For you, a partnership is a deal and a trade-off, with something in it for you both. And fidelity means being able to see your loverÂ’s point of view. But youÂ’re a first-class flirt and love playing the seduction game with any good-looking bloke you meet at a party. Libra may be fair, but youÂ’re not always faithful.<br><br>Libra man<br>Vive la difference should be etched on this charmerÂ’s tombstone, because the Libra man enjoys the company of women more than men and canÂ’t help wanting to be around the opposite sex. The problem is that his scales are often equally balanced and because he canÂ’t decide between two choices, he does neither. The worst-case outcome for the triangle he creates is that he lets down both his wife and his lover Â– again and again.</div>

Loyalty is a big issue for you. Because youÂ’re slow to trust a man, you put him through tests and trials before you commit. Being betrayed freezes your heart and youÂ’re not beyond taking hideous revenge, but sometimes its your own loyalty thatÂ’s in question. When youÂ’re being a bad, bad Scorpio, how faithful are you with your secrets and manipulative moves?<br><br>Scorpio man<br>The male Scorpion is famous for his sexiness Â– and his deadly sting! HeÂ’s often reserved and self-controlled, but once heÂ’s involved he is an intense and committed lover. He can get so obsessed with a woman that jealousy takes over and, like Othello, he misreads the signs and sees betrayal in every innocent situation. Not one to trifle with: he can be totally faithful, but heÂ’s so full of secrets, you never really know.</div>

To be faithful to a man heÂ’s got to inspire you, but when he finally loses his twinkle and his winkle, you canÂ’t wave goodbye quick enough.<br><br>Sagittarius man<br>The secret of the Sagittarian Archer is that heÂ’s always moving on to do something bigger, bolder and better, and if youÂ’re not part of his adventure story, you soon become history. HeÂ’ll be amazingly faithful to some big idea or cause, or a guru in Nepal, but when it comes to boring old everyday living, forget fidelity. If he gives you a speech about freedom and the need for an Â‘open relationshipÂ’ youÂ’ll know which way his wind is blowing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CAPRICORN<br>23 DecemberÂ–20 January<br>Ambitious, reserved, political, responsible<br><br>Capricorn woman<br>Earthy Capricorn comes under Saturn, planet of time and duty, so youÂ’re not the type to go overboard about your relationships. Besides, you donÂ’t rate passion under the duvet that highly, and since so few things in life reach their potential, youÂ’re not too phased by wrong-doing involving your partner Â– or you. For you, fidelity is about a shared commitment or a special project important to you both. YouÂ’ll go flat out to make it work and turn a blind eye to things that donÂ’t affect it.<br><br>Capricorn man<br>The male Capricorn is good on the practical side of life, like paying the mortgage or taking care of the kids, and comes across as such a straight, decent bloke that no one ever guesses what a horny old Goat he can be. HeÂ’s broadly faithful when he feels officially committed, but he often equates fidelity with doing his duty. Judge him on how much time he spends with you. If heÂ’s there, you matter. In his book, thatÂ’s loyalty.</div>

For you, being faithful is all part of being a true friend as well as a lover. But every now and again your other planet, independent Uranus, blows you out of a relationship when you believe itÂ’s had its day. Once you decide that itÂ’s over, out of the blue, your steely behaviour is a big shock to your ex, and your only loyalty lies in being true to yourself.<br><br>Aquarius man<br>The male Water Carrier is a man of ideas and firm principles, and once heÂ’s got the idea of you and him into his head, it stays there. This can take a long time to happen, but then he is totally faithful and believes you are, too. He despises deception, so if he does find another lover, youÂ’ll probably be the first to know. If heÂ’s betrayed, heÂ’ll drive himself crazy looking for reasons, and heÂ’ll be seriously hard work for the next woman who comes along.</div>

YouÂ’re rarely without a man in tow. The big problem is keeping it down to one at a time. You mean to be faithful but your head never rules your heart and because you can see the best in everyone and have a soft spot for lost souls, you easily get sucked in to new affairs. Every time around, you think itÂ’s for real, until you swim off elsewhere.<br><br>Pisces man<br>The Pisces male is a zodiac Casanova, notching up lovers and boasting about his sexual Olympics. This slippery fish thinks monogamy must be some kind of board game, but he is faithful in an odd sort of way. One of his fish will be quite devoted to his long-term partner and settled situation, while the other is hooked on a flirty lover. This is the guy who gets chucked out, twice over. If only he could have both, what a happy little tadpole he would be.</div>
