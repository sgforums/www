The first phase was the widening of Jalan Punchak and the excavation of soil from the construction site. This phase went on until August 15, 1992.<br><br>On July 6, 1992, the second phase began with the construction of the foundation and basement of the tower. Approximately 50,000 cubic meters of concrete were continuously poured for 31 hours thus setting a record in the Malaysian construction industry. The foundation work, requiring no piling, was completed by April 15, 1993.<br><br>The third phase was the construction of the 'superstructure' which began in May 1993. The tedious construction of the tower started with the erection of the tower shaft, then the tower head. As the finishing touches to the tower head were being done, the construction of the touristic building began.<br><br>The touristic building is adomed with designs that reflect the Malaysian Islamic culture. The main lobby of the upper ground floor is decorated with exquisite glass-clad domes that sparkle like giant diamonds. These domes were designed and arranged in the form of the Muqarnas by Iranian craftsmen from Isfahan.<br><br>On September 13, 1994, Prime Minister, YAB Dato Seri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad performed the Topping-up Ceremony where the antenna mast was installed, thus marking the final height of the tower, 421 meters above the ground.

The foundation base houses 3 basement floors for safety purposes, storage and maintenance work.<br>2. The touristic building bears the administration office, souvenir shops and the 146 meters pedestrian mall with cascading pools.<br>3. The tower shaft comprises 22 levels with 4 elevators and flights of stairs with a total of 2,058 steps.<br>4. The tower head holds the public observation platform (276 m) and revolving restaurant as well as the telecommunication and broadcasting stations.<br>5. The antenna mast crowns the tower and is specially utilized for telecommunication and broadcasting transmissions.<br><br>When constructing Menara Kuala Lumpur, the builders took special care to construct a retaining wall around a 100 year old Jelutong tree (Dyera Costulata).<br><br>To conserve the tree's position, the tower was moved at a cost of RM430,000 to avoid felling the monumental tree, which is found near the pedestrian mall.<br><br>Issue #364</div>

The date is projected to be around 1450, and his place of birth is variously stated to be Genoa, Gaeta, or sometimes Chioggia. It is known at any rate that in his youth he moved to Venice, a few miles from the last mentioned town, and became a Venetian citizen.<br><br>Like other Italian explorers of the era, such as Christopher Columbus (Cristoforo Colombo), Cabot made another country his base of operations. For Cabot it was England, so his explorations were made under the English flag. The voyage that saw him and his crew discover the North American mainland Â– the first Europeans known to do so since the Vikings Â– took place in 1497, five years after Columbus' discovery of the Caribbean. Again, like Columbus, Cabot's intention had been to find a westerly sea route to Asia.<br><br>It was probably on hearing of Columbus's discovery of 'the Indies' that he decided to find a route to the west for himself. He went with his plans to England, because he incorrectly thought spices were coming from northern Asia; and a degree of longitude is shorter the further one is from the equator, so the voyage from western Europe to eastern Asia would be shorter at higher latitudes.<br><br>King Henry VII of England gave him a grant to go on "full and free authoritie, leave, and power, to sayle to all partes, countreys, a see as, of the East, of the West, and of the North, under our banners and ensignes, with five ships ... and as many mariners or men as they will have in saide ships, upon their own proper costes and charges, to seeke out, discover, and finde, whatsoever iles, countreyes, regions or provinces of the heathen and infidelles, whatsoever they bee, and in what part of the world soever they be, whiche before this time have beene unknowen to all Christians."<br><br>Cabot went to Bristol to make the preparations for his voyage. Bristol by then was the second-largest seaport in England, and during the years from 1480 onwards several expeditions had been sent out to look for Hy-Brazil, an island that would lie somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean according to Celtic legends. Some people think Newfoundland may have been found on (one of) these voyages.<br><br>In 1496 Cabot started a voyage with one ship from Bristol. But, he got no further than Iceland and was forced to return because of disputes with the crew. On second voyage Cabot left again with only one vessel, the Matthew, a small ship (50 tons), but fast and able. The crew consisted of only 18 people. He departed either May 2 or May 20, 1497. He sailed to Dursey Head, Ireland, from where he sailed due west to Asia - or so he thought. He landed on the coast of Newfoundland on June 24, 1497. His precise landing-place is a matter of much controversy, either Bonavista or St. John's. He went ashore to take possession of the land, and explored the coast for some time, probably departing on July 20. On the homeward voyage his sailors thought they were going too far north, so Cabot sailed a more southerly course, reaching Brittany instead of England. On August 6 he arrived back in Bristol.<br><br>The exact location of Cabot's first landfall is still unknown, because of lack of evidence. Many experts think it was on Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland, but others look for it in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Labrador or Maine. We might never know the truth. His men may have been the first Europeans on either American continent since the Vikings: Christopher Columbus did not find the mainland until his third voyage, in 1498, and letters referring to a voyage by Amerigo Vespucci in 1497 are generally believed to have been forgeries or fabrications.<br><br>Back in England, Cabot was rewarded with Â£10, and a patent was written for a new voyage. Later, a pension of Â£20 a year was granted him. The next year, 1498, he departed again, with 5 ships this time. The expedition made for an Irish port, because of distress. Except for one ship, John Cabot and his expedition were never heard from again.<br><br>John's son Sebastian Cabot later made a voyage to North America, looking for the Northwest Passage (1508<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>), and one to repeat Magellan's voyage around the world, which ended up looking for silver along the RÃ­o de la Plata (1525-8<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/Cabot_Tower_%28600px%29.jpg/389px-Cabot_Tower_%28600px%29.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/Cabot_Tower_%28600px%29.jpg/200px-Cabot_Tower_%28600px%29.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Cabot Tower in the centre of Bristol, England.</span><br><br>In 1498-1500 a few Portuguese travelers, Miguel and Gaspar Corte-Real being the most famous participants, visited Greenland, Labrador and Newfoundland. In 1501-1505 an English syndicate, consisting of 3 Azoreans and 2 English traders, made voyages to Newfoundland. From 1504, if not before, Breton, Basque, Portuguese and English fishermen crossed the ocean to catch fish on the Newfoundland banks.<br><br>Cabot is remembered in Bristol by the Cabot Tower, a 30m tall red sandstone tower of 1897 (the 400th anniversary of the landing) on Brandon Hill near the city centre, by a replica of the Matthew built in the city and by a statue of the explorer on the harbourside.<br><br>Issue #371</div>

The surrounding cliffs made it impossible to attack the castle except from the east, which had a powerfully-defended gatehouse. Scholars also remarked that Harlech defended "way from the sea", with a fortified stairway that runs almost 200 feet down to the foot of the rock where the castle is perched atop. This allowed the castle to have direct access to ships' supplies, however the tide has since receded so that this is no longer possible. When the castle was besieged during Madoc ap Llywelyn's campaign in 1294-1295, this stairway was used to supply the castle.<br><br>In 1404, the castle fell to Owain Glyndŵr, becoming his residence and headquarters.

It was the last Lancastrian fortress to surrender when it did so in 1468; it was able to withstand the seven-year siege through its being provisioned from the sea. This siege partially inspired the song "Men of Harlech".<br><br>Issue #375</div>

Lava domes are one of the principal building materials of many stratovolcanoes worldwide. Domes may reach heights of several hundred metres, and can grow slowly and steadily for months or years. Because high-silica lava can build more highly and steeply than low-silica lava (such as basalt), lava domes can be unstable and prone to collapse. When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases, it produces a pyroclastic flow, one of the most lethal forms of volcanic event. Ultimately, many volcanic domes are destroyed by large explosive eruptions.<br><br>Some of the world's most famous active lava domes include those at Mount Merapi in central Java of Indonesia, Soufriere Hills volcano in Montserrat, and Mt.

His first two visits were in 1878 and 1880, at age 41. During the visits, he sent an account of his visits in installments to the San Francisco Bulletin. Later, he collected and edited these installments in a book, Travels in Alaska, published in 1915, the year he died.<br><br>Issue #381</div>

Movement along the rupture was as large as 5.7 meters (18.7 ft). (Reilinger, et al., 2000)<br><br>This earthquake occurred in the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ). The Anatolian Plate which consists primarily of Turkey is being pushed west about 2-2.5 cm/yr (0.8-1.0 in), as it is squeezed between the Eurasian Plate on the north, and both the African Plate and the Arabian Plate on the south. Most of the large earthquakes result as slip occurs along the NAFZ or Eastern Anatolian Fault.<br><br>The official number of casualties is about 17,000 although real numbers are thought to be above 35,000.

In isiZulu, the language of the Zulu People, they are <span style="font-style: italic;">uKhahlamba</span>, the "barrier of spears".

They are drained on the west by the Orange and Vaal rivers, and on the east and south by a number of smaller rivers, the Tugela being the largest. The range thus separates KwaZulu-Natal Province from Free State Province, looming over the nearby coast of Natal.<br><br>The highest peak is Thabana Ntlenyana at 3,482 m (11,422 ft). Other notable peaks include Mafadi at 3,450 m, Makoaneng at 3,416 m, Champagne Castle at 3,377 m, Giant's Castle at 3,315 m, and Ben Macdhui at 3,001 m. All of these are in the area bordering on Lesotho; north of Lesotho the range gradually becomes lower and less rugged.<br><br>Geologically, the Drakensberg is a remnant of the original African plateau. The mountains are capped by a layer of basalt up to 1,500 m thick, with sandstone lower down, resulting in a combination of steep-sided blocks and pinnacles. Caves are frequent in the sandstone, and many have rock paintings by the San peoples.<br><br>Snow falls regularly in the winter, while rains and mists can occur year-round.<br><br>Many of the Drakensberg peaks offer challenging mountaineering. While the major summits have all been conquered, a number of minor pinnacles have yet to be ascended. Hiking is also a popular activity. Navigation on long hikes is often aided by GPS receivers, and current maps distributed by KZN (KwaZulu-Natal) Wildlife uses the Cape datum as the geodesic reference. GPS users should be careful to use the correct datum as WGS 84 is not always the default.<br><br>Tourism in the Drakensberg is developing, with a variety of hotels and resorts appearing on the slopes. Most of the higher South African parts of the range have been designated as game reserves or wilderness areas. The uKhahlamba or Drakensberg National Park, located in KwaZulu-Natal, near the border with Lesotho, was listed by UNESCO in 2000 as a World Heritage site. The park is also in the List of Wetlands of International Importance (under the RAMSAR convention).<br><br>The most well known national park in the Drakensberg is the Royal Natal National Park. It contains the source of the Tugela river, and includes the 912 m high Tugela Falls, the second highest waterfall on earth. But it is the Central Drakensberg that offers tourists the best access to bushman rock art Kamberg and the largest range of hiking trails.<br><br>Issue #383</div>
