The valley varies in width from thirty to one hundred kilometers, and in depth from a few hundred to several thousand metres. It has been created through the rifting and separation of the African and Arabian tectonic plates that began around 35 million years ago in the north, and by the ongoing separation of East Africa from the rest of Africa along the East African Rift, which began about 15 million years ago. It was named by the explorer John Walter Gregory.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1d/Aerial_jordan.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Aerial_jordan.jpg/180px-Aerial_jordan.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Jordan Rift Valley from space</span><br><br>The northernmost part of the Rift forms the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon separating the Lebanon Mountains and Anti-Lebanon Mountains. To the south in Israel, it is known as the Hula Valley separating between the Galilee mountains and the Golan Heights. Further south, the valley becomes the Jordan River, which flows southward through from Lake Hula into the Sea of Galilee in Israel and then continues South through the Jordan Valley into the Dead Sea on the Israeli-Jordanian Border. From the Dead Sea southwards, the Rift is occupied by the Wadi Arabah and then the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea.<br><br>The southern end of the Red Sea marks a fork in the rift. The Afar Triangle or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a triple junction which is possibly underlain by a mantle plume. The Gulf of Aden is an eastward continuation of the rift - before the rift opened, the Arabian Peninsula was attached to the Horn of Africa - and from this point the rift continues as part of the Mid-oceanic ridge of the Indian Ocean. In a southwest direction the fault continues as the Great Rift Valley, which split the older Ethiopian highlands into two halves.<br><br>In eastern Africa the valley divides into two, the Eastern Rift and the Western Rift.<br><br>The Western Rift, also called the Albertine Rift, is edged by some of the highest mountains in Africa, including the Virunga Mountains, Mitumba Mountains, and Ruwenzori Range, and contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to 1,470 meters deep at Lake Tanganyika). Lake Victoria, the second largest area freshwater lake in the world, is considered part of the Rift Valley system although it actually lies between the two branches. The other Great Lakes are also formed by the rift.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/EAfrica.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/EAfrica.jpg/300px-EAfrica.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Map of East Africa showing some of the historically active volcanoes (red triangles) and the Afar Triangle (shaded, center) Â— a triple junction where three plates are pulling away from one another: the Arabian Plate, and the two parts of the African Plate (the Nubian and the Somalian) splitting along the East African Rift Zone of the <strong>Great Rift Valley</strong> (USGS).</span><br><br>In Kenya the valley is deepest to the north of Nairobi. As the lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea, these lakes tend to be shallow and have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. For example, Lake Magadi is almost solid soda (sodium carbonate), and Lake Elmenteita, Lake Baringo, Lake Bogoria, and Lake Nakuru are all strongly alkaline, while Lake Naivasha needs to be supplied by freshwater springs to support its biological variety.<br><br>The formation of the Rift Valley continues, probably driven by mantle plumes and ultimately a result of the African superswell. The associated geothermal activity and spreading at the rift has caused the lithosphere to thin from a typical 100 km thickness for continents to a mere 20 km. Within a few million years, the lithosphere may rupture and eastern Africa will split off to form a new landmass. If spreading continues, this will lead to the formation of a new mid-ocean ridge.<br><br>The volcanic activity at this site and unusual concentration of hotspots has produced the volcanic mountains Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya, Mount Karisimbi, Mount Nyiragongo, Mount Meru and Mount Elgon as well as the Crater Highlands in Tanzania. The Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano remains active, and is currently the only natrocarbonatite volcano in the world.<br><br>The Rift Valley has been a rich source of anthropological discovery, especially in an area known as Piedmont. Because the rapidly eroding highlands have filled the valley with sediments, a favourable environment for the preservation of remains has been created. The bones of several hominid ancestors of modern humans have been found there, including those of "Lucy", a nearly complete australopithecine skeleton, which was discovered by anthropologist Donald Johanson. Richard and Meave Leakey have also done significant work in this region.<br><br>Issue #353</div>

One chain extends across the sea to Chios, another extends across Euboea to Samos, and a third extends across the Peloponnese and Crete to Rhodes, dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean.

Similar dinosaur fossils have been found between Asia and North America. For instance the dinosaur Saurolophus was found in both Mongolia and western North America. Relatives of Troodon, Triceratops, and even Tyrannosaurus rex all came from Asia. Fossils in China demonstrate a migration of Asian mammals into North America around 55 million years ago. By 20 million years ago, evidence in North America shows a further interchange of mammalian species. Some, like the ancient saber-toothed cats, have a reoccuring geographical range: Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. The only way they could reach the New World is through the Bering land bridge. Had this bridge not existed at that time, the fauna of the world would be very different. For instance horses, dogs, and camels would inhabit only the Americas and nowhere else.<br><br>The Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea to the north and the Bering Sea to the south, are all shallow seas. During previous cycles of global cooling, such as the most recent ice age, enough sea water became concentrated in the ice caps of the Arctic and Antarctic that the subsequent drop in eustatic sea levels exposed shallow sea floors. Other land bridges around the world have been created and re-flooded in the same way: approximately 14,000 years ago, mainland Australia was linked both to New Guinea and to Tasmania, the British Isles were an extension of continental Europe via the English Channel, and the dry basin of the South China Sea linked Sumatra, Java and Borneo to the Asian mainland.<br><br>The Bering Land Bridge is significant for several reasons, not least because it enabled human migration to the Americas from Asia about 12,000 years ago. Recent studies have indicated that of the people migrating across this land bridge during that time period, only 70 left their genetic print in modern descendents, a minute effective founder populationÂ— easily misread as though implying that only 70 people crossed to North America. Sea-going coastal settlers may also have crossed much earlier, but scientific opinion remains divided on this point and the coastal sites that would offer further information now lie submerged in up to a hundred metres of water offshore. Land animals were able to migrate through Beringia as well, bringing mammals that evolved in Asia to North America, mammals such as lions and cheetahs, which evolved into now-extinct endemic North American species, and exporting camelids that evolved in North America (and later became extinct there) to Asia.<br><br>The rise and fall of global sea levels has exposed the land bridge in several periods of the Pleistocene. The bridging land mass called "Beringia" is believed to have existed both in the glaciation that occurred before 35,000 BC and during the more recent period 22,000-7,000 YBP. By c. 6000 YBP the coastlines had assumed approximately their present configurations.<br><br>Beringia constantly transformed its ecology as the changing climate affected the environment, determining which plants and animals were able to survive. The land mass could be a barrier as well as a bridge: during colder periods, glaciers advanced and precipitation levels dropped. During warmer intervals clouds, rain and snow altered soils and drainage patterns. Fossil remains show that spruce, birch and poplars once grew beyond their northernmost modern range today, indicating there were periods when the climate was warmer and wetter. Mastodon, that depended on shrubs for food, were uncommon in the open dry tundra landscape characteristic of Beringia during the colder periods. In this tundra, mammoths also flourished.<br><br>It is likely that small groups of humans would have been able to cross the Bering Strait under conditions that favored a fully frozen route, without the necessity of a completely lowered ocean surface height. Native populations would typically find conditions that they would comprehend, and for whatever reason, would have crossed the divide under many opportunities as conditions warranted. So the extension of populations into the nether regions of North America would have been predominantly driven by social needs, as it would have been likely that some populations of humans would have occupied both sides of the Bering Straits in many prehistoric times.<br><br>Issue #356</div>

Borax may also be produced synthetically from other boron compounds.<br><br>Borax is widely used in detergents, water softeners, soaps, disinfectants, and pesticides. One of its most widely advertised uses was as a hand-cleaner for industrial workers. It is used in making enamel glazes, glass and strengthening pottery and ceramics. It is also easily converted to boric acid or borate, which have many applications.<br><br>Large amounts of borax pentahydrate are used for manufacturing insulating fibreglass and cellulose insulation as a fire retardant and anti-fungal compound. Large amounts are also used in production of sodium perborate monohydrate for use in detergents.<br><br>A mixture of borax and ammonium chloride is used as a flux when welding iron and steel. It lowers the melting point of the unwanted iron oxide (scale), allowing it to run off. Borax is also used mixed with water as a flux when soldering jewelry metals such as gold or silver. It allows the molten solder to flow evenly over the joint in question.<br><br>When used in a mixture, borax can be used to kill carpenter ants, and fleas. Borax is also an ingredient in Slime.<br><br>The origin of the name is traceable to the Persian word bÃ¼rah. The word was also used disparagingly in the 1940s to refer to tawdrily designed modernistic furniture and other works of industrial design. Some say that the use came from advertisement displays for the household clearer, though the use may also derive from the Yiddish word "borachs," meaning rented furniture.<br><br>Borax is also a food additive in some countries (it is banned in the United States), with E number E285. Its use is similar to salt, and it appears notably in French and Iranian caviar. Such caviar plays a key part in the book "Murder at the British Embassy" by Margaret Truman. Despite its use as an insecticide and reputation as a toxin, the LD50 toxicity of borax is about the same as that of table salt (both are around 3,000 mg/kg body mass)!<br><br>To create a pliable "slime-like" putty, mix 2.5 cups of water, 2 cups of PVA Glue, and 4 teaspoons of borax.<br><br>Issue #358</div>

Construction of the dam began in 1964 and was completed in 1968. The total cost was estimated at $209 million, with one-quarter of this amount used to resettle people displaced by the construction of the dam and its reservoir, Kainji Lake.<br><br><img src="http://img388.imageshack.us/img388/7073/dam8uw.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Kainji Dam</strong></span><br><br>The dam is one of the longest dams in the world. It extends for about 10 km (about 6 mi), including its saddle dam, which closes off a tributary valley. Most of the structure is made from earth, but the center section, housing the hydroelectric turbines, was built from concrete. This section is 65 m (215 ft) high.<br><br>The dam was designed to have a generating capacity of 960,000 kilowatts; however, only 10 of its 12 turbines have been installed, reducing the capacity to 800,000 kilowatts. The dam generates electricity for all the large cities in Nigeria. Some of the electricity is sold to neighboring Niger. In addition, occasional droughts have made the Niger's water flow unpredictable, diminishing the dam's electrical output. The dam has a single-lock chamber capable of lifting barges 49 m (160 ft). Kainji Lake measures about 135 km (about 84 mi) long and about 30 km (about 19 mi) at its widest point, and supplies a local fishing industry.<br><br>Issue #359</div>

The wall stretches 60 kilometres (37 miles) from Old Kirkpatrick in West Dunbartonshire on the Firth of Clyde to Bo'ness, Falkirk, on the Firth of Forth. The wall was intended to replace Hadrian's Wall 160 km (100 miles) to the south, as the frontier of Britannia, but while the Romans did establish temporary forts and camps north of the wall, they did not conquer the Caledonians, and the Antonine Wall suffered many attacks. The Romans called the land north of the wall Caledonia.<br><br>The Antonine Wall was inferior to Hadrian's Wall in terms of scale and construction, but it was still an impressive achievement, considering that it was completed in only two years, at the northern edge of the Roman empire in what they perceived as a cold and hostile land. The wall was typically an earth bank, about four metres high, with a wide ditch on the north side, and a military way or road on the south. The Romans initially planned to build forts every six miles, but this was soon revised to every two miles, resulting in a total of 19 forts along the wall. The best preserved but also one of the smallest forts is Rough Castle Fort.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Hadrians_Wall_map.png/300px-Hadrians_Wall_map.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Location of Hadrian's Wall and the Antonine Wall in Scotland and Northern England.</span><br><br>The wall was abandoned after only 20 years, when the Roman legions withdrew to Hadrian's Wall in AD 164. After a series of attacks in AD 197, Emperor Septimius Severus arrived in Scotland in AD 208 to secure the frontier, and repaired parts of the wall. Although this re-occupation only lasted a few years, the wall is sometimes referred to (by later Roman historians) as the Severan Wall.<br><br>Although most of the wall has been destroyed over time, sections of the wall can still be seen in Bearsden, Kirkintilloch, Twechar, Croy, Falkirk and Polmont.<br><br>Issue #361</div>
