This Golden Spruce was sacred to the Haida people as well as a popular tourist attraction. The 300 year old tree was illegally cut down by Grant Hadwin on January 22nd of 1997 as an apparent political protest against the logging companies. Botanists from the University of British Columbia took cuttings from the fallen tree so that this unique form of tree would not be lost forever, and have since offered a number of seedlings to the Haida people to have replanted.<br><br>The islands are home to a wide variety of other large native trees, including the Western Redcedar, Nootka Cypress, Shore Pine, Western Hemlock, Mountain Hemlock, and Red alder.<br><br>Another rare natural occurrence that was popular amongst tourists to Haida Gwaii was the <span style="font-style: italic;">White Raven</span>. This was a completely albino raven that was often mistaken for an eagle or seagull due to its unusual colouring. The White Raven lived around Port Clements and would commonly be seen taking food hand-outs from locals and visitors alike. It died after making contact with an electrical transformer, temporarily knocking out power to the town and surrounding area.<br><br>Some 6,000 people live on the islands. Their economy is resource-based with logging and commercial fishing being the most important. Service industries and government jobs maintain about one-third of the employment rolls. In recent years tourism has started to become a more prominent part of the economy, especially for fishing and tour guides, cycling, camping and adventure tourism.<br><br>The archipelago was visited in 1774 by Juan PÃ©rez and in 1778 by Capt. James Cook. In 1787 the islands were surveyed by Capt. George Dixon. The islands were named by Capt. Dixon after one of his ships, the Queen Charlotte, which was named after <span style="font-style: italic;">Queen Charlotte</span>, wife of King George III of the United Kingdom.<br><br>The archipelago seems to have escaped much of the glaciation of the last ice age. That, and its subsequent isolation from the mainland, has produced what some call the "Galapagos of the North," a unique biological zone with many unusual animals and plants. Its climate, like that of the rest of the British Columbia and Alaskan coast in the area, is moderated by the Kuroshio Current, and features considerable precipitation and relatively mild temperatures year round.<br><br>The artwork known as <span style="font-style: italic;">Haida Gwaii</span>, by Bill Reid, is featured on the reverse side of the Canadian $20 bill. The piece depicts the Spirit of Haida Gwaii in a canoe, accompanied by the mythic messengers. Haida art is also frequently seen on large monumental sized cedar totem poles and even as cartoons in the form of Haida Manga.<br><br>Issue #191</div>

Over the millennia, it cut a deep channel for itself through the surrounding granite, at a rate of about one foot every 2,500 years. The gorge's peculiar shape, contrasted to broad canyons such as the Grand Canyon, can be attributed to this long, direct erosion through hard rock.<br><br>Before European settlement, Native Americans of the Ute people wintered in Royal Gorge for its protection from wind and relatively mild climate. The Comanche, Kiowa, Sioux, and Cheyenne used Royal Gorge on buffalo hunting expeditions as an access point to mountain meadow regions such as South Park Basin.<br><br>Colorado's Rocky Mountain region fell under Spanish claims, and conquistador expeditions of the 17th century or fur traders may have seen Royal Gorge in their traversal of the area. The first recorded instance of a European arrival, however, is the Pike expedition of 1806.

The consequent Royal Gorge Railroad War between crews of the Santa Fe Railroad and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande. Royal Gorge was a bottleneck along the Arkansas too narrow for both rail lines to go through, with no other reasonable access to the South Park area.

Generally hundreds of meters wide, black smokers are formed when superheated water from below the Earth's crust comes through the ocean floor. They are rich in dissolved minerals from the crust, most notably sulfides, which crystallize to create a chimney-like structure around the vent. When the superheated water in the vent comes in contact with the frigid ocean water, many minerals are precipitated, creating the distinctive black color. The metal sulfides that are deposited can become massive sulfide ore deposits in time.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Nur04506.jpg/406px-Nur04506.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Nur04506.jpg/180px-Nur04506.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A <strong>black smoker</strong> in the Atlantic Ocean</span><br><br>Black smokers were first discovered in 1977 around the GalÃ¡pagos Islands by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They were observed using a small submersible vehicle called Alvin. Today, black smokers are known to exist in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, at an average depth of 2100 meters. The temperature of the water they vent can reach 400 Â°C, but does not boil due to the high pressure it is under at that depth. The water is also extremely acidic, often having a pH value as low as 2.8 Â— approximately that of vinegar.<br><br><strong>Black smoker ecosystem</strong><br><br>Although life is very sparse at these depths, black smokers are the center of entire ecosystems. Sunlight is nonexistent, so many organisms Â— such as archaea and extremophiles Â— must convert the heat, methane, and sulfur compounds provided by black smokers into energy through a process called chemosynthesis. In turn, more complex life forms like clams and tubeworms feed on these organisms. The organisms at the base of the food chain also deposit minerals into the base of the black smoker, thus completing the life cycle.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/Deep_sea_vent_chemistry_diagram.jpg/800px-Deep_sea_vent_chemistry_diagram.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/Deep_sea_vent_chemistry_diagram.jpg/400px-Deep_sea_vent_chemistry_diagram.jpg"><br></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Deep sea vent biogeochemical cycle diagram</span><br><br>A bacterium that uses photosynthesis has been found living near a black smoker off the coast of Mexico.

It is often called by a plural form: the <span style="font-style: italic;">Straits of Gibraltar</span>, or a short form: Strog (STRait Of Gibraltar) as it is known in the Navy circles.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Strait_of_gibraltar.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Strait_of_gibraltar.jpg/350px-Strait_of_gibraltar.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The <strong>Strait of Gibraltar</strong> as seen from space.</span><br><br>The name comes from the Arabic name of "Jebel Tariq" meaning Tariq's mountain. It refers to the Berber Muslim general Tariq ibn-Ziyad who conquered Spain in 711.<br><br>On the northern side is Spain and Gibraltar, on the southern side Morocco and Ceuta (a Spanish exclave in North Africa). Its boundaries were known to antiquity as the Pillars of Hercules. There are some small islands, like the disputed Isla Perejil, that is claimed by Spain and Morocco.<br><br>The Strait of Gibraltar has a very strategic location. Ships that travel from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and vice versa, pass through this strait overlooked by the Rock of Gibraltar. Also, very many people who travel from Europe to Africa and vice versa, travel through this strait. During World War II, the British controlled the straits from their nearby base. German submarines entering the Mediterranean Sea were effectively trapped, because they couldn't leave on the surface and the undersea currents were too strong to leave underwater.<br><br>The depth is about 300 m, and it is about 14 km wide at its narrowest point.<br><br>For a number of years the Spanish and Moroccan governments have been jointly investigating the feasibility of a tunnel underneath the strait, similar to the Channel tunnel between England and France. A new three-year study for a railway tunnel was announced in 2003.<br><br>Also, a group of American and British engineers have studied the feasibility of building a bridge to span the straits. Such a bridge would be of a combination suspension-truss design and would dwarf any existing bridge in height (over 3,000 feet) and length (15 km). The 1979 science fiction novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fountains of Paradise</span> by Arthur C. Clarke featured such a bridge.<br><br>The all-but-landlocked Mediterranean has an evaporation rate higher than the combined inflow of all the rivers that empty into it. The sill of the Strait of Gibraltar acts to limit mixing of water between the cold, less saline Atlantic and the warm Mediterranean waters, which are so much saltier that they sink below the constantly incoming Atlantic water and form a highly saline (<span style="font-style: italic;">thermohaline</span>, both warm and salty) bottom water, called the Mediterranean Outflow; it flows out and down the continental slope, losing salinity, until it equilibrates after mixing at a depth of about 1000 m. The Mediterranean outflow water can be traced for thousands of kilometres before losing its identity.<br><br>Some 5 million years ago, the Strait closed, effectively turning the Mediterranean into a huge salty lake that eventually dried up, in what is known as the Messinian Salinity Crisis.<br><br>Issue #207</div>

Actually, almost any waterfall can produce a moonbow under ideal conditions; however, many comparable sites have too much light for this feature to be visible.<br><br><strong>History and preservation</strong><br><br>Long known to Native Americans of the area, Cumberland Falls received its name from Zachary Green, whose party discovered it during an expedition in 1770. From the 1860s to the 1930s, Cumberland Falls and the surrounding land were privately held. The Moonbow Inn, a popular hotel dating to around 1875, was perched on a ledge overlooking the falls.<br><br>The area was a favorite vacation destination for T. Coleman DuPont, a Kentucky native and U.S. Senator from Delaware. Disturbed by plans to build a hydroelectric dam at the site, in 1930 DuPont purchased and donated 600 acres (2.4 kmÂ²) surrounding the falls to Kentucky, urging the commonwealth to set aside the property as a state park. Despite DuPont's death later that year, additional land was purchased, and in 1933 the state legislature designated the property as Kentucky's third state park. Much of the early work at the park, including construction of DuPont Lodge and cabins for guests, was undertaken during the Great Depression by Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and Works Progress Administration (WPA) employees.<br><br>With a reported 700,000 to 1 million visitors per year, the park remains one of Kentucky's busiest and most profitable state parks.<br><br>Issue #208</div>

Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from southern New Mexico to the Big Bend National Park has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Riogrande_watershed.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The watershed of the Rio Grande</span><br><br>The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1,147 m (3,762 feet) above sea level. In New Mexico the river flows through the Rio Grande Rift from one sediment-filled basin to another, cutting canyons between the basins and supporting a fragile bosque ecosystem in its floodplain. From El Paso eastward the river flows through desert. Only in the sub-tropical lower Rio Grande Valley is there extensive irrigated agriculture. The river ends in a small sandy delta at the Gulf of Mexico. During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.<br><br>Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in Lake Cabeza de Vaca. But about 1 million years ago the stream was "captured" and began to flow east.<br><br>Issue #214</div>
