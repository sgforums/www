It is located in the floor of the western North Pacific Ocean, to the east of the Mariana Islands at 11Â° 21' North latitude and 142Â° 12' East longitude, which is near Japan. The trench is the boundary where two tectonic plates meet, a subduction zone where the Pacific Plate is being subducted under the Philippine Plate. The bottom of the trench is further below sea level than Mount Everest is above sea level. The trench has a maximum depth of 10,911 m (35,798 feet) below sea level. Taking into account its latitude and the Earth's equatorial bulge, this puts it at 6,366.4 km from the centre of the Earth. The Arctic ocean, on the other hand, is ~4 km deep, which would put its floor at ~6,352.8 km from the Earth's centre, 13.6 km closer.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Pacific_Ocean.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/180px-Pacific_Ocean.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Mariana Trench on Pacific Ocean map</span><br><br>It was first surveyed in 1951 by the British navy vessel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Challenger II</span>, which gave its name to the deepest part of the trench, the Challenger Deep. Using echo sounding, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Challenger II</span> measured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 m) at 11Â° 19' N, 142Â° 15' E. This sounding was repeatedly made using earphones to hear the return of the signal as the stylus passed across the graduated depth scale, whilst the timing of the speed of the echo-sounding machine, a necessary part of the process, was made with a hand held stopwatch. For these reasons it was considered prudent to subtract one scale division (of 20 fm) when officially reporting a new greatest depth of 5,940 fm (10,863 m) (see <a href="http://www.soc.soton.ac.uk/OTHERS/CSMS/OCHAL/deep.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a>).<br><br>In 1957, the Russian vessel <span style="font-style: italic;">Vityaz</span> reported a depth of 11,034 m (36,201 ft), dubbed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mariana Hollow</span>; this measurement has never been replicated and is not considered accurate. In 1962 the M.V. <span style="font-style: italic;">Spencer F. Baird</span> recorded a greatest depth of 10,915 m (35,810 ft). In 1984 the Japanese sent the <span style="font-style: italic;">Takuyo</span>, a highly specialized survey vessel out to the Mariana Trench and collected data using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; they reported a maximum depth of 10,924 m (35,840 ft) (see <a href="http://www.soc.soton.ac.uk/OTHERS/CSMS/OCHAL/deep.htm" rel="nofollow">link</a>) (this is also reported as 10,920Â±10 m, see <a href="http://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/GIJUTSUKOKUSAI/ICO/nl45.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>).

The onboard systems indicated a depth of 37,800 ft (11,521 m), but this was later revised to 35,813 ft (10,916 m).

Some suggest that it refers to the mineral-rich red mountains nearby, which are indeed called "Mounts of the Edomites" or "the Rubi mountains" in Hebrew language.

The southern part is called the Phuket chain, the northern part is the Tenasserim chain, which continues for 400 km until the Three Pagodas Pass.<br><br><strong>Kra Canal</strong><br><br>As the Malay Peninsula enlarges the shipping routes around Asia significantly, a canal through the Kra Isthmus was suggested as early as 1677, when the Thai King Narai the Great asked the French engineer de Lamar to survey the possibility of building a waterway to connect Songkhla with Marid (now Myanmar). It turned out to be impractical with the technology of that time. In 1793 the idea resurfaced when the younger brother of King Chakri (Rama I) suggested it to make it easier to protect the western coast with military ships. Also in the early 18th century the British East India Company became interested in a canal. After Burma became a British colony in 1863 with Victoria Point opposite the Kra estuary as its southernmost point, an exploration was undertaken, but again with negative result. In 1882 the constructor of the Suez canal, Ferdinand de Lesseps, visited the area, but wasn't allowed to investigate in detail by the Thai king. In 1897 Thailand and the British empire agreed not to build a canal there, to protect the regional dominance of the harbour of Singapore.<br><br>In the 20th century the idea resurfaced several times again, now changing the preferred route to connect the Bandon Bay near Surat Thani with Phangnga. The idea is still entertained by a few Thai politicians today, however the high costs as well as ecological problems make it unlikely to be realized in the near future.

A gravity dam, it was 1,900 m long and 54 m high. The initial design was soon found to be inadequate and the height of the dam was raised in two phases, 1907Â–1912 and 1929Â–1933.<br><br>When the dam almost overflowed in 1946 it was decided that rather than raise the dam a third time a second dam would be built 6 km up-river. Proper planning began in 1952, just after the Nasser revolution, and at first the US was to help finance construction with a loan of USD $270 million. The aid offer was withdrawn in mid-1956 when Egypt formally recognised the People's Republic of China. The Egyptian government intended to continue the project alone and use the revenues of the Suez Canal to help pay for construction. But in the Cold War struggle for influence in Africa the Soviet Union stepped in 1958 and possibly a third of the cost of the dam was paid for as a gift. They also provided technicians and heavy machinery. The enormous rock and clay dam was designed by the Russian Zuk Hydroproject Institute.<br><br>Construction began in 1960. The High Dam, El Saad al Aali, was completed on July 21, 1970, with the first stage finished in 1964. The reservoir began filling in 1964 while the dam was still under construction and first reached capacity in 1976. The reservoir raised concerns from archaeologists and a rescue operation was begun in 1960 under UNESCO. Sites were surveyed and excavated and 24 major monuments were moved to safer locations or granted to countries that helped with the works (such as the Debod temple in Madrid).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/AswanHighDam_Egypt.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/AswanHighDam_Egypt.jpg/220px-AswanHighDam_Egypt.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Aswan High Dam</span><br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Aswan_High_Dam.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/Aswan_High_Dam.jpg/220px-Aswan_High_Dam.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">NASA satellite image of Aswan High Dam</span><br><br><strong>Benefits</strong><br><br>The Aswan High Dam is 3,600 m in length, 980 m wide at the base, 40 m wide at the crest and 111 m tall. It contains 43 million mÂ³ of material. At maximum, 11,000 mÂ³ of water can pass through the dam every second. There are further emergency spillways for an extra 5000 mÂ³ per second and the Toshka canal links the reservoir to the Toshka depression. The reservoir, named Lake Nasser, is 480 km long and 16 km at its widest with a surface area of 6,000 kmÂ² and holds 150 to 165 kmÂ³. It flooded much of lower Nubia and over 90,000 people were displaced. With hydroelectric output of 2.1 gigawatts, the dam holds twelve generators each rated at 175 megawatts. Power generation began in 1967. When the dam first reached peak output it produced around half of Egypt's entire electricity production (about 15% by 1998<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) and allowed for the connection of most Egyptian villages to electricity for the first time. The effects of dangerous floods in 1964 and 1973 and of threatening droughts in 1972Â–73 and 1983Â–84 were mitigated. A new fishing industry has been created around Lake Nasser, though it is struggling due to its distance from any significant markets.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/High_Dam_Burg%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg/800px-High_Dam_Burg%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/High_Dam_Burg%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg/220px-High_Dam_Burg%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A view from the vantage point in the middle of High Dam towards the "Lotus Flower" tower. This tower was built as an Egyptian-Soviet friendship monument to underline the fact that Soviet Union helped in construction of High Dam.</span><br><br><strong>Environmental issues</strong><br><br>In addition to the benefits, however, damming the Nile caused a number of environmental issues. The silt which made the Nile region fertile is instead held at the dam, leading to (expected) silting of the reservoir, which will eventually (an estimated 500 years) render Lake Nasser useless for water storage volume.<br><br>There is some erosion of farmland down-river. Erosion of coastline barriers, due to lack of new sediments from floods, will eventually cause loss of the brackish water lake fishery that is currently the largest source of fish for Egypt, and the subsidence of the Nile Delta will lead to inundation of northern portion of the delta with seawater, in areas which are now used for rice crops. The delta itself, no longer renewed by Nile silt has lost much of its fertility. The red-brick construction industry, which used delta mud, is also severely affected. There is significant erosion of coastlines (due to lack of sand, which was once brought by the Nile) all along the eastern Mediterranean.<br><br>The need to use artificial fertilizers supplied by international corporations is controversial too, causing chemical pollution which the traditional river silt did not. Indifferent irrigation control has also caused some farmland to be damaged by waterlogging and increased salinity, a problem complicated by the reduced flow of the river, which allows salt water further into the delta. Mediterranean fish stocks are also impacted by the dam. The eastern basin of the Mediterranean is low in fertility, and traditionally the marine ecosystem depended on the rich flow of phosphate and silicates from the Nile outflow. Mediterranean catches decreased by almost half after the dam was constructed, but appear to be recovering. The dam has been implicated in a rise in cases of schistosomiasis (bilharzia), due to the thick plant life that has grown up in Lake Nasser, which hosts the snails who carry the disease.<br><br>The construction of the dam also had a major political effect. Lake Nasser is huge, and almost all of Egypt's population lives in the Nile valley. This means that if the dam were to be destroyed, the resulting flood would effectively destroy Egypt completely. It has been rumoured that during the Yom Kippur War the dam Â– heavily defended by flak Â– was paint-bombed by Israeli Air Force aircraft, and it has been further suggested that this was a major factor in Anwar Sadat's decision to make peace with Israel at Camp David.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/High_Dam_Burg_Memorial_Wall%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg/800px-High_Dam_Burg_Memorial_Wall%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/High_Dam_Burg_Memorial_Wall%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg/220px-High_Dam_Burg_Memorial_Wall%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A wall commemorating the completion of Aswan High Dam</span><br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/High_Dam_Burg_Closeup%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg/383px-High_Dam_Burg_Closeup%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/High_Dam_Burg_Closeup%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg/136px-High_Dam_Burg_Closeup%2C_Aswan%2C_Egypt%2C_Oct_2004.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A closeup view of the Soviet-Egyptian friendship monument</span><br><br>Issue #28</div>

In addition to its use as a military fortification, it is thought that the gates through the wall would also have served as customs posts to allow trade to be taxed.<br><br>A significant portion of the wall still exists, particularly the mid-section, and for much of its length, the wall can be followed on foot. It is the most popular tourist attraction in Northern England, where it is often known simply as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Roman Wall</span>.

English Heritage describes it as "the most important monument built by the Romans in Britain".<br><br><strong>Route</strong><br><br>Hadrian's Wall ran for 120 km, virtually due west, from Wallsend on the River Tyne to the shore of the Solway Firth. The A69 road follows the course of the wall as it starts in Newcastle-on-Tyne to Carlisle, then on round the northern coast of Cumbria. The wall is entirely in England and south of the border with Scotland by 15 km in the west and 110 km in the east.<br><br><strong>Hadrian</strong><br><br>Hadrian's Wall was built following a visit by Roman emperor Hadrian. Hadrian was experiencing military difficulties not just in Britain, but from the peoples of various conquered lands across the Empire, including Egypt, Judea, Libya, Mauretania, and many of the peoples conquered by his predecessor Trajan, so was keen to impose order. However the construction of such an impressive wall was probably also built as a symbol of Roman power, both in occupied Britain and in Rome.<br><br>Frontiers in the early empire were based more on natural features or fortified zones with a heavy military presence. Military roads or <span style="font-style: italic;">limes</span> often marked the border, with forts and signal towers spread along them and it was not until the reign of Domitian that the first solid frontier was constructed, in Germania Superior, using a simple fence. Hadrian expanded on this idea, redesigning the German border by ordering a continuous timber palisade supported by forts behind it. Although such defences would not have held back any concerted invasion effort, they did physically mark the edge of Roman territory and go some way to providing a degree of control of who crossed the border and where they did it.<br><br>Hadrian reduced Roman military presence in the territory of the Brigantes and concentrated on building a more solid linear fortification to the north of them. This was intended to replace the Stanegate road which had previously served as the limes.<br><br>Issue #29</div>

Local stone was used in the construction of the early wall, except for almost half the route, to the west of Irthing where turf was used instead as there were no useful outcrops nearby. The turf wall was 6 metres wide and around 3.5 m high. Fortlets in this area were also built from timber and earth rather than stone.<br><br>The milecastles were of three different designs, depending on which Roman legion built them. The Second, Sixth and Twentieth Legions whose inscriptions tell us were all involved in the construction. Similarly there are three different turret designs along the route. All were about 493 m apart and measured 4.27 m square internally.<br><br>Construction was divided into lengths of about 5 miles. One group of each legion would create the foundations and built the milecastles and turrets and then other cohorts would follow, building the wall itself. Sometime during this initial construction however, the plans were changed and was decided to incorporate the larger garrison forts into the wall itself rather than setting them to the south. The eastern end of the wall was extended further east from Pons Aelius (Newcastle) to Wallsend on the Tyne estuary. This length is called the Narrow Wall as it was only 8 Roman feet thick and may have been reduced in size due to the decision to move the garrison forts onto the wall itself.<br><br>Some of the larger forts along the wall, such as Chesters and Housesteads were built on top of the footings of milecastles or turrets, showing the change of plan and an inscription mentioning early governor Aulus Platorius Nepos indicates that the change of plans took place early on. In all, 12 large forts were added to the wall, each c. 7.3 Roman miles apart.<br><br>Once construction had begun, the Vallum or Fosstum was built on the southern side. It consisted of a large, flat bottomed ditch 6 m wide at the top and 3 m deep bounded by a berm on each side 10 m wide. Beyond the berms were earth banks 6m wide and 2 m high. Causeways crossed the ditch at every fort and at one of the milecastles. Initially the berm appears to have been the main route for transportation along the wall.<br><br>The Wall was thus part of a defensive system which, from north to south included:<br><br>-- a glacis and a deep ditch armed with rows of pointed stakes<br>-- the Wall itself<br>-- a later military road (the "Military Way"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>)<br>-- the VallumÂ—two huge banks with a ditch between. The Vallum probably delineated a military zone rather than intending to be a major fortification, though the British tribes to the south were also sometimes a military problem.<br><br><strong>Garrison</strong><br><br>The wall was garrisoned by a mixture of legionary units and auxiliary units of the army (non-citizens). Their numbers fluctuated throughout the occupation, but may have been around 9,000 strong in general, including infantry and cavalry. The new forts could hold garrisons of 500 men whilst cavalry units of 1000 troops were stationed at either end. The total number of soldiers manning the early wall was probably greater than 10,000.<br><br>They suffered serious attacks in 180, and especially between 196 and 197 when the garrison had been seriously weakened, following which major reconstruction had to be carried out under Septimius Severus. After the harsh suppression of the tribes under Septimius, the region near the wall remained peaceful for most of the rest of the 200s. It is thought that many in the garrison may have married and integrated into the local community.<br><br><strong>Decline</strong><br><br>As the Empire declined, by 400 the garrison had abandoned the wall and it fell into disuse. A large proportion of the stone was reused in other local buildings. This continued until the 20th century.<br><br><strong>Other fortifications</strong><br><br>The first Roman fortification in Scotland was the Gask Ridge, a series of forts north of the Clyde and Forth estuaries in Perthshire. This was soon abandoned for Hadrian's Wall. Fifteen years after completion of the Hadrian's Wall, a turf fortification, the Antonine Wall, was built to run between the Clyde and Forth. This wall was considerably shorter than Hadrian's Wall, but was manned by roughly the same number of troops. In some ways the Antonine Wall was more sophisticated, including large platforms for ballista. Within one generation the Antonine Wall had been abandoned, and Hadrian's Wall was reoccupied.<br><br>Issue #29</div>

It also covers a part of Tennessee, near Reelfoot Lake, extending southeast into Dyersburg.<br><br><strong>Structure</strong><br><br>The New Madrid Seismic Zone is made up of reactivated faults that formed when North America began to split or rift apart during the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic Era (about 750 million years ago). The rift failed, but remained as a scar or zone of weakness. During the Mesozoic Era (about 200 million years ago), as the Atlantic Ocean was opening in the east, rifting was once again re-activated and intrusive igneous rocks were emplaced. But again the rifting failed and the continent remained intact, although with a significant zone of weakness. This rift is known as the Reelfoot Rift and coincides with the northernmost portion of the Mississippi embayment. Most of the seismicity is located from 5 to 25 km beneath the Earth's surface.<br><br>The red zones on the map above indicate the epicenter locations of hundreds of minor earthquakes recorded since the 1970s. Two trends are apparent. First is the general NE-SW trend paralleling the trend of the Reelfoot Rift. The second is the intense cross trend, NW-SE, that occurs just southwest of New Madrid. This second trend coincides with an intrusive igneous body which lies deeply buried beneath the sediments of the rift zone. Several other bodies of deeply buried intrusive rock are known to exist within the seismic zone. The depths of these igneous rock bodies closely corresponds to the depth of the seismic activity.<br><br><strong>In New Madrid</strong><br><br>The zone is named after the town of New Madrid, Missouri, the site of three of the most severe North American earthquakes in recorded history, including:<br><br>- December 16, 1811<br>- January 23, 1812<br>- February 7, 1812 was the strongest, with estimated magnitude exceeding 8<br><br><strong>In the fault zone</strong><br><br>The New Madrid fault zone lies within the central Mississippi River valley, extending from northeast Arkansas, through southeast Missouri, western Tennessee, western Kentucky to southern Illinois. Historically, this area has been the site of some of the largest earthquakes in North America. Between 1811 and 1812, four catastrophic earthquakes, with magnitude estimates greater than 7.0 on the Richter scale, occurred during a 3 month period. Hundreds of aftershocks followed over a period of several years. The largest earthquakes to have occurred since then were on January 4, 1843 and October 31, 1895 with magnitude estimates of 6.0 and 6.2 respectively. In addition to these events, seven events of magnitude &gt;= 5.0 have occurred in the area. Instruments were installed in and around this area in 1974 to closely monitor seismic activity. Since then, more than 4000 earthquakes have been located, most of which are too small to be felt. On average one earthquake per year will be large enough to be felt in the area.<br><br><strong>More quakes predicted</strong><br><br>The potential for the recurrence of large earthquakes and their impact today on densely populated cities in and around the seismic zone has generated much research devoted to understanding earthquakes. By closely monitoring the earthquake activity, scientists can hope to understand their causes, recurrence rates, ground motion and disaster mitigation. The probability for an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or greater is significant in the near future, with a 90% chance of such an earthquake by the year 2040.<br><br><strong>Historical catastrophes</strong><br><br>These catastrophic earthquakes occurred during a three-month period in December 1811 and early 1812. They caused changes in the course of the Mississippi River, which rolled backwards temporarily, and were felt as far away as New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, where churchbells rang. Large areas sank into the earth, fissures opened, lakes permanently drained, new lakes were formed, and forests were destroyed over an area of 150,000 acres (600 kmÂ²). Many houses at New Madrid were thrown down. "Houses, gardens, and fields were swallowed up" one source notes. But fatalities and damage were low, because the area was sparsely settled.

Several wild tours venture away from the developed parts of the cave into muddy crawls and dusty tunnels.<br><br>The Echo River Tour, one of the cave's most famous attractions, used to take visitors on a boat ride along an underground river. The tour was discontinued for logistic and environmental reasons in the early 1990s  (see <a href="http://www.nps.gov/maca/FAQ.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>).<br><br>Interested members of the public can join an Earthwatch.org sponsored field survey of the history of Mammoth Cave (see <a href="http://www.earthwatch.org/expeditions/crothers.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>).

In particular, such production makes heavy use of water and causes greater groundwater pollution.

He is noted for devising a system of latitude and longitude and computing the size of the Earth.<br><br>Eratosthenes studied at Alexandria and for some years in Athens. In 236 BC he was appointed by Ptolemy III Euergetes I as librarian of the Alexandrian library. He made several important contributions to mathematics and science, and was a good friend to Archimedes. Around 255 BC he invented the armillary sphere, which was widely used until the invention of the orrery in the 18th century.<br><br>He calculated the earth's circumference circa 240 BC, using trigonometry and knowledge of the angle of elevation of the Sun at noon in Alexandria and Syene (now Aswan, Egypt). The calculation is based on the assumption that the Earth is spherical and that the Sun is so far away that its rays can be taken as parallel.<br><br>Eratosthenes knew that on the summer solstice at local noon on the Tropic of Cancer, the Sun would appear at the zenith, directly overhead- though Syene was in fact slightly north of the tropic. He also knew, from measurement, that in his hometown of Alexandria, the angle of elevation of the Sun would be 7Â° south of the zenith at the same time. Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene- Alexandria is in fact on a more westerly longitude- he concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Syene must be 7/360 of the total circumference of the Earth. The distance between the cities was known from caravan travellings to be about 5,000 stadia. He established a final value of 700 stadia per degree, which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia. The exact size of the <span style="font-style: italic;">stadion</span> he used is no longer known (the common Attic <span style="font-style: italic;">stadion</span> was about 185 m), but it is generally believed that Eratosthenes' value corresponds to between 39,690 km and 46,620 km. The circumference of the Earth around the poles is now measured at around 40,008 km.
