Famous for its brutal extremes of heat, the valley floor at Badwater Basin is the location of the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere (N36Â° 13.961' W116Â° 46.700'), at 282 feet (86 m) below sea level. The entire valley is located within Death Valley National Park.<br><br>The valley is located southeast of the Sierra Nevada range in the Great Basin. It is bounded on the east by the Grapevine Mountains, Funeral Mountains, and Amargosa Range. It is bounded on the west by the Cottonwood Mountains and the Panamint Range. The geological configuration is considered one of the best examples of the Basin and Range configuration.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/Death_Valley_from_space.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/Death_Valley_from_space.JPG/250px-Death_Valley_from_space.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Panamint Range, Death Valley, and the Black Mountains as seen from the Space Shuttle (NASA image)</span><br><br>The valley radiates extreme amounts of heat, allowing for temperatures that are among the hottest on earth. The hottest temperature recorded in the U.S., and the second hottest in the world, was 134Â°F (56.6Â°C) at Greenland Ranch near the valley on July 10, 1913. The valley receives less than 2 in (5 cm) of rain annually. The Amargosa River and Furnace Creek flow through the valley, disappearing into the sands of the valley floor.<br><br>While there is very little rain in Death Valley, the valley is prone to flooding during heavy rains, because the soil is unable to absorb the bulk of the water. The runoff can produce dangerous flash floods. In August 2004 such flooding occurred, causing two deaths and shutting down the national park.<br><br>During the late Pleistocene, the valley was indundated by prehistoric Lake Manly. The valley received its name in 1849 during the California gold rush by emigrants who sought to cross the valley on their way to the gold fields. During the 1850s, gold and silver were extracted in the valley. In the 1880s borax was discovered and extracted by mule-drawn wagons.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Death-valley-sar.jpg/287px-Death-valley-sar.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Death-valley-sar.jpg/180px-Death-valley-sar.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This False-color radar image shows central Death Valley and the different surface types in the area.

They are Pacific signatures of the global ENSO phenomenon (El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation). Their effect on climate in the southern hemisphere is profound. Their role in global warming or cooling is an area of active research, with no clear consensus yet.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5a/El-nino.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/El-nino.gif/400px-El-nino.gif"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chart of ocean surface temperature anomaly [Â°C] during the last strong El NiÃ±o in December 1997.</span><br><br><strong>El NiÃ±o</strong><br><br>El NiÃ±o was originally recognized by fishermen off the coast of South America (Peru and Ecuador) as the appearance of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean. El NiÃ±o is the warming of the surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean that occurs at irregular intervals of 2-7 years, usually lasting 1-2 years. Along the west coast of South America near the end of each calendar year, a warm current of nutrient-poor tropical water replaces the cold, nutrient-rich surface water of the Humboldt Current which fish prefer. Because this condition often occurs around Christmas, local fishermen named it El NiÃ±o (Spanish for boy child, referring to the Child Jesus). In most years the warming lasts only a few weeks or a month, after which the weather patterns return to normal and fishing improves. However, when El NiÃ±o conditions last for many months, more extensive ocean warming occurs and economic results can be disastrous.<br><br>Recent El NiÃ±os have occurred in 1986-1987, 1991-1992, 1993, 1994, 1997-1998, 2002-2003, and a new El NiÃ±o has been in effect since September 2004. The El NiÃ±o of 1997-1998 was particularly strong, while the period from 1990-1994 was unusual in that El NiÃ±os rarely occur in such rapid succession. They were generally weak, however.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Enso_elnino.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ENSO/El NiÃ±o state.<br>- Sea surface is warm in central and eastern Pacific.<br>- Less cold water is pulled up along west coast of South America.<br>- Hot air rises in central Pacific, travels east and west before cooling and descending. </span><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/Enso_normal.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ENSO normal state.<br>- Normal equatorial winds warm as they flow westward across the Pacific.<br>- Cold water is pulled up along west coast of South America.<br>- Warming water is pushed toward west side of Pacific.<br>- Sea surface is warm in the west.<br>- Hot air rises in western Pacific, travels eastward and cool air descends on South America.</span><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Enso_lanina.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">ENSO/La NiÃ±a state.<br>- Similar to ENSO normal state.<br>- Warm water accumulates in far western Pacific.<br>- Equatorial water is cooler than in the normal state.</span><br><br><strong>El NiÃ±o's effects</strong><br><br>El NiÃ±o's weather effects depend on the location, time of year, and the particular episode. In North America, typically, winters are warmer than normal in the upper midwest states and Canada, while central and southern California, northwest Mexico and the southeastern U.S., are wetter than normal. The Pacific Northwest states, on the other hand, tend to be drier during an El NiÃ±o. During a La NiÃ±a, by contrast, the midwestern U.S. tends to be drier than normal.<br><br>In South America, the effects of El NiÃ±o are rather direct and stronger than in North America. An El NiÃ±o is associated with very wet summers in the coasts of Northern Peru and Ecuador causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme. The effects during the months of February, March and April may become critical. Southern Brazil and Northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer. Central Chile receives large rainfall during winter, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events. The entire peruvian coast and parts of northern Chile experience above-normal temperatures and moist conditions for several consecutive months as well. Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts the Amazon River Basin, Colombia and Central America.<br><br>Australia and Indonesia experience as well direct effects of El NiÃ±o resulting in drier conditions, especially in Indonesia and along the eastern half of Australia.<br><br>Finally, Africa experiences droughts both in the Sahel region (northwest Africa) and in south-central Africa (Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana mainly).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-climate effects</span><br><br>Along the west coast of South America, El NiÃ±o reduces the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water that sustains large fish populations, that sustain abundant sea birds, whose droppings support the fertilizer industry. The local fishing industry, who named the annual appearance near Christmas of the El NiÃ±o effect, along the affected coastline suffers greatly during long-lasting El NiÃ±o events.<br><br><strong>La NiÃ±a</strong><br><br>In the Pacific, La NiÃ±a is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific, compared to El NiÃ±o, which is characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the same area. The La NiÃ±a condition often follows the El NiÃ±o, especially when the latter is strong. Strong La NiÃ±as occurred in 1988-1989 and 1998-2001, and weakly in 1995-1996.<br><br><strong>SOI</strong><br><br>The Southern Oscillation (SO) is a global-scale seesaw in atmospheric pressure between Indonesia/North Australia, and the southeast Pacific.

ENSO is the most prominent known source of interannual variability in weather and climate around the world (~3 to 8 years), though not all areas are affected. Global ENSO has signatures in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In the Pacific, during major warm events El NiÃ±o warming extends over much of the tropical Pacific and becomes clearly linked to the SOI intensity. While ENSO events are basically in phase between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, ENSO events in the Atlantic Ocean lag those in the Pacific by 12-to-18 months. Many of the countries most affected by ENSO events are developing countries within main continents (South America, Africa...), with economies that are largely dependent upon their agricultural and fishery sectors as a major source of food supply, employment, and foreign exchange. New capabilities to predict the onset of ENSO events in the three oceans can have global socio-economical impacts. While ENSO is a global and natural part of the Earth's climate, whether its intensity or frequency may change as a result of global warming is an important concern. Low-frequency variability has been evidenced. Interdecadal modulation of ENSO might exist.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Western Hemisphere Warm Pool</span><br><br>Study of climate records has found that about half of the summers after an El NiÃ±o have unusual warming in the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP).

The bay has a narrow entrance, just 230 m (754 ft) wide, called Neptunes Bellows. Adding to the hazard is Ravn Rock, which lies 2.5 m (8 ft) below the water in the middle of the channel. Just inside Neptunes Bellows lies the cove Whalers Bay, which is bordered by a large black sand beach.<br><br>Nevertheless, since the early 19th century Deception Island was a favorite refuge from the storms and icebergs of Antarctica. It was first used by sealers, then in 1906 a Norwegian-Chilean whaling company started using Whalers Bay as a base for a factory ship, the Gobernador Bories. Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were 13 factory ships based there.<br><br>The station did not actually process whale blubber, that being done on the ships, but instead took the carcasses and boiled them down to extract additional whale oil, using large iron boilers, and storing the results in iron tanks.<br><br>Whale oil prices dropped in the Great Depression, making the station uneconomic, and it was abandoned in 1931. Advances in factory ships made shore stations for carcass processing unnecessary, and so it was never reoccupied. 45 men were buried in the station's cemetery, but the cemetery was buried in a 1969 eruption, and the only remaining signs are the rusting boilers and tanks.<br><br>Other remains at Whalers Bay include an aircraft hangar with a bright orange derelict airplane fuselage outside, and the British scientific station house, with the middle torn out by the mudflows in 1969.<br><br>In the 1940s and 1950s, Argentina and the UK contested control of Deception Island with various tit-for-tat removals of each other's flags, and temporary occupation of the island.<br><br>On February 3, 1944 the British established a permanent base on Deception Island as part of Operation Tabarin, which was occupied until December 5, 1967, when a volcanic eruption forced a temporary withdrawal. It was used again between December 4, 1968 and Feburay 23, 1969, when further volcanic activity caused it to be abandoned.<br><br><a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/About_Antarctica/Heritage/Stations/deception_island.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/About_Antarctica/Heritage/Stations/deception_island_small.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">British Deception Island station</span><br><br>In 1961 Argentina's president Arturo Frondizi visited to show his country's interest.<br><br>The volcano has mostly taken care of other attempts to maintain permanent facilities, and as of 2000, there were only two scientific stations still in use, both summer-only - Spain has Gabriel de Castilla, and Argentina its Decepcion station.<br><br><strong>Ecology</strong><br><br>Deception Island has several colonies of chinstrap penguins, and it is possible to make a warm bath by digging into the sands of the beach, so it has become a popular tourist stop in Antarctica.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Penguins_on_deception_island_1962.jpg/800px-Penguins_on_deception_island_1962.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Penguins_on_deception_island_1962.jpg/200px-Penguins_on_deception_island_1962.jpg"></a><br><br>Issue #6</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong> is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the opening into the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. It connects the city of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula and a portion of the south-facing Marin County headlands near the small bayside town of Sausalito, and is located at <a href="http://kvaleberg.com/extensions/mapsources/index.php?params=37_49_N_122_29_W_300000" rel="nofollow">37Â°49' N 122Â°29' W</a>. The color of the bridge is orange vermilion, deemed International Orange. The color was selected by consulting architect Irving Morrow because it blends well with the natural surroundings yet enhances the bridge's visibility.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3e/GoldenGateBridge.jpg/800px-GoldenGateBridge.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3e/GoldenGateBridge.jpg/275px-GoldenGateBridge.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The <strong>Golden Gate Bridge</strong>.  View to the northwest, towards the Marin headlands.</span><br><br>Completed in 1937, it is widely considered one of the most beautiful examples of bridge engineering, both as an structural design challenge and for its aesthetic appeal. Its center span was the longest among suspension bridges until 1964 when the Verrazano Narrows Bridge was erected between the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City. In 1957, Michigan's Mackinac Bridge surpassed the Golden Gate Bridge's length between anchorages to become the world's longest suspension bridge in total length. The longest center suspension span in the world is currently the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge in Japan.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Golden_Gate_Bridge_from_underneath.jpg/800px-Golden_Gate_Bridge_from_underneath.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Golden_Gate_Bridge_from_underneath.jpg/180px-Golden_Gate_Bridge_from_underneath.jpg"></a><br><br>The bridge was the brainchild of Joseph Strauss, an engineer responsible for over 400 drawbridges, though they were far smaller than this project and mostly inland. Strauss spent over a decade drumming up support in Northern California. Strauss's initial proposal for this location was not at all pretty, being comprised of a massive cantilever on each side connected with a central suspension segment. Other key figures in the bridge's construction include architect Irving Morrow, responsible for the Art Deco touches and the choice of color, and engineer Charles Alton Ellis and bridge designer Leon Moisseiff, who collaborated on the complicated mathematics.<br><br>The construction of the bridge began on January 5, 1933 under the aegis of the Works Projects Administration (WPA), a program instigated by Franklin D. Roosevelt to create public works through federal funds and alleviate the effects of the Great Depression. It was completed in April 1937 and opened to pedestrians on May 27 of that year. The next day, President Roosevelt pushed a button in Washington, DC signaling the start of vehicle traffic over the Bridge. The cost to build it was $27 million. A unique aspect of the construction of this bridge was that a safety net was set up beneath it, significantly reducing the number of deaths that were typical for a construction project such as this in the early 1900s. Approximately 11 men were killed from falls during construction, and approximately 19 men were saved by the safety net. Most of the deaths occurred near completion when the net itself failed under the stress of a scaffold fall. Workers whose lives were saved by the safety nets became proud members of the (informal) Halfway to Hell Club.<br><br>The bridge is 1.22 miles (1970 m) long, the distance between the towers ("main span"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) is 4200 ft (1280 m), and their height is 746 feet (230 m) above the water.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/800px-Golden_Gate_Bridge_2003.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/400px-Golden_Gate_Bridge_2003.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Golden Gate Bridge with its approach arch over Fort Point at the San Francisco terminus</span><br><br>The bridge has been declared one of the modern Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was for many years the suspension bridge with the longest main span in the world, but was superseded by the 1298 m long Verrazano Narrows Bridge, New York City in 1964, and several other bridges since. It also had the world's tallest suspension towers at the time of construction, and retained that record until more recently.<br><br>Why isn't the bridge gold, as its name would suggest? International orange, the color of the bridge's paint, was chosen for its visibility in fog. The phrase Golden Gate refers to the strait that the bridge crosses, and this name predates the bridge.<br><br>As the only road to exit San Francisco to the north, the bridge is part of both United States Highway 101 and California State Route 1. The bridge has six total lanes of vehicle traffic, and walkways on both sides of the bridge. The median markers between the lanes are moved to conform to traffic patterns. On weekday mornings, traffic flows mostly southbound into the city, so four of the six lanes run southbound. Conversely, on weekday afternoons, four lanes run northbound. While there has been much demand and discussion concerning the installation of a movable barrier, no satisfactory solution has been committed to by the authorities. Usually, the eastern walkway is for pedestrians only, and the western walkway is for bicyclists only, although this can change during times of construction. Both walkways are closed to pedestrian traffic during the evening and at night.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Ggb_by_night_rotated.jpg/800px-Ggb_by_night_rotated.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Ggb_by_night_rotated.jpg/250px-Ggb_by_night_rotated.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Golden Gate Bridge by night, with downtown San Francisco in the background at far left.</span><br><br>On September 1, 2002, the toll for southbound motor vehicles was raised from $3.00 to $5.00.

On average, there is one jump every two weeks, with a total of over 1,300 suicides (the official count ended in 1995 when the number approached 1,000). More suicides take place on this bridge than on any other single structure in the world. Almost all people jump facing east, towards the bay, due largely to the fact that only the eastern side of the bridge is open to pedestrians. The 220-foot (67 m) fall takes four seconds and jumpers hit the water at 75 miles per hour (120 km/h). As of 2003, only 26 people have survived the jump. The survivors, many of whom report that they regretted the decision in mid-air, all struck the water feet first at a small angle and suffered multiple internal injuries and broken bones. In 2005, documentarian Eric Steel revealed that he had tricked the bridge committee into allowing him to film the bridge for months and had captured nearly 20 suicides on tape.<br><br>The bridge board has for decades resisted calls to add a suicide-prevention barrier to the four-foot (1.2 m) tall rail. However, on February 24, 2005, the bridge committee took the first steps towards approving a roughly $2 million barrier plan.<br><br>Issue #8</div>

In light of the hazards it poses to populated areas, it has been designated a Decade Volcano.<br><br>There is another <span style="font-style: italic;">Mount Merapi</span>, also volcanic, in Sumatra.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Merapi.jpeg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Merapi.jpeg/300px-Merapi.jpeg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Mount Merapi</strong> on the island of Java in Indonesia</span><br><br>Elevation: 2,911 metres (9,548 feet)<br>Latitude: 7Â° 5' S<br>Longitude:	110Â° 4' E<br>Location: Central Java, Indonesia<br>Type: Stratovolcano<br><br><strong>Geological history</strong><br><br>Merapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern Java. It is situated at a subduction zone, where the Indo-Australian Plate is sliding beneath the Eurasian Plate. Eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the lava emitted was basaltic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous andesitic lavas often generating lava domes. Dome collapse has often generated pyroclastic flows, and larger explosions which have resulted in eruption columns have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse.<br><br>Typically, small eruptions occur every 2-3 years, and larger ones every 10-15 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872 (the most violent eruption in recent history) and 1930 (13 villages destroyed and 1400 people killed by pyroclastic flows).<br><br>A very large eruption in 1006 covered all of central Java with ash. The volcanic devastation is believed to have led to the collapse of the Hindu Mataram civilization, and allowed Muslims to become the rulers of Java.<br><br><strong>Recent eruptions</strong><br><br>The volcano's most recent eruption began in 1992 and continued for ten years. During this time, a lava dome was extruded, growing by up to half a metre per day. In 1994, the dome reached the edge of the crater, and from then on, rockfall from the dome produced frequent pyroclastic flows. In late 1994 almost the entire dome collapsed, generating very large pyroclastic flows, which travelled several kilometres from the summit and killed 43 people.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a8/MerapiFromSpace.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/MerapiFromSpace.jpg/180px-MerapiFromSpace.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Satelite image of Mount Merapi. Taken on Aug 2003 by NASA.</span><br><br>Following the large eruption of November 1994, a new dome formed in the crater, and small explosive eruptions continued for several years, generating scores of lava avalanches and pyroclastic flows every day. Eruptions ended in late 2002.<br><br><strong>Monitoring</strong><br><br>Merapi is the site of a very active volcano monitoring program. Seismic monitoring began in 1924, and the eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. There is currently a network of 8 seismographs around the mountain, allowing volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the hypocentres of tremors and quakes. A zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the magma reservoir which feeds the eruptions.<br><br>Other measurements taken on the volcano include magnetic measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chamber beneath it is filling up.<br><br>Lahars are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by rain remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-frequency seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.<br><br><img src="http://volcano.und.nodak.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/southeast_asia/Merapi.gif"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Merapi is a stratovolcano with an active summit lava dome. It is located ~30 km immediately north of Yogyakarta, a city with a population of 500,000. Merapi has the unfortunate distinction of producing more nuee ardentes than any other volcano on Earth. The nuee ardentes result from collapse of the lava dome at the summit. Of the 67 historic eruptions 32 have had nuee ardentes associated with them. Eleven of these eruptions resulted in fatalities. Merapi is closely monitored by the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia. Shortly before this photograph was taken Merapi was generating up to 40 nuee ardentes per day.

The average rainfall in Antofagasta per annum is just 3mm, and there was a period of time where no rain fell there for 40 years. The Atacama is 15 million years old and 50 times more arid than California's Death Valley. The driest part of the Atacama is an area called the 'double rain shadow.' In 2003 a team of researchers published a report in Science magazine titled "Mars-like Soils in the Atacama Desert, Chile, and the Dry Limit of Microbial Life" in which they duplicated the tests used by the Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars landers to detect life, and were unable to detect any signs in Atacama Desert soil. The region may be unique on Earth in this regard. Alonso de Ercilla characterized it in La Araucana, published in 1569: "Towards Atacama, near the deserted coast, you see a land without men, where there is not a bird, not a beast, nor a tree, nor any vegetation" (quoted Braudel 1984 p 388<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>).<br><br>The Atacama has rich deposits of copper and other minerals, and the world's largest natural supply of sodium nitrate, which was mined on a large scale until the early 1940s. The Atacama border dispute between Chile and Bolivia began in the 1800s over these resources.<br><br>The Atacama is inhabited, though sparsely populated. The Pan-American Highway runs through the Atacama. In an oasis, in the middle of the desert, at an altitude of some 2000 meters, is the village of San Pedro de Atacama. Its church was built by the Spanish in 1577, but archeological evidence indicates that the San Pedro area was the center of a Paleolithic civilization that built rock fortresses on the steep mountains encircling the valley.

It is the longest tidewater glacier in Alaska, with an open calving face over ten kilometres (six miles) wide. Before it reaches the sea, Hubbard is joined by the Valerie Glacier to the west, which, through forward surges of its own ice, has contributed to the advance of the ice flow that experts believe will eventually dam the Russell Fiord from Disenchantment Bay waters.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Hubbard_Glacier_Alaska_Map.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Hubbard_Glacier_Alaska_Map.jpg/300px-Hubbard_Glacier_Alaska_Map.jpg"></a><br><br>The Hubbard Glacier ice margin has continued to advance for about a century. In May 1986, the Hubbard Glacier surged forward, blocking the outlet of Russell Fiord and creating "Russell Lake." All that summer the new lake filled with runoff; its water level rose 25 metres, and the decrease in salinity threatened its sea life.<br><br>Around midnight on October 8th the dam began to give way. In the next 24 hours an estimated 5.3 kmÂ³ of water gushed through the gap, and the fiord was reconnected to the ocean at its previous level.<br><br>In spring 2002, the glacier again approached Gilbert Point. It pushed a terminal moraine ahead of its face and closed the opening again in July. On August 14, the terminal moraine was washed away after rains had raised the water level behind the dam it formed to 18 m (61 ft) above sea level. The fiord could become dammed again, and perhaps permanently. If this happens, the fiord could overflow its southern banks and drain through the Situk River instead, threatening trout habitat and a local airport.<br><br>The ice at the foot of Hubbard Glacier is about 400 years old: it takes that long for ice to traverse the length of the glacier. The glacier routinely calves off icebergs the size of a ten-storey building. Where the glacier meets the shore, most of the ice is below the waterline, and newly calved icebergs can shoot up quite dramatically, so that ships must keep their distance from it as they ply their way up and down the coast.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/Hubbard_landsat.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/be/Hubbard_landsat-tn.jpg"></a><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Hubbard Glacier</span></strong><br><br>Issue #16</div>

It is often said to lie on the River Niger, but is actually 20 kilometres north of the river.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/Niger_river_map.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/Niger_river_map.jpg"></a><br><br>Its geographical setting made it a natural meeting point for settled African populations and nomadic Berber and Arab peoples. Its long history as a trading outpost that linked Africa below the Sahara Desert with Berber and Islamic traders throughout north Africa, and thereby indirectly with traders from Europe, has given it a fabled status, and in the West it is considered a metaphor for exotic, distant lands. Timbuktu's most long-lasting contribution to Islamic and world civilization is scholarship. By at least the fourteenth century, important books were written and copied in Timbuktu, establishing the city as the center of a significant written tradition in Africa.<br><br><strong>Origins</strong><br><br>Timbuktu was established as a seasonal camp by the nomadic Tuareg perhaps as early as the 10th century and grew to great wealth because of its key role in trans-Saharan trade in gold, ivory, slaves, salt and other goods, transferring goods from caravans to boats on the Niger. It was the key city in several successive empires: the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire from 1324, and the Songhai Empire from 1468, the second occupations beginning when the population invited the empires to overthrow Tuareg leaders who had regained control. It reached its peak in the early 1500s.<br><br>The leaders of the Songhai kingdom (also spelled Songhay) began expanding their domain along the Niger River. Like the kingdoms of Ghana and Mali that flourished in the region in earlier centuries, Songhai grew powerful because of its control of local trade routes. Timbuktu would soon become the heart of the mighty Songhai Empire.<br><br><strong>Legendary Tales of an Historic City</strong><br><br>Tales of Timbuktu's fabulous wealth helped prompt European exploration of the west coast of Africa. Among the earliest descriptions of Timbuktu are those of Leo Africanus, Ibn Battuta and Shabeni.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ibn Battuta and his Saharan Travels</span><br><br>Ibn Battuta (1304-1368<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) was an Arab traveller born in Tangier. He spent 30 years travelling the Muslim world from Timbuktoo to Turkey, Central Asia, China and India. He was probably the first outsider to document their visit to Timbuktu:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Tunbuktu...is four miles from the Nile. Most of its inhabitants are Massufa, people of the veil. Its governor...called Farba Musa...appointed one of the Massufa as amir over a company...placed on him a garment, a turban and trousers, all of them of dyed material. He then seated him on a shield and he was lifted up by the elders of his tribe on their heads...At Tunbuktu I embarked on the Nile (Niger) in a small vessel carved from one piece of wood. We used to come ashore every night in a village to buy what we needed of food and ghee in exchange for salt and perfumes and glass ornaments.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leo Africanus Describes Timbuktu</span><br><br>Perhaps most famous among the tales written about Timbuktu is that by Leo Africanus aka "Leo the African". As a captured renegade who later converted back to Christianity, following a trip in 1512, when the Songhai empire was at its height he wrote the following: "<span style="font-style: italic;">The rich king of Tombuto (sic) hath many plates and sceptres of gold, some whereof weigh 1300 pounds. ... He hath always 3000 horsemen ... (and) a great store of doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men, that are bountifully maintained at the king's expense</span>". At the time of Leo Africanus' visit, grass was abundant, provising plentiful milk and butter in the local cuisine, though there were neither gardens nor orchards surrounding the city.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shabeni's Description of Timbuktu</span><br><br>Shabeni was a merchant from Tetuan who was captured and ended up in England where he told his story of how as a child of 14, around 1787, he had gone with his father to Timbuktu. A version of his story is related by James Grey Jackson in his book An Account of Timbuctoo and Hausa, 1820: <span style="font-style: italic;">On the east side of the city of Timbuctoo, there is a large forest, in which are a great many elephants. The timber here is very large. The trees on the outside of the forest are remarkable...they are of such a size that the largest cannot be girded by two men. They bear a kind of berry about the size of a walnut, in clusters consisting of from ten to twenty berries. Shabeeny cannot say what is the extent of this forest, but it is very large.</span> Obviously, Ibn Battuta, Leo Africanus and Shabeni experienced a Timbuktu much different from the one most people imagine.<br><br>It is said that Catalan architect Antoni GaudÃ­ was inspired by the local style of mud mosques . The most famous of which is the Sankore mosque also known as the University of Sankore. It was built during the early 15th century and along with historic Jingereber mosque, Sankore is one of a number of islam-based institutions. Is should be noted that while Islam was practiced in the cities, the majority of local natives were non-Muslims. Often the leaders were nominal muslims in the interest of economic advancement while the masses were traditionalists. As the center of an Islamic scholarly community, the "University of Sankore" was very different in organization to the universities of medieval Europe.<br><br>Issue #17</div>

It had no central administration, student registers, or prescribed courses of study; rather, it was composed of several entirely independent schools or colleges, each run by a single master or imam. Students associated themselves with a single teacher, and courses took place in the open courtyards of mosque complexes or private residences. The primary focus of these schools was the teaching of the Qur'an, although broader instruction in fields such as logic, astronomy, and history also took place. Scholars wrote their own books as part of a socioeconomic model based on scholarship. Buying and selling of books was more profitable than gold or slaves. Among the most formidable scholars, professors and lecturers was Ahmed Baba--a highly distinguished historian frequently quoted in the Tarikh-es-Sudan and other works.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Library and Manuscript Treasures of Timbuktu</span><br><br>The collection of ancient manuscripts at the University of Sankore and other sites around Timbuktu document the magnificence of the institution, as well as the city itself, while enabling scholars to reconstruct the past in fairly intimate detail. Dating from the 16th to the 18th centuries, the ancient manuscripts cover every aspect of human endeavor and are indicative of the high level of civilization attained by West Africans during the Middle Ages. In testament to the glory of Timbuktu, for example, an old West African proverb states that, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Salt comes from the north, gold from the south, but the word of God and the treasures of wisdom come from Timbuktu.</span>"<br><br>Among the libraries which have been preserving these manuscripts are: Institut des Hautes Etudes et de Recherche Islamique - Ahmed Baba, Timbuktu; Mamma Haidara Library; Fondo Kati Library; Al-Wangari Library; and Mohamed Tahar Library. These libraries are considered part of the "African Ink Road" that stretched from West Africa connecting North Africa and East Africa. At one time there were 120 libraries with manuscripts in Timbuktu and surrounding areas. There are more than one million objects preserved in Mali with an additional 20 million in other parts of Africa, the largest concentration of which is in Sokoto, Nigeria, although the full extent of the manuscripts is unknown. During the colonial era efforts were made to conceal the documents after a number of entire libraries were stolen and taken to Paris, London and other parts of Europe. Some manuscripts were buried underground, while others were hidden in the desert or in caves. Many are still hidden today. The United States Library of Congress microfilmed a sampling of the manuscripts during an exhibit there in June of 2003.<br><br><strong>Ravage and Decline</strong><br><br>The city began to decline after explorers and slavers from Portugal and then other European countries landed in West Africa, providing an alternative to the slave market of Timbuktu and the trade route through the world's largest desert. The decline was hastened when it was invaded by Morisco mercenaries in the service of the Moroccan sultan in 1591. The colonial era signaled an end to the connection with Timbuktu's past with an emphasis on identifying with the "home country."<br><br>In 1824, a French-based organisation offered a prize to the first non-Muslim to reach the town -- not realising the American Robert Adams has probably visited in 1811.

Architecturally, it is remarkable for its large pyramidal mihrab. But this is not its real claim to fame -- indeed, it is smaller and less intricate than earlier Malian mosques including the 13th century mosque of Djenne. Instead, it is famous for being the center of the great Islamic scholarly community at Timbuktu during the 16th century A.D. The medieval "University of Timbuktu," often referred to as the "University of Sankore" was very different in organization to the universities of medieval Europe. It had no central administration, student registers, or prescribed courses of study; rather, it was composed of several entirely independent schools or colleges, each run by a single master or imam. Students associated themselves with a single teacher, and courses took place in the open courtyards of mosque complexes or private residences. The primary focus of these schools was the teaching of the Koran, although broader instruction in fields such as logic, astronomy, and history also took place. As anyone who wished could establish one of these colleges, standards amongst them are said to have been very uneven. However the imams of the Sankore mosque are known to have been the most respected. The university was adversely affected by the Moroccan invasion of the 1590s and the deportation of its best scholars. It never again regained its 16th century eminence.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.millenniumadventure.com/content/photos/full/mali_18.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.millenniumadventure.com/content/photos/thumb/mali_18.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.millenniumadventure.com/content/photos/full/mali_17.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.millenniumadventure.com/content/photos/thumb/mali_17.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.millenniumadventure.com/content/photos/full/mali_15.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.millenniumadventure.com/content/photos/thumb/mali_15.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.millenniumadventure.com/content/photos/full/mali_13.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.millenniumadventure.com/content/photos/thumb/mali_13.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Images of Timbuktu</span><br><br>Issue #17<br></div>
