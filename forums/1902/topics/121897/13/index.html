The isthmus separates the waters of Chignecto Bay, a sub-basin of the Bay of Fundy, from those of the Northumberland Strait, an arm of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The isthmus is generally acknowledged to stretch from its northerly point at an area in the Petitcodiac River valley near the city of Dieppe, New Brunswick to its southerly point at an area near the town of Amherst, Nova Scotia. At its narrowest point between Amherst and Tidnish, Nova Scotia, the isthmus measures 24 kilometres wide.<br><br><img src="http://img360.imageshack.us/img360/7764/map0le.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">An old map showing the <strong>Isthmus of Chignecto</strong></span><br><br><strong>Geography</strong><br><br>The majority of the lands comprising the isthmus have very low elevation above sea level with a large portion comprising the Tantramar Marshes, as well as tidal rivers, mud flats, inland freshwater marshes, coastal saltwater marshes, and mixed forest. Several prominent ridges rise above the surrounding low land and marshes along the Bay of Fundy shore, namely the Fort Lawrence Ridge (in Nova Scotia), the Aulac Ridge, the Sackville Ridge, and the Memramcook Ridge (in New Brunswick).<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>Prior to British control of present-day mainland Nova Scotia (after 1713), the isthmus was host to a growing Acadian farming community called Beaubassin. The isthmus became the location of the historic dividing line between the British colony of Nova Scotia and the French territory. French military forces established Fort Beausejour on the Aulac Ridge in 1749 in response to the British construction of an outpost called Fort Lawrence on the ridge immediately to the east - between the two ridges was a tidal stream called the Misaquash River which France generally accepted to be the boundary between the French and British territories, despite the fact that an official boundary had never been determined. France also constructed Fort Gaspereaux on the shores of the Northumberland Strait to effectively control travel on the isthmus.<br><br>On May 22, 1755 a fleet of three warships and thirty-three transports carrying 2100 soldiers sailed from Boston, Massachusetts, landing at Fort Lawrence on June 3, 1755. The following day the British forces attacked Fort Beausejour and on June 16, 1755 the French forces evacuated to Fort Gaspereaux, arriving on June 24, 1755 and onward to Fortress Louisbourg where they were re-garrisoned on July 6, 1755. This battle proved to be one of the key victories in the Seven Years War which saw Britain gain control of all of Nouvelle France and l'Acadie.<br><br>Fort Beausejour was renamed Fort Cumberland and replaced Fort Lawrence due to its substantial construction over the British post. The British forces set about burning the French villages at Beaubassin and rounded up the settlers as part of the 1755 Acadian expulsion (the Great Upheaval).<br><br>In 1758 Governor Lawrence issued a proclamation inviting New Englanders to come to Nova Scotia and settle on vacated Acadian lands and take up free land grants. He also extended this invitation to new England soldiers whose enlistments had expired and were planning on returning home. These people became known as the New England Planters.<br><br>Following the war in 1763 the isthmus saw three 100,000 acre (400 kmÂ²) townships created which took the names of Amherst, Sackville and Cumberland.<br><br>The New England settlement drive was not very successful, and after a few small groups arrived and 1760 and 1761 some families returned home and the British government decided to look elsewhere for settlers. Between 1772 and 1775 over twenty ships carried upwards of 1000 settlers from Yorkshire, England to the new townships. The descendants of this Yorkshire Emigration continue to be prominent in the areas development and history.<br><br>The American Revolutionary War saw a semi-organized, yet unsuccessful, attempt by local guerrilla and U.S. forces to take Fort Cumberland and the Tantramar region in October and November 1776. The invaders were routed by British forces from Halifax and Windsor.<br><br><strong>Transportation</strong><br><br>A key surface transportation route, the Isthmus of Chignecto was host to French and later British military roads across the Tantramar Marshes and along the strategic ridges since the 1600s.<br><br>In 1872, construction of the Intercolonial Railway of Canada saw the mainline between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Moncton, New Brunswick built across the southern portion of the isthmus, skirting the edge of the Bay of Fundy while crossing the Tantramar Marshes between Amherst, Nova Scotia and Sackville, New Brunswick.<br><br>In the 1880s a railway line was built from Sackville across the isthmus to Port Elgin and on to Cape Tormentine which played host to an iceboat service and in 1917 a ferry service to Prince Edward Island was established to connect with the Prince Edward Island Railway.<br><br>The isthmus also saw one of Canada's earliest mega-projects in the 1880s when a broad gauge railway was built from the port of Amherst to the Northumberland Strait at Tidnish for carrying small cargo and passenger ships. This ship railway was never successfully operational and construction was abandoned shortly before completion.<br><br>In the 1950s, while construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway was underway, a group of industrialists and politicians from the Maritimes called for a Chignecto Canal to be built as a shortcut for ocean-going ships travelling between Saint John and U.S. ports to the Great Lakes to avoid travelling around Nova Scotia. The project never progressed beyond the survey stage.<br><br>The Trans-Canada Highway was built on the isthmus in the early 1960s, connecting with Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, parallelling existing Canadian National Railway trackage.<br><br>Issue #290</div>

Listed as a "world-class civil engineering project" by the American Society of Civil Engineers; the scheme interlocks 7 power stations and 16 major dams through 145 kilometres of trans-mountain tunnels and 80 kilometres of aqueducts. The Scheme is in an area of 5,124 square kilometres, almost entirely within the Kosciuszko National Park.<br><br>The Scheme was managed by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, now called Snowy Hydro Limited, and took 25 years to build, from 1949 to 1974, at an historical cost of AUD$800 million, a dollar value equivalent today to AUD$6 bn. It employed over 100,000 people from over thirty countries in its construction, providing valuable employment for a large number of recently arrived immigrants, and was important in Australia's post-war economic and social development. The Scheme built several temporary towns for its construction workers, several of which have become permanent: Cabramurra (the highest town in Australia); and Khancoban. Additionally, the economy of Cooma has been sustained by the Scheme.<br><br>The Scheme is the largest renewable energy generator in mainland Australia and plays a pivotal role in the operation of the national electricity market, generating approximately 3.5% of the mainland grid's power. The Scheme also has a significant role in providing security of water flows to the Murray-Darling Basin. The Scheme provides approximately 2100 gigalitres of water a year to the Basin, providing additional water for an irrigated agriculture industry worth about $5 bn per annum, representing more than 40% of the gross value of the nation's agricultural production.<br><br><strong>Environmental concerns</strong><br><br>The original plan was for 99% of the water of the Snowy River's natural flow to be diverted by the Scheme below Lake Jindabyne. Releases from the Scheme were only based on the needs of riparian users and took no account of ecosystem needs; it soon became known that the lower reaches of the river were in environmental crisis. An extensive public campaign led to the Snowy Water Inquiry being established in January 1998. The Inquiry reported to the New South Wales and Victorian Governments in October of that year, recommending an increase to 15% of natural flows. The two Governments were equivocal about this target; aside from economic considerations there was a view that the health of the Murray is more important than that of the Snowy and any extra environmental flows are better used there instead.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/SnowyMountainsNSWTumut2PowerStation20050423.JPG/800px-SnowyMountainsNSWTumut2PowerStation20050423.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/SnowyMountainsNSWTumut2PowerStation20050423.JPG/200px-SnowyMountainsNSWTumut2PowerStation20050423.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Tumut 2 underground power station.</span><br><br>In 1999 the seat of East Gippsland was won in the Victorian election by an independent, Craig Ingram, based in large part on his campaign to improve Snowy flows.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Retaining wall</strong></span><br><br>A <strong>retaining wall</strong> is a structure that holds back earth. Retaining walls stabilize soil and rock from down slope movement or erosion and provide support for vertical or near-vertical grade changes. Cofferdams and bulkheads, structures to hold back water, are sometimes also considered retaining walls. Retaining walls are generally made of masonry, stone, brick, concrete, steel or timber. Once popular as an inexpensive retaining material, railroad ties have fallen out of favor due to environmental concerns.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/Retaining_wall_12-2404a_%28NARA%29.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/Retaining_wall_12-2404a_%28NARA%29.gif/350px-Retaining_wall_12-2404a_%28NARA%29.gif"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Structure in the foreground is called a 'mud box' - a kind of <strong>retaining wall</strong> built to hold the flood waters in check. Note the buildings on the opposite side are half-submerged. May 1973, Mississippi river, USA.</span><br><br>The most important consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls is that the retained material is attempting to move forward and downslope due to gravity. This creates a soil pressure behind the wall (depending on the angle of internal friction (phi) and the cohesive strength (c) of the material). This pressure is smallest at the top and increases toward the bottom and will push the wall forward or overturn it if nor proprely addressed. Also any groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes an additional horizontal hydraulic pressure on the wall.<br><br>There are three common types of retaining structures: <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>gravity</strong></span>, <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>cantilevered</strong></span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>sheet pile</strong></span> walls.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Gravity walls</strong></span> are made from a large mass of stone, concrete, or composite materials. Gravity walls depend on the size and weight of the wall mass to resist pressures from behind. Gravity walls will often have a slight setback, or batter, to improve wall stability by leaning back into the retained soil. For short, landscaping walls, gravity walls made from dry-stacked (mortarless) stone or segmental concrete units (masonry units) are commonly used. Dry-laid gravity walls are somewhat flexible and do not require a rigid footing below frost.<br><br>Earlier in the 20th century, taller retaining walls were often gravity walls made from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller retaining walls are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as: geosynthetic or steel-reinforced backfill soil with pre-cast facing; gabions (stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks), crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from pre-cast concrete or timber and filled with soil) or soil-nailed walls (soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods).<br><br>For <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>reinforced-soil gravity walls</strong></span>, the soil reinforcement is placed in horizontal layers throughout the height of the wall. Common soil reinforcement materials include steel straps and geogrid, a high-strength polymer mesh, that provide tensile strength to hold soil together. The wall face is often pre-cast, segmental concrete units that can tolerate some differential movement. The reinforced soil's mass, along with the facing, becomes the gravity wall. The reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 50 to 60 percent as deep (thick) as the height of the wall, and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall.<br><br>Prior to the introduction of modern reinforced-soil gravity walls, cantilevered walls were the most common type of taller retaining wall. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Cantilevered walls</strong></span> are made from a relatively thin stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry (often in the shape of an inverted T). These walls cantilever loads (like a beam) to a large, structural footing; converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are butressed on the front, or include a counterfort on the back, to improve their stability against high loads. Buttresses are short wing walls at right angles to the main trend of the wall. These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth. This type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Sheet pile walls</strong></span> are often used in soft soils and tight spaces. Sheet pile walls are made out of steel sheet piles or wood driven into the ground. Structural design methods for this type of wall exist but these methods are more complex than for a gravity wall. As a rule of thumb; 1/3 third above ground, 2/3 below ground. Taller sheet pile walls usually require a tie-back anchor "dead-man" placed in the soil some distance behind the wall face, that is tied to the wall face, usually by a cable or a rod. Anchors must be placed behind the potential failure plane in the soil.<br><br>Proper drainage behind the wall is critical to the performance or retaining walls. Drainage materials will reduce or eliminate the hydraulic pressure and increase the stability of the fill material behind the wall (assuming of course, that this is not a retaining wall for water).<br><br>Issue #295</div>

Based on high-quality 3D seismic survey, US oil field service companies plan to drill 4,500 horizontal wells in addition to the existing 17,000 wells, which allowed the production rate to rebound to 450,000 barrels (72,000 mÂ³) per day.<br><br>Ultimate recovery of Samotlor, estimated by U.S. Geological Survey in 2000, is about 20 billion barrels (3.2 kmÂ³).

Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n was born in SantervÃ¡s de Campos (Valladolid). As a young man he joined the war to conquer Granada, the last Moorish state on the Iberian peninsula. Ponce de LeÃ³n accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the New World. He became the first Governor of Puerto Rico by appointment of the Spanish Crown. He is regarded as the first European known to have visited what is now the United States when he set foot in Florida in 1513.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n.jpg/418px-Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n.jpg/180px-Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n</strong></span><br><br>Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n settled in Hispaniola after arriving in the New World. He helped conquer the Tainos of the eastern part of Hispaniola, and was rewarded with the governorship of the Province of Higuey that was created there. While there he heard stories of the wealth of Boriquin (now known as Puerto Rico, and he sought and received permission to go there. In 1508, Ponce de LeÃ³n founded the first settlement in Puerto Rico, Caparra (later relocated to San Juan). He was greeted with open arms by the Taino Cacique, Agueybana, and quickly gained control of the island. As a result, Ponce de Leon was named Governor of Puerto Rico in 1509. Ponce de LeÃ³n and the other conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to construct fortifications. The Tainos subsequently died in great numbers after exposure to the European diseases the sailors brought with them and to which the natives had no immunity. Ponce de LeÃ³n, however, became rich while serving as Governor.<br><br>In 1506, upon the death of Christopher Columbus, who had been appointed lifetime military governor of his newly found discoveries, the Spanish authorities refused to grant the same privilege to his son Diego Columbus. The Spanish Crown by then had selected Ponce de LeÃ³n to colonize and govern the island of Puerto Rico. In the meantime Diego Columbus had taken his claim to the top court in Madrid and won his rights. Ponce de LeÃ³n was then removed from office in 1512 and felt his good name had been damaged. Not wishing to serve Diego, Ponce de LeÃ³n obtained title to explore the areas north of Cuba.<br><br>The popular story that Ponce de LeÃ³n was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he discovered Florida is misconceived. He was seeking a spiritual rebirth with new glory, honor, and personal enrichment, not a physical rebirth through the waters of the Fountain of Youth. The Tainos had told the Spanish of a large, rich island to the north named Bimini, and Ponce de Leon was searching for gold, slaves and lands to claim and govern for Spain, all of which he hoped to find at Bimini and other islands. The story of Ponce de LeÃ³n searching for the Fountain of Youth seems to have surfaced in the 1560s in the Memoir of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, and was later included in the Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos of Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas.<br><br>Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n equipped three ships at his own expense, and set out on his voyage of discovery and conquest in 1513. On March 27, 1513, he sighted an island, but sailed on without landing. Later, on April 2, he landed on the east coast of the newly discovered land at a point which continues to be disputed, but was somewhere on the northeast coast of the present State of Florida. Ponce de LeÃ³n claimed "La Florida" for Spain. Ponce de LeÃ³n named the land La Florida, meaning flowery, either because of the vegetation in bloom he saw there, or because he landed there during Pascua Florida, Spanish for Flowery Passover, meaning the Easter season. Pascua Florida Day, April 2, is a legal holiday in Florida.<br><br>Juan Ponce de LeÃ²n then sailed south along the Florida coast, charting the rivers he found, passed around the Florida Keys, and up the west coast of Florida to Cape Romano (Marco Island). He sailed back south to Havana, and then up to Florida again, stopping at the Bay of Chequesta (Biscayne Bay) before returning to Puerto Rico.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Juan_Ponce_de_Leon_statue.jpg/432px-Juan_Ponce_de_Leon_statue.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Juan_Ponce_de_Leon_statue.jpg/180px-Juan_Ponce_de_Leon_statue.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Statue of Juan Ponce de Leon at the Plaza San JosÃ© in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The statue was made in New York in 1882 using the bronze from English Cannons seized after the English attacked San Juan in 1792.</span><br><br>In 1514 Juan Ponce de Leon returned to Spain and recieved commissions to conquer the Caribs of Guadalupe and to colonize the Island of Florida. His expedition to Guadalupe in 1515 was not successful, and he returned to Puerto Rice where he stayed until 1521.<br><br>In 1521 Juan Ponce de LeÃ²n organized a colonizing expedition on two ships. It consisted of some 200 men, including priests, farmers and artisans, 50 horses and other domestic animals, and farming implements. The expedition landed on the southwest coast of Florida, somewhere in the vicinity of the Caloosahatchee River or Charlotte Harbor. The colonists were soon attacked by Calusas and Ponce de LeÃ³n was injured by a poisoned arrow. After this attack, he and colonists sailed to Havana, Cuba, where he died.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Gulf of Maine</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Gulf of Maine</strong> is a large gulf of the Atlantic Ocean on the northeastern coast of North America, roughly between Cape Cod in Massachusetts on the south and Cape Sable Island on the southern tip of Nova Scotia to the northeast. It includes the entire coastlines of the U.S. states of New Hampshire and Maine, as well as Massachusetts north of Cape Cod, and the southern and western coastlines of the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia respectively. Massachusetts Bay and the Bay of Fundy are included within the Gulf of Maine system. As such, the Gulf of Maine is also home to the highest tidal variations on the planet.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1a/Wpdms_nasa_topo_gulf_of_maine.jpg"><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Gulf of Maine</span></strong><br><br>The coastline of the Gulf of Maine is predominantly rocky and scenic; the only significant coastal development is located in the Boston, Portsmouth, Portland and Saint John metropolitan areas. The effects of glaciation are responsible for stripping sedimentary soil away from the coastline, therefore the gulf lacks the sandy beaches found to the south along the Eastern Seaboard. The underwater features of the seabed sculptured during the lower sea levels of the ice ages make the gulf a semi-enclosed sea bounded to the south and east by underwater banks. Georges Bank in particular, on its southern end, protects the Gulf of Maine waters from the Gulf Stream. Gulf of Maine waters are more strongly influenced by the Labrador Current, making the gulf waters significantly colder and more nutrient-rich than those found to the south. Undersea valleys in the central basin can reach depths of 1,500 feet (500 meters) while undersea mountains rise up 800 feet (266 meters) from the sea floor, almost reaching the surface in some locations.<br><br>The watershed of the gulf encompasses an area of 69,115 milesÂ² (179,008 kmÂ²), including all of Maine, 70 percent of New Hampshire, 56 percent of New Brunswick, 41 percent of Massachusetts, and 36 percent of Nova Scotia. The watershed also includes a small southern portion (less than 1 percent) of the Canadian province of Quebec. Significant rivers that drain into the Gulf include, from east to west, the Annapolis, Shubenacadie, Salmon, Petitcodiac, St. John, Magaguadavic, St. Croix, Penobscot, Kennebec, Piscataqua and Merrimack Rivers; the St. John and Penobscot having the greatest discharge.<br><br>The cold waters of the gulf make it one of the most productive marine environments in the North Atlantic, and it furnishes habitat for many diverese species including most notably the Atlantic herring (<span style="font-style: italic;">Clupea harengus</span>) and the American lobster (<span style="font-style: italic;">Homarus americanus</span>), which grows to famously large sizes in the gulf. The waters of the Gulf of Maine system, particularly at the boundary with the Bay of Fundy are also home to the summering grounds for many different whale species, most notably the highly endangered North Atlantic Right Whale.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/91/DSCN3977_hamptonbeachnh_e.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/91/DSCN3977_hamptonbeachnh_e.jpg/250px-DSCN3977_hamptonbeachnh_e.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, a beach on the Gulf of Maine.</span><br><br>The gulf's relative proximity to Europe made it an early destination for European colonization. French settlers founded a settlement on St. Croix Island in 1604. English settlers founded the Popham Colony on an island in the Kennebec River in 1607, the same years as the Jamestown settlement, followed by the Plymouth Colony on the shores of Massachusetts Bay in 1620.<br><br>In the 1960s and 1970s there was a dispute between Canada and the United States over fishing and other resource rights in the Gulf of Maine, specifically the Georges Bank region. This dispute was taken to the International Court of Justice, which delineated a boundary through the Gulf in 1984. Canada and the U.S. continue to disagree on the sovereignty of Machias Seal Island and the waters surrounding it in the northeastern part of the gulf. In recognition of the Gulf's importance to marine habitat, both nations currently maintain complementary embargos against offshore oil and gas exploration activities on Georges Bank in the southern part of the gulf.<br><br>Issue #307</div>

A hospice for travellers founded in 1049, named after Saint Bernard of Menthon, which later became famous for its St. Bernard dogs.

The Great St Bernard Tunnel (and the main road) plunges through the mountains at the 1,915 m level; after the construction of the Simplon Tunnel further east in 1905, railroad traffic partly superseded the St Bernard road.

On the south side of the pass, the Great St Bernard Valley is drained by the Artanavaz River, which runs down to Aosta.<br><br>Just below the pass is a small lake, and several buildings making up the hospice straddle the pass itself. The old road may still be seen, above the paved road. The minor peaks Mont Mort and Pic de Drona flank the pass. The elevation is such that snow may keep the pass closed until June, and indeed the motivation for the hospice was to aid travellers overcome by the difficulties of the crossing.<br><br>Likewise, the dogs from this area, known as St. Bernards, were bred to be large enough to handle deep snow and to scent out lost persons.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Lava tube</strong></span><br><br><strong>Lava tubes</strong> are natural conduits through which lava travels beneath the surface of a lava flow. They can be actively draining lava from a source, or can be extinct, meaning the lava flow has ceased and the rock has cooled and left a long, cave-like channel.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Lava_tube_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_NM-750px.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Lava_tube_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_NM-750px.JPG/300px-Lava_tube_at_Craters_of_the_Moon_NM-750px.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Lava tube</strong> cave at Craters of the Moon</span><br><br><strong>Formation</strong><br><br>Tubes form in one of two ways: by the crusting over of lava channels and from Pahoehoe flows where the lava is moving under the surface.<br><br>Lava usually leaves the point of eruption in channels. These channels tend to stay very hot as their surroundings cool. This means they slowly develop walls around them as the surrounding lava cools and/or as the channel melts its way deeper. These channels can get deep enough to crust over, forming an insulating tube that keeps the lava molten and serves as a conduit for the flowing lava. These types of lava tubes tend to be closer to the lava eruption point.<br><br>Further away from the eruption point, lava can flow in an unchanneled, fanlike manner as it leaves its source, which is usually another lava tube leading back to the eruption point. Called Pahoehoe flows, these areas of surface-moving lava cool, forming either a smooth or rough, ropy surface. The lava continues to flow this way until it begins to block its source. At this point, the subsurface lava is still hot enough to break out at a point, and from this point the lava begins as a new "source". Lava flows from the previous source to this breakout point as the surrounding lava of the Pahoehoe flow cools. This forms an underground channel that becomes a lava tube.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Lavacicles_8238.jpg/800px-Lavacicles_8238.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Lavacicles_8238.jpg/300px-Lavacicles_8238.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lavacicles on the ceiling of Mushpot Cave in Lava Beds National Monument.</span><br><br><strong>Characteristics</strong><br><br>A broad lava-flow field often consists of a main lava tube and a series of smaller tubes that supply lava to the front of one or more separate flows. When the supply of lava stops at the end of an eruption or lava is diverted elsewhere, lava in the tube system drains downslope and leaves partially empty cave-like conduits beneath the ground.<br><br>Such drained tubes commonly exhibit step marks on their walls that mark the various depths at which the lava flowed. Also, lava tubes generally have flat floors and roofs. Lava stalactites that hang from the roof are rare in lava tubes. However, short lavacicles on the ceiling of a lava tube form as the lava in the tube retreats and the viscous lava on the ceiling drips as it cools. Dripstone is created when lava splashes on the inside walls of the tubes.<br><br>Lava tubes can be up to 4-5 m wide, though are often narrower, and run anywhere from 1-5 m below the surface. Lava tubes can also be extremely long; one tube from the Mauna Loa (Hawaii, USA) 1859 flow enters the ocean about 50 km (over thirty miles) from its eruption point, and the Cueva del Viento on Teide (Tenerife, Spain) is 15 km long.<br><br>Issue #311</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Crosley Field</strong></span><br><br><strong>Crosley Field</strong> was a baseball stadium that stood in Cincinnati, Ohio from 1912-1970. Various baseball stadiums had actually stood on the site since 1884, though the exact positions of the grandstands had been repeatedly shifted. Crosley was the home of the National League's Cincinnati Reds. In 1912, the stadium was rebuilt in steel and concrete at a cost of $225,000.<br><br><img src="http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/3205/crosle019cb.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Crosley Field</strong></span><br><br>The stadium was known as <span style="font-style: italic;">Redland Field</span> from 1912-1933, when team owner Powel Crosley chose to rename the stadium in his own honor - advertising his Crosley automobiles to boot. Crosley was the site of the first major league night baseball game on May 24, 1935.<br><br>The field of play was known for the sloping hill or "terrace" that led up to the fence (and to street level) across left field, which remained throughout the entire time the stadium stood, and the short fence in center field. The team claimed that the fence was 390 feet away, but both the home and opposing pitchers were certain it was shorter.<br><br>The stadium began to decline in the 1960s, and the surrounding neighborhood became rather dangerous, particularly at night. These factors, along with the city's desire to build a single stadium that could house both the Reds and the Cincinnati Bengals of the NFL led to the closure of Crosley and the mid-season move of the Reds in 1970 to Riverfront Stadium. Crosley Field was demolished two years later, and a business park now stands on the site. However, the park has been recreated (in part) in Blue Ash, Ohio as part of a local athletic center, using various items from the original (such as 400 seats).<br><br>Issue #312</div>

The top few meters is fresh water, fed from the high inflows from the surrounding mountains. Below this is a layer of cold, heavy, saline water from the sea.
