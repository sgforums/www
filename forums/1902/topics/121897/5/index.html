            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Calcite</strong></span><br><br>The mineral <strong>calcite</strong> is a calcium carbonate corresponding to the formula CaCO3 and is one of the most widely distributed minerals on the Earth's surface. It is a common constituent of sedimentary rocks, limestone in particular. It is also the primary mineral in metamorphic marble. It also occurs as a vein mineral in deposits from hot springs, and also occurs in caverns as stalactites and stalagmites. Calcite is often the primary constituent of the shells of marine organisms (e.g. plankton, bivalves, etc.). Calcite represents the stable form of calcium carbonate; aragonite will change to calcite at 470Â°C.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/Calcite_USA.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/Calcite_USA.jpg/180px-Calcite_USA.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Calcite</strong> from Brushy Creek Mine, Missouri, USA.</span><br><br><strong>Properties</strong><br><br>Calcite crystals are hexagonal-rhombohedral, though actual calcite rhombohedrons are rare as natural crystals. However, they show a remarkable variety of habit including acute to obtuse rhombohedrons, tabular forms, prisms, or various scalenohedrons. It may occur as fibrous, granular, lamellar, or compact. Cleavage is usually in three directions parallel to the rhombohedron form. Its fracture is conchoidal, but difficult to obtain. It has a hardness of 3, a specific gravity of 2.7, and its luster is vitreous in crystallized varieties. Color is white or colorless, though shades of gray, red, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, or even black can occur when the mineral is charged with impurities. Calcite reacts when it comes into contact with hydrochloric acid, which causes effervescence.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Calcite_Morocco.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Calcite_Morocco.jpg/180px-Calcite_Morocco.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Calcite from Middle Atlas, Morocco.</span><br><br>Calcite is transparent to opaque and may occasionally show phosphorescence or fluorescence. It is perhaps best known because of its power to produce strong double refraction of light, such that objects viewed through a clear piece of calcite appear doubled in all of their parts - a phenomenon first described by Rasmus Bartholin. A beautifully transparent variety used for optical purposes comes from Iceland, called <span style="font-style: italic;">Iceland spar</span>.

It was a 305 ft. (93 m) high earthfill dam intended for irrigation, electricity, flood prevention, and recreation. The dam was built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, which later received most of the blame for the collapse.

The tuff sits on top of sedimentary rock. The area is very permeable, but no seepage was noted on the dam itself before the date of the collapse. Several springs had opened up downstream a few days before, however.<br><br><strong>The collapse and aftermath</strong><br><br>At the time of the collapse, the reservoir had just filled for the first time with spring runoff. Water began seeping from the dam the Thursday before the collapse, not unexpected for an earthen dam.<br><br>On the morning of June 5 a new leak appeared. Bulldozers were sent to plug the leak, unsuccessfully. Local media appeared, and an alarm was raised to downstream residents. Two bulldozers were caught in the eroding embankment, their operators pulled to safety with ropes. At around 11:57 a.m., the dam collapsed. By evening the reservoir had completely emptied.<br><br>Cities immediately downstream, such as Rexburg, suffered horribly. The city of Idaho Falls, further downstream, had time to prepare. At the old and unstable American Falls Dam downstream, engineers released water before the flood arrived. That dam held, and the flood was over. Cleaning up took the rest of the summer.<br><br>A wide-ranging controversy erupted from the dam's collapse. According to the Bureau of Reclamation site, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Today, Bureau of Reclamation engineers assess all Reclamation dams under strict criteria established by the Safety of Dams program.

The original list of gates on the wall going clockwise from Ludgate in the east to Aldgate in the west were: Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. Some of the gates, though now long gone, are remembered by the areas or roads where the gates stood being named after them. Due to the rapid growth of the city, the number of gates was increased to cope with the extra traffic in the medieval period, and the walls were also strengthened and built upon.<br><br>Today all that remains of the wall are a few (albeit substantial) fragments, some of which can be seen in the grounds of the Museum of London, in the Barbican Estate and around Tower Hill. Part of the route originally taken by the northern wall is commemorated by the road also named <span style="font-style: italic;">London Wall</span> on which the museum is located. The modern road starts in the west with a roundabout with Aldersgate then passes east past Moorgate, and eventually becomes Wormwood Street before it reaches Bishopsgate. One of the largest and most readily accessed fragments of the wall stands just outside Tower Hill tube station, with a replica statue of the Emperor Trajan standing in front of it.<br><br>The wall was constructed largely from Kentish ragstone brought by water from Maidstone. It enclosed an area of about 330 acres (1.3 kmÂ²), was 6 to 9 feet (2 to 3 m) wide and about 18 feet (5 m) high, with a ditch or fossa in front of the outer wall, measuring some 6 feet (2 m) deep by between 9 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) wide. It included a number of bastions (at least twenty) spaced about 70 yards (64 m) apart; the best-preserved of these can be seen at the Barbican Estate, next to the church of St Giles-without-Cripplegate. The wall appears to have been built in the late 2nd century and continued to be developed until at least the end of the 4th century, making it among the last major building projects undertaken by the Romans before their withdrawal from Britain in 410.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/London_wall_bastion.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/London_wall_bastion.jpg/180px-London_wall_bastion.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">13th century bastion on the London Wall, Barbican Estate</span><br><br>The wall remained in active use as a fortification for over 1,000 years afterwards. It was used to defend London against raiding Saxons in 457, and was redeveloped in the medieval period with the addition of crenellations, more gates and further bastions. It was not until as late as the 18th and 19th centuries that the wall underwent substantial demolition, though even then large portions of it survived by being incorporated into other structures. Amid the devastation of the Blitz, some of the tallest ruins in the bomb-damaged City were remnants of the Roman wall.<br><br>The wall's moat has also left its mark on London; it forms the line of the street of Houndsditch. This was once London's main rubbish disposal site and was notorious for its appalling odour; its name, according to the 16th century historian John Stow, was derived "from that in old time, when the same lay open, much filth (conveyed forth of the City) especially dead dogges were there laid or cast." The moat was finally covered over and filled in at the end of the 16th century, becoming the present street.<br><br>Issue #94</div>

It forms a transform boundary between the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate. Earthquakes along the fault, and the associated earth movements, have formed the Southern Alps.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/South.island.arp.750pix.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ab/South.island.arp.750pix.jpg/250px-South.island.arp.750pix.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This true-color image provides a nearly cloud-free look at the South Island of New Zealand. The <strong>Alpine Fault</strong> is easily visible from space, running along the western edge of the Southern Alps from the south-western coast towards the north-eastern corner of the South Island. The scene was acquired by NASAÂ’s Terra satellite, on October 23, 2002. Forested areas are clearly indicated by the very dark green, particularly in the northwest and southwest. The braided Waimakariri and Rakaia rivers can also clearly be seen as they make their way to the east coast on either side of Banks Peninsula.</span><br><br>Beginning off the south-western corner of the South Island, the Alpine Fault runs along the western edge of the Southern Alps, then splits into three parallel faults north of Arthur's Pass. Average slip rates in the fault's central region are about 30 mm a year, very fast by global standards.<br><br><strong>Historic Earthquakes</strong><br><br>The Alpine Fault has experienced sizeable earthquakes in historic times:<br><br>-- 1929 - Arthur's Pass. Estimated magnitude = 7.1.<br>-- 1929 - Murchison. Estimated magnitude = 7.8.<br>-- 1968 - Inangahua. Estimated magnitude = 7.1.<br>-- 2003 - Fiordland. Estimated magnitude = 7.1.<br><br><strong>Major Ruptures</strong><br><br>Over the last thousand years, there have been four major ruptures along the Alpine Fault causing earthquakes of about magnitude 8. These occurred in approximately 1100, 1450, 1620 and 1717 AD, at intervals between 100 and 350 years. The 1717 quake appears to have involved a rupture along nearly 400 km of the southern two thirds of the fault. Scientists' best estimate is that there is a high likelihood of a similar earthquake within a few decades.<br><br>Large ruptures can also trigger earthquakes on the faults continuing north from the Alpine Fault.<br><br>Issue #97</div>

There are microwave receivers for distant signals at about 305 meters, and the top of the transmission antenna is at the apex of the tower. However, CN soon found it was far more lucrative as a tourist attraction than a transmission tower. With over a million tourists climbing the tower each year it has yet to have an unprofitable year. The construction costs were repaid in fifteen years.<br><br>Metal staircases with 1,776 steps reach the Skypod level (447 m) and are the tallest metal staircases on earth. These stairs are intended for emergency use and are not open to the public, except for twice a year for charity stairclimb events: around Earth Day in the spring by the World Wildlife Fund; and in the fall by the United Way's Toronto chapter.

It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers. The following year, the Guinness Book of World Records officially changed the CN Tower's classification to "World's Tallest Building and Free-Standing Structure".<br><br>There are many guyed towers taller than the CN Tower, the current tallest being the KVLY-TV tower in North Dakota at 628 m (2,063 feet) tall, but these are guy-wire supported structures and not classified as free-standing. The Petronius Compliant Tower (an oil platform) at 645 m (2,116 feet), is a taller free-standing structure, however all but its top is under water. If built, a 1,000 m tower for a solarthermic power station in Australia will break the record. The Burj Dubai, slated for completion in 2008, would according to present claims by its developers, become a taller free-standing land structure than CN Tower.<br><br>The builders of the CN Tower did not expect that it would hold the tallest structure record for so many years. Previous record holders had quickly been supplanted. Several rivals have been proposed and designed but none have yet been built and most schemes collapsed. In part this is because of the development of cable television soon after the tower was built which greatly reduced the need for such broadcasting centres, especially in urban areas. Only in cities, however, are there enough tourists to make such a tower viable as a tourist attraction.<br><br>On July 23, 1999 Ashrita Furman became the fastest person to go up the CN Tower using a Pogo stick. In 2001, a group of environmentalists scaled the tower to place a banner protesting the policies of United States President George W. Bush on the tower.<br><br>Issue #98</div>

Over a period of perhaps 10 to 15 million years lava flow after lava flow poured out, eventually accumulating to a thickness of more than 6,000 feet (1.8 km). As the molten rock came to the surface, the earth's crust gradually sank into the space left by the rising lava. The subsidence of the crust produced a large, slightly depressed lava plain now known as the Columbia Basin or Plateau.<br><br>The ancient Columbia River was forced into its present course by the northwesterly advancing lava. The lava, as it flowed over the area, first filled the stream valleys, forming dams that in turn caused impoundments or lakes. In these ancient lake beds are found fossil leaf impressions, petrified wood, fossil insects, and bones of vertebrate animals.<br><br>Issue #104</div>

Dias was a cavalier of the royal court, superintendent of the royal warehouses and sailing-master of the man-of-war "<span style="font-style: italic;">San Christovao</span>". King John II of Portugal appointed him on October 10, 1486 as the head of an expedition which was to endeavor to sail around the southern end of Africa in hopes of finding a trade route leading to Asia. The Chief purpose of the expedition was to find the country of the legendary Christian African king known as Prester John, concerning whom recent reports had arrived through JoÃ£o Alfonso de Aveiro and with whom the Portuguese wished to enter into friendly relations.<br><br>After ten months of preparation, Dias left Lisbon in August 1487 with a fleet consisting of three ships, two armed caravels of fifty tons each and one supply-ship. Among his companions were PÃªro de Alenquer, who wrote a description of Vasco da Gama's first voyage, JoÃ£o Infante, Ã�lvaro Martins, and JoÃ£o Grego. The supply-ship was commanded by Bartolomeu's brother, PÃªro Dias. There were also two Negroes and four Negresses on board who were to be set ashore at suitable spots to explain to the natives the purpose of the expedition.<br><br>Dias sailed first towards the mouth of the Congo River, discovered the year before by Diogo CÃ£o and Martin Behaim, then, following the African coast, he entered Walvis Bay. From 29Â° south latitude (Port Nolloth) he lost sight of the coast and was driven by a violent storm, which lasted thirteen days, far beyond the cape to the south. When calm weather returned he sailed again in an easterly direction and, when no land appeared, turned northward, landing in the "Bahia dos Vaqueiros" (Mossel Bay) on February 3 1488. Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope with two caravels, then Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa, in 1488.<br><br>In February 1488 he rounded the southern coast of Africa as far the Great Fish River. After it was clear that India could be reached by this route, he turned back. It was only on his return voyage that he discovered the Cape of Good Hope in May 1488. Dias returned to Lisbon in December 1488 after an absence of sixteen months and seventeen days. He explored a total of about 2,030 km of unknown African coast.<br><br>He originally named the Cape of Good Hope the "Cape of Storms" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Cabo das Tormentas</span>). It was later renamed by John II as the Cape of Good Hope (<span style="font-style: italic;">Cabo da Boa EsperanÃ§a</span>) because of the opening of a route to the east. The discovery of the passage around Africa was significant because for the first time Europeans could trade directly with India and Asia bypassing Middle East overland routes and middle men. This would eventually lead to a rise of Atlantic trading countries and a general decline of Middle East and Mediterranean countries for centuries afterwards.<br><br>In 1497 Dias accompanied, but in a subordinate position, Vasco da Gama's expedition to India. He followed Gama with one ship to Cape Verde. He also accompanied Pedro Ã�lvares Cabral on the voyage that resulted in the discovery of Brazil in 1500. He died off the Cape of Good Hope in a storm; his vessel was one of those wrecked not far from the Cape of Good Hope.<br><br>An official report of the expedition to the Cape of Good Hope has not yet been found. Dias' grandson Paulo Dias de Novais was a Portuguese colonizer of Africa in the 16th century.<br><br>Issue #105</div>

At sea the clays and sands have been eroded away. A narrow (&lt; 30 m) band of relatively resistant Portland limestone forms the shoreline. Behind this is a narrow (&lt; 50 m) band of slightly less resistant Purbeck limestone.

The clay shows obvious signs of slumping, and in Geological time it is eroding very rapidly.

The present arena is informally known to some as "The World's Most Famous Arena".<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Madisonsquaregarden.jpg/800px-Madisonsquaregarden.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Madisonsquaregarden.jpg/300px-Madisonsquaregarden.jpg"></a><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Madison Square Garden</span></strong><br><br><strong>Present operations</strong><br><br>The present Garden is best known as the home of the New York Knicks (basketball) and New York Rangers (ice hockey), professional sports teams that play their home matches in the arena. It also hosts the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus when it comes to New York City, home games for the St. John's Red Storm (college basketball), and almost any other kind of indoor activity that draws large audiences, such as the 2004 Republican National Convention.<br><br>MSG is also known for its place in the history of boxing. Many of boxing's most important fights were held at the Madison Square Garden, including many of Joe Louis, the Roberto Duran-Ken Buchanan affair, and the first Joe Frazier-Muhammad Ali bout. Before promoters such as Don King and Bob Arum moved boxing to Las Vegas, Madison Square Garden was considered the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecca of boxing</span>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seating</span><br><br>Seating in the present Madison Square Garden is arranged in five ascending levels. The lowest one is referred to as "rink-side" for hockey games or "court-side" for basketball games (at some events a still lower seating level, known as the Rotunda, is also provided); next above this is the First Promenade, followed by the Second Promenade, First Balcony and Second Balcony. The seats of these five levels originally bore the colors red, orange, yellow, green and blue respectively; however, this color scheme has since been abolished, mainly because the "blue seats" had become synonymous with rowdy behavior by fans, particularly those attending New York Rangers hockey games.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The site of the first Madison Square Garden was formerly the Union Depot of the New York and Harlem Railroad. When the depot was moved to the current site of Grand Central Terminal in 1871 the depot was sold to P.T. Barnum and converted into hippodrome called "Barnum's Monster Classical and Geological Hippodrome". In 1876 it was renamed to Gilmore's Garden.<br><br>William Henry Vanderbilt officially renamed Gilmore's Garden to Madison Square Garden and reopened the facility to the public on May 30, 1879 at 26th Street and Madison Avenue. The first arena was originally built for the sport of track cycling, which is still remembered in the name of the Madison event.<br><br>The second Madison Square Garden, designed by Stanford White, who would later be killed there, opened at this site in 1890 and remained until the third Garden opened in 1925. On February 11, 1968 Madison Square Garden III closed and Madison Square Garden IV opened.<br><br><strong>Notable events at Madison Square Garden</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notable firsts</span><br><br>-- February 12, 1879 - The first artificial ice rink in North America opens at the Garden.<br>-- 1902 - The first indoor professional American football game is played.<br>-- 1934 - The first college basketball game at the Garden is played, between the University of Notre Dame and New York University.<br>-- February 28, 1940 - Basketball is televised for the first time (Fordham University vs. the University of Pittsburgh).<br>-- March 19, 1954 - Joey Giardello knocks out Willie Tory in round seven at the Garden in the first televised prize boxing fight shown in color.<br>-- March 31, 1985 - The WWF, now known as the WWE, presents the first WrestleMania Pay Per View event, marketed as the Greatest spectacle in professional wrestling, revolutionizing the Sports Entertainment industry.<br>-- June 14, 1994 - After 54 years the New York Rangers win the Stanley Cup at Madison Square Garden.<br>-- June 29, 1997 - The New York Liberty professional women's basketball team plays their first home game - the first professional women's basketball game to be played at the Garden in many years.<br>-- March 1, 2003 - Quinnipiac University defeats the University of Connecticut 4-3 in the first college hockey game played at Madison Square Garden since 1977.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other notable events</span><br><br>-- June 25, 1906 - Architect Stanford White is assassinated by Harry K.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Estuary</strong></span><br><br>An <strong>estuary</strong> is a semi-enclosed coastal body of water which has a free connection with the open sea and within which sea water mixes with fresh water. The key feature of an estuary is that it is a mixing place for sea water and a significantly-sized river to supply fresh water. A tide is a necessary component to maintain a dynamic relationship between the two waters. Though something in the nature of an estuary can exist in a non-tidal sea, such areas go by names such as lagoon, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ã©tang</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">laguna</span>. In non-tidal seas, the rivers naturally form deltas rather than estuaries.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Estuaries</strong> and coastal waters are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, providing numerous ecological, economic, cultural, and aesthetic benefits and services.</span><br><br>An estuary is typically the tidal mouth of a river, and estuaries are often characterised by sedimentation of silt which usually comes mainly from the sea though in some cases, that from the river predominates. The sand and mud banks and marshes are relied upon as habitat, by for example, wading birds. Estuaries are more likely to occur on submerged coasts, where the sea level has risen in relation to the land, as this process floods valleys to form rias, fjords etc, which can be classified as estuaries in cases where there is a significant river flowing into them.<br><br>The estuaries are sometimes confused with fjords. The Lim bay in Istria, Croatia, is often called "Lim fjord" although it's not actually caused by glaciation but by land erosion by the river Pazincica.<br><br>Issue #113</div>
