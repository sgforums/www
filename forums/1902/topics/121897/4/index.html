It covers much of Greenland; Labrador; most of Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River; much of Ontario outside the southern peninsula between the Great Lakes; the Adirondack Mountains of northern New York; parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota; the central portion of Manitoba away from Hudson Bay and the Great Plains; northern Saskatchewan; a small portion of north-eastern Alberta; and the mainland northern Canadian territories to the east of a line extended north from the Saskatchewan/Alberta border (Northwest Territories and Nunavut). In total it covers approximately 8 million square kilometers.<br><br><strong>Geology</strong><br><br>Such a large area of exposed, old rock requires some explanation. The current surface expression of the Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the bedrock, with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe glaciation during the last ice age, which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean. The multitude of rivers and lakes in the entire region is caused by the watersheds of the area being so young and in a state of sorting themselves out with the added effect of post-glacial rebound. The Shield was originally an area of very large mountains and much volcanic activity, but over the millennia the area was eroded to its current topographic appearance of relatively low relief.<br><br>Mountains have deep roots and float on the denser mantle much like an iceberg at sea. As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the Shield were once far below the earth's surface. The high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for mineralization.<br><br><strong>Mining and economics</strong><br><br>The Shield is one of the world's richest areas in terms of mineral ores. It is filled with substantial deposits of nickel, gold, silver, and copper. Throughout the north of Canada there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since the Sudbury Basin is believed to be an ancient meteorite impact crater.<br><br>The Shield, particularly the portion in the Northwest Territories, has recently been the site of several major diamond discoveries. The kimberlite pipes in which the diamonds are found are of relatively recent origin, and one theory of their origin suggests that the Shield was at some time in the past above a hot spot in Earth's mantle (much like the one that formed Hawaii, but under land rather than ocean). The spot lifted the surrounding landscape as the continent drifted over it, forming the pipes in various locations. The line of subsurface mountains that runs from the eastern seaboard of the United States nearly to Europe before culminating in the Challenger Seamount would, if run backwards in time, follow a path that matches what is suggested.<br><br>The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.<br><br>Issue #71</div>

Before the explosion, Mount Tambora was approximately 4200m (13,000 ft) high; after the explosion, it was only 2,851 m (about 9,000 ft) high. Tambora was not, however, the most violent volcanic eruption of all time. The eruption of Santorini (Thira) in Greece in about 1650 BC was greater, but no accounts of the explosion survive, possibly because it destroyed the nearby civilizations which might have recorded it.

Trails up from the valley floor and down from other regions of the park outside the valley proper lead to both the top and base of upper Yosemite Falls. The upper fall is formed by the swift waters of Yosemite Creek which, after meandering through Eagle Creek Meadow, hurls themselves over the edge of a hanging valley in a spectacular and deafening show of force.<br><br>-- Between the two obvious main plunges there are a series of cascades and smaller plunges generally referred to as "<span style="font-style: italic;">the cataracts</span>". Taken together these account for another drop of 675 feet, nearly twice the height of the lower falls. Because of the layout of the area, the lack of any major drops in this section and the lack of public access they are all too easy to overlook. Most viewpoints in the valley miss them entirely. The best vantage points for the cataracts are found along the Yosemite Falls trail.

However, a traditional bridge could not be built because it would cut off access to the port facilities situated at that time in the Pool of London, between London Bridge and the Tower of London. A tunnel beneath the Thames, the Tower Subway, was opened in 1870, but it could only accommodate pedestrian traffic.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/London_tbr_night_01.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/180px-London_tbr_night_01.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The bridge is illuminated at night.</span><br><br>A <span style="font-style: italic;">Special Bridge or Subway Committee</span> was formed in 1876 to find a solution to the river crossing problem. It opened the design of the new crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette. However, the evaluation of the designs was surrounded by controversy, and it was not until 1884 that a design submitted by Horace Jones, the City Architect, was finally approved.<br><br>Jones' design was for a bascule bridge 800 feet (244 m) in length with two towers each 213 feet (65 m) high, built on piers. The central span of 200 feet (61 m) between the towers is split into two equal bascules or leaves, which can be raised to an angle of 83 degrees to allow river traffic to pass through. Although each bascule weighs over 1,000 tons, they are counterbalanced to minimise the force and time required to raise them, and they can be raised in under one minute. The original hydraulic raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in six accumulators. Water was pumped into the accumulators by steam engines. Although the bridge is raised today electrically, the original steam engines are preserved as a visitor attraction.<br><br><strong>Construction</strong><br><br>Construction of the bridge started in 1886 and took 8 years, employing 5 major contractors and 432 construction workers. Two massive piers containing over 70,000 tons of concrete were sunk into the river bed to support the construction. Over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the towers and walkways. This was then clad in Cornish granite and Portland Stone, both to protect the underlying steelwork and to give the bridge a more pleasing appearance.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Tower_bridge_works_1892.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6f/Tower_bridge_works_1892.jpg/180px-Tower_bridge_works_1892.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Tower Bridge under construction, September 28, 1892</span><br><br>Jones died in 1887, and his chief engineer, Sir John Wolfe-Barry, took over the project.

The official opening ceremony was conducted by the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and his wife, Alexandra of Denmark.<br><br><strong>Tower Bridge today</strong><br><br>The high-level walkways between the towers gained an unpleasant reputation as a haunt for prostitutes and pickpockets and were closed in 1910. They have now been reopened as part of the Tower Bridge Experience, a museum/historical exhibition mostly housed in the bridge's twin towers. The exhibition also includes photos, holograms and a film detailing the build, along with access to the original steam engines that once powered the Bridge bascules, housed in a building close to the south end of the Bridge.<br><br>A "Behind the Scenes" tour can be booked in advance, on which it is possible to see the bridge's command centre (where the raising of the bridge is controlled when a vessel passes underneath). The bascules of the bridge are raised around five hundred times a year.<br><br>Although river traffic is now a fraction of what it used to be, it still takes priority over road traffic.

It is located mainly in the far west of Chad, bordering on northeastern Nigeria. The lake possesses many small islands and mudbanks, and its shorelines are largely comprised of marshes. Because it is very shallow - only 7 metres at its deepest - its area is particularly sensitive to small changes in average depth, and it consequently also shows seasonal fluctuations in size.

Climate change and increased demands on the lake's water have accelerated its shrinkage over the past 40 years. In the 1960s it had an area of more than 26,000 kmÂ², making it the fourth largest lake in Africa. By 2000 its extent had fallen to less than 1,500 kmÂ². This is due to reduced rainfall combined with greatly increased amounts of irrigation water being drawn from the lake and the rivers which feed it, the largest being the Chari/Logon system, which originates in the mountains of the Central African Republic. It seems likely that the lake will shrink further and perhaps even disappear altogether in the course of the 21st century.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8b/ShrinkingLakeChad-1973-1997-EO.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/ShrinkingLakeChad-1973-1997-EO.JPG/250px-ShrinkingLakeChad-1973-1997-EO.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lake Chad in a 2001 satellite image, with the actual lake in blue, and vegetation on top of the old lake bed in green.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Banks Peninsula</strong></span><br><br><strong>Banks Peninsula</strong> is located in the Canterbury region on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand, partly surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, and adjacent to the largest city in the South Island, Christchurch, which has approximately 340,000 residents. The peninsula has a land area of approximately 1,000 kmÂ². The <span style="font-style: italic;">Banks Peninsula District Council</span> has 7,833 residents (2001 census).<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/Banks_Peninsula_from_space.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Banks Peninsula</strong>, including Lyttelton Harbour and Akaroa Harbour, in Canterbury, New Zealand. The peninsula is roughly circular in shape, with many bays, and two deep harbours.</span><br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>There were three phases of Maori settlement on the peninsula. Waitaha were the earliest inhabitants, followed by Kati Mamoe. Ngai Tahu took over in the 17th century.<br><br>The first European sighting of the peninsula was by Captain James Cook during his first circumnavigation of New Zealand in 1769, and he named it in honour of the Endeavour's botanist, Joseph Banks. It is famous as one of his two cartographical errors - unable to see the low plains adjoining the peninsula he charted it as an island. Distracted by a phantom sighting of land to the southeast, he sailed away before exploring any closer and never discovered the two good harbours.<br><br>By the 1830s, Banks Peninsula had become a European whaling centre, to the detriment of the Maori who succumbed in large numbers to disease and inter-tribal warfare exacerbated by the use of muskets. Two significant events in the assumption of British sovereignty over New Zealand occurred at Akaroa. First, in 1830 the Maori settlement at Takapuneke was the scene of a notorious incident. The Captain of the British brig <span style="font-style: italic;">Elizabeth</span>, John Stewart, helped North Island Ngati Toa chief, Te Rauparaha, to capture the local Ngai Tahu chief, Te Maiharanui. The settlement of Takapuneke was sacked. Partly as a result of this massacre, an official British Resident, James Busby, was sent to New Zealand in an effort to stop such atrocities. The events at Takapuneke thus led directly to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. Then in 1838 Captain Langlois, a French whaler, decided that Akaroa would make a good settlement to service the whaling ships and "purchased" the peninsula in a dubious land deal with the local Maori. He returned to France, floated the Nanto-Bordelaise company, and set sail for New Zealand with a group of French and German families aboard the ship Comte de Paris, with the intention of forming a French colony on a French South Island of New Zealand.<br><br>However, by the time Langlois and his colonists arrived at Banks Peninsula in August 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi had already been signed (the signatories including two chiefs at Akaroa in May) and New Zealand's first Governor, William Hobson, had declared sovereignty over the whole of New Zealand. On hearing of the French plan for colonisation, Hobson quickly dispatched the HMS Britomart from the Bay of Islands to Akaroa with police magistrates on board. While Langlois and his colonists sheltered from unfavourable winds at Pigeon Bay on the other side of the peninsula, the British flag was raised at Greens Point between Akaroa and Takapuneke and courts of law convened to assert British sovereignty over the South Island.<br><br>From the 1850s, Lyttelton and then Christchurch outgrew Akaroa, which has developed into a holiday resort and retained many French influences as well as many of its nineteenth century buildings.<br><br>Historic harbour defenses dating from 1874 onwards may be found at Ripapa Island in Lyttelton Harbour and at Godley Head.<br><br><strong>Geology</strong><br><br>Banks Peninsula is the main volcanic feature of the South Island. Geologically, the peninsula is the eroded remnants of two large stratovolcanoes (Lyttelton formed first, then Akaroa). These were formed by intraplate volcanism between approximately eleven and eight million years ago (Miocene) on a continental crust. The peninsula formed as offshore islands, with the volcanoes reaching to about 1,500 m above sea level. Two dominant craters formed Lyttelton and Akaroa Harbours. The Canterbury Plains formed from the erosion of the Southern Alps (an extensive and high mountain range caused by the meeting of the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates) and from the alluvial fans created by large braided rivers, and are at their widest point where they meet the hilly sub-region of Banks Peninsula. The northern and western flanks of the peninsula are covered with a layer of loess, a layer of rather unstable fine silt deposited by the fÃ¶hn winds which bluster across the plains. The portion of crater rim lying between Lyttelton Harbour and Christchurch city is known as the Port Hills.<br><br><strong>Land use</strong><br><br>It is estimated that 98% of the peninsula was once covered by native forest. However, Maori and European settlers successively denuded the forest cover and less than 2% remains today, although some reafforestation is under way. Many English trees, notably walnut, were planted by settlers.<br><br>Several sites off the coast of the peninsula are used for mariculture cultivation of mussels.<br><br>A large Marine Mammal Sanctuary, mainly restricting set net fishing, surrounds much of the peninsula. The principal aim of this is the conservation of Hector's dolphin, the smallest of all dolphin species. Eco-tourism based around the playful dolphins is now a significant industry in Akaroa.<br><br>A relatively small marine reserve called Pohatu is centred on Flea Bay on the south-east side of the peninsula.<br><br>A notable feature of the peninsula is the Summit Road. Built in the 1930s, the road is in two sections - one along the crest of the Port Hills from Godley Head (the northern head of Lyttelton Harbour) to Gebbies Pass at the head of the harbour. The second section runs around the crater rim of Akaroa Harbour from 'Hill Top' - the junction with the main Christchurch-Akaroa highway to a point above Akaroa. Both roads afford spectacular views as well as providing vehicular access to many parks, walkways and other recreational features.<br><br><strong>Statistics</strong><br><br>-- Highest point: Mount Herbert (919 m)<br>-- Permanent population : 7,600<br><br>Issue #81</div>

In the Eastern Pyrenees, with the exception of one break at the eastern extremity of the PyrÃ©nÃ©es AriÃ©geoises, the mean elevation is maintained with remarkable uniformity until a sudden decline occurs in the portion of the chain known as the AlbÃ¨res.<br><br><strong>Geology</strong><br><br>The Pyrenees are older than the Alps: their sediments were first deposited in coastal basins during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. In the Lower Cretaceous period, the Gulf of Gascony (Bay of Biscay) fanned out, pushing Spain against France and putting large layers of sediment in a vice grip. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and stretched progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the Eocene epoch.<br><br>The eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of granite and gneissose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of limestone. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of granite, which is particularly resistant to erosion, as well as weak glacial development.<br><br><strong>Landscape</strong><br><br>Four conspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:<br><br>- the absence of great lakes, such as fill the lateral valleys of the Alps<br>- the rarity and great elevation of passes<br>- the large number of the mountain torrents locally called <span style="font-style: italic;">gaves</span>, which often form lofty waterfalls, surpassed in Europe only by those of Scandinavia<br>- the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, locally called a <span style="font-style: italic;">cirque</span>.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/LacArtouste.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/LacArtouste.png/300px-LacArtouste.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lake of Artouste</span><br><br>The highest waterfall is that of Gavarnie (462 m), at the head of the Gave de Pau; the Cirque de Gavarnie, in the same valley, is perhaps the most famous example of the <span style="font-style: italic;">cirque</span> formation. Not only is there a total lack of those passes, so common in the Alps, which lead across the great mountain chains at a far lower level than that of the neighbouring peaks, but between the two extremities of the range, where the principal highroads and the only railways run between France and Spain, there are only two passes practicable for carriages: the Col de la Perche, between the valley of the TÃªt and the valley of the Segre, and the Col de Somport or Port de Canfranc, on the old Roman road from Saragossa to Oloron.<br><br>A particularly notable feature is La BrÃ¨che de Roland, a gap in the ridge line, in tradition created by Roland.<br><br>Issue #87</div>

Coal deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes but the French side has numerous beds of lignite.<br><br>Mineral springs are abundant and very remarkable, and specially noteworthy are the hot springs, in which the Alps, on the contrary, are very deficient. The hot springs, among which those of BagnÃ¨res de Luchon and Eaux-Chaudes may be mentioned, are sulphurous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of BagnÃ¨res de Bigorre (Hautes-PyrÃ©nÃ©es), Rennes les Bains (Aude) and Campagne (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not very warm.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Pyrenees_summer_stream.jpg/779px-Pyrenees_summer_stream.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Pyrenees_summer_stream.jpg/250px-Pyrenees_summer_stream.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Mountain stream in the summer.</span><br><br><strong>Climate</strong><br><br>The amount of the precipitation, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees, which leads to a marked contrast between these sections of the chain in more than one respect. In the first place, the eastern Pyrenees are without glaciers, the quantity of snow falling there being insufficient to lead to their development. The glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down in the valleys, but have their greatest length in the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there are evidences of a much wider extension of the glaciers during the Ice age. The case of the glacier in the valley of Argelbs in the <span style="font-style: italic;">dÃ©partement</span> of Hautes-PyrÃ©nÃ©es is the best-known instance. The snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from 2,700-2,800 m. above sea-level.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Pyrenees_summit_in_summer.jpg/800px-Pyrenees_summit_in_summer.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Pyrenees_summit_in_summer.jpg/250px-Pyrenees_summit_in_summer.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Pyrenees summit in the summer.</span><br><br><strong>Flora and fauna</strong><br><br>A still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the aspect of the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are very well wooded, but the extent of forest declines eastwards, and the eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. There is a change, moreover, in the composition of the flora in passing from west to east. In the west the flora, at least in the north, resembles that of central Europe, while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character, though the difference of latitude is only about 1Â°, on both sides of the chain from the centre whence the CorbiÃ¨res stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. The Pyrenees are relatively as rich in endemic species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that endemism is the occurrence of the sole European species of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dioscorea</span> (yam), <span style="font-style: italic;">Dioscorea pyrenaica</span>, at a single high site in the central Pyrenees, and that of the monotypic genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Xatardia</span>, only on a high alpine pass between the Val d'Eynes and Catalonia. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the saxifrages, several species of which are endemic here.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/52/Pic_de_Bugatet.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/52/Pic_de_Bugatet.jpg/250px-Pic_de_Bugatet.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Pic de Bugatet in the NÃ©ouvielle Natural Reserve</span><br><br>In their fauna also the Pyrenees present some striking instances of endemism.
