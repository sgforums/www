Both meanings exclude Cuba as well as the Florida Keys.)<br><br>The total area of the Gulf of Mexico is approximately 615,000 miÂ² (1.6 million kmÂ²), the southern third of which lies within the tropics, and plunges to a depth of 2,080 fathoms (3,804 m). This deepest part is Sigsbee Deep, an irregular trough more than 300 nautical miles (550 km) long, sometimes called the "Grand Canyon under the sea." The cooler water from the deep stimulates plankton growth, which attracts small fish, shrimp, and squid. The Gulf Stream, a warm Atlantic Ocean current and one of the strongest ocean currents known, originates in the gulf. The gulf has been visited many times by powerful Atlantic hurricanes, some of which have caused extensive human death and other destruction).<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/GolfVanMexico.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Gulf of Mexico</span><br><br>Tidal ranges are extremely small in the Gulf of Mexico due to the narrow connection with the ocean Â– much like the Mediterranean.<br><br>The Bay of Campeche in Mexico constitutes a major arm of the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, the gulf's shoreline is fringed by numerous bays and smaller inlets. A number of rivers empty into the gulf, most notably the Mississippi River. The land that forms the gulf's coast, including many long, narrow barrier islands, is almost uniformly low-lying and is characterized by marshes and swamps as well as stretches of sandy beach.<br><br>The continental shelf is quite wide at most points along the coast. The shelf is exploited for its oil by means of offshore drilling rigs, most of which are situated in the western gulf. Another important commercial activity is fishing; major catches include various fishes as well as shrimp and crabs, with oysters being harvested on a large scale from many of the bays and sounds. Other important industries along the coast include shipping, petrochemical processing and storage, paper manufacture, and tourism.<br><br>Coastal cities of note include Tampa, St. Petersburg, Pensacola, Mobile, New Orleans, Beaumont, and Houston (all in the U.S.), Tampico, Tuxpam, Veracruz and MÃ©rida (in Mexico), and Havana (in Cuba).<br><br>The gulf's coastal areas were first settled by Native American groups, including those representing several of the early advanced cultures of Mexico. During the period of European exploration and colonization the entire region became a theatre of contention between the Spanish, French and English. The present-day culture of the coastal region is primarily Spanish-American (Mexico, Cuba) and Anglo-American (U.S.).<br><br>A point of interest about the Gulf is that 65 million years ago, the Chicxulub crater was formed when a large meteorite hit the earth. It is hypothesized that this impact was the asteroid that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.<br><br><strong>Pollution</strong><br><br>Because of the ever increasing amount of nitrogen and phosphates dissolved in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, pollution has more than doubled since 1950. Current estimates suggest that three times as much nitrogen is being carried into the Gulf today compared with levels 30 years ago or at any time in history. Blooms of photosynthesizers die and sink, and the processes of their decay exhausts the available supplies of oxygen dissolved in the water. Every summer there is now an area south of the Louisiana coastline, larger than the U.S. state of Massachusetts at over 7,000 miÂ² (18,000 kmÂ²) that is hypoxic. These waters do not carry enough oxygen to sustain marine life. This annually enlarging "dead zone" is a major threat to the fishing industry and to public health.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Fishing_Fleet_in_Biloxi.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fishing Boats in Biloxi</span><br><br>Also, there are frequent "red tide" algae blooms that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore.

Used in prehistoric times by migrating animal herds, the Indians used it after their arrival into North America. The gap was named for Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland who sponsored an expedition into the area in 1750. In 1775, Daniel Boone brought a company of men to cut out a path through the gap to enable a settlement effort by the Transylvania Company in Transylvania. The trail was widened in the 1890s to accommodate wagon traffic.

Where they came ashore, there the viking in question would build his farm.), and found upon HjÃ¶rleifshÃ¶fÃ°i his brother, HjÃ¶rleifur, dead and his slaves missing. Out at sea he could see boats going towards a small group of islands, and likewise he set off after them.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Heimaey_Island.PNG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Heimaey_Island.PNG/340px-Heimaey_Island.PNG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Heimaey off of southwest Iceland</span><br><br>The slaves in question had been abducted from Ireland, and were called westmen (Vestmenn), since Ireland was the most western part of the known world at that time (c.a. 840). The slaves came ashore in Heimaey and took shelter upon the mountains and anywhere else they thought they might be safe, but alas, IngÃ³lfur slaughtered them all, unknowingly creating names for various places in the process - for example "DufÃ¾ekja", an area on Heimaklettur, Heimaey's highest mountain (263 m), is named after the slave DufÃ¾akur, who is said to have thrown himself off Heimaklettur at that point - rather taking his own life that to let IngÃ³lfur take it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First settlers</span><br><br>The first person said to have built a farm in Heimaey was known as HerjÃ³lfur BÃ¡rÃ°arson. He apparently built his farm in HerjÃ³lfsdalur (literally: HerjÃ³lf's valley). The ruins in HerjÃ³lfsdalur were excavated in 1971, and did much to unsettle the story of HerjÃ³lfur BÃ¡rÃ°arson though.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Turkish invasion</span><br><br>The year 1627, three Algerian pirate ships raided many towns on the south coast of Iceland, most notably GrindavÃ­k and Vestmannaeyjar. In GrindavÃ­k townspeople could flee into the lava field of Reykjanes and hide indefinitely, however Heimaey, being so remote and secluded, was hit rather badly. The invasion fleet was called "Turkish" by Icelanders, simply because of a lack of cultural distinction between Islamic countries. Many heroic stories exist of the people who survived the invasion, most notably GuÃ°rÃ­Ã°ur SÃ­monardÃ³ttir, better known as Tyrkja-Gudda (Turkish-Gudda), who was taken from her home at StakkagerÃ°i on Heimaey to a slave market in Algeria. From there she bought her way back to Iceland through Tunisia, Italy and Denmark - Iceland was then under Danish rule.

During the night the 5000 inhabitants of the island were evacuated, mostly by fishing boats, as almost the entire fishing fleet was in dock. The encroaching lava flow threatened to destroy the harbour that was the main source of livelihood for most of the town. However, by spraying the lava constantly with cold sea water some of it solidified and diverted the rest, saving the harbour from destruction. During the eruption, though, half of the town was crushed and the island grew a great deal, however only one fatality could be directly or indirectly attributed to the eruption, and that was the death of a man who had broken into the chemist's store to acquire drugs and was suffocated by toxic fumes.<br><br><strong>Present day</strong><br><br>Currently Vestmannaeyjar is the home to around 4,500 humans, 2,000,000 puffins, and many millions of other birds.<br><br>Issue #244</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Groundwater</strong></span><br><br><strong>Groundwater</strong> is water flowing within aquifers below the water table. Within aquifers, the water flows through the pore spaces in unconsolidated sediments and the fractures of rocks. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps and can form oases or swamps. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal and industrial use through man-made wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology.<br><br>Groundwater can be a long-term 'reservoir' of the natural water cycle (with residence times from days to millennia), as opposed to short-term water reservoirs like the atmosphere and fresh surface water (which have residence times from minutes to years). The figure shows how deep groundwater (which is quite distant from the surface recharge) can take a very long time to complete its natural cycle. Groundwater is naturally replenished by surface water from precipitation, streams, and rivers when this recharge reaches the water table. It is estimated that the volume of groundwater is fifty times that of surface freshwater; the icecaps and glaciers are the only larger reservoir of fresh water on earth.<br><br>Usable groundwater is contained in aquifers, which are subterranean areas (or layers) of permeable material (like sand and gravel) that channel the groundwater's flow. Aquifers can be <span style="font-style: italic;">confined</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">unconfined</span>. If a confined aquifer follows a downward grade from a <span style="font-style: italic;">recharge zone</span>, groundwater can become pressurized as it flows. This can create artesian wells that flow freely without the need of a pump. The top of the upper unconfined aquifer is called the water table or phreatic surface, where water pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Groundwater_flow_times_usgs_cir1139.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Groundwater_flow_times_usgs_cir1139.png/200px-Groundwater_flow_times_usgs_cir1139.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Relative <strong>groundwater</strong> travel times.</span><br><br>Typically groundwater is thought of as liquid water flowing through shallow aquifers, but technically it can also include soil moisture, permafrost (frozen soil), immobile water in very low permeability bedrock, and deep geothermal or oil formation water. Groundwater is believed to provide lubrication and buoyancy which allow thrust faults to move. Nearly any point in the Earth's subsurface has water in it, to some degree (it may be very dry or mixed with other fluids). Groundwater is not confined only to the Earth, either; subsurface water on Mars is believed to have given rise to some of the landforms observed there.<br><br><strong>Problems with groundwater</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Groundwater overdraft</span><br><br>Groundwater is a highly useful and abundant resource, but in arid or semi-arid regions it cannot renew itself as rapidly as it is being withdrawn by humans. If groundwater is extracted intensively from water wells, as for irrigation or municipal use in arid or semi-arid regions, it may not recover to its pre-development state. The most evident problem that may result from this is a lowering of the water table beyond the reach of existing wells. Wells must consequently be deepened to reach the groundwater; in some places (e.g., California, Texas and India) the water table has dropped hundreds of feet due to well pumping. A lowered water table may, in turn, cause other problems such as subsidence.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subsidence</span><br><br>In its natural equilibrium state, the groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer supports some of the weight of the overlying sediments. When groundwater is depressurized or even removed from aquitards, where the materials are very compressible and pore pressures can be high, compaction may occur. This compaction, typically called subsidence, may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is not. Thus the aquifer is permanently reduced in capacity, and the surface of the ground may also subside. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of ground water under it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seawater intrusion</span><br><br>Generally, in very humid or undeveloped regions, the shape of the water table mimics the slope of the surface. The recharge zone of an aquifer near the seacoast is likely to be inland, often at considerable distance. In these coastal areas, a lowered water table may induce sea water to reverse the flow toward the sea. Sea water moving inland is called a saltwater intrusion. Alternatively, salt from mineral beds may leach into the groundwater of its own accord.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mining groundwater</span><br><br>Sometimes the water movement from the recharge zone to the place where it is withdrawn may take centuries (see figure above). When the usage of water is greater than the recharge, it is referred to as mining water (the water is often called fossil water, due to its geologic age). Under those circumstances it is not a renewable resource.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Groundwater pollution</span><br><br>In the Ganges Plain of northern India and Bangladesh, severe natural pollution by arsenic affects 25% of water wells in the shallower of two regional aquifers. The pollution occurs because aquifer sediments contain organic matter (dead plant material) that generates anaerobic (an environment without oxygen) conditions in the aquifer. These conditions result in the microbial dissolution of iron oxides in the sediment and thus the release of the arsenic, normally strongly bound to iron oxides, into the water. As a consequence, arsenic-rich groundwater is often iron-rich, although secondary processes often obscure the association of dissolved arsenic and dissolved iron.<br><br>Not all groundwater problems are caused by over-extraction. Pollutants dumped on the ground or in landfills may leach into the soil, and work their way down into aquifers. Movement of water within the aquifer is then likely to spread the pollutant over a wide area, making the groundwater unusable.

The valley was originally not only made through glacial erosion but by the high pressure melting water which pushed its way beneath the ice.<br><br>On the Folgefonn peninsula which belongs to the Hardangerfjord, the third largest glacier in Norway is found.

Later the fjord became the birthplace for larger tourism influx to Norway, and in 1875 Thomas Cook started with weekly cruise departures from London to the Hardangerfjord, due to its spectacular nature, glaciers and grand waterfalls. Soon after this many of the major waterfalls became the source for large industries in fjord settlements as Odda.<br><br>Today the Hardangerfjord is witness to a renaissance in tourism and new infrastructure for travellers has once again become an industry for the local communities along the fjord.<br><br>The contemporary fjord is divided among the 13 municipalities BÃ¸mlo, Eidfjord, Etne, Granvin, Jondal, Kvam, Kvinnherad, Odda, Sund, Sveio, Tysnes, Ullensvang and Ulvik.

Diamond's quest is to explain why such advanced civilzations developed only in Eurasia, and to do so in ways that do not appeal to ethnocentric myths, but do away with them. Most significantly, although it identifies the main processes and factors of civilizational development that were present in Eurasia, but not elsewhere, it does so by tracing commonalities between Eurasian civilizations, leaving the question open of why Europe came to supersede other Eurasian civilizations after 1800.<br><br><img src="http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/1188/diamond2009we.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Jared Mason Diamond</strong></span><br><br>Diamond was born in Boston to a physician father and a teacher/musician/linguist mother.

During 1962-1966, he returned to Harvard as a junior Fellow. He became professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School in 1966. While in his twenties, he also developed a second parallel career in the ecology and evolution of New Guinea birds, and he has led numerous trips to explore New Guinea and nearby islands. In his fifties, Diamond gradually developed a third career in environmental history, becoming professor of geography and of environmental health sciences at UCLA, his current position.<br><br>Diamond is renowned as the author of a number of popular science works that combine anthropology, biology, linguistics, genetics, and history. While Diamond became a staunch opponent of the use of genetic and racial arguments to account for the differences in technological sophistication, his early work included a paper entitled "Ethnic differences: Variation in human testis size", in which he investigated correlations between possible genetic and racial variations in testicular size and hormone levels and argued that testicular size and hormone levels were highest among African races and lowest in East Asian, with Caucasian populations falling between the two.<br><br>In his most recent book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed</span> (2004), Diamond examines what caused some of the great civilizations of the past to collapse into ruin and considers what contemporary society can learn from their fates.<br><br>Diamond speaks a dozen languages, and his books rely on fields as diverse as molecular biology and archaeology, as well as obscure knowledge about everything from typewriter design to feudal Japan.

Abd Al Kuri and Samha have a population of a few hundred people between them; Darsa is uninhabited. The principal city is Hadiboh (estimated population in 2004, 43,000) The inhabitants of Socotra raise cattle and goats.<br><br>The climate is generally tropical desert, with rainfall being light, seasonal (winter) and more abundant at the higher ground in the interior than along the coastal lowlands.<br><br>Socotra has three geographical terrains: the narrow coastal plains, a limestone plateau permeated with karstic caves, and the Haghier mountains.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6d/Wfm_socotra_landsat.jpg/800px-Wfm_socotra_landsat.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6d/Wfm_socotra_landsat.jpg/280px-Wfm_socotra_landsat.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Satellite image of Socotra</span><br><br>Socotra is one of the most isolated bits of land on earth of continental landmass origin (i.e., not of volcanic origin). The island probably detached from Africa as a fault block during the Middle Pliocene (ca 6 mya), in the same set of rifting events that have opened the Gulf of Aden to its northwest. The long geological isolation of the archipelago and its fierce heat and drought have combined to create a unique and spectacular endemic flora that would be highly vulnerable to change; surveys have revealed that more than a third of the 800 or so plant species of Socotra are found nowhere else. Botanists rank the flora of Socotra among the ten most endangered island flora in the world. The archipelago is a site of global importance for biodiversity conservation and a possible center for ecotourism. Even the Modern South Arabian Semitic language, Soqotri, is spoken only there, although it is related to other South Arabian languages on the Arabian mainland such as Mehri language.<br><br>One of the most striking of Socotra's plants is the dragon's blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari), which is a very strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree. Its red sap was the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a medicine and a dye.<br><br>As with many isolated island systems, bats are the only mammals native to Socotra. In contrast, the marine biodiversity around Socotra is rich, characterized by a unique mixture of species that have originated in farflung biogeographic regions: the western Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, Arabia, East Africa and the wider Indo-Pacific.<br><br>The monsoonal climate is strong: from June to September the island has traditionally been inaccessible, because of exceedingly strong monsoon winds and high seas. In July 1999 a new airport opened Socotra to the outside year round. Most Socotris still live without electricity, running water or a paved road. At the end of the 1990s a United Nations Development Programme was launched with the aim of providing a close survey of the island of Socotra. The semiarid island is mountainous with a narrow coastal plain. Interior mountains rise to 5,000 feet (1,525 meters). The chief products of the island are dates, ghee, tobacco, and fish.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>Socotra appears as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dioskouridou</span> ("of the Dioscurides"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) in the 1st century <span style="font-style: italic;">Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</span>, a navigation aid. In the notes to his translation of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Periplus</span>, G.W.B. Huntingford remarks that the name <span style="font-style: italic;">Socotra</span> is not Greek in origin, but from the Sanskrit <span style="font-style: italic;">dvipa sukhadhara</span> ("island of bliss"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>). A local tradition held that the inhabitants were converted to Christianity by Thomas in AD 52, and in the 10th century the Arab geographer Abu Mohammed Al-Hassan Al-Hamdani stated that in his time most of the inhabitants were Christians.<br><br>The explorer TristÃ£o da Cunha put ashore in the early 16th century and considered Socotra conquered for Portugal, at which time Christianity had disappeared from the island except for stone crosses at which Alvares said people worshipped. However, during a visit of the island in 1542, Francis Xavier found a group of people claiming to be descended from the converts made by St. Thomas.<br><br>The islands passed under the control of the Mahra sultans in 1511, but eventually became a British protectorate in 1886, for whom it was an important strategic stop-over.

A conglomerate by contrast is a sedimentary rock composed of rounded fragments or clasts of pre-existing rocks. Both breccias and conglomerates are composed of fragments averaging greater than 2 mm in size. The angular shape of the fragments indicate that the material has not been transported far from its source. Breccias indicate accumulation in a juvenile stream channel or accumulations due to gravity erosion.

Sometimes the surface of a lava flow will harden while the interior will remain liquid; the fracturing of the surface layer and its subsequent cementation by uncooled lava produces flow breccia.<br><br>The intrusion of plutonic rocks will often shatter the invaded country rock, producing a shatter breccia. In the case of plutonic rocks partly cooled and subsequently broken by further invasions of magma, intrusive breccias are formed. Explosive release of volatiles can form masses or pipe like breccias above an intrusion . These shatter breccias or breccia pipes may be mineralized by later hydrothermal fluids forming metal rich sulfide ores.<br><br>Impact breccias are thought to be diagnostic of an impact event such as an asteroid or comet striking the earth, and are usually found at impact craters.<br><br><strong>Ornamental uses of breccia</strong><br><br>The striking visual appearance of breccias has for millennia made them a popular sculptural and architectural material.
