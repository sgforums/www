            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Lake Vostok</strong></span><br><br><strong>Lake Vostok</strong> is a subglacial lake in Antarctica . It is located at 77Â° S 105Â° E, beneath Russia's Vostok Station, 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) under the surface of the central Antarctic ice sheet. It is 250 kilometers long by 50 kilometers wide at its widest point, thus similar in size to Lake Ontario, and is divided into two deep basins by a ridge. The water over the ridge is about 200 metres (650 feet) deep, compared to roughly 400 metres (1,300 feet) deep in the northern basin and 800 metres (2,600 feet) deep in the southern. Lake Vostok covers an area of 14,000 square kilometers (5,400 square miles), approximately the size of Lake Ontario. It has an estimated volume of 5,400 cubic km (1,300 cubic miles) and consists of fresh water.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Lake_Vostok_Map.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Lake Vostok</strong>'s location within Antarctica (NASA)</span><br><br>Russian and British scientists discovered the lake's existence in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating radar imaging observations and spaceborne radar altimetry. It has been confirmed that the lake contains plenty of liquid water under the kilometers-deep icecap, promising to be the most unspoiled lake on Earth. Its water is very old, with a mean residence time in the order of one million years (as compared with six years for Lake Ontario Â— which is typical for lakes of that size.)<br><br>The average water temperature is around -3 Â°C, below normal freezing point. As to why it remains liquid in the coldest place on Earth, it has been suggested that heat from the Earth's interior (from radioactive decay) radiates up from below to warm rocks on the bottom of the lake. The ice sheet itself may be acting as a blanket, protecting the lake from cold temperatures on the surface. Another possibility is that the lake has not yet had time to freeze after a temperate period that ended about 5,000 years ago. A fourth hypothesis has the lake remaining liquid due to the pressure of the ice bearing down on it.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/Lake_Vostok_Sat_Photo.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lake Vostok from space (NASA GSFC)</span><br><br>Researchers working at Vostok Station produced one of the world's longest ice cores in 1998. A joint Russian, French, and U.S. team drilled and analyzed the core, which is 3,623 meters (11,886 feet) long. Ice samples from cores drilled close to the top of the lake have been analysed to be as old as 420,000 years, suggesting that the lake has been sealed under the icecap for between 500,000 and more than a million years. Drilling of the core was deliberately halted roughly 120 meters (400 feet) above the suspected boundary where the ice sheet and the liquid waters of the lake are thought to meet to prevent contamination of the lake.<br><br>From this core, specifically from ice that is thought to have formed from lake water freezing onto the base of the ice sheet, evidence has been found, in form of some microbes, to suggest that the lake water supports life. Scientists suggested that the lake could possess a unique habitat for ancient bacteria with an isolated microbial gene pool containing characteristics developed perhaps 500,000 years ago.<br><br>Since it has been discovered that it consists of two separate basins divided by a ridge, it has been suggested that the chemical and biological compositions of these two ecosystems are likely to be different.<br><br>Lake Vostok is an oligotrophic extreme environment, one that is supersaturated with oxygen, with typically 50 times higher oxygen levels than those found in ordinary freshwater lakes on Earth. The sheer weight of the continental icecap sitting on top of Lake Vostok is believed to contribute to the high oxygen concentration. Besides dissolving in the water, oxygen and other gases are trapped in a type of structure called a clathrate. In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an icy cage and look like packed snow. These structures form at the high pressure depths of Lake Vostok and would be unstable if brought to the surface.<br><br>Due to this fact, if water is released from Lake Vostok due to drilling, it could gush like a popped carbonated (fizzy) drink can and, if not contained, open the lake to possible contamination and pose a potential hazard to scientists.<br><br>No other natural lake environment on Earth has this much oxygen. Organisms in Lake Vostok are believed to be capable of overcoming very high oxygen stress. They may have had to evolve special adaptations, such as high concentrations of protective enzymes, in order to survive the lake's oxygen-rich environment.<br><br>Due to the lake's similarity to Europa, a moon of Jupiter, confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on Europa.<br><br>In April 2005, German, Russian and Japanese Researchers found that the lakes has tides. Depending on the position of the sun and the moon, the surface rises between 1 and 2 centimeters. The researches assume that the fluctuation of the lake surface has the effect of a pump that keeps the water circulating, which would be necessary for the survival of microorganisms if there are any.<br><br>Issue #41</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Panama Railway</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Panama Railway</strong> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Panama Railroad</span> was the world's first transcontinental railroad. It stretches across the isthmus of Panama from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>The need for the railway was inspired by the California Gold Rush. The project was begun in 1850 and the railroad was completed in 1855, with the first train running from ocean to ocean on 28 January of that year.<br><br>The railway cost some $8 million US to build (8 times the initial estimate in 1850), and presented considerable engineering challenges, going over mountains and through swamps. Over 300 bridges and culverts needed to be built along the route. Some swamps were found to require fill over 100 feet (30 m) in depth before a solid bed could be constructed. It was the most expensive railway per unit length of track built up to that time. It is estimated that more than 12,000 people may have died in its construction; the railroad company kept no official count. Cholera and malaria killed numerous workers.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/CulebraSummit.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The <strong>Panama Railway</strong> at Culebra Summit Station, 1854</span><br><br>It was largely built and financed by private companies from the United States. Among key individuals in building the railway were William H. Aspinwall, George Muirson Totten, and John Lloyd Stephens. Ownership of the railroad was originally by a publicly traded corporation based in New York City, which bought exclusive rights to build across the isthmus from the government of Colombia, Panama being a province of Colombia at the time. The stock of the Panama Railway Company quickly became some of the most highly valued of the era.<br><br>The railway carried significant traffic even while it was under construction, with traffic carried by mules over the unfinished sections. This had not been originally intended, but people crossing the isthmus to California were eager to use such track as had been laid. When only 7 miles (10 km) of track had been completed the railway was doing a brisk business, charging $25 per person for the train ride and another $10 to walk the remaining 40+ miles (60 km) of right-of-way across the isthmus. By the time the line was completed, more than one-third of its cost had already been paid for from fares.<br><br>Upon completion, the 48 mile (77 km) long railway was proclaimed an engineering marvel of the era.<br><br>The Atlantic terminal is in ColÃ³n, Panama; the Pacific in Panama City.<br><br>Until the opening of the Panama Canal, it carried the heaviest volume of freight per unit length of any railroad in the world. The existence of the railway was key in the selection of Panama as the site of the canal. In 1881 the French Compagnie Universelle du Canal InterocÃ©anique purchased controlling interest in the Panama Railway Company. In 1904 the United States government purchased the railway from the French canal company. At the time railway assets included some 75 miles (120 km) of track, 35 locomotives, 30 passenger cars, and 900 freight cars.<br><br>The railway greatly assisted in the building of the canal, which closely paralleled and in some places took over the rail line. Parts of the rail route were moved during the building of the canal, and considerable additions were made to the rail system. The rebuilt and improved Panama Railway beside the canal was completed in 1912.<br><br>After World War II few additional improvements were made to the Panama Railway, and it declined in the late 20th century. In 1979 the US government handed over control to the government of Panama. On 19 June 1998 the government of Panama turned over control to the private <span style="font-style: italic;">Panama Canal Railway Company</span> ("PCRC"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>), with majority shares owned by the Kansas City Southern Railroad. In 2000 and 2001 a large project upgraded the railway to handle large shipping containers, to compete in cargo transport with the Panama Canal.<br><br>Issue #43</div>

Cousteau won three Oscars for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Silent World</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Golden Fish and World Without Sun</span>, as well as many other top awards including the Palme d'Or in 1956 at the Cannes Film Festival. His work did a great deal to popularize knowledge of underwater biology.<br><br>In 1963 with Jean de Wouters Cousteau developed the underwater camera named "Calypso-Phot" which was later licensed to Nikon and became the "Calypso-Nikkor" and then the "Nikonos".<br><br>Together with Jean Mollard he created the SP-350, an two-man submarine that could reach a depth of 350m below the ocean's surface. The successful experiment was soon repeated in 1965 with two submarines that reached 500m.<br><br>Cousteau was made director of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, created the Underseas Research Group in Toulon, was the leader of the Conshelf Saturation Dive Program (long-term immersion experiments, the first manned undersea colonies) and was one of the few foreigners that has been admitted to the American Academy of Sciences.<br><br>Cousteau's popularity was increasing. In October 1960, a large amount of radioactive waste was going to be discarded in the sea by EURATOM. Cousteau organized a publicity campaign which gained wide popular support. The train carrying the waste was stopped by women and children sitting on the railway, and was sent back to its origin. The risk was avoided.<br><br>In Monaco, the following November, an official visit by the French president Charles de Gaulle turned into a debate on the events of October 1960 and on nuclear experiments in general. The French ambassador already had suggested that Prince Rainier avoid the subject, but the president (allegedly) asked Cousteau in a friendly manner to be kind toward nuclear researchers, and Cousteau (allegedly) replied: "No sir, it is your researchers that ought to be kind toward us." During this discussion Cousteau found out that the reason for French experiments and research was American refusal to share its atomic secrets with its allies.<br><br>In 1974 he created the Cousteau Society for the protection of ocean life, which now has more than 300,000 members.<br><br>In 1977, together with Peter Scott, he received the UN international environment prize, and a few years later he also received the American Liberty Medal from Jimmy Carter, then president of the United States.<br><br>In 1992 he was invited to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the United Nations' international conference on environment and development, then he became a regular consultant the UN and the World Bank.<br><br><strong>Legacy</strong><br><br>Cousteau liked to call himself an "oceanographic technician". He was in reality a sophisticated lover of nature, especially that of the sea. His work allowed people of all continents to visit life under the ocean's surface and explore through television the resources of the "blue continent".<br><br>The works that Cousteau produced also created a new kind of scientific communication that caused some criticism by formal academics. The so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">divulgationisme</span>, a simple comprehensible form of sharing scientific concepts, was soon used for other disciplines too and became one of the most important and appreciated characteristics of modern TV broadcasting. The documentary information found in Cousteau's words a linear scheme to follow.<br><br>Now Cousteau's figure is admired, beloved worldwide through the many who love the sea, and is regarded to with a sort of devotion, as symbolic of adventure, nature and exploration.<br><br>Jacques Cousteau died on June 25, 1997, and is buried in the Cousteau family plot at Saint-AndrÃ©-de-Cubzac Cemetery, Saint-AndrÃ©-de-Cubzac, France.<br><br>Issue #47</div>

This site was originally settled by ancient Greek colonists as the city of Byzantium. The Byzantine Empire had its naval headquarters there, and walls were built along the shoreline to protect the city (by then renamed Constantinople) from naval attacks. At the entrance to the Horn, there was a large, floating boom-chain (a huge line of logs bound together by chains) pulled across from Constantinople to the fortress of Galata on the northern side, preventing unwanted ships from entering.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Ac.goldenhorn.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Ac.goldenhorn.jpg/350px-Ac.goldenhorn.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The <strong>Golden Horn</strong> from the southern or Constantinople shore, with the skyline of modern Istanbul on the far shore.</span><br><br>There were three notable times when the chain across the Horn was either broken or circumvented. In the 10th century the Kievan Rus' dragged their ships out of the Bosporus, around Galata, and relaunched them in the Horn; the Byzantines defeated them with Greek fire. In 1204, during the Fourth Crusade, Venetian ships were able to break the chain with a ram. In 1453, Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II copied the tactics of the Rus', towing his ships across Galata into the estuary over greased logs.<br><br>In 1502 Leonardo da Vinci produced a drawing of a single span 720-foot (240 m) bridge as part of a civil engineering project for Sultan Beyazid II. The bridge was intended to span the Golden Horn. It was never built, but Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a smaller bridge based on his design was constructed in Norway.<br><br>After the Fall of Constantinople to Mehmed, Greek citizens, the Greek Orthodox Church, Jews, Italian merchants, and other non-Muslims began to live along the Horn in the Phanar (Fanar) and Balat districts. Today the Golden Horn is settled on both sides, and there are parks along each shore. The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce is also located along the shore, as is a Muslim cemetery. The Galata Bridge, built in 1836, connects Old Istanbul with the districts of Galata and EminÃ¶nÃ¼. Two other bridges, the AtatÃ¼rk Bridge and the HaliÃ§ Bridge, are located further up the Horn. Until the 1980s the Horn was a dumping ground for industrial waste, but has since been cleaned up and is a popular tourist attraction in Istanbul.<br><br><img src="http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/AssetsTurkey/Maps/GoldenHornFmSpace.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Golden Horn from space</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Golden Horn" is its Western name.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Hail</strong></span><br><br><strong>Hail</strong> is a type of graupel (a form of precipitation) composed of balls or irregular lumps of ice. It occurs when supercooled water droplets (remaining in a liquid state despite being below the freezing point, 0 Â°C/ 32 Â°F) in a storm cloud collide with some solid object, such as a dust particle or an already-forming hailstone. The water then freezes around the object. Depending on the wind patterns within the cloud, the hailstone may continue to circulate for some time, increasing in size. Eventually, the hailstone falls to the ground, when the updraft is no longer strong enough to support its weight.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/Large_hailstone.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/Large_hailstone.jpg/180px-Large_hailstone.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">An unusually large hailstone</span><br><br>Hail often forms in strong thunderstorms, often along a cold front, where the layer of air on top is much colder than that on the bottom. The smaller hailstones can bounce up and down between the warm and cold layers due to updrafts and gravity. The longer the stones bounce around, the larger they grow. For the same reason, larger hail can occur in warmer regions in the world due to stronger updrafts. These strong, severe, or even supercell thunderstorms can also occur in summer, even without a cold front.<br><br>Hailstones, while most commonly only a few millimetres in diameter, can sometimes grow to several centimetres or occasionally even bigger. Such big hailstones can do serious damage, notably to automobiles, skylights, and glass-roofed structures. Pea or golfball-size hailstones are not uncommon in severe storms. Rarely, massive hailstones have been known cause concussions or to kill people by causing head trauma.<br><br>The first image above shows an aggregate hailstone. It is a large hailstone with smaller stones visible. The ruler shows the size of this remarkable hailstone. The diameter is approximately 6 inches or 15 cm, the size of a grapefruit. In the picture below, large hail collects on streets and grass during a severe thunderstorm.

The largest hailstone fell in Aurora, Nebraska on June 22, 2003 with a radius of 17.8 cm (7 in.), but its mass was less than that of the Coffeyville stone, possibly because a piece broke off when it hit a house.

They were connected until 1720, when the natural connection was destroyed by a storm flood. The highest point is on the main island, reaching 61 meters from sea level. The two islands are part of the district Pinneberg of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The main island has a good harbour and is frequented mostly by sailing yachts.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/18/Helgoland_aerial.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/300px-Helgoland_aerial.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The two islands of Heligoland</span><br><br><strong>Geology</strong><br><br>The island of Heligoland is a geological oddity Â— the presence of the main island's characteristical red sedimentary rock in the middle of the German Bight is unusual. It is not known to form cliffs anywhere else along the North Sea coast. The formation itself is from the early Eocene geologic age. It is younger than and layered on top of a much thicker bedrock of white chalk, the very same which is well known to form the white cliffs of Dover, and cliffs of Danish and German islands in the Baltic Sea. In fact, a small chalk rock close to Helgoland, called the "whitte klippe" (white cliff) is known to have existed within sight of the island to the west till the 18th century, when storm floods finally eroded it to below sea level. Helgoland's rock is significantly harder than the postglacial sediments and sands forming the islands and coastlines to the east of the island. This is why the core of the island, which a thousand years ago was still surrounded by a large, low-laying marshland and sand dunes and separated from coast in the east only by narrow channels, has remained to this day, although the onset of the North sea has long eroded away all of its surroundings. A small piece of Helgoland's sand dunes remains Â— the sand isle just across the harbour called "die DÃ¼ne" (the Dune), which today holds the air strip.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The German Bight and the area around the island is known to have been inhabited since prehistoric times. Tools made of flint have been recovered from the bottom of the sea surrounding Heligoland.<br><br>In AD 697, Radbod, the last Frisian king, retreated to the then single island after his defeat by the Franks. By 1231 the island is listed as the property of the Danish king Valdemar II. From then until 1714 ownership switched several times between Denmark and the Duchy of Schleswig, with one period of control by the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. In August 1714 it was captured by Denmark, and in 1807 it was seized by the British during the Napoleonic wars.<br><br>Britain gave up the islands to Germany in 1890, and gave up their interests in Madagascar to the French, in return for those countries quitting their claims to the African island of Zanzibar (now a part of Tanzania), largely so the British could intervene there to suppress the slave trade. A "grandfathering<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>"/optant approach prevented the Heligolanders (as they were named in the British measures) from forfeiting advantages because of this imposed change of status.<br><br>Under the German Empire, the islands became a major naval base, and during the First World War the civil population was evacuated to the mainland. The first naval engagement of the war, the Battle of Heligoland Bight was fought nearby in the first month of the war. The islanders returned in 1918, but during the Nazi era the naval base was reactivated. During the Second World War the islanders remained on the main island, but on 18 April 1945 over a thousand allied bombers attacked the islands leaving nothing standing. The civil population was protected in rock shelters, most of the 128 people killed being anti-aircraft crews. The islands were evacuated the following night.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Helgoland_%28WW1%29.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/Helgoland_%28WW1%29.jpg/300px-Helgoland_%28WW1%29.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Heligoland during World War I</span><br><br>From 1945 to 1952 the uninhabited islands were used as a bombing range. On 18 April 1947, the Royal Navy detonated 6800 tons of explosives in a concerted attempt to destroy the main island. While the military installations were destroyed, most of the island remained. In 1952 the islands were restored to the German authorities, which had to clear a huge amount of undetonated ammunition, landscape the main island, and rebuild the houses before it could be reinhabited.<br><br>It is now a holiday resort once again and enjoys a tax exempt status, so much of the economy is founded on sales of cigarettes, alcoholic beverages and perfumes to tourists that visit the islands. The islands are also outside the Schengen area. Its inhabitants are ethnic Friesians who speak (besides German) a distinctive Heligoland variety of the North Frisian language(s).<br><br><strong>Philately</strong><br><br>While Heligoland was a British possession about 20 postage stamps were issued between 1867 and 1890. They have the distinction of being the first multi-colored stamps and are still considered attractive. There were up to eight printings of a single denomination and also a large volume of reprints which are known as the Berlin, Leipzig and Hamburg Reprints, respectively. The Berlin reprints are sometimes better quality than the originals. The reprints were done between 1875 and 1895. Consequently many "old" collections contain reprints rather than originals. Some believe there were seven million reprints as compared to the known 1Â½ million originals, of which perhaps half were sold through the post office and the remainder sold to dealers when withdrawn from use. A few printings were never postally sold but nevertheless found their way into the hands of dealers. The stamps were printed by the Prussian State Printing Office in Berlin. They were denominated in the Hamburg Schilling until 1875, when both German Reich and English values appeared on each stamp issue (the Farthing/Pfennig issues). All are embossed with a silhouette of Queen Victoria excepting the four highest values which represent Heligoland escutcheons. Mint stamps of Heligoland are moderate to medium priced but with some running to 1000 Euros (2005) rarities. Some used stamps have brought 4800 Euros at auction and some covers have brought 10 or 12 thousand Euros. This is an inducement for forgery. Because used stamps are often more valuable than mint stamps, forged postal cancellations are plentiful and are the rule on purported high-value items. Because of the many forged cancellations and many reprints collectors of Heligoland stamps are advised to either become expert or rely on specialists; most reputable dealers will not handle them because of the prevalence of reprints and forgeries. The collector who wishes to become expert is advised to acquaint himself with the Michel Deutschland Spezial Katalog and acquire, at least, Helmuth Lemberger's <span style="font-style: italic;">Helgoland Philatelie</span>.

Bill Rose and Craig Chesner of Michigan Technological University deduced that the total amount of erupted material was about 2,800 kmÂ³; around 2,000 kmÂ³ of ignimbrite that flowed over the ground and around 800 kmÂ³ that fell as ash, with the wind blowing most of it to the west. Such a huge eruption probably lasted nearly two weeks. Very few plants or animals in Indonesia would have survived, and it is possible that the eruption caused a planet-wide die-off. There is some evidence, based on mitochondrial DNA, that the human race was reduced to only a few thousand individuals by the Toba eruption (Toba catastrophe theory).<br><br>A large area collapsed after the ejection of that amount of subsurface material, forming a caldera, which filled with water creating Lake Toba.

The primary source of this calcite is usually marine organisms. These organisms secrete shells that settle out of the water column and are deposited on ocean floors as pelagic ooze. Secondary calcite may also be deposited by supersaturated meteoric waters (groundwater that precipitates the material in caves). This produces speleothems such as stalagmites and stalactites. A further form is composed of oolites (Oolitic Limestone) and can be recognised by its granular appearance. Limestone makes up about 10 percent of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/af/LimestoneWithFossilUSGOV.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/LimestoneWithFossilUSGOV.jpg/180px-LimestoneWithFossilUSGOV.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Limestone</strong> with fossils</span><br><br>Pure limestones are white or almost white. Because of impurities, such as clay, sand, organic remains, iron oxide and other materials, many limestones exhibit different colors, especially on weathered surfaces. Limestone may be crystalline, clastic, granular, or dense, depending on the method of formation. Crystals of calcite, quartz, dolomite or barite may line small cavities in the rock. Chert or Flint nodules are common in limestone layers. Bands of limestone emerge from the Earth's surface in often spectacular rocky outcrops and islands. Examples include the Verdon Gorge in France; Malham Cove in North Yorkshire, England; and the Ha Long Bay National Park in Vietnam.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Limestoneshale7342.JPG"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Limey shale overlaid by <strong>limestone</strong>, Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee</span><br><br>Travertine is a banded, compact variety of limestone formed along streams, particularly where there are waterfalls and around hot or cold springs. Calcium carbonate is deposited where evaporation of the water leaves a solution that is supersaturated with chemical constituents of calcite. Tufa, a porous or cellular variety of travertine, is found near waterfalls.<br><br>Karst topography and caves are often formed in areas composed chiefly of limestone.<br><br>Limestone is a parent material of Mollisols.<br><br><strong>Uses of limestone</strong><br><br>Limestone is quarried for roadbeds, building and landscape construction, and cement manufacture.<br><br>Limestone is especially popular in architecture, and many landmarks around the world, especially in North America and Europe, are made primarily of the material. Limestone is readily available and relatively easy to cut into blocks or more elaborate carving. It is also long-lasting and stands up well to exposure. However, it is a very heavy material, making it impractical for tall buildings; it is also quite expensive. Limestone was most popular in the early 20th and late 19th centuries. Train stations, banks and other structures from that era are normally limestone. Limestone is used as a facade on some skyscrapers, but only in thin sheets rather than solid blocks. In North America, most limestone used in construction comes from Indiana.<br><br>Though the limestone used for construction is good for humid climates, it is vulnerable to acids, making acid rain a problem when it occurs in places where limestone is used extensively. The acids in the water can wear away the details of statues and other art.<br><br>Issue #62</div>

There are unsubstantiable stories of Tai O being the base of many smuggling and piracy operations, with the inlets of the river providing excellent protection from the weather and serving as a hiding place. At nearby Fan Lau, a fort was built in 1729 to protect shipping on the Pearl River. Smuggling of guns, tobacco, drugs and people remain documented as illegal activities, both into and out of mainland China.<br><br>When the British came to Hong Kong, Tai O was known as a Tanka village. During and after the Chinese Civil War, Tai O became a primary entrypoint for illegal immigration for those escaping from the People's Republic of China. Some of these immigrants, mostly Han Chinese, stayed in Tai O, and Tai O attracted people from other Hong Kong ethnic groups, including Hoklo and Hakka.<br><br>The fishing lifestyle is gradually dying out. While many residents continue to fish, it does not provide a sustainable income. There is still a public school on the island and most young people move out when they come of age. In 2000 a large fire broke out destroying many residences. The village now comprises mainly squatter huts and dilapidated stilt houses. The government of the HKSAR had proposed a new town on the site but it met with grassroots opposition. Plans for a container cargo terminal, a theme park, and residential towers have also been proposed. There is currently a large land reclamation project on the Lantau side.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Reclamation_at_Tai_O.jpg/800px-Reclamation_at_Tai_O.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Reclamation_at_Tai_O.jpg/300px-Reclamation_at_Tai_O.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reclamation Project at Tai O, Lantau Island, Hong Kong</span><br><br><strong>Sights and cuisine</strong><br><br>Also known as the "Venice of Hong Kong", Tai O is also a hot tourist spot for both foreigners and residents of other parts of Hong Kong, despite damage by the fire in July 2000.

This transfer entails a change in the physical nature of water from liquid to gaseous phases. Along with evaporation can be counted transpiration from plants. Thus, this transfer is sometimes referred to as <span style="font-style: italic;">evapotranspiration</span>.<br><br>-- <strong>Precipitation</strong> is atmospheric moisture that has previously condensed to form clouds (changed from the gas phases to a liquid or solid phase), falling to the surface of the earth. This mostly occurs as rainfall, but snow, hail, fog drip, and other forms participate as well.<br><br>-- <strong>Infiltration</strong> into the ground is the transition from surface water to groundwater. The infiltration rate will depend upon soil or rock permeability as well as other factors. Infiltrated water may reach another compartment known as groundwater (i.e. an aquifer). Groundwaters tend to move slowly, so the water may return as surface water after storage within an aquifer for a period of time that can amount to thousands of years in some cases. Water returns to the land surface at lower elevation than where it infiltrated, under the force of gravity or gravity induced pressures.<br><br>-- <strong>Runoff</strong> includes the variety of ways by which land surface water moves down slope to the oceans. Water flowing in streams and rivers may be delayed for a time in lakes. Not all precipitated water returns to the sea as runoff; much of it evaporates before reaching the ocean or reaching an aquifer.<br><br>-- <strong>Subsurface flow</strong> incorporates movement of water within the earth, either within the vadose zone or aquifers. After infiltrating, subsurface water may return to the surface or eventually seep into the ocean.<br><br>Issue #65</div>
