This earthquake was considered moderate, with a moment magnitude of 6.7, but was the most monetarily costly quake in United States history. The Guinness Book of World Records rates the earthquake at a 7.5.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy2.png/800px-Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy2.png/180px-Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy2.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Aftermath of the 1994 <strong>Northridge earthquake</strong>. The underpass of the 10 Freeway at La Cienega Blvd. It shows the collapsed section of the freeway.</span><br><br>The epicenter was in the San Fernando Valley, originally believed to be in the community of Northridge (later shown to actually have occurred within the neighboring community of Reseda), about 32 km (20 mi) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The National Geophysical Data Center places the epicenter's geographical coordinates at 34.213 N and 118.537 W, which is at the end of Elkwood St., just east of Baird Av.<br><br>Damage occurred up to 77 km (52 mi) away, with the most damage in the west San Fernando Valley and the city of Santa Monica. Fifty-seven people were killed, and over 1,500 were seriously injured. Major freeway damage occurred up to 32 km (20 mi) from the epicenter. Portions of Interstate 10 (the Santa Monica Freeway) and California State Highway 14 (the Antelope Valley Freeway) collapsed and had to be rebuilt.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy.png/800px-Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy.png/180px-Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The support columns were crushed into giant metal cage-like states.</span><br><br>This quake was unusual because the epicenter was within a major metropolitan area. Although several commercial buildings collapsed, loss of life was minimized because of the early morning hour of the quake, and it occurred on the birthdate (observed) of Martin Luther King, Jr., a federal holiday. Also, because of known seismic activity in California, area building codes dictate that buildings incorporate structural design intended to reduce the risk of structural collapse due to earthquakes. As it turned out, one of the few multi-family buildings to collapse had not been built to code.<br><br>Through investigation of damaged buildings, it was discovered that structural steel did not perform as well as expected. Because nobody anticipated that steel would fail at the rate that it did, buildings that were not expected to have major damage were red-tagged many months after the quake, when the inspectors finally got to them. This new information on the nature of earthquake damage resulted in even more stringent building codes.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy3.png/800px-Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy3.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy3.png/180px-Northridge_earthquake_10_frwy3.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The freeway bent even before the collapsed section.</span><br><br>The quake produced unusually strong thrust, with accelerations in the range of 1.0 g over a large area. While most of the damage was caused by shaking, some damage was also caused by fire and by ground deformation. In some areas the ground surface was permanently uplifted by up to 50 cm (20 in).<br><br>This was the third very destructive earthquake to occur in California in 23 years. The first was the Mw 6.6 San Fernando (Sylmar) Earthquake, affecting the same area in 1971; the second was the Mw 6.9 (Richter magnitude 7.1), 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake south of San Francisco. The 1994 event is the most damaging earthquake to strike the United States since the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. In terms of financial loss, the earthquake is also one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, comparable to Hurricane Andrew in 1992.<br><br>Several key hospitals suffered severe structural damage and were rendered unusable after the earthquake. Not only were they unable to serve their local neighborhoods, they had to transfer out their inpatient populations, which further increased the burden on nearby hospitals that were still operational. As a result, the state legislature passed a law requiring all California hospitals to ensure that their acute care units and emergency rooms are in earthquake-proof structures by January 1, 2005.<br><br>Issue #116</div>

From the 1460s, the goal had become one of rounding that continent's southern extremity and gaining easier access to the riches of India (mainly black pepper and other spices) through a reliable sea route instead of the costly and unsafe overland route.<br><br>Da Gama was born in Sines. He was slightly younger than 20 years old as these long-term plans were coming to fruition. Bartolomeu Dias had returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope and exploring as far as the Fish River in modern-day South Africa, while Pero da CovilhÃ£ in India had explored south for some of the distance intervening between subcontinent and the end of explorations. It remained only for the two segments to be joined into one voyage.<br><br>This task was given to Da Gama's father, EstevÃ£o da Gama, but he died before he could begin. Vasco was then given the job on the strength of his work for the Portuguese crown along the Gold Coast of Africa. On July 8, 1497 four ships (the <span style="font-style: italic;">SÃ£o Gabriel</span>, the <span style="font-style: italic;">SÃ£o Rafael</span>, whose commander was his brother Paulo da Gama, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Berrio</span>, and a storage ship of unknown name) left Lisbon and the voyage began.<br><br>By December 16 they had passed the Fish River and continued on into waters unknown to Europeans. With Christmas pending they gave the coast they were passing the name Natal (Christmas in Portuguese), which it retains to this day. By January they had reached modern-day Mozambique, Arab-controlled territory on the East African coast that was part of the Indian Ocean's network of trade. Having got that far, da Gama was able to employ a pilot at Malindi, who brought the expedition the rest of the way to Calicut (the exact Malayalam name is <span style="font-style: italic;">Kozhikode</span>) on the southwest coast of India on May 20, 1498. Sometimes violent negotiations with the local ruler (the <span style="font-style: italic;">Samoothiri Raja</span>, usually anglicized as <span style="font-style: italic;">Zamorin</span>) ensued in the teeth of resistance from Arab merchants. Eventually da Gama was able to gain an ambiguous letter of concession for trading rights, but had to sail off without warning after the Zamorin insisted on his leaving behind all his goods as collateral. Da Gama kept his goods, but left behind a few Portuguese with orders to start a trading post.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7c/Vascodagama.JPG" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7c/Vascodagama.JPG/200px-Vascodagama.JPG"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Vasco da Gama on board a boat</span><br><br>Upon his return to Portugal in September 1499, da Gama was richly rewarded as the man who had brought to fruition a plan that had taken eighty years. He was given the title "Admiral of the Indian Ocean", and on February 12, 1502 he sailed again with a fleet of twenty warships to enforce Portuguese interests. Pedro Ã�lvares Cabral had been sent out two years earlier (on which voyage he incidentally discovered Brazil, though some claim this it was intentional) and found that those at the trading post had been murdered, encountered further resistance and bombarded Calicut.<br><br>Da Gama assaulted and exacted tribute from the East African Arabian port of Kilwa, which had been one of those involved with frustrating the Portuguese; he played privateer amongst Arab merchant ships; and then finally smashed a Calicut fleet of twenty-nine ships and essentially conquered that port city. In return for peace, he received valuable trade concessions and a vast quantity of plunder that put him in extremely good favor with the Portuguese crown. Returning to Portugal, he was made Count Vidigueira out of lands that had previously belonged to the royal BraganÃ§a family.<br><br>Having acquired a fearsome reputation as a "fixer" of problems that arose in India, he was sent to the subcontinent once more in 1524. The intention was that he was to replace the incompetent Eduardo de Menezes as viceroy of the Portuguese possessions, but he died not long after arriving in Calicut. After burial for some time at St.Francis Church, Fort Kochi, Kochi, India, his remains were returned to Portugal in 1539 and re-interred in Vidigueira.<br><br>As much as anyone after Henry the Navigator, da Gama was responsible for Portugal's success as an early colonizing power. Besides the first voyage itself, it was his astute mix of politics and war on the other side of the world that placed Portugal in a prominent position in the Indian Ocean trade.

The best snow to use for this purpose is snow which has been blown by wind, which can serve to compact and interlock the ice crystals. The hole left in the snow where the blocks are cut from is usually used as the lower half of the shelter. Sometimes, a short tunnel is constructed at the entrance to reduce wind and heat loss when the door is opened. Due to snow's excellent insulative properties, inhabited igloos are surprisingly comfortable inside.<br><br>Central Eskimos, especially those around the Davis Strait, line the living area with skin, which can increase the temperature within from around 2Â°C to 10-20Â°C.<br><br>Architecturally, the igloo is unique in that it is a dome that can be raised out of independent blocks leaning on each other and polished to fit without an existing supporting structure.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/Igloo_see-through_sideview_diagram.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sideview diagram of an Igloo: opening to the right</span><br><br>Because "igloo", or <span style="font-style: italic;">iglu</span> in standard orthography, is simply the Inuktitut word for a house of any kind, since the twentieth century a snowhouse in Inuktitut is frequently called an <span style="font-style: italic;">igluvigaq</span>, or <span style="font-style: italic;">igluvigait</span> in plural, in distinction.<br><br><strong>Other kinds of snowhouses</strong><br><br>For fun, or for winter camping and survival purposes, it is possible to construct a simpler but similar kind of snow shelter by simply creating a large pile of snow and excavating the inside. The snow need not be of the same quality, and the construction is easier (less experience needed). Such shelters are usually not as sturdy and permanent as proper igloos.<br><br>A nice trick to make the building of a snowhouse much quicker and less labour intense is to first make a pile of (cardboard) boxes and then cover the box pile with snow. Then cut open "the door" and pull out the boxes. This means one needs to use much less snow or one can build a much bigger snowhouse. (Old cardboard boxes can usually be acquired at the local supermarket if one asks nicely.)<br><br>To make the snowhouse much more robust and safer it is recommended to pour water over it so it gets covered in ice. This makes it harder and sturdier and also makes it slippery, which discourages kids from climbing on top of if. Kids climbing on the house are usually the only reason why snowhouses collapse. A collapsing snowhouse can be very dangerous if kids get caught inside. (By the way, pour the water after pulling out the boxes since it is very hard to cut open a door in an icy house.)<br><br>Issue #123</div>

Although it is not the largest dam in the world, it has the largest generating capacity and produces the most electricity. Its generating capacity (but not its annual production of electricity) will be surpassed by China's Three Gorges Dam. Two more generator units are currently being built. When finished in the first half of 2005, Itaipu will be capable of a total output of 14,000 MW of power.

However, Paraguay sells the majority of its power to Brazil (and therefore has not had difficulty in paying for the project). Even in this configuration, the plant supplies 25% of the power consumed by Brazil and 90% of that consumed by Paraguay. Furthermore, this electricity for Paraguay is sold very cheaply and so although it is poor, its citizens can afford abundant lighting. On the other hand, Itaipu was built during the corrupt Stroessner dictatorship and so a small number of families owning large construction businesses benefitted significantly at the expense of the general population.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Itaipu.jpg/800px-Itaipu.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Itaipu.jpg/250px-Itaipu.jpg"></a><br><br><strong>Power transmission</strong><br><br>The power generated by the generators on the Paraguay side is done at a frequency of 50 Hertz, as 50 Hertz is the grid frequency of Paraguay. The generators on the Brazilian side run with the grid frequency of Brazil, which is 60 Hertz. Because Paraguay cannot consume all the energy produced by its generators, a part of it is transfered via the HVDC Itaipu to the area of SÃ£o Paulo.

They have narrow flood plains, steep sides, and relatively high population density. All three valleys flow down to Salisbury where the rivers meet. Durrington and Amesbury are the only towns on the plain, though there are a number of small villages and hamlets. The A303 cuts across the plain, and a tunnel is soon to be constructed to protect Stonehenge from the damage done by the huge volume of traffic which passes just metres from the stones.<br><br>The Hampshire Downs and the Berkshire and Marlborough Downs are chalk downland to the east and north of Salisbury Plain, and the Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase are to the southwest. In the west and northwest the geology is mainly of the clays and limestones of the Blackmore Vale, Avon Vale and Vale of Wardour. To the south is the New Forest.<br><br>Salisbury Plain has featured in the writings of William Wordsworth, Thomas Hardy, William Henry Hudson, and A.G. Street and in the paintings of Constable.<br><br>The plain is one of the Ministry of Defence and NATO's principal training grounds because of the sparse population. Because of the large training areas inaccessible to the public, the plain is also a wildlife haven, and home to two National Nature Reserves, but there is concern that the low level of grazing on the plain could allow scrub to encroach on the grassland.<br><br>The plain is also home to DSTL Porton Down, a laboratory whose work is shrouded in secrecy.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>Salisbury Plain is famous for its history. In Neolithic times there was an extensive population and much of the original vegetation had been cleared. The population was centred around the causeway camps of Whitesheet Hill and Robin Hood's Ball. By 2200 BC, Stonehenge and Avebury had become a focus for building, including a large quantity of round barrows and long barrows. Around 600 BC, large Bronze Age hill forts were constructed at Scratchbury and Battlesbury. Roman roads are visible features, probably serving a settlement near Old Sarum. Villas are sparse, however, and Anglo-Saxon place names suggest that the plain was mostly a grain producing imperial estate.<br><br>In the sixth century Anglo-Saxon incomers built planned settlements in the valleys surrounded by strip lychetts, with the downland left as sheep walks. To the south is the city of Salisbury, whose 13 and 14th century cathedral is famous for having the tallest spire in the country, and the building was, for centuries, the tallest building in Britain. The cathedral is evidence of the prosperity the wool and cloth trade bought to the area. In the post-Medieval period, the system of floated flood meadows was developed, and large manors and estates developed around Salisbury. In the mid-19th century the wool and cloth industry began to decline, leading to a decline in the population and change in land use from sheep farming to agriculture and military use. Wiltshire became one of the poorest counties in England during this period of decline. There are a number of chalk carvings on the plain, of which the most famous is the Westbury White Horse. The Kennet and Avon Canal runs to the north of the plain, through the Vale of Pewsey.<br><br>In 1896 George Kemp and Marconi experimented with wireless telegraphy on Salisbury Plain, and achieved good results over a distance of 1Â¾ miles.<br><br>Issue #131</div>

There is also a small amount of water vapor that respires from plants and evaporates to join other water molecules in condensing into clouds<br><br>The amount of rainfall is measured using a rain gauge. It is expressed as the depth of water that collects on a flat surface, and can be measured to the nearest 0.25 mm or 0.01 in. It is sometimes expressed in litres per square metre (1 L/mÂ² = 1 mm).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Rain_on_grass.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/95/Rain_on_grass.jpg/250px-Rain_on_grass.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Raindrops on grass</span><br><br>Falling raindrops are often depicted in cartoons as "tear-shaped", round at the bottom and narrowing towards the top, but this is incorrect (only drops of water dripping from some sources are tear-shaped at the moment of formation). Small raindrops are nearly spherical. Larger ones become increasingly flattened, like hamburger buns; very large ones are shaped like parachutes. On average, raindrops are 1 to 2 mm in diameter. The biggest raindrops on Earth were recorded over Brazil and the Marshall Islands in 2004 - some of them were as large as 10 mm. The large size is explained by condensation on large smoke particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water.<br><br>Generally, rain has a pH slightly under 6, simply from absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which dissociates in the droplet to form minute quantities of carbonic acid. In some desert areas, airborne dust contains enough calcium carbonate to counter the natural acidity of precipitation, and rainfall can be neutral or even alkaline. Rain below pH 5.6 is considered acid rain.<br><br><strong>Culture</strong><br><br>Cultural attitudes towards rain differ across the world.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Sea floor spreading</strong></span><br><br><strong>Sea floor spreading</strong> is a part of the theory of plate tectonics. Sea floor spreading is the process by which continental drift occurs. This mechanism, which is a more accurate version of Alfred Wegener's original drift of continents that "plow" through the sea, was proposed by Harry Hess from Princeton University in the 1960s. This phenomenon is known to be caused by convection currents in the plastic, very weak upper mantle, or asthenosphere.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Earth_seafloor_crust_age_1996.gif/800px-Earth_seafloor_crust_age_1996.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Earth_seafloor_crust_age_1996.gif/300px-Earth_seafloor_crust_age_1996.gif"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The age of oceanic crust. Youngest crust is along spreading centers created by <strong>sea floor spreading</strong>.</span><br><br><strong>Incipient spreading</strong><br><br>In the general case, sea floor spreading starts as a rift in a continental land mass, similar to the Red Sea-East Africa Rift System today. The process starts with heating at the base of the continental crust which causes it to become more plastic and less dense. Because less dense objects rise in relation to more dense objects, the area being heated becomes a broad dome. As the crust bows upward, fractures occur that gradually grow into rifts. The typical rift system consists of three rift arms at approximately 120 degree angles. These areas are named triple junctions and can be found in several places across the world today.<br><br><strong>Early spreading</strong><br><br>If spreading continues past the incipient stage described above, two of the rift arms will open while the third arm stops opening and becomes a 'failed rift'. As the two active rifts continue to open, eventually the continental crust is attenuated as far as it will stretch. At this point basaltic oceanic crust begins to form between the separating continental fragments. When one of the rifts opens into the existing ocean, the rift system is flooded with seawater and becomes a new sea. The Red Sea is an example of a new arm of the sea, and the East Africa rift is a "failed" arm that is opening somewhat more slowly than the other two arms. During this period of initial flooding the new sea is sensitive to changes in climate and eustasy. As a result the new sea will evaporate (partially or completely) several times before the elevation of the rift valley has been lowered to the point that the sea becomes stable. During this period of evaporation large evaporite deposits will be made in the rift valley. Later these deposits have the potential to become hydrocarbon seals and are of particular interest to petroleum geologists.<br><br>Sea floor spreading can stop at any time in the process, but if it continues far enough that the continent is completely severed a new ocean basin is created. The Red Sea has not yet completely split Arabia from Africa, but a similar feature can be found on the other side of Africa that has broken completely free. South America once fit into the area of the Niger Delta. The Niger River has formed in the failed rift arm of the triple junction.<br><br><strong>Continued spreading and subduction</strong><br><br>The new oceanic crust is quite hot relative to old oceanic crust, so the new oceanic basin is shallower than older oceanic basins. Since the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise (EPR)) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a "textbook" slow spreading center while the EPR is used as an example of fast spreading. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.<br><br>Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.<br><br><strong>Debate and search for mechanism</strong><br><br>At the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (and other places), material from the upper mantle rises through the faults between oceanic plates to form new crust as the plates move away from each other, a phenomenon first observed as continental drift. When Alfred Wegener first presented a hypothesis of continental drift in 1912, conservative geologists, especially in North America, demanded to know where the motive force could possibly lie. Discoveries of the earth's great fiery welts, like the mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise have provided the explanation.<br><br>It is still a matter of some debate whether seafloor spreading is driven primarily by the force of rising magma at these locations, or if it is driven by the force of sinking magma elsewhere and these upwellings are merely a side effect. It is likely however that some seafloor spreading is driven by active upwelling and some by passive upwelling.<br><br>Issue #133</div>

Transparency ranges from translucent to transparent and crystal faces are highly lustrous (vitreous to adamantine). Scheelite possesses distinct cleavage and its fracture may be subconchoidal to uneven. Its specific gravity is high at 5.9Â–6.1 and its hardness is low at 4.5Â–5. Aside from pseudo-octahedra, scheelite may be columnar, granular, tabular or massive in habit. Twinning is also commonly observed and crystal faces may be striated. Scheelite streaks white and is brittle.<br><br>Gems cut from transparent material are fragile yet attractive: Scheelite's refractive index (1.918Â–1.937 uniaxial positive, with a maximum birefringence of 0.016) and dispersion (0.026) are both moderately high. These factors combine to result in scheelite's high lustre and perceptible "fire", approaching that of diamond. Owing to low hardness, however, cut scheelites are best enjoyed unset as valuable collector's pieces.<br><br>Rockhounds treasure scheelite for its fluorescent properties: under shortwave ultraviolet light, the mineral glows a bright sky-blue.

Gemmologists distinguish natural scheelite from synthetic material mainly by microscopic examination: Natural material is very seldom without internal growth features and inclusions (imperfections), while synthetic material is usually very clean. Distinctly artificial curved striae and clouds of minute gas bubbles may also be obvserved in synthetic scheelite.<br><br>The visible absorption spectrum of scheelite, as seen by a hand-held (direct vision) spectroscope, may also be of use: Most natural stones show a number of faint absorption lines in the yellow region of the spectrum (~585 nm) due to praseodymium and neodymium trace impurities. Conversely, synthetic scheelite is often without such a spectrum.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Grand Canal of China</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Grand Canal of China</strong>, also known as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Jing-Hang Grand Canal</span> is the largest ancient canal or artificial river in the world, the oldest part of the canal dates back to 5th century B.C.<br><br>In the year of 604, Emperor Yang Guang of Sui Dynasty left Chang'an (in Xi'an), the capital, and made his rounds in Luoyang. In 605, the emperor gave an order to build two projects: transferring the capital from ChangÂ’an to Luoyang (in Henan) and excavating the Grand Canal linking Beijing and Hangzhou. It took over six years to build the Grand Canal linking all the canals along it and connecting Haihe, Huang He (Yellow River), Huaihe, Yangtze and Qiantangjiang rivers. The Grand Canal starts north in Beijing and ends south in Hangzhou of Zhejiang with a total length of 1,794 kilometers (1,115 miles), passes Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Kaiserkanal01.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Kaiserkanal01.jpg/250px-Kaiserkanal01.jpg"></a><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Grand Canal of China</span></strong><br><br>According to the writings published by PÃ¨re Gandar, the total length of the canal is 3,630 li, or about 1,200 miles. A rough measurement, taking account only of the main bends of the canal, makes its length 850 miles. After leaving Hangzhou the canal passes round the eastern border of the Lake Tai, surrounding in its course the beautiful city of Suzhou, and then trends in a generally north-westerly direction through the fertile districts of Jiangsu as far as Jingjiang on the Yangtze.<br><br>In this, the southern section, the slope is gentle and water is plentiful (from 7 feet at low water to 11 feet, and occasionally 13 feet at high water). Between Suzhou and Jingjiang the canal is often over 100 feet (30 m) wide, and its sides are in many places faced with stone. It is spanned by fine stone bridges, and near its banks are many memorial arches and lofty pagodas.<br><br>In the central portion of the canal, that is between Jingjiang and Qingjiangpu, at which latter place it crosses the dry channel which marks the course of the Huang He (Yellow River) before 1852, the current is strong and difficult to ascend in the upward (northern) journey. This part of the canal skirts several lakes and is fed by the Huai He as it issues from the Xingzuo lake. The country lying west of the canal is higher than its bed; while the country east is lower than the canal, The two regions are known respectively as Shanghe (above the river) and Xiahe (below the river). Waste weirs opening on the Xiahe (one of the great rice-producing areas of China) discharge the surplus water in flood seasons.<br><br>The northern and considerably the longest section of the canal, extends from the old bed of the Yellow river to Tianjin. It largely utilizes existing rivers and follows their original windings. Between Xingjiangpu and the present course of the Yellow river the canal trends north-northwest, skirting the highlands of Shandong. In this region it passes through a series of lagoons, which in summer form one lake -- Zhouyang. North of that lake on the east bank of the canal, is the city of Ziningzhou. About 25 miles north of that city the highest level of the canal is reached at the town of Nan Wang. Here the river Wen enters the canal from the east, and about 30 miles farther north the Yellow river is reached. On the west side of the canal, at the point where the Yellow river now cuts across it, there is laid down in Chinese maps of the 18th century a dry channel which is described as being followed by the Yellow river before it took the channel it abandoned in 1851-1853.<br><br>The passage of the Yellow river to the part of the canal north of this stream is difficult, and can only be effected at certain levels of the river. Frequently the waters of the river are either too low or the current is too strong to permit a passage. Leaving this point the canal passes through a well-wooded and hilly country west of Dongping Zhou and east of Dongchang Fu. At Linjing Zhou it is joined at right angles by the Wei river in the midst of the city. Up to this point, i.e. from Qingjiangbu to Linjing Zhou, a distance of over 300 miles, navigation is difficult and the water-supply often insufficient. The differences of level, 20 to 30 feet, are provided for by barrages over which the boats -- having discharged their cargo -- are hauled by windlasses. Below the junction with the Wei the canal borrows the channel of the river and again becomes easily navigable. Crossing the frontier into Zhili, between De Zhou and Zang Zhou, which it passes to the west, it joins the Beihe at Tianjin, after having received the waters of the Geduo river in the neighbourhood of Qing Jian .<br><br>The most ancient part of the canal is the section between the Yangtze and the Huai He. This part is thought, on the strength of a passage in one of the books of Confucius, to have been built c. 486 BC. It was repaired and enlarged in the 3rd century AD. The southern part, between the Yangtze and Hangzhou, was built early in the 7th century AD (initially named as Jiang Nan He). The northern part is stated to have been constructed in the years 1280 to 1283. The northern portion of the canal is now of little use as a means of communication between north and south. It is badly built, neglected and charged with the mud-laden waters of the Yellow River. The central and southern portions of the canal are very largely used.<br><br>Issue #137</div>

This process takes millions of years to happen, but the results can be seen today in the rocks of the continents.<br><br>The middle of most continents have not been crunched or squished up the way the edges have been. That is because the middle of the continents are made of very strong old rock. This part of the continent is called the stable craton. Indiana is located near the middle of the North American craton.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/North_america_craton_nps.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/North_america_craton_nps.gif/300px-North_america_craton_nps.gif"></a><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">North American craton</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The brown area shows the part of the North American continent that has been stable for over 600 million years. This region is made up of a basement older Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rock that is mostly covered by a relatively thin cover of younger sedimentary rock. Geologists call these long-stable continental cores cratons.<br><br>The green area on the illustration shows new continental material that was added relatively recently, within the last 600 million years or so. Continents can grow when two plates collide, welding, or accreting, the two pieces together. Continents also grow when oceanic crust is scraped off oceanic plates as they sink in subduction zones.<br><br>The purple area fringing the stable continental core is made up of older Precambrian basement that was deformed during plate collisions that occurred within the last 600 million years. The force of collision produced great folds and faults that sometimes penetrated deep into the continental interior. Where the crust was uplifted, these folds and faults are exposed at the surface, allowing geologists to piece together the ancient history of our continent.</span><br><br><strong>Interior Platform</strong><br><br>While much of the stable craton is exposed at the surface north of Indiana as the Canadian Shield, the middle of the craton, located in the United States, is covered with sedimentary rocks of the Interior Platform. The sequence of rocks varies from approximately 3,500 in excess of 20,000 feet in thickness. The cratonic rocks are metamorphic and igneous while the overlying sedimentary rocks are composed mostly of limestones, sandstones, and shales. These sedimentary rocks were deposited from 650 to 290 million years ago.<br><br><strong>Tectonic Setting</strong><br><br>The metamorphic and igneous rocks of the "basement complex" were created 1.5 to 1.0 billion years ago in a tectonically active setting. It was a setting of great pressure and temperature. The younger sedimentary rocks that were deposited on top of this basement complex were formed in a setting of quiet marine and river waters. Much of this time the craton was covered by a large shallow sea, a so-called "epicratonic sea" (meaning literally "on" the craton). Sometimes land masses or mountain chains rose up on the distant edges of the craton and then eroded down, shedding their sand across the landscape.<br><br>Issue #138</div>

Within the caldera there are two lakes (Paulina Lake and East Lake) many cinder cones, lava flows, and obsidian domes.<br><br>A deep gash in the northern caldera wall, dubbed The Fissure, is the end of a 29 mile (47 km) long series of fractures called the Northwest Rift Zone. Approximately 6,100 years ago, fissure basalt flows erupted from the rift and covered part of Newberry's northwest flank.<br><br>A great deal of volcanic activity has occurred on Newberry's shield, which itself has one of the largest collections of cinder cones, domes, lava flows, and fissures in the world (local residents call these parasitic vents the "Paulina Mountains", as if they were their own mountain range). Most of the cinder cones are 200 to 400 ft (60 to 120 m) high and have shallow saucer-shaped summit craters. They are typically surrounded by basalt or andesite that erupted from their bases, forming large lava beds. There are also about 20 rhyolite domes or fissures on the eastern, southern, and western flanks. Larger examples include McKay Butte on the west flank (580,000 years old), China Hat (780,000 years old) and East Butte (850,000 years old) on the far eastern base.<br><br>During the late Pleistocene and Holocene there have been six eruptive episodes; four rhyolitic (east half of the caldera) and two basaltic (on the flanks).<br><br>-- South Obsidian Eruptive Episode: An estimated 12,000 calendar yrs ago, an obsidian dome and related obsidian flow erupted in the southeast part of the caldera.<br><br>-- East Rim Eruptive Episode: About 11,200 calendar yrs ago (10,000 C14 yrs B.P.), mafic cinders, scoria, spatter, and lava flows erupted from a fissure on the east rim of the caldera.<br><br>-- Interlake Eruptive Episode: A series of rhyolitic eruptions began in the caldera approximately 7,300 calendar yrs ago (6,200 C14 yrs B.P.).

This eruptive episode probably lasted for about 200 years.<br><br>-- Northwest Rift Eruptive Episode: About 7,000 calendar yrs ago (6,100 C14 yrs B.P.), basaltic andesite lava and cinder cones erupted from extensive fissure vents on the northwest and south flanks of Newberry. Spatter and cinders also erupted from a fissure on the north caldera wall. The lava flows range up to 9 km long and are more voluminous at lower elevations. This eruptive episode probably lasted for less than 50 years.<br><br>-- East Lake Eruptive Episode: About 3,500 yrs ago, obsidian flows and associated pumice deposits in the caldera erupted from caldera ring fractures.<br><br>-- Big Obsidian Eruptive Episode: About 480 A.D. (1,470 calendar years B.P.), a 3-part sequence of rhyolitic eruptions began, which included an air-fall tephra, ash-flow tephra, and an obsidian flow, from a common vent at the base of the south caldera wall. The initial Plinian eruption 480 A.D. (1,580 C14 yrs B.P.) produced the Newberry pumice fall deposit which blanketed the east flank of the volcano and areas to the east. About 210 yrs later the Paulina Lake ash flow (1,310 C14 yrs B.P.) spread from near the south caldera wall to Paulina Lake.
