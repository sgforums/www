The total height of Gerbrandy Tower was originally 382.5 metres. It was reduced in 1987 to 375 metres. Towers of the type of Gerbrandy tower do not fit well in existing classification hierarchies of free standing tower antennas or guyed masts since it incorporates elements from both. If the structure is counted as a tower, it is the tallest tower in Western Europe. The Gerbrandy Tower is not the only tower which consists of a concrete tower on which a guyed mast is set. There are at least two similar, but smaller towers of the same pattern. One is the radio tower of Smilde (Netherlands), which consists of a 80 metre high concrete tower, on which a 223.5 metre high guyed mast is mounted. The other is the TV Tower Waldenburg (Germany), with a total height of 145 metres.<br><br>During Christmas time lamps are put on the guys and make the tower the biggest Christmas tree in the world. There were plans to limit these decorations to once every 5 years, but sponsoring has allowed the seasonal lighting to be put up every year so far.<br><br>The tower is named after Pieter Gerbrandy, prime minister of the Netherlands during World War Two.<br><br>Issue #165</div>

It was during this time that Livingstone made the one convert that he ever made in Africa, who then renounced Christianity within six months.

In particular, Livingstone was a proponent of trade and missions to be established in central Africa.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/David_Livingstone_memorial_at_Victoria_Falls%2C_Zimbabwe.jpg/450px-David_Livingstone_memorial_at_Victoria_Falls%2C_Zimbabwe.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/David_Livingstone_memorial_at_Victoria_Falls%2C_Zimbabwe.jpg/180px-David_Livingstone_memorial_at_Victoria_Falls%2C_Zimbabwe.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">David Livingstone memorial at Victoria Falls</span><br><br>At this time he believed the key to achieving these goals was the navigation of the Zambesi River. He returned to England to try to garner support for his ideas, and to publish a book on his travels. At this time he resigned from the missionary society to which he had belonged.<br><br><strong>Zambesi Expedition</strong><br><br>Livingstone returned to Africa as head of the Zambesi Expedition. While Livingstone was exploring the Zambesi river, the missions sent to central and east Africa at his urgings ended in disaster, with nearly every missionary dying of malaria or other ailments. The Zambesi river turned out to be completely unnavigable past the Kabrabasa rapids, a series of cataracts and rapids that Livingstone had failed to explore on his earlier travels.<br><br>The other Westerners, including Livingstone's brother Charles (the one exception being George Rae, an engineer) either died, resigned, or were fired by Livingstone. His wife Mary died on April 29, 1863 of dysentery, but Livingstone continued to explore, eventually returning home in 1864. The Zambesi Expedition was castigated as a failure in many British newspapers of the time, and Livingstone experienced great difficulty in raising funds to further explore Africa.<br><br><strong>Source of the Nile</strong><br><br>In March 1866, Livingstone returned to Africa, this time to Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania), where he set out to seek the source of the Nile. Richard Francis Burton, John Hanning Speke, and Samuel Baker had earlier (and correctly) identified either Lake Albert or Lake Victoria as the source, but the matter was still debated vigorously. Finding the Lualaba River, which feeds the Congo River, Livingstone decided that this river was in fact the "real" Nile.<br><br><strong>Illness and death</strong><br><br>He was taken ill, and completely lost contact with the outside world for six years. Only one of his 44 later dispatches made it to Zanzibar. Stanley, who had been sent in a publicity stunt to find him by the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Herald</span> newspaper in 1869 found Livingstone in the town of Ujiji, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in 1871. Stanley joined Livingstone, and together they continued exploring the north end of the Tanganyika (the other constituent of the present Tanzania), until Stanley left the next year.<br><br>Despite Stanley's urgings, Livingstone was determined not to leave Africa until his mission was complete, and he died there, in Zambia, in 1873 from malaria and internal bleeding caused by bowel obstruction. His body, carried over a thousand miles by his loyal attendants Chuma and Susi, was returned to Britain for burial in Westminster Abbey.<br><br>Issue #172</div>

This huge impact crater, with its distinctive outline, was created about 1800 m.y. ago. Some scientists argue that it was at least 245 km (152 mi) across when it was circular. The strong northwestward thrusting of the Grenville Province terrane against the Superior Province (containing Sudbury) subsequently deformed it, more than 900 m.y. later, into its present elliptical shape (geologists will recognize this as a prime example of the "strain ellipsoid"<strong></strong>) model. After Sudbury was initially excavated, magmas from deep in the crust invaded the breccia filling, to emplace against its walls.

Originally called <span style="font-style: italic;">Ozakajo</span>, it is one of Japan's most famous castles, and played a major role in the unification of Japan during the sixteenth century.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/OsakaCastle1.jpg/497px-OsakaCastle1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/OsakaCastle1.jpg/180px-OsakaCastle1.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Osaka Castle</strong></span><br><br>The castle is situated on a plot of land roughly one kilometer square. It is built on two raised platforms of landfill supported by sheer walls of cut rock, each overlooking a moat. The central castle building is five stories on the outside and eight stories on the inside, and built atop a tall stone foundation to protect its occupants from sword-bearing attackers.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>* 1583: Toyotomi Hideyoshi commenced construction on the site of the Ikko-ikki temple of Ishiyama Honganji. The basic plan was modeled after Azuchi Castle, the headquarters of Oda Nobunaga. Toyotomi wanted to build a castle that mirrored Oda's, but surpassed it in every way: the plan featured a five-story main tower, with three extra stories underground, and gold leaf on the sides of the tower to impress visitors.<br><br>* 1585: Inner donjon completed. Toyotomi continued to extend and expand the castle, making it more and more formidable to attackers.<br><br>* 1598: Construction completed. Hideyoshi died. Osaka Castle passed to his son, Toyotomi Hideyori.<br><br>* 1603: Tokugawa Ieyasu defeated Hideyori's armies at the Battle of Sekigahara, and started his own bakufu in Edo.<br><br>* 1614: Tokugawa attacked Hideyori in the winter. Although the Toyotomi forces were outnumbered 2 to 1, they managed to fight off Tokugawa's 200,000-man army and protect the castle's outer walls. However, Tokugawa attempted to muzzle Toyotomi by filling up the castle's outer moat, rendering it largely defenseless.<br><br>* 1615: During the summer, Hideyori began to dig the outer moat once more. Tokugawa, in outrage, sent his armies to Osaka Castle again, and routed the Toyotomi men inside the outer walls on June 4. Osakajo fell to Tokugawa, and the Toyotomi clan perished.<br><br>* 1620: The new heir to the shogunate, Tokugawa Hidetada, began to reconstruct and rearm Osaka Castle. He built a new elevated main tower, five stories on the outside and eight stories on the inside, and assigned the task of constructing new walls to individual samurai clans. The walls built in the 1620's still stand today, and are made out of interlocked granite boulders with no mortar whatsoever: they are held together solely by each other. Many of the stones were brought from rock quarries in the Seto Inland Sea, and bear inscribed crests of the various families who laid them into the walls.<br><br>* 1665: Lightning strikes burned down the main tower.<br><br>* 1843: After decades of neglect, the castle got much-needed repairs when the bakufu collected money from the people of the region to rebuild several of the turrets.<br><br>* 1868: Much of the castle was burned in the civil conflicts surrounding the Meiji Restoration. Under the Meiji government, Osaka Castle was converted to a barracks for Japan's rapidly-expanding Western-style military.<br><br>* 1928: The main tower was restored after the mayor of Osaka concluded a highly successful fund-raising drive.<br><br>* 1945: Bombing raids on Osaka damaged the reconstructed main tower.<br><br>* 1995: Osaka's government approved yet another restoration project, with the intent of restoring the main tower to its Edo-era splendor.<br><br>* 1997: Restoration was completed.<br><br><strong>Today</strong><br><br>The castle is open to the public, and is easily accessible from Osakajo Koen Station on the JR Osaka Loop Line. It is a popular spot during festival seasons, and especially during the cherry blossom bloom, when the sprawling castle grounds are covered with food vendors and taiko drummers.<br><br>The grounds also house a museum, convention hall, and the Toyokuni Shrine dedicated to Toyotomi Hideyoshi.<br><br>Issue #176</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Permafrost</strong></span><br><br>In geology, <strong>permafrost</strong> or <span style="font-style: italic;">permafrost soil</span> is soil that stays in a frozen state for more than two years in a row.<br><br>The extent of permafrost can vary as the climate changes. Today, approximately 20% of the Earth's land mass is covered by permafrost (including discontinuous permafrost) or glacial ice. Seasonal frost commonly overlays permafrost and is called the <span style="font-style: italic;">active layer</span> as it will thaw during the summer. Plant life can be supported only within the active layer because growth can occur only in soil that is fully thawed for some part of the year. Thickness of the active layer varies by year and location but is typically 0.6 - 4 m (2 to 12 feet) thick. The depth of the permafrost can in areas of continuous permafrost and harsh winters be very great (440 m (1,330 feet) at Barrow, Alaska and as much as 1,493 m (4,510 feet) in the northern Lena and Yana River basins).<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Permafrost_-_ice_wedge.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Permafrost_-_ice_wedge.jpg/250px-Permafrost_-_ice_wedge.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">An ice wedge in <strong>permafrost</strong>.</span><br><br><strong>Continuous and discontinuous permafrost</strong><br><br>Permafrost will form in any climate where the mean annual air temperature is less than the freezing point of water - unless there is sufficient snowfall to form glaciers or ice sheets. Typically the temperature of the ground will be on average less variable from season to season than the air temperature, and temperatures also tend to increase with depth. Thus, if the mean annual air temperature is only slightly below 0Â°C (32Â°F), permafrost will form only in spots that are sheltered - usually with a northerly aspect. This creates what is known as <span style="font-style: italic;">discontinuous</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">permafrost</span>. Usually, permafrost will remain discontinuous in a climate where the mean annual temperature is between -5 and 0Â°C (23 to 32Â°F). There are exceptions in <span style="font-style: italic;">unglaciated</span> Siberia and Alaska where the present depth of permafrost is a relic of climatic conditions during glacial ages where winters were up to 11Â°C (20Â°F) colder than those of today. At mean annual temperatures below -5Â°C (23Â°F) the influence of aspect can never be sufficient to thaw permafrost and a zone of <span style="font-style: italic;">continuous permafrost</span> forms.<br><br>A <span style="font-style: italic;">line of continuous permafrost</span> in the Northern Hemisphere is formed from the furthest-northward points at which permafrost sometimes melts or is interrupted by regions without permafrost; north of this line all land is covered by permafrost or glacial ice. The "line" of continuous permafrost lies further north at some longitudes than others and can gradually move northward or southward due to regional climactic changes. In the southern hemisphere, most of the equivalent line would fall within the Southern Ocean if there were land there; most if not all of the Antarctic continent is covered not with frozen soil but with glacial ice.<br><br><strong>Construction on permafrost</strong><br><br>Building on permafrost is difficult due to the heat of the building (or pipeline) melting the permafrost and sinking downwards. This sinking problem has three common solutions: using foundations on wood piles, building on a thick gravel pad (usually 1 to 2 m (4 to 6 feet) thick), or using anhydrous ammonia heat pipes. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System uses insulated heat pipes to keep the pipeline from sinking into the permafrost.<br><br>At the <span style="font-style: italic;">Permafrost Research Institute</span> in Yakutsk, it has been found that sinking of large buildings into the frozen earth (known to the Yakuts before Yakutsk was even founded) can be prevented effectively by means of stilts extended down to a depth of about fifteen metres or more. At this depth the temperature does not change with the seasons but remains at about -5Â°C.<br><br><strong>Permafrost extent</strong><br><br>Measurement of the depth and extent of permafrost may be an indicator of global warming as recent years (1998 and 2001) have seen record thawing of permafrost in Alaska and Siberia. In the Yukon, the zone of continuous permafrost has moved 100 kilometres poleward since 1899. However accurate records only go back 30 years. It is thought that the thawing of permafrost could exacerbate global warming through the release of methane and other hydrocarbons which are powerful greenhouse gases. It also could encourage erosion because permafrost lends considerable stability to the barren slopes in the Arctic.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Permafrost_-_polygon.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Permafrost_-_polygon.jpg/250px-Permafrost_-_polygon.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Polygons on the ground.</span><br><br>At the Last Glacial Maximum, continuous permafrost covered a much greater area than it does today, covering all of ice-free Europe south to about Szeged and the Sea of Azov (then dry land) and China south to Beijing. In North America, only an extremely narrow belt of permafrost existed south of the ice sheet at about the latitude of New Jersey through southern Iowa and northern Missouri. In the southern hemisphere, there is some evidence for former permafrost from this period in central Otago and Argentine Patagonia, but it was probably discontinuous except at the very highest latitudes.<br><br>Issue #178</div>

The ground was broken in December 2003, and construction started in March 2004, but was halted by the high construction cost in August 2004.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/Beijing_National_Stadium_1.jpg/800px-Beijing_National_Stadium_1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/Beijing_National_Stadium_1.jpg/300px-Beijing_National_Stadium_1.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Beijing National Stadium</strong>, the main stadium to the Olympics 2008 in Bejing, China.</span><br><br>In the new design, the roof of the stadium had been omitted from the design. Experts say that this will make the stadium safer, whilst reducing construction costs. The construction of the Olympic buildings will continue once again in the beginning of 2005.<br><br><strong>In depth</strong><br><br>The stadium's appearance is one of synergy, with no distinction made between the facade and the superstructure. The structural elements mutually support each other and converge into a grid-like formation - almost like a bird's nest with its interwoven twigs. The spatial effect of the stadium is novel and radical, yet simple and of an almost archaic immediacy, thus creating a unique historical landmark for the Olympics of 2008.<br><br>The stadium was conceived as a large collective vessel, which makes a distinctive and unmistakable impression both from a distance and when seen from up close. It meets all the functional and technical requirements of an Olympic National Stadium, but without communicating the insistent sameness of technocratic architecture dominated by large spans and digital screens.<br><br>Visitors walk through this formation and enter the spacious ambulatory that runs full circle around the stands. From there, one can survey the circulation of the entire area including the stairs that access the three tiers of the stands. Functioning like an arcade or a concourse, the lobby is a covered urban space with restaurants and stores that invite visitors to stroll around. Just as birds stuff the spaces between the woven twigs of their nests with a soft filler, the spaces in the structure of the stadium will be filled with inflated ETFE cushions. On the roof, the cushions will be mounted on the outside of the structure to make the roof completely weatherproof.<br><br>Whilst the rain is collected for rainwater recuperation, the sunlight filters through the translucent roof providing the lawn with essential ultraviolet radiation. On the facade, the inflated cushions will be mounted on the inside of the structure where necessary, e.g. to provide wind protection. Since all of the facilities - restaurants, suites, shops and restrooms - are all self-contained units, it is possible to do largely without a solid, enclosed facade. This allows natural ventilation of the stadium, which is the most important aspect of the stadium's sustainable design.<br><br>The sliding roof is an integral part of the stadium structure. When it is closed, it converts the stadium into a covered arena. Just as a tin is only complete with a lid, the roof, whether closed or open, is an elementary part of the whole. With its own structural logic, it is also a grid-like formation that forms a waterproof shell together with the inflated cushions.<br><br>Issue #179</div>

The updraft is the large cloud mass at the center of the photo. The anvil is the flat layer at the top. The downdraft is the rainy area to the right.</span><br><br><strong>Formation</strong><br><br>To create a cumulonimbus cloud, you need three ingredients.<br><br>1. Plenty of moisture.<br>2. A mass of warm unstable air.<br>3. A source of energy to lift the warm, moist air mass rapidly upward.<br><br>Typically, the clouds form around front lines, near oceans where sea breezes provide the storm energy, or over mountains which push the air upwards.<br><br>When the warm air rises above the typically cooler air above it, it starts to cool and the water vapor condenses into water droplets. This adds more energy to the cloud, which soon becomes self-sustaining. As the air mass continues to rise, the water droplets continue to cool and form ice crystals. Gravity causes these droplets and crystals to start to fall, causing a downward movement to compete with the upward lift.<br><br>Instability between the updrafts and downdrafts causes static electrical charges to build up in the cumulonimbus cloud. The discharge of this electricity causes thunder and lightning.<br><br>During the spring and summer, cumulonimbus clouds are more likely to form in the afternoon, due to the heating of the earth's surface. However, they can also form along a cold front when the warm buoyant air is forced upward by the heavier cold air mass that cuts under the warmer air like a wedge. This can happen at any time of the year, as demonstrated by thunderstorms that happen in conjunction with snowstorms in the winter.<br><br><strong>Appearance</strong><br><br>The base of a cumulonimbus can be several miles across, and it can be tall enough to occupy middle as well as low altitudes: though formed at an altitude of about 3,000 to 4,000 metres (10,000 to 12,000 feet), its peak can reach up to 23,000 metres (75,000 feet) in extreme cases. Typically, it peaks at a much lower height. Cumulonimbus are also characterized by a flat, anvil-like top (the <span style="font-style: italic;">anvil dome</span>), caused by straight line winds at the higher altitudes which shear off the top of the cloud. This anvil shape can precede the main cloud structure for many miles, causing anvil lightning.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/AnvilCumNim.png/800px-AnvilCumNim.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/AnvilCumNim.png/250px-AnvilCumNim.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ideal anvil shaped cumulonimbus</span><br><br><strong>Effects</strong><br><br>Cumulonimbus storm cells can produce heavy rain (particularly of a convective nature) and flash flooding, as well as straight-line winds. Most storm cells die after about 20 minutes, when the precipitation causes more downdraft than updraft, causing the energy to dissipate. If there is enough solar energy in the atmosphere, however (on a hot summer's day, for example), the moisture from one storm cell can evaporate rapidly -- resulting in a new cell forming just a few miles from the former one. This can cause thunderstorms to last for several hours.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Cumulonimbus_NOAA_gov.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Cumulonimbus_NOAA_gov.jpg/200px-Cumulonimbus_NOAA_gov.jpg"></a><br><br>Cumulonimbus clouds contain severe convection currents, with very high, unpredictable winds, particularly in the vertical plane (updrafts and downdrafts). They are therefore extremely dangerous to aircraft. Smaller propeller-driven planes cannot cope with the conditions and must fly around them; larger jet aircraft fly over the smaller ones and around larger examples. Larger planes are also equipped with weather radar and wind shear detectors to help guide them through, in the event that they need to pass through such clouds to land.<br><br>The air convection can also form mesocyclones, which can cause hail and tornadoes.<br><br>Issue #181</div>

Later he made extensive travels to among others Egypt and Ethiopia. It is not known when he wrote his <span style="font-style: italic;">Geographika</span> though remarks in it place the finished version in the reign of Emperor Tiberius; some place its first drafts around 7 AD, others around 18 AD.

Yet while it does cover the entire world known to the Greeks and Romans of his time, it suffers from several major flaws: a constant and very intrusive defense of the poet Homer as a geographical source, leading him to dismiss more recent writers, such as Herodotus, who were often eyewitnesses to what they reported; a preoccupation with minute, often captiously argumentative, criticism of these other writers; a peculiarly Greek aprioristic attitude to facts, seeking to derive them from the pure exercise of reason: in sum, one would prefer more geography and less argumentation. These byways, however, do provide modern scholars with valuable historical information on the methods of ancient geography and on many older geographers whose works have not come down to us.<br><br>Some thirty manuscripts of <span style="font-style: italic;">Geographika</span> or parts of it have survived, almost all of them medieval copies of copies, though there are fragments from papyrus rolls which were probably copied out ca AD 100-300.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Altun Ha</strong></span><br><br><strong>Altun Ha</strong> is the name given to ruins of an ancient Maya city in Belize, located in the Belize District about 30 miles (50 km) north of Belize City and about 6 miles (10 km) west of the shore of the Caribbean Sea.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/AltunHaMasonAltars.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A portion of the ruins of <strong>Altun Ha</strong>, Belize, with the Temple of the Masonry Altars visible in the background across a plaza. </span><br><br>"Altun Ha" is a modern name in the Maya language, coined by translating the name of the nearby village of Rockstone Pond. The ancient name is at present unknown.<br><br>The largest of Altun Ha's temple-pyramids, the "Temple of the Masonry Altars", is 54 feet (16 m) high. A drawing of this structure is the logo of Belize's leading brand of beer, "Belikin".<br><br>The site covers an area of about 5 miles (8 km) square. The central square mile of the site has remains of some 500 structures.<br><br>Archeological investigations show that Altun Ha was occupied by 200 BC. The bulk of construction was from the Maya Classic era, c. 200 to 900 AD, when the site may have had a population of about 10,000 people. About 900 there was some looting of elite tombs of the site, which some think is suggestive of a revolt against the site's rulers. The site remained populated for about another century after that, but with no new major ceremonial or elite architecture built during that time. After this the population dwindled, with a moderate surge of reoccupation in the 12th century before declining again to a small agricultural village.<br><br>The ruins of the ancient structures had their stones reused for residential construction of the agricultural village of Rockstone Pond in modern times, but the ancient site did not come to the attention of archeologists until 1963, when the existence of a sizable ancient site was recognized from the air by pilot and amateur Mayanist Hal Ball.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/AltunHaMasks.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ruins of Altun Ha, Belize, showing architectural grotesque masks, detail on temple pyramid.</span><br><br>Starting in 1965 an archeological team lead by Dr. David Pendergast of the Royal Ontario Museum began extensive excavations and restorations of the site, which continued through 1970. One of the most spectacular discoveries is a large (almost 10 pounds or 5 kilograms) piece of jade elaborately carved into an image of the head of the Maya Sun God, <span style="font-style: italic;">Kinich Ahau</span>. This jade head is considered one of the national treasures of Belize.<br><br>A road connects Altun Ha to Belize's Northern Highway, and the site is accessible for tourism.<br><br>Issue #188</div>

(The term <span style="font-style: italic;">sluice gate</span> refers to any gate that operates by allowing water to flow under it.) When a sluice gate is fully lowered, water sometimes spills over the top, in which case the gate operates as a weir.<br><br>Usually a mechanism drives the sluice gate up or down. This may be a simple, hand-operated, worm drive or rack and pinion drive, or it may be electrically or hydraulically powered.<br><br>The gates of a lock may work in a way similar to the way a sluice gate works, but traditional canal lock gates are hinged to swing like double doors.<br><br><strong>Flow calculation</strong><br><br>The sluice flow rate formula is:<br><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/math/257bba8976f1ae80ca6199243127a990.png"><br><br>where:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Q</span> is the flow<br><span style="font-style: italic;">A</span> is the area of the sluice<br><span style="font-style: italic;">g</span> is the acceleration due to gravity on the Earth's surface (approx. 9.81 m/sÂ²)<br><span style="font-style: italic;">h</span> is the head across sluice<br><span style="font-style: italic;">C</span> is the discharge coefficient (typically 0.61 for small depth ratios)<br><br><strong>Types of sluice gates</strong><br><br>- <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Flap</span></strong> sluice gate - a fully automatic type, which is controlled by the pressure head across it.
