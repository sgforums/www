The name comes from the Greek, used by Theophrastus, and was probably applied to several distinct substances. Other sources say the word comes from the Persian <span style="font-style: italic;">zinjifrah</span>, originally meaning "lost".<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/CinnabarUSGOV.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/CinnabarUSGOV.jpg/220px-CinnabarUSGOV.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Cinnabar</strong></span><br><br>Cinnabar was mined by the Roman Empire for its mercury content and it has been the main ore of mercury throughout the centuries. Some mines used by the Romans are still being mined today. It is generally found as a vein-filling mineral associated with recent volcanic activity and alkaline hot springs.<br><br>Cinnabar is generally found in a massive, granular or earthy form, and is bright scarlet to brick red in color. However, it occasionally occurs in crystals with a metallic adamantine luster. The crystals belong to the rhombohedral (trigonal) system, and are generally of rhombohedral habit, sometimes twinned. The twinning in cinnabar is distinctive and forms a penetration twin that is ridged with six ridges surrounding the point of a pryamid. It could be thought of as two scalahedral crystals grown together with one crystal going the opposite way of the other crystal.<br><br>Cinnabar presents remarkable resemblance to quartz in its symmetry and optical characteristics. Like quartz, it exhibits circular polarization, and Alfred Des Cloizeaux showed that it possessed fifteen times the optical rotatory power of quartz. It has higher refractive power than any other known mineral, its mean index for sodium light being 3.02, while the index for diamondÂ—a substance of remarkable refractionÂ—is only 2.42.

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has named these the <span style="font-style: italic;">Heisei 16 Niigata Prefecture Chuetsu Earthquakes</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mid Niigata Prefecture Earthquake of 2004</span>.<br><br><strong>Damage</strong><br><br>The earthquakes have caused extensive damage. As late as November 3, the 39th fatality attributable to the earthquakes occurred as perceptible aftershocks continued. Over 3,000 injuries have been reported in Niigata Prefecture. Over one hundred thousand people fled their homes. The earthquakes caused houses to collapse in Ojiya and damaged thousands in the area.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/Chuetsuearthquake_in_Ojiya.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Chuetsuearthquake_in_Ojiya.jpg/180px-Chuetsuearthquake_in_Ojiya.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Broken asphalt road caused by the <strong>2004 Chuetsu Earthquake</strong> at Ojiya, Niigata, Japan.</span><br><br>For the first time in its history, a Shinkansen train derailed while in service. Eight out of ten cars of the Toki 325 (a 200 Series Shinkansen) derailed on the Joetsu Shinkansen line between Nagaoka Station in Nagaoka and Urasa Station in Yamato; no injuries were reported among the 155 passengers. Railbeds, bridges and tunnels were all affected. East Japan Railway Company stopped all trains in Niigata Prefecture, including the extensively damaged Joetsu Line, Shinetsu Main Line, Iiyama Line, Tadami Line and Echigo Line. Part of Nagaoka Station appeared ready to collapse as a result of an aftershock, but after a brief closure, the station has reopened.<br><br>The segment of the Joetsu Shinkansen between Echigo Yuzawa Station and Nagaoka Station closed.

On December 28, 2004, the Joetsu Shinkansen, also reopened, the last to do so.<br><br>Japan Highways closed all expressways in Niigata Prefecture. Closures affected the Kanetsu Expressway and the Hokuriku Expressway. As of November 4, the Kanetsu Expressway remained closed between Nagaoka Interchange and Koide Interchange. This segment reopened on November 5.<br><br>Landslides and other problems forced closure of two national highways, Route 8 and Route 17, as well as several prefectural roads. This isolated several localities, including nearly the entire village of Yamakoshi, which was then a village in the district of Koshi but since merged with and became part of the city of Nagaoka. On July 22, 2005, the government lifted the nine-month-old evacuation order for 528 of the 690 affected households.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Chuetsu_earthquake-takidashi.jpg/800px-Chuetsu_earthquake-takidashi.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Chuetsu_earthquake-takidashi.jpg/180px-Chuetsu_earthquake-takidashi.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Distribution of cooked soup in front of Ojiya City gymnasium, which became a shelter after the 2004 Chuetsu Earthquake in Niigata, Japan.</span><br><br>The earthquakes also caused a landslide that partially buried three vehicles. A young boy was rescued from one of these vehicles, but his mother and sister perished. (Recent typhoons had waterlogged the soil, making landslides more likely.)<br><br>The quake broke water mains. Extensive electric power, telephone (including cellular telephone) and Internet outages were reported. The cellular telephone system suffered from direct damage to relay stations, as well as depletion of battery back-up power supplies in as little as a day.<br><br><strong>Earthquake details</strong><br><br>The first quake struck the Chuetsu area of Niigata Prefecture, Japan with a reading of 7 on the Japanese shindo scale at Kawaguchi, Niigata. On the Richter scale, the moment magnitude of the earthquake is estimated at 6.9. (For comparison, the Great Hanshin earthquake, which devastated much of Kobe, measured 7 on the shindo scale, with a magnitude of 7.2.) The earthquake occurred at a depth of 15.8  km. The JMA gave the coordinates of the earthquake as 37.3Â° N 138.8Â° W.<br><br>A second earthquake occurred at 6:12 p.m. (16 minutes after the first). This one, at a much shallower depth, also caused a shindo of 6+ and had a magnitude of 5.9. A third, at 6:34, had a shindo of 6-;. At 7:46, another shindo 6-; earthquake occurred. Intervening and subsequent earthquakes of lesser intensity also shook the region. During the first 66 hours, 15 earthquakes with intensities of shindo 5-; or higher rocked the Chuetsu region.<br><br>In a press release, the Geographical Survey Institute (GSI) of the Government of Japan published preliminary estimates that a fault having a length of 22 km and a width of 17 km moved approximately 1.4 m.<br><br>This was the deadliest earthquake to strike Japan since January 1995's Great Hanshin earthquake.<br><br><strong>Background</strong><br><br>The shindo scale is a scale of intensity, like the Mercalli Intensity Scale. It provides information related to the severity of shaking at the earth's surface, where it affects structures. In contrast, the magnitude of the earthquake describes the energy released by the quake.<br><br>Niigata Prefecture is located in the Hokuriku region of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. The initial earthquake caused noticeable shaking across almost half of Honshu, including parts of the Tohoku, Hokuriku, Chubu, and Kanto regions.<br><br>Issue #231</div>

It is nicknamed "<span style="font-style: italic;">der lange Lulatsch</span>" ("the lanky lad"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) and is one of the best-known points of interest in the city of Berlin. It stands in the Berlin fairground in the Charlottenburg Wilmersdorf district. On September 3, 1926 the radio tower was inaugurated on the occasion of the 3. <span style="font-style: italic;">GroÃŸen Deutschen Funkausstellung</span> (third Great German radio exhibition). The tower is now a protected monument.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/2004-01-02_Funkturm_Berlin.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/2004-01-02_Funkturm_Berlin.jpg/180px-2004-01-02_Funkturm_Berlin.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The <strong>Funkturm Berlin</strong></span><br><br><strong>Building method</strong><br><br>The tower is built as one large steel framework construction, similar to the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The 150 m high and approximately 600 metric ton radio tower was originally planned strictly as a transmitting tower, but later additions included a restaurant at a height of approximately 52 m, and observation deck at a height of approximately 125 m. Visitors reach the restaurant and the observation deck by an elevator which travels up to 4 meters per second.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Berlin_-_Funkturm_at_night_-_blue_illuminated.jpg/450px-Berlin_-_Funkturm_at_night_-_blue_illuminated.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Berlin_-_Funkturm_at_night_-_blue_illuminated.jpg/180px-Berlin_-_Funkturm_at_night_-_blue_illuminated.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Funkturm - blue illuminated on the occasion of the Funkausstellung 2005</span><br><br>The radio tower has two very notable structural characteristics. First, it sits on a square surface area merely 20 meters to a side. Its ratio of surface area to height is 1:6.9. For comparison, the Eiffel Tower sits on a square 129 meters to a side, giving surface-area-to-height ratio of 1:2.3. Second, the radio tower is probably the only observation tower of the world standing on porcelain insulators. It was designed as the support tower for a T-antenna for medium wave, and the insulators were intended to prevent the drain of the transmitting power down through the tower itself. However, this was impractical, because visitors would have been vulnerable to massive electric shocks, so the tower was later grounded via its elevator shaft. The insulators used were manufactured in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Koeniglich Preussische Porzellanmanufaktur</span> (Royal Prussian Porcelain Factory).<br><br>On March 22, 1935, the first regular television program in the world was broadcast from an aerial on the top of the tower. Since 1962, the tower is no longer used for TV transmissions. Since 1973, the radio tower no longer serves as a regular transmission tower for broadcasting purposes, but it is still used as relay station for amateur radio, police radio, and mobile phone services. The last complete renovation took place in the year 1987 in honor of the 750th anniversary of the founding of Berlin.<br><br>Issue #232</div>

By definition of the International Hydrographic Bureau, the Great Australian Bight extends eastward from West Cape Howe, Western Australia, to South West Cape, Tasmania. The more generally accepted boundaries are from Cape Pasley, Western Australia, to Cape Carnot, South Australia - a distance of 1,160 km or 720 miles. Much of the Bight lies due south of the expansive Nullarbor Plain, which straddles the two Australian states of South Australia and Western Australia.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Australia.A2002231.0145.250m_NASA_Nullarbor.jpg/792px-Australia.A2002231.0145.250m_NASA_Nullarbor.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Australia.A2002231.0145.250m_NASA_Nullarbor.jpg/250px-Australia.A2002231.0145.250m_NASA_Nullarbor.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The <strong>Great Australian Bight</strong> south of the Nullarbor.

The coast was later first accurately charted by the English explorer Captain Matthew Flinders in 1802, during his circumnavigation of the Australian continent. A later land-based survey was accomplished by Edward John Eyre.<br><br>The coast line of the Great Australian Bight is characterised by stunning cliff faces (up to 60 m high), surfing beaches and rock platforms, ideal for whale-watching. The waters of the Great Australian Bight, despite being relatively shallow, are not fertile. While most continental shelves are rich in sea life and make popular fishing areas, the barren deserts north of the bight have very little rainfall, and what there is mostly flows inland, to dissipate underground or in salt lakes. In consequence, the Great Australian Bight receives very little of the runoff that fertilises most continental shelves and is essentially a marine desert. It is probably best noted for the large number of sharks that frequent its coastal waters, as well as the increasing numbers of southern right whales that migrate within the region.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Great_Australian_Bight_Marine_Park.jpg/800px-Great_Australian_Bight_Marine_Park.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Great_Australian_Bight_Marine_Park.jpg/180px-Great_Australian_Bight_Marine_Park.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Great Australian Bight</span><br><br>The bight is very stormy during winter months.<br><br>Economically, the Bight has been exploited over many years as part of the fishing, whaling and shellfish industries.

It is one of the Aeolian Islands, a volcanic archipelago north of Sicily. This name is a corruption of the ancient Greek name <span style="font-style: italic;">StrongulÃ¦</span> which was given to it because of its round swelling form.<br><br>Stromboli stands approximately 900 m high above sea level, but in total rises over 2,000 m from the ocean floor. There are three active craters at the peak. A significant geological feature of the volcano is the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciara del Fuoco</span> ("Stream of fire"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>), a broad channel on the north western side of the cone, generated by a giant flank collapse about 6,000 years ago.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/DenglerSW-Stromboli-20040928-1230x800.jpg/800px-DenglerSW-Stromboli-20040928-1230x800.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/DenglerSW-Stromboli-20040928-1230x800.jpg/300px-DenglerSW-Stromboli-20040928-1230x800.jpg"></a><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Stromboli</span></strong><br><br>Elevation: 926 metres (3,038 feet)<br>Coordinates: 38.789Â° N 15.213Â° E<br>Location: Aeolian Islands (Italy)<br>Type: Stratovolcano<br>Last eruption: 2005 (continuing)<br><br>Stromboli is remarkable because of the length of time for which it has been in almost continuous eruption. For at least the last 2,000 years, the same pattern of eruption has been maintained, in which explosions occur at the summit craters at intervals of minutes to hours. This type of very mild explosive eruption is known as Strombolian activity when observed at other volcanoes. Eruptions from the summit craters typically result in lava rolling down this channel. Stromboli's activity is almost exclusively explosive, but lava flows do occasionally occur - an effusive eruption in 2002 was its first in 17 years.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/31/Sciara_del_fuoco.jpg/789px-Sciara_del_fuoco.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/31/Sciara_del_fuoco.jpg/200px-Sciara_del_fuoco.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sciara del fuoco</span><br><br>The continuous mild explosive eruptions are also occasionally punctuated by much larger eruptions. The largest eruption of the last hundred years occurred in 1930, and resulted in the deaths of several people and the destruction of a number of houses by flying volcanic bombs. Large eruptions occur at intervals of years to decades, and the most recent large eruption began in 2002, causing the closure of the island to non-residents for several months. The eruption started with a lava flow (29 Dec 2002) along the "Sciara del Fuoco" flank that rapidly reached the sea. On 30 Dec 2002 a huge volume of rocks collapsed from the "Sciara del Fuoco" generating at least two landslides and many tsunami waves. The highest wave was 10 m high and caused serious damages at the Stromboli village. On April 5, 2003 a strong explosion from the summit crater ejected rocks that reached the Ginostra village, damaging some houses. The eruption terminated on July 2003.<br><br><strong>Historic account of the crater</strong><br><br>Several enterprising travellers have ascended to the crater of Stromboli. It was examined with great care in 1828 by M. Hoffmann, a Prussian geologist, who, while being held fast by his companions, leaned over the crag immediately above the crater, and looked right down into one of its active mouths. His description of what he saw follows.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Three active mouths were seen at the bottom of the crater. The principal one, in the middle, was about two hundred feet in diameter; it shows nothing remarkable, only fuming slightly; and numerous yellow incrustations of sulphur coat the walls of its chimney. Close by this mouth is another, somewhat nearer the precipice, only twenty feet wide, in which I could observe the play of the column of liquid lava, which at intervals poised itself at a level. This lava did not look like a burning mass vomiting flames, but as glossy as molten metal -- like iron issuing from the smelting furnace, or silver at the bottom of a crucible.<br><br>This melted mass rose and fell -- evidently urged by the powerful tension of elastic vapours pressing it upwards from beneath; and it was easy to perceive the balance of effect between the weight of the molten masses and the pressure of the steam which resisted them. The surface rose and fell rhythmically: there was heard a peculiar sound, like the crackling of air from bellows entering the door of a furnace. A bubble of white vapour issued at each crack, raising the lava, which fell down again immediately after its escape. These bubbles of vapour dragged to the surface of the lava red-hot cinders, which danced as if tossed by invisible hands in rhythmic sport above the brink of the opening.<br><br>This play, so regular and attractive, was interrupted, every quarter of an hour or so, by more tumultuous movements. The mass of whirling vapour then rested motionless for a moment -- even making a jerking motion of return, as if inhaled by the crater, from the bottom of which the lava rose more strongly as if to encounter it. Then the ground trembles, and the walls of the crater starting bend. It was quite an earthquake. The mouth of the crater uttered a loud rolling bellow, which was followed by an immense bubble of vapour, bursting at the surface of the lava with a loud thundering report. The whole surface of the lava, reduced to glowing splinters, was then tossed into the air.<br><br>The heat struck our faces forcibly; while a flaming sheaf rose right into the air, and fell back in a shower of fire all around. Some bombs ascended to a height of about 1200 feet, and in passing over our heads described parabolas of fire. Immediately after such an eruption, the lava withdrew to the bottom of the chimney, which then yawned black and gaping. But erelong there was seen re-ascending the shining mirror of the surface of lava, which then recommenced the rhythmic play of its ordinary less violent bubblings. </span><br><br>In 1949 and 1957,the volcanologist Haroun Tazieff has visited Stromboli and filmed it from very close distance to the crater.<br><br>Issue #235</div>

These geological formations tend to be found as isolated entities rather than in mountain range fashion, which makes them the host of a unique array of endemic plant and animal species. Some of the most outstanding tepuis are Autana, Pico da Neblina (the highest one, on the Venezuelan-Brazil border), Auyantepui and Monte Roraima. They are typically composed of Precambrian sandstone rocks, very hard to climb, that rise abruptly from the jungle, giving rise to spectacular natural scenery.

After descending, legend has it that ex-apiarist Hillary said he and Tenzing had 'knocked the bastard off', a phrase which has found its way into colloquial New Zealand English.<br><br>Sir Edmund is the only living New Zealander to appear on a banknote.<br><br>Born in Tuakau (south of Auckland), Hillary attended the Auckland Grammar School. The trip to school was over two hours each way, time which he spent reading. As he grew up he was smaller than his peers and very shy so he took refuge in his books and daydreams of a life filled with adventure. At age 16, his interest in climbing was sparked during a school trip to Ruapehu. He found that his gangly and uncoordinated frame was physically strong and had greater endurance than many of his tramping companions.<br><br>During World War II he was a RNZAF navigator. He was part of an unsuccessful New Zealand expedition to Everest in 1951 before joining the successful British attempt of 1953. He climbed 10 other peaks in the Himalaya on further visits in 1956, 1960-61 and 1963-65. He also reached the South Pole, as part of the British Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, on January 4, 1958.<br><br>He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) on July 16, 1953 and was created a member of the Order of New Zealand (ONZ) in 1987.

Through his efforts he has succeeded in building many schools and hospitals in this remote region of the Himalaya. He has stated that he regards this as his most important achievement. He is also the Honorary President of the American Himalayan Foundation, a US non-profit body that also helps improve the ecology and living conditions in the Himalayas. During the mid-1980s, he was also New Zealand's High Commissioner to India (the equivalent of an Ambassador between Commonwealth countries), where he was in frequent demand as a guest of honor. On one occasion when he was asked about the possibility of the existence of the yeti or abominable snowman, he expressed his skepticism since he had actually searched the Himalayas for that elusive creature.<br><br>To mark the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest, the Nepalese Government conferred honorary citizenship upon Sir Edmund at a special golden jubilee celebration in the capital Kathmandu.
