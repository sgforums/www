The bridge was built in 1779 to link the industral town of Broseley with Madeley Wood and Coalbrookdale.<br><br>It is a beautiful and scenic place which also has great historical importance: it is said to be the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution. This began in Coalbrookdale with Abraham Darby's invention of a process for producing high quality iron.

It was formed during the last ice age when the output from the previously north flowing river became trapped in a lake created by glaciers to the north. The level of the lake rose until it was able to flow over the hills to the south. This flow eroded a path through the hills forming the gorge and permanently diverting the Severn southwards.<br><br>There are two reasons the site was so useful to the early industrialists. The raw materials, coal, iron ore, limestone and clay, for the manufacture of iron, tiles and porcelain are exposed or easily mined in the gorge. The deep and wide river allowed easy transport of products to the sea.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Telford_-_Shropshire_dot.png/417px-Telford_-_Shropshire_dot.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Telford_-_Shropshire_dot.png/180px-Telford_-_Shropshire_dot.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Location of Ironbridge Gorge</span><br><br>Issue #142</div>

The U.S. islands include numerous New York state parks, including Robert Moses State Park - Thousand Islands, located on an island in the St. Lawrence.<br><br>In the late 19th century and early 20th century many distinguished visitors made the region widely known as a summer resort. Several grand hotels provided luxurious accommodations while steamboats offered extensive tours among the islands. Wealthy and middle-class summer residents built summer homes. Some masonry "castles" remain as international landmarks. The most famous extant examples are Singer Castle on Dark Island and the long-neglected but now restored Boldt Castle on Heart Island.<br><br>During the half century (1874-1912) of the resort's greatest prominence, most wealthy vacationers came from New York City, joined by prominent families from Chicago, Pittsburgh and other cities of the United States and Canada. The region retains a historically important collection of vacation homes from this time. The Thousand Islands have long been a center for recreational boating. Large steam yachts, many designed by Herreshoff required distinctive yacht houses. The region was known also for innovative power boating during this period. Three local yacht clubs hosted the Gold Cup Races of the American Power Boat Association for nine consecutive years.

Its land borders are the Suez Canal to the west and the IsraelÂ–Egypt border to the north-east. The Sinai Peninsula is in Southwest Asia (also called West Asia - the more geographically accurate term for the Western term of Middle East) while the rest of Egypt is in North Africa.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/89/Southeastern_Mediterranean_panorama_STS040-152-180.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/Sinai_Peninsula_from_Southeastern_Mediterranean_panorama_STS040-152-180.jpg/180px-Sinai_Peninsula_from_Southeastern_Mediterranean_panorama_STS040-152-180.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In this panorama view of the Southeastern Mediterranean (28.0N, 34.0E), the <strong>Sinai Peninsula</strong> dominates this north looking oblique view. Lying between two great continents, historic Sinai separates Africa from Asia. The Great Rift Fault originates in southern Turkey, through the Jordan River Valley, and the Gulf of Aqaba, the Red Sea and then into east Africa. The atmospheric haze seen throughout is thought to be wind borne atmospheric dust.</span><br><br>The Sinai is almost entirely desert, but is settled along the Sabah coast at Taba (near the Israeli town of Eilat), where there is a hotel and casino. Moving southwards along the coast, there lie: Nuweiba, Dahab and Sharm el-Sheikh. The Sinai is also settled on the north coast near the Gaza Strip at El-Arish.<br><br>Mount Sinai in the Sinai is biblically significant as it is allegedly the site where Moses received the Ten Commandments. A monastery situated at St. Catherine in the southern Sinai Peninsula claims to be at the site of Mount Sinai, though historians and archeologists generally reject this as the site.<br><br>The eastern boundary of the peninsula is a geological fault zone known as the Great Rift Valley, which can be seen from the upper Jordan River valley, extending southward through the Red Sea into Africa.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The Sinai was inhabited by the Monitu and was called <span style="font-style: italic;">Mafkat</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Country of Turquoise</span>. From the time of the First dynasty or before, the Egyptians mined turquoise in Sinai at two locations, Wadi Maghareh and Serabit el-Khadim. They were operated on and off on a seasonal basis for thousands of years. Modern attempts to exploit the deposits have been unprofitable. These may be the first known mines.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ef/Sinai_peninsula_topo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ef/Sinai_peninsula_topo.jpg/285px-Sinai_peninsula_topo.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Sinai Peninsula, located between Africa and Asia, is a result of those two continents pulling apart from each other. Earth's crust is cracking, stretching, and lowering along the two northern branches of the Red Sea, namely the Gulf of Suez, seen here on the west (left), and the Gulf of Aqaba, seen to the east (right). This color-coded shaded relief image shows the triangular nature of the peninsula, with the coast of the Mediterranean Sea forming the northern side of the triangle. The Suez Canal can be seen as the narrow vertical blue line in the upper left connecting the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.<br><br>The peninsula is divided into three distinct parts; the northern region consisting chiefly of sandstone, plains and hills, the central area dominated by the Tih Plateau, and the mountainous southern region where towering peaks abound. Much of the Sinai is deeply dissected by river valleys, or wadis, that eroded during an earlier geologic period and break the surface of the plateau into a series of detached massifs with a few scattered oases.<br><br>Two visualization methods were combined to produce the image: shading and color coding of topographic height. The shade image was derived by computing topographic slope in the northwest-southeast direction, so that northwest slopes appear bright and southeast slopes appear dark. Color coding is directly related to topographic height, with green at the lower elevations, rising through yellow and tan, to white at the highest elevations. </span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modern history</span><br><br>Until the early 20th century, Sinai was under the control of the Ottoman Empire. In 1906 it became part of then British-controlled Egypt, when the Turkish government yielded to British pressure to hand over the peninsula. The border imposed by the British runs in an almost straight line from Rafah on the Mediterranean shore to Taba on the Gulf of Aqaba. This line served as the eastern border of Sinai ever since, and is now the international border between Israel and Egypt.<br><br>In 1948, Egyptian forces passed through Sinai on their way to invade the newly-created state of Israel based on a United Nations mandate dividing the land between the Jews and the Christian and Muslim inhabitants. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Israeli forces entered the north-eastern corner of Sinai, but withdrew shortly after, following British and American pressure. Under the terms of the 1949 Armistice Agreement, Sinai, together with the Gaza Strip, remained under Egyptian control, although parts of it were demilitarized.<br><br>In 1956, Egypt used its control of Sinai to impose a blockade on the Israeli port of Eilat. Following this, Israeli forces, aided by Britain and France (which sought to regain control over the Suez Canal) invaded Sinai, and took control over the entire peninsula within several days (see Suez Crisis). Several months later, Israel withdrew its forces from Sinai, following strong American and Russian pressure. Following this, the United Nations Emergency Force, the UNEF, was stationed in Sinai to prevent any military occupation of the Sinai.<br><br>In 1967, Egypt reinforced its military presence in Sinai, renewed the blockade on Eilat, and on May 16 ordered the UNEF out of Sinai effective immediately. In the following Six-Day War, the Egyptian army was defeated, and Israel took control over the entire peninsula. The Suez Canal, whose east bank was now controlled by Israel, was closed.<br><br>In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Egyptian forces managed to make advances into the peninsula, but were eventually pushed back across the Suez Canal. As part of the following cease-fire agreements, Israel pulled its forces out of a strip in western Sinai, allowing for the re-opening of the canal.<br><br>In 1979 Israel and Egypt signed a Peace Treaty, in which Israel agreed to transfer all control over Sinai to Egypt. Subsequently, Israel pulled out of Sinai in several stages, ending in 1982. The Israeli pull-out involved the destruction of several Israeli settlements including the town of Yamit in north-eastern Sinai.<br><br><strong>Present</strong><br><br>The Sinai Peninsula is currently divided among several governorates, or provinces, of Egyptian administration. The southern portion of the Sinai is called Janub Sina' in Arabic, literally "Sinai South." The northern portion is named Shamal Sina', or "Sinai North." the other three governates converge on the Suez Canal, including Al Isma'iliyah on its southern end and crosses into Egypt-proper. In the center is As Suways, literally "the Suez;" and Bur Sa'id lies in the north with its capital at Port Said.<br><br>Approximately 66,500 live in Janub Sina' and 314,000 live in Shamal Sina'. Port Said itself has a population of roughly 500,000, while the rest of the governorate (Bur Sa'id) itself. Portions of the populations of Al Isma'iliyah and As Suways live in Sinai, while the rest live on the western side of the Suez Canal in Egypt-proper. The combined population of these two governorates is roughly 1.3 million (only a part of that population live in the Sinai, while the rest live on the western side of the Suez).<br><br>Issue #148</div>

These cliffs, generally known as Calvert Cliffs, are famous for their fossils, especially fossilized shark teeth. Fossilized shark teeth are commonly found washed up on the beaches next to the cliffs. Scientist's Cliffs is a beach community in Calvert County, named so because of the cliffs' propensity for geological finds and numerous fossils.<br><br>Much of the bay is quite shallow.

The Bay was once known for its great seafood production, especially blue crabs, clams and oysters. The plentiful oyster harvests led to the development of the Skipjack, the State Boat of Maryland, which is the only remaining working boat type in the United States still under sail power. Today, the body of water is less productive than it used to be, because of runoff from development throughout the watershed, urbanization, particularly on its western shore, overharvesting, and invasion of foreign species. The bay though, still yields more fish and shellfish (about 45,000 short tons or 40,000 metric tons yearly) than any other estuary in the United States.<br><br>The Bay is famous for its Rockfish, otherwise known as Striped bass.

Chesapeake Bay's oyster industry has also suffered from two diseases: MSX and dermo. Harmful algae blooms such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Pfiesteria</span> which can effect both fish and humans is also a problem. The depletion of oysters due to overharvesting has had a particularly harmful effect on the quality of the Bay. The reduction of oysters, which serve as natural water filters for the Bay, has led to reduced water quality of the Bay: water that was formerly clear for fathoms is now so turbid that a wader may lose sight of his feet before his knees are wet.<br><br>Issue #150</div>

In 1897 the Mountain was "officially" named Mount McKinley, after the popular U.S. president William McKinley.

There have been several campaigns to officially switch the name of the mountain back to "Denali" nation-wide. However, at the first session of each Congress, Ralph Regula, the congressman from President McKinley's district, introduces legislation "to provide for the retention of the name of Mount McKinley" which effectively blocks any effort at a name change.<br><br>A 1903 claim of a first ascent by Dr. Frederick Cook was later proven fraudulent, and the first real ascent came on June 7, 1913 by a party led by Hudson Stuck.

It is named after the Dutch navigator Willem Barents. It is a rather deep shelf sea (average depth 230 m), bordered by the shelf edge towards the Norwegian Sea in the west, the island of Svalbard (Norway) in the north-west, and the islands of Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya (Russia) in the north-east and east.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/NW_Russia.jpg/379px-NW_Russia.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/NW_Russia.jpg/180px-NW_Russia.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Southeastern portion of <strong>Barents Sea</strong>, the Kola Peninsula and the White Sea.</span><br><br>The southern half of the Barents Sea, including the ports of Murmansk (Russia) and VardÃ¸ (Norway) remain ice-free year round due to the warm North Atlantic drift. In September, the entire Barents Sea is more or less completely ice-free. Until the Winter War, Finland's territory also reached to the Barents Sea, with the harbor at Petsamo was Finland's only ice-free winter harbor.<br><br>There are three main types of water masses in the Barents Sea: Warm, salty Atlantic water (temperature &gt; 3Â°C, salinity &gt; 35) from the North Atlantic drift, cold Arctic water (temperature &lt; 0Â°C, salinity &lt; 35) from the north, and warm, but not very salty coastal water (temperature &gt; 3Â°C, salinity &lt; 34.7). Between the Atlantic and Polar waters, a front called the Polar Front is formed. In the western parts of the sea (close to BjÃ¸rnÃ¸ya), this front is determined by the bottom topography and is therefore relatively sharp and stable from year to year, while in the east (towards Novaya Zemlya), its can be quite diffuse and its position varies a lot between years.<br><br>Due to the North Atlantic drift, the Barents Sea has a high biological production compared to other oceans of similar latitude. The spring bloom of phytoplankton can start quite early close to the ice edge, because the fresh water from the melting ice makes up a stable water layer on top of the sea water. The phytoplankton bloom feeds zooplankton such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Calanus finmarchicus, Calanus glacialis, Calanus hyperboreus, Oithona spp., </span>and krill. The zooplankton feeders include young cod, capelin, polar cod, whales and Little Auk. The capelin is a key food for top predators such as the North-East Arctic cod, harp seals, and seabirds such as Common Guillemot and Brunnich's Guillemot. The fisheries of the Barents Sea, in particular the cod fisheries, are of great importance for both Norway and Russia.<br><br>Nuclear contamination from dumped Russian naval reactors is an environmental concern in the Barents Sea.<br><br>Issue #155</div>

The Isthmus of Tehuantepec is the narrowest part of Mexico between the Atlantic (Gulf of Mexico) and the Pacific oceans. That it is also the flattest has long drawn the interest of would-be canal builders.</span><br><br>The Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas stand on the east of the isthmus, with Veracruz and Oaxaca on the west. It includes that part of Mexico lying between the 94th and 96th meridians of West longitude, or the south-eastern parts of Veracruz and Oaxaca, with perhaps small districts of Chiapas and Tabasco. It is 200 km (125 miles) across at its narrowest part from gulf to gulf, or 92 km (120 miles) to the head of Laguna Superior on the Pacific coast. The Sierra Madre breaks down at this point into a broad, plateau-like ridge, whose elevation, at the highest point reached by the Tehuantepec railway (Chivela Pass) is 735 ft. The northern side of the isthmus is swampy and densely covered with jungle, which has been a greater obstacle to railway construction than the grades in crossing the sierra. The whole region is hot and malarial, except the open elevations where the winds from the Pacific render it comparatively cool and healthful. The annual rainfall on the Atlantic or northern slope is 156 in. (Enock) and the maximum temperature about 95 F. in the shade. The Pacific slope has a light rainfall and dryer climate.<br><br><strong>North America</strong><br><br>The southern edge of North America, if North America is defined as its tectonic plate, lies in the isthmus (this definition would exclude California west of the San Andreas fault, while including areas of eastern Siberia, such as Kamchatka), and not at the Isthmus of Panama.<br><br><strong>Proposed canal</strong><br><br>Since the days of HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s, the Tehuantepec isthmus has been considered a favorable route, first for an interoceanic canal, and since the 19th century for an interoceanic railway. Its proximity to the axis of international trade gives it some advantage over the Panama route; the Isthmus of Panama, however, is significantly narrower, making for a shorter traversal. See also: Panama Canal, Nicaragua Canal.<br><br><strong>Railway</strong><br><br>When the great cost of a canal across the isthmus compelled engineers and capitalists to give it up as impracticable, James B. Eads proposed to construct a quadruple track ship-railway, and the scheme received serious attention for some time. Then came projects for an ordinary railway, and several concessions were granted by the Mexican government for this purpose from 1857 to 1882. In the last-named year the Mexican government resolved to undertake the enterprise on its own account, and entered into contracts with a prominent Mexican contractor for the work. In 1888 this contract was rescinded, after 108 km (67 mi) of road had been completed. The next contract was fruitless because of the death of the contractor, and the third failed to complete the work within the sum specified (2,700,000). This was in 1893, and 60 km (37 mi) remained to be built. A fourth contract resulted in the completion of the line from coast to coast in 1894, when it was found that the terminal ports were deficient in facilities and the road too light for heavy traffic. The government then entered into a contract with the London firm of contractors of S. Pearson &amp; Son, Ltd., who had constructed the drainage works of the valley of Mexico and the new port works of Veracruz, to rebuild the line and construct terminal ports at Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf coast, and at Salina Cruz on the Pacific side. The work was done for account of the Mexican government. Work began on 10 December 1899, and was finished to a point where its formal opening for traffic was possible in January 1907.<br><br>The railway is 308 km (192 mi) long, with a branch of 29 km (18 mi) between Juile and San Juan Evangelista. The minimum depth at low water in both ports is 33 ft., and an extensive system of quays and railway tracks at both terminals affords ample facilities for the expeditious handling of heavy cargoes. The general offices, shops and hospital are located at RincÃ³n Antonio, at the entrance to the Chivela Pass, where the temperature is cool and healthful conditions prevail. At Santa Lucrecia, 175 km (109 mi) from Salina Cruz, connection is made with the Veracruz &amp; Pacific railway (a government line), 343 km (213 mi) to CÃ³rdoba, Veracruz, and 500 km (311 mi) to Mexico City.<br><br>Issue #156</div>

While the northern end has been rated a gentle 4, the southern side is rated as a 7 (with 10 as the most hazardous) due to a famous rip current known as the "Backpackers Express" (also known as "Bronte Express" because you would supposedly end up at Bronte - two beaches south - if caught in it). In actual fact there are up to five rip currents operating along the beach, the Backpackers' Express being the one closest to the designated swimming area. The beach has an underwater shark net in place sporadically during the swimming season. It is removed for repairs in the winter and is redeployed again in the summer.<br><br>Bondi Beach hosted the beach volleyball competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Bondi Beach is the end point of the City to Surf Fun Run. The run is held each year in August. Until the mid 1990s the run was held in October, late autumn, until the number of heat-related deaths forced organisers to rethink the event. The race attracts over 60,000 entrants who complete the 14 km run from the central business district of Sydney to Bondi Beach.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>Bondi Beach was a working class suburb throughout most of the twentieth century. Bondi Beach and the Eastern Suburbs also became home for many mainly Jewish migrants as people fled war and the Holocaust from Poland and Germany. This can be noted by the synagogues and the kosher businesses in the area.<br><br>During the 1970s and 80s it was renowned for its immigrant New Zealander population. The Bondi Astra hotel, now an apartment complex, was notorious as a place to buy illegal late-night liquor and heroin. A major factor in Bondi's seedy image was the fact that Sydney's Water Board maintained an untreated sewage outlet at the north end of the beach, resulting in the term 'Bondi Cigar' - a somewhat exaggerated reference to human faeces floating in on the tide. The sewage outlet was closed in the mid 1990s when a deep water ocean outfall was built.<br><br>In recent decades Bondi has become gentrified and is home to many famous Australians such as media baron James Packer. War correspondent, film-maker and playwright John Pilger was born in Bondi Beach.<br><br><strong>Origin of term</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bondi</span>, derived from an old Aboriginal term meaning, approximately, "sound of water breaking on the beach".<br><br>Issue #157</div>

On the left side is the sea, and on the right side the lake (IJsselmeer) created by the Afsluitdijk.</span><br><br>Previous experiences had demonstrated that till (boulder clay), rather than just sand or clay, was the best primary material for a structure like the Afsluitdijk, with the added benefit that till was in plentiful supply in the area; it could be retrieved in large quantities by simply dredging it from the bottom of the Zuiderzee. Work started at four points: on both sides of the mainland and on two specially made construction-islands (Kornwerderzand and Breezand) along the line of the future dike.<br><br>From these points the dike slowly grew by ships depositing till into the open sea in two parallel lines. Sand was then poured in between the two dams and as it emerged above the surface was then covered by another layer of till. The nascent dike was then strengthened from land by basalt rocks and mats of willow switch at its base. The dike could then be finished off by raising it further with sand and finally clay for the surface of the dike, on which grass was planted.<br><br>Construction progressed better than expected; at three points along the line of the dike there were deeper underwater trenches where the tidal current was much stronger than elsewhere. These had been considered to be major obstacles to completing the dike, but all of them proved to be relatively straightforward. On May 28, 1932, two years earlier than initially thought, the Zuiderzee ceased to be as the last tidal trench of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Vlieter</span> was closed by a final bucket of till. The IJsselmeer was born, even though it was still salty at the time.<br><br>The dike itself however was not finished yet as it still needed to be brought up to its required height and a road linking Friesland and North Holland (the current A7/E22 motorway) also remained to be built. It would not be until September 25, 1933, that the Afsluitdijk was officially opened, with a monument marking the spot where the dike had been closed. The amount of material used is estimated at 23 million mÂ³ of sand and 13.5 million mÂ³ of till and over the years an average of around 4,000 to 5,000 workers were involved with the construction every day, relieving some of the unemployment following the Great Depression.<br><br>Beside the dam itself there was also the necessary construction of two complexes of shipping locks and discharge sluices at both ends of the dike. The complex at Den Oever includes the <span style="font-style: italic;">Stevin</span> lock (named after mathematician and engineer Simon Stevin) and three series of five sluices for discharging the IJsselmeer into the Wadden Sea; the other complex at Kornwerderzand is composed of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Lorentz</span> locks (named after Hendrik Lorentz, the famous physicist, who personally did the calculations of the tides that were crucial to the construction of the afsluitdijk) and two series of five sluices, making a total of 25 discharge sluices. Periodically discharging the lake is necessary since it is continually fed by rivers and streams (most notably the IJssel river that gives its name to the lake) and polders draining their water into the IJsselmeer.<br><br>Issue #159</div>

Broad at the base, they taper to a level top, where temporary embankments or sandbags can be placed.

Don McLean mentions driving his "Chevy to the Levee" in his song "American Pie".<br><br><strong>Natural Levees</strong><br><br>A natural levee results from the deposit of material by a river during flood stage resulting in the land near a river being raised in elevation. When the river is not in flood state it cuts a channel in the elevated material. Natural levees are especially noted on the Yellow River in China near the sea where ocean going ships appear to sail high above the plain on the elevated river. Natural levees are also present on the Rio Grande River in Colorado's San Luis Valley.<br><br>Natural levees are formed as sediment of larger grain size settles out on the banks of channels owing to the drop in flow velocity on the edge of the channel.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Levees in Tidal Waters</span><br><br>The same basic process occurs in tidal creeks when the incomming tide carries mineral material of all grades up to the limit imposed by the energy of the flow. As the tide overflows the sides of the creek towards high water, the flow rate at the brink slows and larger sediment is deposited, forming the levee. At the height of the tide, the water stands on the salt-marsh or flats and the finer particles slowly settle, forming clay. In the early ebb, the water level in the creek falls leaving the broad expanse of water standing on the marsh at a higher level.<br><br>The area of water on the marsh is much greater than the water surface of the creek so that in the latter, the flow rate is much greater. It is this rush of water, perhaps an hour after high water, which keeps the creek channel open. The cross-sectional area of the water body in the creek is small compared with that initially over the levee which at this stage is acting as a weir. The deposited sediment (coarse on the levee and fine on the mud flats or salt-marsh) therefore tends to stay put so that, tide by tide, the marsh and levee grow higher until they are of such a hight that few tides overflow them. In an active system, the levee is always higher than the marsh. That is how it came to be called "<span style="font-style: italic;">une rive levÃ©e</span>" or raised shore.<br><br>Issue #160</div>

During the fighting between 20,000 and 35,000 deaths, and more than 43,000 prisoners were taken; afterwards, a military court pronounced about a hundred death sentences, more than 13,000 prison sentences, and close to 4,000 deportations to New Caledonia.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/Monument_Federes.jpg/800px-Monument_Federes.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/Monument_Federes.jpg/300px-Monument_Federes.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Monument in memory of the Communards shot at the Communards' Wall, in the Samuel de Champlain's square near the PÃ¨re Lachaise cemetery in Paris, built with the original stones from the Communards' Wall.</span><br><br>The memory of the Commune remained engraved in the people's memory, especially within the Workers' Movement which regenerated itself in a few years time. The first march before the Wall, at the call of Jules Guesde, took place in May 23, 1880, two months before the Communards' Amnesty: 25,000 people, a symbolic "immortal" red rose in their buttonholes, stood up against police forces. From that time on, this "ascent to the Wall", punctuated French labor force political history. Every year since 1880, the organizations of the French left have held a demonstration in this symbolic place during the last week of May.

It is formed at the western edge of the Central Valley by the Sacramento River at its confluence with the San Joaquin River just east of where the river enters Suisun Bay (an upper arm of San Francisco Bay).

The Sacramento River flows into the delta from the north, meeting the San Joaquin River as it flows from the south. The main channel of the Sacramento continues westward into Suisun Bay, which empties into San Pablo Bay via the Carquinez Strait.</span><br><br>The delta consists of a myriad of small natural and man-made channels (locally called sloughs), creating a system of isolated lowland islands and wetlands (defined by dikes or levees). The extensive system of earthen levees has allowed wide-spread farming throughout the delta, one of the most fertile agricultural areas in California. However, a burst dike can result in the flooding of a vast tract of land. On June 4, 2004, a 350 foot (110 m) section of a levee 10 mi (16 km) west of Stockton collapsed, flooding the Upper Jones Tract, a 648 acre (2.6 kmÂ²) "island".<br><br>The many channels throughout the delta are a popular destination for boating and fishing, and provide habitat for migratory birds. Before the building of more modern highways, automobile transportation throughout the area was accomplished by roadways along the levees and one of the most extensive systems of cable ferries in North America. Today, channels of the delta are spanned by over 50 drawbridges.<br><br>The Sacramento River Delta is given as an example of an inverted river delta. The fan-shaped area of the of the delta converges downstream, rather than diverging, as the two rivers are forced to exit the Central Valley through the Coast Range via the narrow channel known as the Carquinez Strait leading into the San Francisco Bay.<br><br>Issue #163</div>

There have been no indications found that could have been used to predict this earthquake. Although well overdue, the probability of this quake occurring in 2004 has been estimated at about ten percent. The magnitude of the event was consistent with previous earthquakes in this region.<br><br><strong>Aftershocks</strong><br><br>Substantial aftershocks continued for more than a week after the initial event, moving in a northwesterly progression. In early October, there was a cluster of small earthquakes near Paso Robles near a parallel fault to the west. These may be in response to the transfer of stress to these faults after the release of stress at Parkfield. Past earthquakes have also occurred to the east of Parkfield at about the same distance from the San Andreas Fault near Coalinga and Avenal.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/PasoRobles20041011.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Aftershocks on October 11, 2004.</span><br><br><strong>Recent developments</strong><br><br>In December 2004, seismologists at the University of California, Berkeley announced the discovery of subtle tremors near Cholame, a hamlet near the San Andreas Fault directly south of Coalinga. This is in a region of the locked fault below the Parkfield episodes, last creating a 7.8 magnitude quake at Fort Tejon in 1857. These tremors were discovered using deep borehole seismometers that avoid surface noise. The spectral signatures of these motions are more similar to those of magma movement near volcanos than of typical earthquakes, but it is believed that the motions are not due to magma or fluid motion. It is hoped that this new discovery may sometime inform scientists as to the degree of danger presented by known locked faults. It is not currently expected that this knowledge will be refined into a precise predictive tool.<br><br><strong>Fort Tejon earthquake</strong><br><br>What is possibly the largest earthquake on the San Andreas fault in the last several hundred years is the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, with a fault rupture from the general vicinity of Parkfield to San Bernardino in Southern California, a distance of about 360 km (225 miles) and an offset of about 9 meters (30 feet). The epicenter of this earthquake is (by various sources) believed to be somewhere in the region from Cholame to Parkfield, a location at the extreme northern end of the locked portion of the fault and at the southern end of the rapidly periodic segment. It is believed that this earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 6.0 foreshock that was centered at Parkfield.<br><br>Issue #164</div>
