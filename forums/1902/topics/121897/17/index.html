Within the fort, several brilliantly crafted and decorated palaces are found. Of these, Moti Mahal (Pearl Palace), Phool Mahal (Flower Palace), Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), Sileh Khana, and Daulat Khana are notable. One also finds the fort museum comprising several palaces. This museum houses an exquisite collection of palanquins, howdahs, royal cradles, miniatures, musical instruments, costumes and furniture.

As this reduces the capacity of the channel, the channel will change direction over time, gradually building up a slightly mounded or shallow conical fan shape. This fan shape can also be explained with a thermodynamic justification: the system of sediment introduced at the apex of the fan will tend to a state which minimizes the sum of the transport energy involved in moving the sediment and the gravitational potential of material in the cone. It can easily be seen that there will be iso-transport energy lines forming concentric arcs about the discharge point at the apex of the fan. Thus the material will tend to be deposited equally about these lines, forming the characteristic cone shape. Multiple braided streams are usually present and active during water flows. Alluvial fans are most likely to be found in desert areas subject to periodic flash floods from nearby thunderstorms in local hills. Alluvial fans are very common around the margins of the sedimentary basins of the Basin and Range province of southwestern United States and northern Mexico.<br><br>Plants often are concentrated at the base of alluvial fans and many have long tap roots (30-50 feet) to reach water. The long-rooted plants are called phreatophytes by biologists. The water at this level is derived from water that has seeped through the fan and hit an impermeable layer that funneled the water to the base of the fan where it is concentrated and sometimes forms springs and seeps if the water is close enough to the surface. These stands of bushes cling onto the soil at their bases and over time wind action often blows away sand around the bushes which form islands of habitat for many animals.<br><br>Issue #389</div>

The island is the result of two separate shield volcanoes: Wai'anae and Ko'olau, with a broad "valley" or saddle (the central O'ahu Plain) between them. The highest point is Mt. Ka'ala in the Wai'anae Range, rising to 1,225 m (4,019 ft) above sea level (Macdonald, Abbott, &amp; Peterson, 1983).<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Oahu.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>O'ahu</strong></span><br><br>The island is home to about 900,000 people (approximately 75% of the resident population of the state) and partly because of this, O'ahu has for a long time been nicknamed "The Gathering Place". However, the term O'ahu has no confirmed meaning in Hawaiian, other than that of the place itself (Pukui, et al., 1976).

The island extends from Ka'ena on the west end to Makapu'u on the east.

O'ahu was not actually visited by Europeans until 28 February 1779 when Captain Clerke aboard HMS Resolution stepped ashore at Waimea Bay. Clerke had taken command of the ship after Capt.

Just as annual floods on the Nile allow for fertile, farmable land, the dramatic increase of water during the rainy season nourishes the producers of the Pantanal, which in turn nourishes all the other species as well. Humans have taken advantage of this so much that it has become a problem. Approximately 99% of the land in the Pantanal is privately owned for the purpose of agriculture.<br><br>The Pantanal is a natural water treatment facility. It supplies freshwater to the nearby areas by removing chemicals and other pollutants from the water which flows through it. However, when this Â“cleaning systemÂ” becomes overloaded, species which call the Pantanal home begin to suffer.

Within 1.5-2 km of the surface the highly pressured magma explodes upwards and expands to form a conical to cylindrical diatreme, which erupts to surface.

The distinctive characteristic of orangeites is phlogopite macrocrysts and microphenocrysts, together with groundmass micas that vary in composition from phlogopite to "tetraferriphlogopite" (anomalously Fe-rich phlogopite). Resorbed olivine macrocrysts and euhedral primary crystals of groundmass olivine are common but not essential constituents.<br><br>Characteristic primary phases in the groundmass include: zoned pyroxenes (cores of diopside rimmed by Ti-aegirine); spinel-group minerals (magnesian chromite to titaniferous magnetite); Sr- and REE-rich perovskite; Sr-rich apatite; REE-rich phosphates (monazite, daqingshanite); potassian barian hollandite group minerals; Nb-bearing rutile and Mn-bearing ilmenite.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kimberlitic indicator minerals</span><br><br>Kimberlites are peculiar igneous rocks because they contain a variety of mineral species with peculiar chemical compositions. These minerals such as potassic richterite, chromian diopside (a pyroxene), chromium spinels, magnesian ilmenite and high-aluminium garnets are generally absent from most other igneous rocks, making them particularly useful as indicators for kimberlites.<br><br>These indicator minerals are generally sought in stream sediments in modern alluvial material. Their presence, when found, may be indicative of the presence of a kimberlite within the erosional watershed which has produced the alluvium.<br><br><strong>Economic importance</strong><br><br>Kimberlites are the most important source of primary diamonds. Many kimberlite pipes also produce rich alluvial or eluvial diamond placer deposits.<br><br>The deposits occurring at Kimberley, South Africa were the first recognized and the source of the name. The Kimberley diamonds were originally found in weathered kimberlite which was colored yellow by limonite, and so was called yellow ground. Deeper workings encountered less altered rock, serpentinized kimberlite, which miners call blue ground.<br><br>Issue #395</div>

The Balboa Island community is joined to the mainland by a short two-lane bridge on the northeast of Balboa Island, and a privately-operated fleet of three, three-car ferryboats (Balboa Island Ferry) which provide access across the harbor to the Balboa Peninsula which lies to the south.<br><br><img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/2253/balboaislsandytravls1af.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Balboa Island</strong></span><br><br>Balboa Island is one of the most expensive real estate markets in North America outside of Lower Manhattan. A two-bedroom house with a water view from the living room can cost about $3 million.<br><br>Local tradition has it that Balboa Island is where the frozen chocolate banana was first marketed: There are snack shops on Marine Avenue that will dip a frozen banana on a stick into chocolate sauce and roll it around in ground nuts or candy sprinkles. This legend is referenced in the American television show Arrested Development in which the wealthy Bluth family of Orange County owns a frozen chocolate banana stand on Balboa Island. Also popular is the Balboa bar, a square of vanilla ice cream on a stick prepared in a similar fashion.<br><br>The zip code for Balboa Island is 92662.<br><br>The island was not always easily accessible. Newport Harbor was still largely undredged, and sailboat was often the only way to get around. Robert McFadden, an early Balboa Harbor developer had established a successful fishing wharf on the Balboa Peninsula and by 1906, the Pacific Electric line Red Cars began service to the Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Pavilion, and soon, the Red Cars would bring thousands of summertime visitors from Los Angeles.<br><br>Within a few years, real estate promoters began sending salesmen up to wealthy Pasadena and soon to Los Angeles (both connected by the Red Cars) to promote property in and around Newport Harbor. Considerable Balboa Island property was sold in Pasadena, and this is one of the reasons that so many longtime Island residents continue to have family and contacts in the Pasadena area. One of these real estate promoters was William Collins. At the time, Balboa Island was little more than a sandbar that was usually swallowed up by high tide.<br><br>In 1908 and 1909, with permission of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Collins dredged the surrounding bay and piled the sand on the little sandbar that he came to call Balboa Island. Collins originally sold lots on the Island for as little as $25, with the promise of a bridge and ferry service to follow. Joseph Allan Beek, while still a student at Pasadena City College, was enchanted with the area, and became one of Collins' salesmen. Joe Beek played a crucial role in the development of Balboa Island, and spent a lifetime devoted to it. He later served as Secretary of the California State Senate until his death in 1968.<br><br>The island grew slowly at first, but in 1916, it became part of the City of Newport Beach. By 1921, homes were beginning to fill in the Island and Balboa Peninsula. Roads to the Newport Harbor area were still largely undeveloped, and many people still arrived by rail to the peninsula and took the ferry over to the island. Although the first bridge from the mainland to the North Bayfront was built in 1912, it was not capable of carrying automobiles until 1929, when it was refurbished.<br><br>In 1919, after complaints of inadequate service, the city of Newport Beach awarded a fifteen-year franchise to Joseph Beek to run the ferry. At first it only carried pedestrians, but by 1921, was also transporting cars to the Island. The ferry operation remains in the Beek family.<br><br>In 1953, the International Boy Scout Jamboree held its event where Newport Center and Fashion Island now sit. Thousands of tents were pitched in the area reachable only by a two-lane muddy trail called Palisades Road. The road was soon paved, and later the name was changed to Jamboree Road in honor of the Scouts.<br><br>Today it remains a major thoroughfare through Newport Beach, and ends at Balboa Island. Over the years, Balboa Island has developed into a close-knit community, home to professionals, families, retirees, students and celebrities.<br><br>Issue #396</div>

The English word geyser to describe a spouting hot spring derives from Geysir (which itself is derived from the Icelandic verb gjÃ³sa meaning to erupt. The English verb gush is probably related to that word). Geysir lies on the slopes of Laugarfjall hill which is also the home to Strokkur geyser.<br><br>Eruptions at Geysir can hurl boiling water up to 60 metres in the air. However, eruptions may be infrequent, and have in the past stopped altogether for years at a time. Currently, eruptions are occurring about three times a day on average.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/Geysir.jpg/463px-Geysir.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/09/Geysir.jpg/250px-Geysir.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Strokkur, a geyser in the <strong>Geysir</strong> area</span><br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>The oldest accounts of a geyser at Haukadalur date back to 1294. Earthquakes in the area caused significant changes in local neighbouring landscape creating several new hot springs. Changes in the activity of the Geysir and the surrounding geysers are strongly related to earthquake activity. In records dated 1630 the geysers erupted so violently that the valley around them trembled.<br><br>In recent times earthquakes have tended to revive the activity of Geysir which then subsides again in the following years. Before 1896 Geysir was almost dormant before an earthquake that year caused eruptions to begin again, occurring several times a day, lasting up to an hour and causing spouts of up to 60 metres in height. By 1935 the geyser was almost dormant again and a manmade channel was dug through the silica rim around the edge of the geyser vent. This ditch caused a lowering of the watertable and a revival in activity. Gradually this channel too clogged with silica and eruptions again became rare. In 1981 the ditch was cleared again and eruptions could be stimulated, on special occasions, by the addition of soap. Following environmental concerns the practice of adding soap was seldom employed during the 1990s. During that time Geysir seldom erupted. When it did erupt, it was spectacular, sending boiling water about forty metres into the air. On the Icelandic National Day authorized government geologists would force an eruption. A further earthquake in 2000 revived the geyser again. Initially eruptions were taking place on average eight times a day. By July 2003 this activity had again decreased to around three times per day.<br><br>The nearby geyser Strokkur erupts much more frequently than Geysir, erupting to heights of up to 20 metres every five minutes or so. Strokkur's activity has also been affected by earthquakes, although to a lesser extent than the Great Geysir. There are around thirty much smaller geysers and hot pools in the area, including one called Litli Geysir ('Little Geysir').<br><br>Descriptions of the Great Geysir and Strokkur have been given in every travel guide to Iceland published from the 18th century onwards. Today the geyser remains an essential element of almost every tourist's itinerary. The place is, together with Ãžingvellir and the Gullfoss waterfall, part of the most famous sights of Iceland, the Golden Circle.<br><br><strong>Ownership of the Geysir area</strong><br><br>Until 1894 the Geysir area was owned by a local farmer. In that year the area was sold to James Craig (later Lord Craigavon), a whisky distiller and future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Initially he erected large fences around the site and an entrance fee was charged for visitors wishing to view the geysers. The following year however Craig appeared to tire of his project and gave the area as a present to a friend, E. Craig, who dropped the entrance fees. Later Craig's nephew Hugh Rogers inherited the site. In 1935 he sold the site to film director SigurÃ°ur JÃ³nasson who subsequently donated it to the Icelandic people in perpetuity.<br><br>Issue #398</div>

Despite the great promise of the rich farmland of the Valley, the Blue Ridge Mountains, crossed by Governor Alexander Spotswood's legendary Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition at Swift Run Gap in 1716, were a major obstacle to colonial expansion from the east. Instead, the Valley was first settled by German and then by Scotch-Irish immigrants from Pennsylvania in the 1730s. The former were known as "Shenandoah Deitsch".
