In the crystal structure, zinc and sulfur atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated. The structure is closely related to the structure of diamond. The hexagonal analog is known as the wurtzite structure. The lattice constant for zinc sulfide in the zincblende crystal structure is 5.420 angstroms.<br><br>Its color is usually yellow, brown, or gray to gray-black, and it may be shiny or dull. Its luster is resinous. It has a yellow or light brown streak, a hardness of 2.5 - 4, and a specific gravity of 3.9-4.1. Some specimens have a red iridescence within the gray-black crystals; these are called "ruby sphalerite." The pale yellow and red varieties have very little iron and are translucent. The darker more opaque varieties contain more iron. Some specimens are also fluorescent in ultraviolet light. The refractive index of sphalerite (as measured via sodium light, 589.3 nm) is 2.37. Sphalerite crystallizes in the isometric crystal system and possesses perfect dodecahedral cleavage.

Freshly cut gems are lively with an adamantine luster and could conceivably be mistaken for a fancy-colored diamond in passing, but due to sphalerite's softness and fragility the gems are best left unset as collector's or museum pieces (although some have been set into pendants). Collectors may pay a premium for stones over one carat (200 mg), as clean crystals are usually quite small.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Mantle</strong></span><br><br>The Earth's <strong>mantle</strong> is the layer in the structure of the Earth that lies directly under the Earth's crust and above the Earth's outer core. The term is also applied to the structure of other planets. Earth's mantle lies roughly between 30 and 2,900 km below the surface.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/07/Earth-crust-cutaway-english.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Earth cutaway from core to exosphere. Partially to scale.</span><br><br>The boundary between the crust and the mantle is the MohoroviÃ¨iÃ¦ discontinuity, named for its discoverer, and is usually called the Moho. The Moho is a boundary at which there is a sudden change in the speed of seismic waves. At one time some thought that the Moho was the structure at which the earth's rigid crust moved relative to the mantle. Current research places this zone of movement within the mantle, from 70 km (43 mi) below the ocean crust to 150 km (93 mi) below the continental crust. The mantle just below the crust is composed of cold and therefore rigid mantle fused to the crust but at the same time separated from it by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Moho</span>. This rigid layer of crust and the upper mantle forms the lithosphere.<br><br>The mantle differs substantially from the crust in its mechanical characteristics and its chemical composition. It is chiefly the difference of chemistry on which the distinction between crust and mantle is based. Mantle rock consists of olivines, different pyroxenes and other mafic minerals. Typified by peridotite, dunite, and eclogite, mantle rocks also possesses a higher portion of iron and magnesium and a smaller portion of silicon and aluminium than the crust. In the mantle, temperatures range between 100Â°C at the upper boundary to over 3,500Â°C at the boundary with the core. Although these temperatures far exceed the melting points of the mantle rocks at the surface, particularly in deeper ranges, they are almost exclusively solid. The enormous lithostatic pressure exerted on the mantle prevents them from melting.<br><br>The subregion of the mantle extending about 250 km (155 mi) below the lithosphere is called the asthenosphere. It some regions of the earth, this subregion of the mantle is associated with a region of the mantle that passes seismic waves more slowly. This region is called the <span style="font-style: italic;">low-velocity zone</span>. The cause of this low velocity zone is still debated. Currently theories include the influence of temperature and pressure or the existence of a small amount of partial melt.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cc/Earthquake_wave_paths.gif"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Mapping the interior of the Earth with earthquake waves.</span><br><br>Due to the temperature difference between the Earth's crust and outer core there is a convective material circulation in the mantle. Hot material ascends as a plutonic diapir from the border with the outer core, while cooler (and heavier) material sinks downward. This is often in the form of large-scale lithospheric downwellings at plate boundaries called subduction zones. During the ascent the material of the mantle cools down adiabatically. The temperature of the material falls with the pressure relief connected with the ascent, and its heat distributes itself over a larger volume. Near the lithosphere the pressure relief can lead to partial melting of the diapir, leading to volcanism and plutonism.<br><br>The convection of the Earth's mantle is a chaotic process (in the sense of fluid dynamics), which is thought to drive the motion of plates. Plate motion should not be confused with the older term continental drift which applies purely to the movement of the crustal components of the continents. The movements of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle are thereby partially decoupled, since due to the rigidity of the lithosphere, a tectonic plate can only move as a whole. Continental drift is therefore only a diffuse image of the movements at the upper limit of the Earth's mantle. The convection of the mantle is not yet clarified in detail. There are different theories, according to which the Earth's mantle is divided into different floors of separate convection.<br><br>Although there is a tendency to larger viscosity at greater depth, this relation is far from linear, and shows layers with dramatically decreased viscosity, in particular in the upper mantle and at the boundary with the core.<br><br>Due to the low viscosity in the upper mantle one could reason that there should be no earthquakes below approximately 300 km depth. However, in subduction zones, the geothermal gradient can be lowered, increasing the strength of the surrounding mantle, and allowing earthquakes to occur down to a depth of 400 km and 670 km.<br><br>The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is ~140 GPa (1.4 Matm). There exists increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, the entire mantle, however, is still thought to deform like a fluid on long timescales. The viscosity of the upper mantle ranges between 10^21 and 10^24 PaÂ·s, depending on depth. Thus, the upper mantle can only flow very slowly.<br><br>Why is the inner core thought solid, the outer core thought liquid, and the mantle solid/plastic? The melting points of iron rich substances are higher than pure iron. The core is composed almost entirely of pure iron, while iron rich substances are more common outside the core. So, surface iron-substances are solid, upper mantle iron-substances are semi-molten (as it is hot and they are under relatively little pressure), lower mantle iron-substances are solid (as they are under tremendous pressure), outer core pure iron is liquid as it has a very low melting point (despite enormous pressure), and the inner core is solid due to the overwhelming pressure found at the centre of the planet.<br><br>Issue #272</div>

It is located at approximately 40Â°13'N 26Â°26'E. The strait is 61 km (38 miles) long but only 1.2 to 6 km (0.75 to 4 miles) wide, averaging 55 m (180 ft) deep with a maximum depth of 81 m (300 ft). Water flows in both directions along the strait, from the Sea of Marmara to the Aegean via a surface current and in the opposite direction via an undercurrent.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Dardanelles_map2.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Dardanelles_map2.png/250px-Dardanelles_map2.png"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Map of the <strong>Dardanelles</strong></span><br><br>Just like the Bosporus strait, it separates Europe (in this case the Gallipoli peninsula) and the mainland of Asia. The major city adjoining the strait is Ã‡anakkale (which takes its name from its famous castles; kale means "castle"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>). The name <span style="font-style: italic;">Dardanelles</span> derives from Dardanus, an ancient Greek city on the Asian shore of the strait.<br><br>The strait has long had a strategic role in history. The ancient city of Troy was located near the western entrance of the strait and the strait's Asiatic shore was the focus of the Trojan War. It was also the scene of the legendary Greek story of Hero and Leander. The Persian army of Xerxes I and later the Macedonian army of Alexander the Great crossed the Dardanelles in opposite directions to invade each other's lands, in 480 BC and 334 BC respectively. The Dardanelles were vital to the defence of Constantinople during the Byzantine period, and since the 14th century they have almost continuously been controlled by the Turks.<br><br>Gaining control or special access to the strait became a key foreign policy goal of the Russian Empire during the 19th century. Following the Ottoman Empire's defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829, in 1833 Russia forced the Turks to sign the Treaty of Hunkiar Iskelesi which required the straits to be closed to warships of non-Black Sea powers at Russia's request. This would have effectively given Russia a free hand in the Black Sea.<br><br>The treaty alarmed the Western powers, who feared the consequences of potential Russian expansionism in the Mediterranean. At the London Straits Convention in July 1841, Britain, France, Austria and Prussia forced Russia to agree that only Turkish warships could traverse the Dardanelles in peacetime. Britain and France subsequently sent their fleets through the straits to attack the Crimea during the Crimean War in 1853, though this was done as allies of the Ottoman Empire. This convention was formally reaffirmed by the Congress of Paris in 1856, following the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, and it remained theoretically in force into the 20th century.<br><br>The Allies made a failed attempt to seize the Dardanelles during World War I, seeking to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the conflict. The Battle of Gallipoli damaged the career of Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty who eagerly promoted the use of Royal Navy battleships to force open the straits. The straits were mined to prevent Allied ships from penetrating them, although a British submarine did succeed in evading the minefields and sank a Turkish battleship off the Golden Horn in Istanbul. Sir Ian Hamilton's Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was unsuccessful in its attempt to capture the Gallipoli peninsula, and a withdrawal was ordered in January 1916.<br><br>Following the war, the 1920 Treaty of SÃ¨vres demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the League of Nations. This was amended under the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne which restored the straits to Turkey but allowed all foreign warships to traverse the straits freely. Turkey rejected the terms of this treaty and subsequently remilitarized the area. The reversion to this old regime was formalised under the Montreux Convention of July 1936. The convention, which is still in force today, treats the straits as an international shipping lane but Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non-Black Sea nations. During World War II, when Turkey was neutral for almost the entire length of the conflict, the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations.<br><br>Issue #274</div>

Since the letter "j" doesn't exist in Greek TÃ®j-TÃ»j became Tig later Tigr.In Greek at the end of words -is sonex is used (TÃ®j-Tijr-Tig-Tigr-Tigris). In Kurdish "Derzi" means needle, meaning that the river is long and straight like a needle (Derzi-Terzi-Tirzi-Tigris). Another name for this watercourse, used from the time of the Persian Empire, is Arvand, which has the same meaning. Today, the name Arvand refers to the lower part of the Tigris (ie, Arvand/Shatt al-Arab) in Persian.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/85/Tigris_river_in_mosul.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/85/Tigris_river_in_mosul.jpg/300px-Tigris_river_in_mosul.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Tigris</strong> River in Mosul, Iraq</span><br><br>The Tigris is approximately 1,800 km (1,150 miles) long, rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey and flowing in a generally southeasterly direction until it joins the Euphrates near Al Qurna in southern Iraq. The two rivers together form the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which empties into the Persian Gulf. The river is joined by many tributaries, including the Diyala and Zab.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Tigr-euph.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Map of the Tigris-Euphrates watershed</span><br><br>Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, stands on the western bank of the Tigris, while the port city of Basra straddles both the Tigris and the Euphrates. In ancient times, many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the river, drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians. Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh, Ctesiphon and Seleucia, while the city of Lagash was irrigated by Tigris water delivered to it via a canal dug around 2400 BC. Saddam Hussein's hometown, Tikrit, is also located on the river and derives its name from it.<br><br>The Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country. It is navigable as far as Baghdad by shallow-draft vessels, but rafts are required for transport upstream to Mosul. River trade declined in importance during the 20th century as the Basra-Baghdad-Mosul railway and roads took over much of the freight traffic.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Tigrisdiyarbakir.jpg/800px-Tigrisdiyarbakir.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Tigrisdiyarbakir.jpg/300px-Tigrisdiyarbakir.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Tigris outside DiyarbakÃ½r in Turkey</span><br><br>The river is heavily dammed in both Iraq and Turkey, in order to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley. Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq, to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following snowmelt in the Turkish mountains around April. Recent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy, both for its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream.<br><br>Issue #281</div>

It is a major producer of grain, particularly barley, so historically this has been sent out by sea. Almost every coastal town has a jetty, which used to be visited by ketches, schooners and later steamships to collect the grain in bags, and deliver fertiliser and other supplies. As the roads have improved, and freight handling techniques have changed from bags to bulk, this became obsolete. A new deep-water port was built near the south eastern tip at Port Giles to export grain in bulk (opened in 1970), and almost all the other ports ceased to be used for freight in the 1950s and 1960s. The only other ports with bulk handling facilities are Wallaroo at the north-western side, and Ardrossan at the top of Gulf Saint Vincent, also used to ship dolomite from a nearby mine for OneSteel.

Construction began at Allanburg on November 30, at a point now marked as such on the west end of Bridge #11 (former Ontario Highway 20). It opened in 1829, running from Port Dalhousie on Lake Ontario south along Twelve Mile Creek to St. Catharines. From there it took a winding route up the Niagara Escarpment through Merritton to Thorold, where it continued south via Allanburg to Port Robinson on the Welland River. Ships went east on the Welland River to Chippawa, the south end of the portage road.<br><br>A southern extension from Port Robinson opened in 1833. This extension followed the Welland River south to Welland, and then split to run south to Port Colborne on Lake Erie. A feeder canal ran southwest from Welland to another point on Lake Erie, just west of Rock Point. With the opening of the extension, the canal stretched 44 km (27 mi) between the two lakes, with 40 wooden locks. The minimum lock size was 33.5 m by 6.7 m (110 ft by 22 ft), with a minimum canal depth of 2.4 m (8 ft).<br><br>In 1839 the government of Upper Canada approved a purchase of canal stock due to financial problems. This buyout was completed in 1841, and work began to deepen the canal and reduce the number of locks to 27, each 45.7 m (150 ft) by 8.1 m (26.5 ft). By 1848 a 2.7 m (9 ft) deep path was available not only through the Welland Canal but also the rest of the way to the Atlantic Ocean via the route of the current St. Lawrence Seaway.<br><br>Competition came in 1854 with the opening of the Erie and Ontario Railway, running parallel to the original portage road. In 1859 the Welland Railway opened, parallel to the canal and with the same endpoints. Along with this competition, boats were being built bigger than the canal could support. In 1887 a new shorter alignment was completed between St. Catharines and Port Dalhousie. The new route had a depth of 4.3 m (14 ft) and 26 stone locks, each 82.3 m (270 ft) by 13.7 m (45 ft). Even so, the canal was still too small for many boats.<br><br>More construction began in 1913 and was not completed until 1932. The route was again changed north of St. Catharines, now running directly north to Port Weller. Only eight locks remained, seven at the Niagara Escarpment and the eighth a control lock at Port Colborne to control the depth of the canal. The depth was now 7.6 m (25 ft), with locks 233.5 m (766 ft) by 24.4 (80 ft).<br><br>In the 1950s, with the building of the St. Lawrence Seaway, a depth of 8.2 m (27 ft) was adopted. From 1967 to 1973, the 13.4 km (8.3 mi) Welland By-Pass opened, providing a new shorter alignment between Port Robinson and Port Colborne and bypassing downtown Welland. All three crossings of the new alignment - one an aqueduct for the Welland River - were built as tunnels. Around the same time, the Thorold Tunnel was built at Thorold and several other bridges were removed.<br><br><strong>Lock operations</strong><br><br>Unlike with previous versions of the canal, ships using the current canal move under their own power during their entire transit of the Welland Canal and its locks. Once a vessel has been securely moored in the lock chamber by a crew of Seaway linehandlers, the huge steel lock gates close behind it and valves are put into operation to fill or empty the lock by gravity flow. About 91 million litres (20 million gallons) of water are required for each lock transit. The time needed to fill a lock is approximately 11 minutes. As the new level is reached, the forward gates are opened and, at a sign from the spotter, a short blast of the ship's whistle signals "cast off" and the vessel proceeds out of the lock.<br><br>Issue #286</div>
