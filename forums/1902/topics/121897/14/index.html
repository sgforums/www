First, the airplane's exhaust increases the amount of moisture in the air, which can push the water content of the air past saturation point. This causes condensation to occur, and the contrail to form.<br><br>Airplane fuel such as petrol/gasoline (piston engines) or paraffin/kerosene (jet engines) consists primarily of hydrocarbons. When the fuel is burned, the carbon combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide; the hydrogen also combines with oxygen to form water, which emerges as superheated steam in the exhaust. For every gallon of fuel burned, approximately one gallon of water is produced, in addition to the water already present as humidity in the air used to burn the fuel. At high altitudes this steam emerges into a freezing environment, (as altitude increases, the atmospheric temperature drops) which lowers the temperature of the steam until each individual droplet freezes into tiny ice crystal. These millions of tiny ice crystals form the contrails. The time the steam/water droplets take to freeze accounts for the contrail forming some way behind the aircraft's engines.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/85/Contrails.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Multiple contrails in an area with high airline traffic.</span><br><br>2. The wings of an airplane cause a drop in air pressure in the vicinity of the wing (this is partly what allows a plane to fly). This drop in air pressure brings with it a drop in temperature, which can cause water to condense out of the air and form a contrail.<br><br>Exhaust contrails tend to be more stable and long-lasting than wing-tip contrails, which are often disrupted by the aircraft's wake and are commonly very short-lived.<br><br><strong>Contrails and climate</strong><br><br>Contrails, by affecting cloud formation, can act as a radiative forcing. Perhaps surprisingly, various studies find that the overall effect is a warming (Ponater et al., GRL, 32 (10): L10706 2005). However, the size of the forcing is not well known: globally (for 1992 air traffic conditions), values range from 3.5 mW/mÂ² to 17 mW/mÂ².<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Contrails_over_Nova_Scotia.jpeg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Contrails_over_Nova_Scotia.jpeg/250px-Contrails_over_Nova_Scotia.jpeg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A satellite photo of Nova Scotia showing numerous contrails of jets travelling between the Eastern Seaboard and Europe.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sept. 11th, 2001 Climate Impact "Experiment"</span><br><br>It had been hypothesized that in regions such as the United States with heavy air traffic, contrails affected the weather, reducing solar heating during the day and radiation of heat during the night by increasing the albedo. The suspension of air travel for three days in the United States after September 11, 2001 provided an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Measurements did in fact show that without contrails the local diurnal temperature range (difference of day and night temperatures) was about 1 degree Celsius higher than immediately before (Travis et al., J. Climate, 17, 1123-1134, 2004); however, it has also been suggested that this was due to unusually clear weather during the period (Kalkstein and Balling Jr., Climate Research, 26, 1-4, 2004).<br><br>Issue #314</div>

He was born in the town of Horsens in Denmark and died at Bering Island, near the Kamchatka Peninsula.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/VitusBering.jpg/150px-VitusBering.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Vitus Jonassen Bering</strong></span><br><br>After a voyage to the East Indies, he joined the Russian Navy in 1703, serving in the Baltic Fleet during the Great Northern War. In 1710Â–1712 he served in the Azov Sea Fleet in Taganrog and took part in the Russo-Turkish War. He married a Russian woman, and in 1715 he made a brief visit to his hometown, never to see it again. A series of explorations of the north coast of Asia, the outcome of a far-reaching plan devised by Peter the Great, led up to Bering's first voyage to Kamchatka. In 1725, under the auspices of the Russian government, he went overland to Okhotsk, crossed to Kamchatka, and built the ship Sviatoi Gavriil (St. Gabriel). Aboard the ship, Bering pushed northward in 1728, until he could no longer observe any extension of the land to the north, or its appearance to the east.<br><br>In the following year he made an abortive search for mainland eastward, rediscovering one of the Diomede Islands (Ratmanov Island) observed earlier by Dezhnev. In the summer of 1730, Bering returned to St. Petersburg. During the long trip through Siberia along the whole Asian continent, he became very ill. Five of his children died during this trip. Bering was subsequently commissioned to a further expedition, and returned to Okhotsk in 1735. He had the local craftsmen Makar Rogachev and Andrey Kozmin build two vessels, Sviatoi Piotr (St. Peter) and Sviatoi Pavel (St. Paul), in which he sailed off and in 1740 established the settlement of Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka. From there, he led an expedition towards North America in 1741. A storm separated the ships, but Bering sighted the southern coast of Alaska, and a landing was made at Kayak Island or in the vicinity. Under the command of Aleksei Chirikov, the second ship discovered the shores of the northwestern America (Aleksander Archipelago of present-day Alaska). These voyages of Bering and Chirikov were a major part of the Russian exploration efforts in the North Pacific known today as the Great Northern Expedition.<br><br>Bering was soon forced by adverse conditions to return, and he discovered some of the Aleutian Islands on his way back. One of the sailors died and was buried on one of these islands, and the group was named after him (as the Shumagin Islands). Bering became too ill to command his ship, which was at last driven to refuge on an uninhabited island in the Commander Islands group (Komandorskiye Ostrova) in the southwest Bering Sea, where Bering himself and 28 men of his company died. This island bears his name. A storm shipwrecked Sv. Piotr, but the only surviving carpenter, S. Starodubtsev, with the help of the crew managed to build a smaller vessel out of the wreckage. The new vessel had a keel length of only 12.2 meters (40 feet) and was also named Sv. Piotr. Out of 77 men aboard Sv. Piotr, only 46 survived the hardships of the expedition which claimed its last victim just one day before coming into home port. Sv. Piotr was in service for 12 years, sailing between Kamchatka and Okhotsk until 1755. Its builder, Starodubtsev, returned home with governmental awards and later built several other seaworthy ships.<br><br>The value of Bering's work was not fully recognized for many years, but Captain Cook was able to prove Bering's accuracy as an observer. Nowadays, the Bering Strait, the Bering Sea, Bering Island, and the Bering Land Bridge bear the explorer's name.<br><br>Issue #320</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Azuchi Castle</strong></span><br><br><strong>Azuchi Castle</strong> was one of the primary castles of Oda Nobunaga. It was built from 1576 to 1579, on the shores of Lake Biwa, in Omi Province. Nobunaga intentionally built it close enough to Kyoto that he could watch over and guard the approaches to the capital, but, being outside the city, his fortress would be immune to the fires and conflicts that occasionally consumed the capital.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/46/Azuchi01.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Azuchi01.jpg/300px-Azuchi01.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Stone steps leading up to the <strong>Azuchi Castle</strong> ruins.</span><br><br>Unlike earlier castles and fortresses, Azuchi was not intended to be solely a military structure, cold, dark, and foreboding. Nobunaga intended it as a lavish mansion, which would impress and intimidate his rivals, not only with its defenses, but with its lavish apartments and decorations, and flourishing town and religious life. The keep, called Tenshukaku, rather than being the center of the castle's defences, was a seven-story building containing audience halls, private chambers, offices, and a treasury, as though it were a royal palace. In addition to being one of the first Japanese castles with a tower keep, Azuchi was unique in that its uppermost story was octagonal. In addition, the facade of Azuchi, unlike the solid white or black of other castles, was colorfully decorated with tigers and dragons.<br><br>There were five main militaristic features of Azuchi Castle that differentiated it from earlier castle designs. Firstly, it was a massive structure, with the walls of the castle ranging from 18 feet to 21 feet in thickness. The second feature of Azuchi Castle is the predominant use of stone. The walls were constructed from huge granite stones fitted carefully together without the use of mortar. A third innovation of the Azuchi Castle was the high central tower, or donjon. The tower allowed for increased visibility for the use of guns against an opposing force. BuilderÂ’s plans for the castle show the donjon to be 138 feet tall, with seven levels. Fourthly, Azuchi Castle had irregularly formed inner citadels. These inner citadels gave defenders ample defensive positions against intruders. The location of Azuchi Castle was also a novel feature. Whereas most Japanese castles found the most advantegous position was at the base of mountain surrounded by dense vegetation (which would allow cover for an enemy), Azuchi Castle was built on a plain to give a wide view of an approaching enemy.<br><br>Nobunaga desired a full castle town, and built well-defended homes for his generals, a JÃ´do-shu Buddhist temple called JÃ´gon-in, and a number of homes for commoners a short distance away on the shore of the lake. However, he had trouble convincing people to move into these homes at first. In the summer of 1577, he issued a municipal charter, guaranteeing residents immunity from taxes, building or transport levies, and moratoria, and forced all travelers on the Nakasendo highway to stop in the town overnight for lodging, thus bringing business to his town's innkeepers. By 1582, the town's inhabitants numbered roughly 5,000.<br><br>In the summer of that same year, just after Nobunaga's death, the castle was attacked by the forces of Akechi Mitsuhide, Nobunaga's betrayer. The castle was set aflame, though some accounts claim this might have been the work of looting townspeople, or of one of Nobunaga's sons.

It lies between the coast of Connecticut to the north and Long Island to the south.

The towns of Orient, Greenport, East Marion, Southold, and Mattituck have smaller populations are located on the extreme eastern tip of the Long Island Sound. They offer great property value as well. On the extreme western end, it is bounded on the north side by Westchester County, New York and the Bronx, and connects to the East River. On its eastern end it is connected to Block Island Sound. The sound is considered by some to be the natural border between New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fe/Wpdms_ev26188_long_island_sound.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Long Island Sound</strong> is shown highlighted in pink between Connecticut (to the north) and Long Island (to the south).</span><br><br>The Sound is 110 miles (177 km) long and 21 miles (34 km) wide at its widest point. It has an average depth of 78 feet (24 m), with the deepest point being 300 feet (90 m). The volume of water in the Sound is 8 trillion US gallons (30 kmÂ³). Including all islands, the Long Island Sound has a shoreline of 548 miles (882 km).<br><br>The first European to record the existence of Long Island Sound was the Dutch navigator Adriaen Block, who entered the sound from the East River in 1614.<br><br>Several major cities are situated along the Long Island Sound, resulting in a total of more than 8 million people living within its watershed. Major Connecticut cities on the Sound include Bridgeport, New London, Stamford, Norwalk, and New Haven. New York cities on the Sound include New York City (the Bronx borough).<br><br>Ferries provide service between Long Island and Connecticut, notably between Port Jefferson, New York and Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Orient Point, New York and New London, Connecticut.

The Atlantic Ocean side remains sandy with no rocks. This is due to the formation of Long Island nearly 10,000 years ago as glaciers formed the fish-shaped island.<br><br>Many attempts have been made to build a bridge over the sound, including a bridge from Rye, New York to Oyster Bay, New York, from New Haven, Connecticut to Shoreham, New York on Long Island and from Orient Point, New York to Rhode Island.<br><br>Long Island Sound has historically had a rich fishery, but in recent years the western part of the sound has become increasingly deficient of marine life. The fishing and lobstering industries have encouraged efforts to identify the cause of the dead water and rectify the problem.<br><br>Major environmental problems currently affecting the Sound include hypoxia, toxic substance and pathogen contamination, debris and other man-made pollution, and overdevelopment.<br><br>Issue #322</div>

The Mani is the central peninsula of the three which extend southwards from the Peloponnese in southern Greece. To the east is the Laconian Gulf, to the west the Messenian Gulf. The peninsula forms a continuation of the Taygetos mountain range, the western spine of the Peloponnese.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/GreeceMani.png"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Mani Peninsula</strong></span><br><br>The terrain is mountainous and inaccessible. The name "Mani" is thought to have originally meant "dry" or "treeless." Until recent years many Mani villages could be reached only by sea. Today a narrow and winding road extends down the west coast from Kalamata to Areopoli, but on the east coast there is no substantial road south of Gytheio.<br><br>Administratively, The Mani is divided between the districts of Laconia and Messenia, in the province of Peloponnesos, but in ancient times it lay entirely within Laconia, the district dominated by Sparta. The Messenian Mani receives somewhat more rainfall than the Laconian, and is consequently more fertile. Messenian Maniot surnames almost uniformly end in -eas, whereas Laconian Maniot ones in -akos.<br><br>Neolithic remains have been found in the many caves along the Mani coasts. Homer refers to a number of towns in the Mani region, and some artifacts from the Mycenean period have been found. The area was occupied by the Dorians in about 1200 BC, and became a dependency of Sparta. When Spartan power was destroyed in the 3rd century, the Mani was self-governing for a time before being absorbed into the Roman Empire in the 2nd century.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Ac.mani.jpg/300px-Ac.mani.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The coastline of the Mani Peninsula</span><br><br>As the power of the Byzantine Empire declined in the 9th century AD, the peninsula drifted out of the Empire's control. The fortress of Maini in the south became the area's centre. Over the subsequent centuries the peninsula was fought over by the Byzantines, the Franks and the Saracens.<br><br>After the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Italian and French knights (known to the Greeks as Franks), occupied parts of the Peloponnese. In 1249 the Mani was occupied by the Venetians, who made it one of the twelve baronies of the Principality of Moreas and built the fortresses of Mystras, Passavas, Gustema (Beaufort) and Megali Maini.<br><br>In 1460 Mystras fell to the Ottomans, but the Mani was not subdued and retained its internal self-government in exchange for an annual tribute. Local chieftains or beys governed Mani on behalf of the Ottomans. As Ottoman power declined, the mountains of the Mani became a stronghold of the kleftes, bandits who also fought against the Ottomans. There is evidence of a sizeable Maniot emigration to Corsica sometime during the Ottoman years.<br><br>The last bey of Mani, Petros Mavromichalis was among the leaders of the Greek War of Independence. He proclaimed the revolution at Areopoli on March 17, 1821. The Maniots contributed greatly to the struggle, but once Greek independence was won they wanted to retain their local autonomy. During the reign of Ioannis Kapodistrias they violently resisted outside interference.<br><br>The Mani's local autonomy was abolished in 1870, and the area gradually became a backwater as the inhabitants abandoned the land through emigration. It was not until the 1970s, when new roads led to the growth of the tourist industry, that the Mani began to regain population and become prosperous. Maniots were known for their obstinate character, conservative views, sometimes extreme frugality, and their zealous safeguarding of the family property.<br><br>Despite the region's aridity, Mani is known for unique culinary products such as glina or syglino (pork or pork sausage smoked with aromatic herbs such as thyme, oregano, mint, etc. and stored in lard along with orange peel), and what is probably the world's best extra-virgin olive oil, soft-pressed from partially ripened olives of the Koroneiki varietal that are organically grown on mountain terraces.<br><br>Today the Mani's coastal villages are full of cafes and souvenir shops. The peninsula attracts visitors for its Byzantine churches, Frankish castles and stunning scenery. Furthermore, the famous towers of Mani are significant tourist attractions. Gytheio, Areopoli, Kardamyli and Stoupa are filled with German and other tourists during the summer months.<br><br>Issue #328</div>

The canal also carries Chicago's treated sewage into the Des Plaines River. Before completion of the canal in 1900, the sewage of Chicago was dumped into Lake Michigan, the city's drinking water supply. The canal is part of the Chicago Wastewater System, operated by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. The system has been named a Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is 30 miles (48 kilometers) long, 202 feet (62 meters) wide, and 24 feet (7.3 meters) deep.

The cityÂ’s water supply also came from the lake, through water intake cribs located offshore. Inevitably, sewage infiltrated the water supply, leading to typhoid fever, cholera and dysentery. A cholera epidemic in 1854 killed more than 5 percent of the cityÂ’s population. Deaths from typhoid fever averaged 65 per 100,000 population a year between 1860 and 1900. The water cribs were moved farther out into the lake, but this effort did not stem the epidemics.<br><br>By 1887, it was decided to reverse the flow of the Chicago River through civil engineering. Engineer Rudolph Hering noted that a ridge about 12 miles from the lake shore divided the Mississippi River drainage system from the Great Lakes drainage system. A plan soon emerged to cut through that ridge and carry waste water away from the lake, through the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers, to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1889, the Illinois General Assembly created the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago (now the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago) to carry out the plan.<br><br>The canal, linking the south branch of the Chicago River to the Des Plaines River at Lockport, was completed in 1900. The rate of flow is controlled by the Lockport Powerhouse, sluice gates at Chicago Harbor and at the O'Brien Lock in the Calumet River, and also by pumps at Wilmette Harbor. Two more canals were later built to add to the system: The North Shore Channel in 1910, and the Calumet Sag Channel in 1922.<br><br>Construction of the Ship and Sanitary Canal was the largest earth-moving operation that had been undertaken in North America up to that time.

Under the influence of the low-intensity, long-term stresses that drive plate tectonic motions, the lithosphere responds essentially as a rigid shell and thus deforms primarily through brittle failure, while the asthenosphere accommodates strain through plastic deformation. Both the crust and upper mantle float on the more plastic asthenosphere. The crust is distinguished from the mantle, and hence the upper mantle, by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the Moho discontinuity. The thickness of the lithosphere varies from around 1.6 km (1 mi) at the mid-ocean ridges to approximately 130 km (80 mi) beneath older oceanic crust. The thickness of the continental lithospheric plates is probably around 150 kilometers (93 mi).<br><br>As the cooling surface layer of the Earth's convection system, the lithosphere thickens over time. It is fragmented into relatively strong pieces, called tectonic plates, which move independently relative to one another. This movement of lithospheric plates is described as plate tectonics.

Other planets such as Mars have a thicker lithosphere than ours with far less (if any) plate movement. A thicker lithosphere can support heavier features such as volcanos. This combined with less plate movement results in volcanos staying over the same hotspot for far longer than they would here, results in volcanos that dwarf in size those on Earth.<br><br>Issue #338</div>
