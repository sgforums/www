General symptoms of poisoning are blistering, dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), hoarseness.<br><br>2) Common names: <strong>Angels' wings</strong><br>Botanical name: <strong><span style="color: green;">Caladium x hortulanum</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://blankees.com/house/plants/image/caladium.jpg"><br><br>Poisonous parts: All parts<br>Toxins: Calcium oxalate<br><br>Notes:<br>Pictured is one of the pink cultivars commonly sold in garden centers. Ingestion can cause severe irritation to the mouth and throat and may also be an irritant to the G.I. tract. Children as well as cats, dogs and other family pets that may nibble on the foliage are all at risk.<br><br>3) Common names: <strong>Kaffir Lily</strong><br>Botanical name: <strong><span style="color: green;">Clivia miniata</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://blankees.com/house/plants/image/kaffirflower.jpg"><br><img src="http://blankees.com/house/plants/image/kaffir_lily.jpg"><br><br>Poisonous parts: Roots<br>Toxins: Lycorine<br><br>Notes:<br>Kaffir lily contains small amounts of the alkaloid lycorine. Large quantities must be ingested to cause symptoms of toxicity. General symptoms of poisoning are collapse, diarrhea, paralysis, salivation, vomiting.<br><br>Kaffir's produce a beautiful cluster of tubular orange flowers with yellow throats. If the flowers are pollinated they each produce a cherry sized, green berry which slowly turns red over many weeks.<br><br>Kaffir's are an easy to care for plant which tolerates typical house hold conditions. Although good lighting is required for bloom, non-blooming plants are still visually interesting. They sucker readily so sharing with friends is easy. No wonder these  blooming plants are so popular!<br><br>4) Common names: <strong>Croton</strong><br>Botanical name: <strong><span style="color: green;">Codiaeum variegatum</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://blankees.com/house/plants/image/croton.jpg"><br><br>Poisonous parts: Bark, roots, latex, leaves<br>Toxins: 5-deoxyingenol<br><br>Notes:<br>This exotic plant is grown for it's colorful foliage.  Chewing the bark and roots is said to cause burning of the mouth. The latex has caused eczema in some gardeners after repeated exposure.<br><br>5)  Common names: <strong>Azalea</strong><br>Botanical name: <strong><span style="color: green;">Rhododendron sp.</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://blankees.com/house/plants/image/azalea.jpg"><br><br>Poisonous parts: All parts<br>Toxins: Andromedotoxins (grayanotoxins)<br><br>Notes:<br>Azalea, a bonsai favorite, is the common name for the dwarf type Rhododendrons. Although a low toxicity plant it is best to keep children and pets away. Treat all Rhododendrons as poisonous.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: olive;"><strong>POISON IVY</strong></span><br><br>If you live in North America and spend any amount of time gardening, golfing, hiking, or working in the woods, there's one poisonous plant you should learn to recognize before all others: poison ivy. Sure, there may be other poisonous plants around, but this is the one we've seen the most.<br><br>The old saying is to beware of any plant with 3 leaves that are shiny... skip the shiny part and beware of any plant with 3 leaves! You may confuse some non-poisonous 3-leafed plants with poison ivy, but there won't be many. Take a close look at the poison ivy photo below and notice how the 3 leaves are grouped around the end of the stem. Learn to scout woodsy areas for this plant.<br><br><img src="http://www.donnan.com/images/PoisonIvy.JPG"><br><br>While it's usually best to look down toward the ground for poison ivy, don't forget to look up as well. Since poison ivy is actually a strong growing vine, it commonly climbs up tree trunks and may appear at eye level or much higher. To be on the safe side, take note of any tree trunks with vines on them. Older poison ivy vines tend to have a "hairy" look to them.<br><br><img src="http://www.donnan.com/images/poisonivy1.JPG"><br><br>Brushing against poison ivy with your shoes or clothing will cause the toxic oil from the plant to rub off on you. The oil remains active for quite sometime and can still give you a serious rash hours later when you take off your shoes or handle your contaminated clothing. As a precaution after you've been outside, it's best to wash exposed skin areas with soap and COLD water. You can also use a commercial cleansing product such as TECNU.<br><br>Never burn poison ivy on a brush fire since inhaling the smoke can cause serious lung problems. Another thing to remember is that just because poison ivy vines look dormant or dead, doesn't mean the oil in the stems and roots can't give you a bad case of skin rash. And finally, even though poison ivy has excellent fall leaf color, it's definitely not a cutting to bring into the house for a fall foliage centerpiece!<br><br><img src="http://www.donnan.com/images/poisonivy2.JPG"><br><br><span class="small">Extracted for educational, non-commercial use from:  <a href="http://www.donnan.com/" rel="nofollow">donnan.com</a></span></div>

In adults usually requires &gt;300 stings<br><br>Untreated Lethality Rate : Except in individuals with severe sensitivity to the venom, lethality rate is almost zero in single or small numbers of stings.<br><br>Local Effects : Local pain &amp; swelling<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Apis_mellifera_bi.jpg/240px-"><br><br><strong>First Aid for Bee Stings (honey bee)</strong><br><br>1. If the stinging apparatus is still present in the skin, as is usually the case for honey bee stings, remove it by gently scraping it out, using a finger nail or similar. Do not try and pull it out by holding the stinger, as this may squeeze more venom into the victim.<br><br>2.  Apply a cold pack to the sting area.<br><br>3.  If the patient develops generalised rash, difficulty breathing or becomes faint or collapses, urgent treatment is required, as this is an acute allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to the venom. If there is any impairment of vital functions, such as problems with respiration, airway, circulation, heart function, these must be supported as a priority. In particular, both airway and respiration may be impaired, requiring urgent and prolonged treatment, which may include the mouth to mask (mouth to mouth) technique of expired air transfer. Seek urgent medical attention.<br><br>4.  If the victim is already known to have an allergy to insect venom (bee or wasp), they are at risk of a major allergic reaction. At the first sign of such a reaction, if available, administer epinephrine (adrenaline, "epipen" ) as instructed on the medication. If the reaction includes airway constriction (asthma) and a "ventolin" puffer is available, use it. Seek urgent medical attention.<br><br>5.  Stings inside the mouth may cause dangerous swelling, even in people who are not allergic to venom, and require urgent medical attention.<br><br>6.  Multiple stings involving several hundred separate stings are potentially able to cause direct toxic effects. Urgent medical treatment should be sought.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1f/Beeswarm1.jpg/180px-Beeswarm1.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A honey bee swarm  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Beeswarm1.jpg" rel="nofollow">click</a> to make your hair stand)</span><br><br><strong>Treatment Summary</strong><br>Most bee stings cause minor short lived local effects, especially pain &amp; swelling. Only local treatment is required. Remove the attached sting, before more venom is pumped in. A local cold pack is often helpful.<br><br>For cases with systemic allergic reactions, treatment is directed to maintaining vital functions. There is no antivenom. Patients sustaining anaphylactic reactions should be advised to avoid further bee stings and to carry emergency treatment (eg adrenaline; EpipenÂ¨) and be shown how to use it.<br><br><strong>Key Diagnostic Features</strong><br>Most reactions; local pain &amp; swelling only, sting &amp; venom gland in situ.<br>Allergic reactions; vary from mild to full anaphylaxis.<br><br><strong>General Approach to Management</strong><br>Only cases with systemic allergic effects or cases with massive multiple stings or intraoral stings need medical input. In these case, admit &amp; observe, treat as appropriate for the type of effect evident.<br><br>Antivenom Therapy : No antivenom available<br></div>

It occurs when dust and smoke particles accumulate in relatively dry air. When weather conditions block the dispersal of smoke and other pollutants they concentrate and form a usually low-hanging shroud that impairs visibility and may become a respiratory health threat. Dense haze caused by industrial pollution is also known as <strong>smog</strong>.<br><br>Sources for haze particles include farming (ploughing in dry weather), traffic, industry, forest fires and peat field fire.<br><br>Seen from afar (e.g. approaching airplane), haze is brownish, while mist is more blueish-grey. While haze is formed in relatively dryish air, in more humid air mist is formed, and the haze particles can even act as condensation nucleii for the mist droplets.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/HazeAmpangKualaLumpur.JPG/300px-HazeAmpangKualaLumpur.JPG"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Severe haze affecting Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in August 2005</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Haze in Southeast Asia</span></strong><br><br>Haze is a regular problem in Southeast Asia caused by land and forest fires in Indonesia, especially Sumatra and Kalimantan. Those fires mainly affect Brunei, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, and occasionally Guam and Saipan. The economic losses of the fires in 1997 have been estimated at US$9.3 billion. This includes damages in agriculture production, destruction of forest lands, health, transportation, tourism, and other economic endeavours. Not included are social, environmental, and psychological problems and long-term health effects. The latest bout of haze to occur in Malaysia, Singapore and the Malacca Straits was in October 2006, and was caused by smoke from fires in Indonesia being blown across the Straits of Malacca due to south-westerly winds.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Downtown_Core%2C_Singapore%2C_Oct_06.JPG/250px-Downtown_Core%2C_Singapore%2C_Oct_06.JPG"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Singapore's Downtown Core on 7 October 2006, when it was affected by forest fires in Sumatra, Indonesia.</span><br><br>As a reaction, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, formed a Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) and established a co-ordination and support unit (CSU). As part of this Action Plan and with the help of Canada, a monitoring and warning system for forest/vegetation fires was developed and implemented called Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). Since September 2003 daily ratings have been issued by the Malaysian Meteorological Service (MMS).<br><br>But to this date, the haze problem persists as Indonesia grapples ineffectively to enforce legal policies on errant farmers.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Pollution index</span></strong><br><br>The severity of haze is often measured using automated optical instruments such as Nephelometers, as haze is associated with visibility and traffic control in ports. Haze however can also be an indication of poor air quality though this is often better reflected using accurate purpose built air indexes such as the American Air Quality Index or the Malaysian API (Air Pollution Index).<br><br>In hazy conditions, it is likely that the index will report the suspended particulate level. The disclosure of the responsible pollutant is mandated in some jurisdictions.<br><br>The American AQI is divided into six color coded categories. Technically AQI runs only from 0 to 500. The 301 to 500 range is categorised as hazardous and colored maroon.<br><br>The Malaysian APIs most hazardous category is above 500. Above 500, a state of emergency is declared in the reporting area. Usually, this means that non essential government services are suspended, and all ports in the affected area closed. There may also be a prohibition on private sector commercial and industrial activities in the reporting area excluding the food sector. So far, the state of emergency ruling due to a hazardous API level applied to the Malaysian towns of Port Klang, Kuala Selangor (2005) and Sarawak state (1997).<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ac/Getty_5_bg_081003.jpg/180px-"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Los Angeles skyline, showing haze.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: brown;">2006 Southeast Asian haze</span></strong></span><br><span class="small">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</span><br><br>The 2006 Southeast Asian haze was caused by continued open uncontrolled burning and slash and burn activities in Indonesia, and has affected several countries in the Southeast Asian region and beyond, such as Malaysia, Singapore, southern Thailand, and as far as Saipan. Local sources of pollution do partly contribute to the increased toxicity, particularly in high-pollution areas such as ports, oil refineries, and dense urban areas. In the highly urbanised and industrialised Klang Valley of Malaysia in particular, the surrounding terrain acts as a natural retainer of polluted air, aggravating the situation when the haze sets in. The Klang Valley area includes the financial hub of Kuala Lumpur, the city of Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam and various other districts and mukims.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Borneo_fires_October_2006.jpg/350px-"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Satellite photograph of the haze above Borneo</span><br><br><strong>Indonesia</strong><br>The fires originate mostly in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, and on Sumatra, where they are set annually by farmers to clear land ahead of the growing season. Satellite images taken over Borneo on October 4 showed 561 "hot spots" indicating areas where fires had been set.<br><br>Officials in neighboring countries accuse Indonesian officials of doing nothing to stop the fires, though forestry ministry officials said they had firefighters working to douse the blazes on state-controlled land. However, they conceded, most of the fires were on private land.<br><br>The fires have closed schools, delayed and cancelled airline flights, disrupted shipping and forced Indonesians to don face masks. Cities affected include Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan and Pekanbaru, Riau. The haze was blamed for a Mandala Airlines flight skidding off the runway upon landing at Balikpapan, East Kalimantan on October 3, when visibility was reported at around 400 meters. It has caused breathing problems for people in the Riau Islands and in Jambi Province.<br><br><strong>Malaysia</strong><br>Menara Kuala Lumpur was barely visible.The effects of the haze started in early July and affected the northern Malaysian states severely. However, the haze had cleared substantially throughout Peninsular Malaysia from August 29, 2006 due to raining season. The rain reduced the number of hotspots throughout Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. On the August 30, 2006, The Star reported that Kuala Lumpur would be free of haze during the Merdeka Day. In the late evening just before midnight on the August 31, 2006, visibility in the Klang Valley was recorded to be very good.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/HazyKlFromPNBDarbyParkHafiz.jpg/250px-"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The business district of Kuala Lumpur in the evening of September 29, 2006. Menara Kuala Lumpur was barely visible.</span><br><br>Unfortunately, the haze returned again in late September. This was due to a change of wind direction towards the south west partially caused by Typhoon Xangsane. The worst hit place was Kuching, where the Air Pollution Index (API) nearly reached 300, which borders the hazardous category of the API. The worst affected area in Peninsular Malaysia is Johor Bahru which recorded an API of 150 on October 7 and October 8. For now, many people are wearing masks to prevent themselves from inhaling excessive amounts of haze. On October 7, visibility in parts of East Malaysia fell to 300 metres. On or about October 9, the worst of the haze seemed to be in the state of Negeri Sembilan, where visibility in Sepang fell briefly to 500 metres and the API in Nilai reached 198. Shortly thereafter changing winds caused conditions to improve rapidly. Sarawak has started cloud seeding attempts to try to encourage rainfall that will help relieve the haze.<br><br><strong>Singapore</strong><br>Singapore was largely spared from the haze, recording PSI at moderate levels until 8 a.m., October 7, 2006, when the 3-hour PSI reading breached the 100 mark and entered unhealthy levels for the first time in the year. At 10 a.m., it hit 130, the highest in three years, before subsiding to 80 at 4 p.m. and climbing rapidly to 150 at 9 p.m, before ending the day at 136, the worst since 1997. The highest 3-hour average PSI ever recorded was 226 in September 1997.<br><br><strong>Thailand</strong><br>In July, the southern Thai provinces of Pattani and Satun suffered an on and off bout of smog, with the levels of pollutants in Satun being high enough to constitute a health hazard.  In all, seven provinces were affected by the haze in July and August.<br><br>Haze was again reported on October 6, with respiratory illnesses and eye irritation reported in Narathiwat. Visibility and air quality were also affected in Songkhla, Satun and Yala. Health warnings were issued and surgical masks were issued to residents. Three days later, meteorological officials reported that the haze had thinned to almost normal visibility.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">NASA MODIS imagery of fires</span></strong><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">Click for bigger image</span></span><br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Borneo_fires_October_2006.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Borneo_fires_October_2006.jpg/120px-Borneo_fires_October_2006.jpg"></a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fires on Borneo, especially Kalimantan, and the haze caused.
