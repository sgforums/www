Most of its prey, such as rabbits and rodents, are quickly killed by its powerful jaws. The venom attacks the nervous system and is strong enough to kill birds and mammals. It has been suggested that the venom of the Gila monster is used more for defense than for feeding.<br><br>The bite is described as extremely painful. Victims may also experience localized swelling, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, weakness, faintness, excessive perspiration, chills, and fever. When bitten, it is important to disengage the lizard as soon as possible. This may be done by placing a strong stick between the bitten part and the back of the lizard's mouth and pushing against the rear of the jaw. If this doesn't work, immersion in water may make it release its hold. The brittle teeth of the Gila monster may remain imbedded in the wound and must be removed by a medical professional.</div>

"It's such an easy risk factor to remove."<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Fries_draining.jpg/212px-Fries_draining.jpg"><br><br><strong>Taste Preferences or Profit Motive? </strong><br><br>McDonald's Corp., which promised in September 2002 to cut trans fat in half, and KFC's parent, Yum! Brands, said the explanation is local taste preferences. But nutrition experts and consumer activists said it is about money: Frying oil high in trans fats costs less.<br><br>The Danish researchers tested products from the chains' outlets in dozens of countries in 2004 and 2005, analyzing McDonald's chicken nuggets, KFC hot wings, and the two chains' fried potatoes. The findings were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.<br><br>At a New York City McDonald's, a large fries-and-chicken-nuggets combo was found to contain 10.2 grams of the trans fat, compared with 0.33 grams in Denmark and about 3 grams in Spain, Russia and the Czech Republic.<br><br>At KFCs in Poland and Hungary, a large hot wings-and-fries order had 19 grams of trans fats or more, versus 5.5 grams for wings and fried potato wedges in New York. But in Germany, Russia, Denmark and Aberdeen, Scotland, the same meal had less than a gram.<br><br>A large order of french fries at a New York City McDonald's contained 30 percent more trans fat than the same order from an Atlanta McDonald's.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/IMGP4604.JPG/180px-IMGP4604.JPG">      <span style="font-style: italic;">Dutch fries with tartar sauce   *slurp*</span><br><br><strong>'More Harmful Than Any Other Kind of Fat' </strong><br><br>Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is cooking oil that has been injected with hydrogen to harden it and give it a longer shelf life. Switching to liquid vegetable oils such as canola, corn, olive or soy eliminates the trans fat, as has been done in Denmark under a 2004 law allowing only a minuscule amount of trans fat in foods.<br><br>Trans fat raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol. Eating just 5 grams of it per day increases the risk of heart disease 25 percent, research shows.<br><br>"Per gram, it is more harmful than any other kind of fat," Stender said. "It's a metabolic poison."<br><br>McDonald's said it "continues to work diligently on ways to reduce" trans fat in its fries. It said most of its oils come from local suppliers, based on consumer preference, and that oil used in the United States is different from that in Europe and elsewhere.<br><br>Stender and other experts said many restaurants use partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to save money because it doesn't spoil and can be used over and over for frying.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Copyright: Buffalo News</span><br><br><a href="http://health.dailynewscentral.com/content/view/2208/63" rel="nofollow">More on Trans Fat</a></div>

A particular strain of this seaweed developed for the aquarium trade was accidentally introduced to the coasts of the Mediterranean, Australia and California.

So it grows unchecked and thick carpets of the seaweed smother native plants and deprive native animals of food.

High levels of nitrogen foment the growth of algae, both toxic and nontoxic.<br><br>"There is evidence that strongly suggests a relationship between aquiculture and harmful algae," Alejandro Buschmann, a marine biologist who did a study for Oceana, told reporters at a news conference.<br><br><img src="http://www.sciencentral.com/news/image_db/2023660/20236608a3sqg.jpg"><br><span class="small">Image: AquaNet</span><br><br>Oceana said the government should not give any more permits out for new salmon farms and should study ways to make the industry safer for the environment, including the nitrogen problem as well as stronger monitoring of the industry for use of internationally banned anti-fungals. "This needs to be taken into account by the government and taken on as a problem for the country," said Oceana's director in Chile, Marcel Claude.<br><br>A spokeswoman for the Salmonchile association that represents the industry said the group was working on a statement about the Oceana assertions, which she said were false.<br><br>The Gulf of Ancud and fjords and inland channels in southern Chile have seen a huge growth in salmon farming in recent years. Salmon is an imported species to Chile, but the country is now the second biggest salmon producer in the world, just behind Norway.<br><br>The salmon are concentrated in huge cages in the sea and fed pellets made from other fish. Buschmann said protein from the unconsumed food and the salmon's fecal matter release a huge amount of nitrogen into the water.<br><br>Chile exported 350,000 tonnes of farmed salmon and trout last year, more than triple the volume 10 years ago. Salmon is Chile's fourth biggest export, and the industry generates 45,000 direct and indirect jobs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: blue;">"There is a huge potential for transfer of disease and parasites in salmon farms as antibiotics, uneaten food pellets, feces and toxic anti-foulants flow out of the nets and contaminate the area," he said. "These coastal communities are in economic trouble and are hanging on by a thread. The potential for trouble is right there, but it's a really prickly area of research because it's highly politically charged. We'll keep working on it and in a few years we should be able to predict the ramifications of this situation."<br><br>- Dr. John Volpe from "Tracking an Alien Species" by Phoebe Dey - Express News</span> </span></div>

Clark</span><br><br>Frogs from both countries secrete toxic chemicals called alkaloids from their skin, which often prove deadly and distasteful to predators. Research over the past several decades has shown that Panama's poisonous hoppers acquire their alkaloids by eating ants, but the poison source for Madagascar frogs remained unknown.<br><br>Now, Academy entomologist Brian Fisher and Cornell chemist Valerie Clark, together with colleagues from the United States and Madagascar, have found that Madagascar's Mantella frogs also acquire their toxins from ants. Like their counterparts in Panama, they have evolved a way to ingest the poisonous ants without harming themselves.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">Brachymyrmex longicornis</span>: Poisonous Brachymyrmex longicornis ants probably acquire their toxins from either poisonous plants or tiny mites.</span><br><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/Plants%20-%20poisonous/calacad3_brachy_lat500w.jpg"><span class="small"><br>Photo: John Longino</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">Anochetus grandidieri</span>: Fisher and Clark found <span style="font-style: italic;">Anochetus grandidieri </span>ants in the stomachs of several Mantella frogs.</span><br><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/Plants%20-%20poisonous/calacad4_CASENT0007734_P500w.jpg"><br><span class="small">Photo: April Nobile, California Academy of Sciences</span><br><br>The ants that supply the poison to the frogs in Panama and Madagascar are not closely related to one another, but they contain many of the same poisonous alkaloids. Thus, even though the frogs in Madagascar and Panama live nearly half a world apart from one another, they share 13 identical poisonous compounds. This, Fisher notes, is a beautiful example of convergent evolution Â– similar evolutionary pressures in two different parts of the world have led unrelated frogs to find and sequester the same poisonous alkaloids in the same way.<br><br><strong>Â© 2006 California Academy of Sciences </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: brown;">What is the difference between venom and poison?</span> </strong><br><br>The terms venom and poison are often used interchangeably. Although both venomous and poisonous animals have potentially dangerous toxins in their bodies, the way that toxin is delivered differs.<br><br><strong>Venom</strong> is injected.  Venomous animals have an active delivery system and may use their toxin for protection or to help them catch food. Unlike poisonous animals, venomous animals store their toxin in venom glands. They inject their toxin into their predator or prey using fangs, pinchers, spines, or any other sharp body part that is hollow, grooved or breaks the skin to introduce venom. Some venomous animals, such as the spitting cobra, can even squirt at an enemy and are accurate up to 10 feet!<br><br><strong>Poison</strong> is eaten or absorbed.  Poisonous animals have a passive delivery system and use their toxin for protection only. They store their toxin in their meat or skin. If someone or something eats the animal, the predator may get sick or even die. When this happens, you can be sure the predator won't make that mistake again! An example of a poisonous animal is a poison dart frog.</div>
