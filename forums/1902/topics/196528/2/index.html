            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">SNAKES</span></span></strong><br><br>There are 15 snake families and the venomous species, with only a few exceptions, belong to two of them: Elapidae and Viperidae.<br><br><img src="http://library.thinkquest.org/C007974/media/2cobra.jpg"><br><br>Cobras, mambas, kraits, coral snakes and sea snakes are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">elapids</span>. They are all venomous snakes and can be found in warmer parts of the world, except Europe and Madagascar.<br><br>The second family, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Viperidae</span>, includes vipers and pit vipers. These again are all venomous snakes that have long, hinged fangs. They live in most parts of the world, except in Australia and Madagascar. The difference between the true vipers and pitvipers is that the pitvipers have an additional sense organ located in front and just below the eyes. These are the so-called heat pits that allow pit vipers to hunt with remarkable accuracy, even in total darkness.<br><br><strong>Venomous Snakes</strong><br>There are three types of venomous snakes: opysthoglyph, proteroglyph and solenoglyph.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opysthoglyphs</span> are mostly harmless or mildly venomous snakes. Their fangs are enlarged rear teeth with a groove that venom flows down while they are swallowing their prey. However, there are snakes of this type that are known to have killed humans before, for example the Boomslang (Dispholidus typus). Another good example of this type is the Mangrove snake (D. dendrophila).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proteroglyphs</span> have small, fixed, non-movable front fangs. When they bite they hang on and chew their prey to envenomate it. Cobras (Naja), mambas (Dendroaspis), kraits (Bungarus), taipans (Oxyuranus), coral snakes (Micrurus) and sea snakes are good examples of this type. They are some of the deadliest snakes in the world.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solenoglyphs</span> have movable front fangs that fold back into the mouth until they are needed. These snakes are very dangerous for they can open their mouths almost 180 degrees with their fangs extended straight out. They can strike at any portion of the body and their attack is much unpredictable. Rattlesnakes (Crotalus), eyelash vipers (Bothriechis), gaboon vipers (Bitis), cottonmouths and copperheads (Agkistrodon) belong to this type.<br><br><strong>Snake Venom</strong><br>Snake venom is modified saliva that is primarily used for hunting (capturing and digesting the prey). Some venom is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hematoxic</span> (affecting the blood). Almost all American pit vipers have hematoxic venom. It destroys tissues and causes great pain, swelling and thinning or thickening of the blood.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neuroxoxic</span> venom attacks the nervous system and causes death as a result of heart failure or suffocation, though the bite may not be painful. Cobras and coral snakes fall under this category.<br><br>Venom may function as hemotoxin, neurotoxin or a combination of both. It is made up of 20 different enzymes but species usually have 6-12 of them.<br><br>The production of venom takes much energy. That is why snakes try to keep their venom supply and use only the amount of venom that is necessary for a particular purpose. If their aim is to kill a big prey, they will not hesitate to inject large quantity of toxins; for a small prey smaller quantity of venom is needed. If a snake is startled and bites in defense, then often the bite is Â“dryÂ”, i.e. contains no venom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ANIMAL DANGERS - SNAKES</strong><br><br>Snakes do not usually attack humans unless they are disturbed or threatened. They will first warn the human by baring their fangs, making hissing noises and getting into a classic S-shape position. A bite from a non-venomous snake looks like a row of teeth bites while the bite from a venomous snake looks like double fang marks. Snakebites will be painful, swollen and numb within 15 minutes. Snake venom may also cause symptoms of muscle aches, blurred vision, drowsiness and spasm of the jaw. Many snakes that bite do not usually inject their venom ("dry bites" ) as they prefer to use it for hunting. Sometimes the snake's tooth may dislodge inside the wound.<br><br>There are several species of snakes in Singapore. The python and boa constrictor kills its prey by constriction and are not venomous. However, they will bite if provoked. The viper and king cobra are venomous snakes.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Snake identification</span><br><br>Garden snake<br>Most garden snakes have pale yellow or orange strip down the spine and a paler stripe low on each side. Some are unstriped or have stripes only on the sides. They may have a spotted or checkered pattern.<br><br>Green snake<br>This is a snake which is commonly seen. It is bright green in colour on top, and whitish below. It has a long tapering tail and can grow up to about 26 inches in length.<br><br>Corn snake<br>A tan to reddish-brown snake with darker reddish-brown patches trimmed with black. It may grow up to 1.5 metres long.<br><br>Python<br>Pythons are large and muscular, and kill their prey by squeezing, or constricting, until it suffocates. Pythons range from 1 to 10 metres in length and weigh up to 140kg.<br><br>Boa Constrictor<br>Boa Constrictors have sharp teeth. They range from 3 to 4 metres in length and weigh up to 130kg.<br><br>Banded Krait<br>Banded kraits are deadly snakes marked with alternate black and pale yellow cross bands throughout the entire length of the body. They are usually found in costal regions such as mangrove forests and can grow up to 2 metres in length.<br><br>Viper<br>Vipers have a triangular head covered with scales and have a pair of long, hollow fangs in the front of the upper jaw. Vipers rest high in the trees during the daytime and are well camouflaged. They tend to be nocturnal.<br><br>King Cobra<br>The king cobra is the world's longest poisonous snake. Its venom is so potent that elephants can die within 3 hours of a bite. King cobras have a small and round head with large scales edged in black. It is thin and yellow-olive or brown in colour. They can grow up to 6 metres in length. King cobras are usually found in rainforests and swamps.<br><br>Coral snakes<br>Coral snakes are brightly-coloured snakes. They often have bands or rings of red, black and yellow or white along their bodies. They are slender and tend to be nocturnal.<br><br>Sea snake<br>Sea snakes have specialized flattened tails for swimming. Sea snakes have no gills and must rise to the surface of the water for air, but they can remain underwater for several hours at a time. They can grow up to 2.7 metres in length.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First aid for snake bites</span><br>Stay calm. Not all snakes are poisonous.<br>Lay the victim flat.<br>Immobilise the bitten limb, using a splint if possible and position it below the level of the heart.<br>Wash the bite site with soap and water.<br>If there is eye irritation, rinse the eye under gently running cool water for at least 15 minutes. Prevent run-off water from entering the unaffected eye.<br>Do not cut and suck out the venom as it can lead to a bacteria infection.<br>Do not apply a tourniquet or ice on the wound as this will reduce blood flow to the affected area.<br>Try to get a description of the snake. This will help the doctor to identify the snake and the correct treatment. Do not try to catch the snake.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- taken from Drug &amp; Poison Information Centre (Singapore)</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ANIMAL DANGERS - WASPS &amp; BEES</strong><br><br>Wasps and bees have stingers that deliver venom and cause pain when injected into the skin. Honeybees sting once and leave a stinger in the wound while wasps and hornets  can sting many times. Most people who are stung by an insect will have redness, itching, swelling, and some pain around the sting site.<br><br>Some people are allergic to insect stings. They may experience rashes, itch, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, puffiness of the eyes, lips, tongue and throat, and difficulty in breathing. Symptoms can begin immediately after the sting or up to 30 minutes later and might last for hours. The patient can die of shock if this response is not reversed within a short time. Non-allergic victims who receive multiple stings can also develop serious complications.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First aid for wasps and bees stings</span><br>Scrape out the stinger with a stiff object like a credit card. Do not touch the stinger or pull it out yourself as this would inject more venom into the wound.<br>Remove any rings and watches before any swelling occurs.<br>Wash the sting site with soap and water.<br>Wrap a few ice cubes in a towel and apply on the area for 10-15 minutes to stop the pain and swelling. To prevent frostbite, do not apply ice directly on the sting area.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">- taken from the Drug &amp; Poison Information Centre (Singapore)</span></div>

The spines of the sea urchins are used to deliver their venom. The sting can cause severe burning pain, swelling, bleeding, itch, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and difficulty breathing. The symptoms may develop immediately and may last up to 6 hours. Deep puncture wounds may be seen after a sting.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stingrays</span><br><img src="http://www.wildsingapore.com/wildshores/vertebrates/fish/rajiformes/narcine/050622cftd4084m3.jpg">     Stingrays are often found buried and feeding in shallow water. Stingrays are not aggressive by nature. People are usually stung when they step on the stingray. The sting causes profuse bleeding, swelling and severe pain that can last for months. Other symptoms that may develop are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating, muscle cramps, and fits.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blue-ringed Octopus</span><br><img src="http://www.didyouknow.cd/animals/graphics/octopus3.jpg"><br><span class="small">The world's most dangerous octopus - the blue rings are visible only when it's about to attack</span>     <span class="small">(Image from didyouknow.cd)</span><br><br>This is a very small octopus found in shallow tropical water and in tide pools.

Prevent run-off water from entering the unaffected eye.<br>* For jellyfish, remove tentacles from the skin with sand, clothing or a towel.<br>* For stingrays, remove any parts of an embedded sting if possible.<br>* For sea urchins, gently pull out any protruding spines. Do not crush the spines.<br>* Soak the affected area into hot (not scalding) water for 30-90 minutes to ease pain. If pain returns later, try the heat soaks again.<br>* Do not apply a tourniquet or ice on the wound as this may cut blood flow to the affected area.<br>* Do not cut and suck out the venom as it can lead to a bacteria infection.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Credits &amp; copyrights: All text taken from the Drug &amp; Poison Information Centre (Singapore); all images taken from Wildsingapore.com unless otherwise stated.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Coca </strong><br><span class="small">Erythroxylon coca </span><br><br>Believe it or not, in the 16th century, there really was a Â“Land of the drug addictsÂ”, located in South America. At that time, the Incas undertook a great expansion and conquered many neighboring native tribes.<br><br>The population was persuaded to work very hard, everybody regardless of gender or age worked all day to receive only a third of the production but there were no rebellions and no discontent. The unconditional obedience of the masses was due to chewing the leaves of coca, which made people the perfect workers Â– they hardly ate or slept but felt satisfied, even happy. However, the narcotic also led to premature aging and a physical and mental breakdown. Then came an agonizing death.<br><br>The plant which caused, and unfortunately still causes, that degradation of personality is a two- to three-meter-high evergreen bush from the wet tropical regions of South America, nowadays also cultivated in subtropical zones and South Asia. It has small shiny spear-shaped leaves and red cherry-fruit. Until 1860, when the alkaloid cocaine was first extracted from the leaves of the plant, people did not know why coca had such a disastrous effect. The substance obtained was a white scentless powder, which particularly affects the sensibility of skin and the sensory organs. This property made it valuable for surgery and two decades later it was already in use.<br><br>Cocaine also stimulates the central nervous system. Therefore, one loses oneÂ’s feelings of fatigue and hunger, the inferiority complex and bad mood; however, oneÂ’s health and will deteriorate. The poisoning is very pleasant at first owing to a momentary euphoria and incapability of perceiving the environment as it is. Soon after that, weakness occurs, the pulse accelerates and becomes irregular. Affected people may have seizures accompanied by breathing- and cardiac disruptions, which may lead to a preventable fatal end.<br><br>There are many derivatives of cocaine such as novocaine and dicaine. Novocaine injections are generally used in a 1-10% saline solution for dental and spinal anesthesia. Unlike cocaine, procaine is non-addictive, yet toxic. Probably, the most toxic one of all derivatives is crack. It has wide application everywhere else but in medicine.<br><br>The extent of mental degradation caused by this insidious poison is much greater than that caused by many others. Its use leads to paranoia, audial hallucinations, extreme aggression and even inclination to suicide.<br>The number of the cocaine- and crack-addicts is getting larger and larger; pregnant women take drugs and bear babies with monstrous abnormalities. Cocaine has been popular since the 16th century and is still a major threat to our generation.<br><br><span class="small">Copyright: 2000 Team C007974, Thinkquest</span></div>

Its content is extremely high when tubers are unripe or green as a result of incorrect storrage but they cannot cause poisoning because solanin decomposes when boiled.<br><br>Only the fruit, blossoms, seeds, sprouts, and sun-greened tubers may be dangerous.<br><br>They can bring about stomachache, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, psychic depression, breathing disruptions, irregular pulse and even coma in the case of high dose intake and lack of therapy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tobacco<br><br>Nicotiana tobacum </strong><br><br>This is probably the most popular poison in the world. Who would have thought?<br><br>Most people think that the American Indians are the ones to blame, but it was Herodotus, in fact, to mention inhaling the smoke of some smoldering grass. NicotineÂ–the most important alkaloid of the plantÂ–has been found in the mummy of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II. Moreover, devices related to smoking have been discovered in those ancient tombs.<br><br>However, the public opinion is that tobacco was imported to Europe in 1558 due to Francesco Fernandez, the doctor of Philippe II, King of Portugal at that time. At first, it grew in palaces because of its aesthetic value but very soon, almost everyone gained access to the cultivated poison, which made many rulers and highly placed officials take preventive measures against already widespread smoking.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">Pope Urban VII excommunicated smokers. </span><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Louis XIII prohibited the use of tobacco.</span><br><span style="color: green;">Smokers in Spain were sentenced to prison and hard labor for life by the church court.  </span><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Jacob I, the king of Britain prohibited smoking and banished the smokers from London. </span><br><span style="color: green;">Michael Romanov, king of Russia, punished smokers in the following manner: offenders caught for the first time were given 60 lashes on their feet; the second time the smoker had his nose or ears cut off and was exiled to Siberia.</span><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Murad IV, a sultan of Turkey, ordered smokers to have their hands cut off. </span><br><span style="color: green;">Tobacco traders in Persia were burnt together with their wares. </span><br><span style="color: darkblue;">In India, the nose or the upper lip of smokers was cut.</span><br><span style="color: green;">Apparently, these measures have been both insufficient and unsuccessful. </span></span><br><br>Tobacco itself is an annual, about 2 m high, and has large leaves and pink blossoms. In 1828, the French pharmacists Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph-Bienaim Caventou extracted the poison, the alkaloid nicotine, which was a colorless oily liquid with a sharp hot taste. About 50 mg of it would be sufficient to kill a non-smoker. Researches show that the temperature of the burning end of a cigarette is 830-880 degrees C, which enriches the smoke with more than 1500 ingredients! They were divided into different groups according to their toxic effects:<br>1. Carbon monoxideÂ–it decreases the oxygen saturation of blood.<br>2. Irritating substancesÂ–they cause cough and wheezing.<br>3. Dangerous carcinogenic substances.<br><br>What then makes people light the next cigarette? At first, nicotine stimulates the brain but shortly, it paralyzes nerve impulses and, as a result, the smoker craves for another cigarette. That is how smoking becomes a habit. The American writer Mark Twain said it was easy to give up smoking and that he had done it a hundred thousand times himself.<br><br>Many plants are poisonous and tobacco happens to be one of them. People smoke it because they easily get addicted to the smoke, gradually killing themselves. Is it the plant to blame?<br><br><span class="small">Copyright: 2000 Team C007974, Thinkquest</span></div>
