They always seem to come back after a few months , as for aphids , try to get a ladybird the red back with black dots type . The ladybird will eat up all the aphids very fast the it will fly away on its own , as ladybird is the natural predator of aphids , and ladybird have a huge appetite for aphids .</div>

It was well after gettting it from the nursery. But leaves started to drop coz of the poor sunlight. Later noticed the white specks crawling. Went into panic mode and found some solution in the home made spray of boiled chilli water and soap. No more white specks. But leaves continued to drop. Maybe the soap was a bit too much<br><br>Later on, the white specks came back. This time, just 'showered' the plant/leaves everyday.<br><br>Yeah, read somewhere aphids and a whole hosts of other insects just love chilli plant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Where do we get ladybugs here in sg?</div>
