              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>PHNOM PENH (AFP) – 
                  Pollution in southeast Asia's <span id="lw_1245320025_0" class="yshortcuts">Mekong River</span> has pushed freshwater dolphins in <span id="lw_1245320025_1" class="yshortcuts">Cambodia</span> and Laos to the brink of extinction, a conservation report said Thursday, sparking a furious government denial.</p>
              <p>The WWF said only 64 to 76 <span id="lw_1245320025_2" class="yshortcuts">Irrawaddy dolphins</span> remain in the Mekong after toxic levels of pesticides, mercury and
                  other pollutants were found in more than 50 calves who have died since
                  2003.</p>
              <p>"These pollutants are widely distributed in the environment and so the
                  source of this pollution may involve several countries through which
                  the Mekong River flows," said WWF veterinary surgeon Verne Dove in a
                  press statement.</p>
              <p>The organisation said it was investigating how environmental
                  contaminants got into the Mekong, which flows through Cambodia, Laos,
                  Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and the southern Chinese province of <span id="lw_1245320025_3" class="yshortcuts">Yunnan</span>.</p>
              <p>However, the Cambodian government official tasked with caring for the
                  country's Irrawaddy dolphins said there remained "about 150 to 160" of
                  them in the Mekong, and alleged the WWF's report used flawed research
                  methodology.</p>
              <p>"It's big trouble -- they (the WWF) should resign. They should leave
                  Cambodia," Touch Seang Tana, chairman of Cambodia's Commission to
                  Conserve Mekong River Dolphins and Develop Eco-tourism, told AFP.</p>
              <p>"They published this without consulting me, and I'm the authority
                  here," he said, adding he did not believe the river contained the
                  pollutants listed in the WWF's report.</p>
              <p>The WWF said it suspected that high levels of mercury found in some dead dolphins came from gold mining activities.</p>
              <p>It added that Irrawaddy dolphins in Cambodia and Laos urgently needed a health programme to counter the <span id="lw_1245320025_4" class="yshortcuts">effects of pollution</span> on their immune systems.</p>
              <p>Inbreeding among the small population could have also contributed to
                  weakened immune systems in the dead young dolphins, all of whom were
                  under two weeks old.</p>
              <p>"The Mekong River dolphins are isolated from other members of their
                  species and they need our help," said WWF Cambodia country director
                  Seng Teak, adding the mammals "can show remarkable resilience" if their
                  habitat is protected.</p>
              <p>The Mekong River Irrawaddy dolphin, which inhabits a 190-kilometre
                  (118-mile) stretch in Cambodia and Laos, has been listed as critically
                  endangered since 2004, the WWF said.</p>
              <p>Thousands of Irrawaddy dolphins once swam in the Mekong. Although
                  regarded as sacred in Cambodia and Laos, their numbers were cut by the
                  use of illegal fishing nets and Cambodia's drawn-out civil conflict, in
                  which dolphin blubber was used to lubricate machine parts and fuel
                  lamps.</p>
              <p>The Cambodian government, however, has been promoting dolphin-watching
                  to attract eco-tourism and cracked down on the use of illegal nets
                  which entangled them.</p>
              <p>It hopes such measures and establishing protected areas will raise their numbers over the next few years.</p>
              <p>The Mekong is one of only five freshwater habitats in the world for the <span id="lw_1245320025_5" class="yshortcuts">Irrawaddy dolphin</span>, and Cambodia is thought to support its largest remaining population.</p>
              <p>With their pale grey skin and blunt beaks, Irrawaddy dolphins resemble
                  porpoises more than their sea-going cousins, and congregate in a
                  handful of the Mekong's natural deep-water pools.</p>
              <p>The river is the world's largest inland fishery, producing some 2.5
                  million tonnes of fish per year valued at more than 2 billion dollars.</p>
              <p>The Mekong also provides 80 percent of the animal protein for 60 million people who live along its lower basin.</p>

              <p>There is no agreement between the sharing of Mekong water sources, unlike the Nile water agreement. There will be holocaustic effect on the lower and middle Mekong if the proposal were to be passed by China. The countries of Mekong are now fighting over this in the UN.</p>
