With landslides still blocking many roads, helicopters are a lifeline for isolated communities, delivering supplies and ferrying badly injured people to hospitals. The United Nations warned on Friday that it will run out of money and be forced to ground helicopters delivering desperately needed relief supplies to quake-hit northern Pakistan unless donors come through with the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to see 2.3 million hungry people through the winter.
