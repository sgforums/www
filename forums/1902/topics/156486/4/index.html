A major earthquake shook cities and villages across the south Asian subcontinent on Saturday, including the Pakistan capital Islamabad where scores of people were feared killed or trapped when two buildings collapsed. Officials said heavy casualties were expected in the north of Pakistan, but details were difficult to obtain because telephone lines were down and mobile networks overwhelmed.
