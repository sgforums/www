Sickness is increasing among Pakistani earthquake survivors, a U.N. official said on Thursday, after the government dramatically increased the death toll from the disaster. The government said on Wednesday the toll had jumped to 73,276 dead from a figure of 57,600 given a day earlier. The sharp rise could be related to concerted efforts to clear debris since the October 8 quake, a top relief official said. REUTERS/Mian Khursheed</div>
