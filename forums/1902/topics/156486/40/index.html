Earthquake survivors had little to celebrate on the Eid al-Fitr holiday at the end of the holy month of Ramadan nearly four weeks after more than 73,000 people were killed in the country's worst disaster. People in predominantly Muslim Pakistan mark the holiday by dressing up in new clothes and visiting family and friends but there was little festivity at a tent camp for homeless survivors in the ruined city of Muzaffarabad.
