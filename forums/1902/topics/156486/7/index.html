Quake-triggered landslide in this mountainside shattered nearly half of Jabla's 296 buildings, including the mosque. In this once remote region, loss of green cover from commercial logging, local felling and overgrazing has exposed rock and soil, making the land less compact and able to retain water, which now rushes easily down mountainsides to set off what some call 'ecological landmines,' the landslides.
