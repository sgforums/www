Pakistan said on Sunday preparations were complete for opening border crossing points with India, but New Delhi said it was ready to open only one of five points to help survivors of last month's quake. The Pakistani proposal to open five points on the old rivals' disputed border in Kashmir appears more of a symbolic gesture of friendship, rather than something that will make a big difference for efforts to bring relief to survivors.
