              <p>s Earth's climate continues to warm, life might become the province of the small, a new study suggests.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1248140851_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Climate change</span> has already had documented effects on species living across the globe, from polar bears in the Arctic to coral reefs<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/warmingworldmaymeansmalleranimals/32774364/SIG=11v173t2i/*http://www.livescience.com/environment/071213-coral-acid.html"></a> in the tropical seas. While some changes are specific to certain types of animals, others seem to be more universal.</p>
              <p>Two such ecological changes that have been noted and predicted are the shift of species' ranges<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/warmingworldmaymeansmalleranimals/32774364/SIG=120tn4a1r/*http://www.livescience.com/environment/080812-birds-north.html"></a> to higher altitudes and latitudes to keep within their temperature
              comfort zones and the shift in the timing of key events in the life
              cycle of organisms - for example, the flowering plants<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/warmingworldmaymeansmalleranimals/32774364/SIG=122945imo/*http://www.livescience.com/environment/071107-seed-dormancy.html"></a> or the migration of birds.</p>
              <p>A third change can now be added to that list: As temperatures rise, organisms get smaller, from the scale of whole communities down to the individual.</p>
              <p>This relationship was known to exist in nature, with warmer
              environments tending to be dominated by smaller-sized species, said
              study leader Martin Daufresne of Cemagref Aix-en-Provence (a French <span id="lw_1248140851_6" class="yshortcuts">governmental research institute</span>).
              But what Daufresne and his colleagues aimed to do with their study was
              "was to test if this known relationship in ecology was working for
              climate change," he said.</p>
              <p>They found that it's working.</p>
              <p>The results of their research are detailed in the July 20 issue of the <span id="lw_1248140851_7" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</span>.</p>
              <p>Shift to the small</p>
              <p>This relationship between warmer
              environments and smaller size works at three different levels in a
              given biological community: "Being small could mean that you are
              belonging to a small-sized species; but it could also mean that you are
              younger, or that you are small for your age," Daufresne explained.</p>
              <p>He and his colleagues used long-term
              surveys to look at these measures for several different aquatic
              communities that encompassed a variety of organisms (including
              bacteria, phytoplankton and fish) living in a variety of environments
              (large rivers, streams and salt water).</p>
              <p>The researchers found that, on average, these communities did in fact get smaller as temperatures rose<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/warmingworldmaymeansmalleranimals/32774364/SIG=12a0b5mba/*http://www.livescience.com/environment/top10_global_warming_results.html"></a> in their environments over time.</p>
              <p>For communities of fish in large French
              rivers, for example, the team observed "a decrease on average of
              something like more than 60 percent of the mean size at the community
              scale," during the span of about two decades, Daufresne told <span id="lw_1248140851_9" class="yshortcuts">LiveScience</span>.
              This decrease was due to a combination of an increase in the proportion
              of small-sized species, an increase in proportion of juveniles, and a
              decrease in size at a given age among individuals within a species.</p>
              <p>What exactly is behind this shift isn't
              clear yet and will require further study, Daufresne said. "Since we
              observe this decrease at the different scales, it's a bit difficult to
              find a common trigger - maybe there are several triggers, or maybe just
              one," he said.</p>
              <p>What is clear though, "is that it's something which seems to happen everywhere," which supports global warming's
              role, Daufresne said. "The fact that we observe this common pattern
              among different systems and among different kinds of organisms means
              that there is a real effect of the global warming on size."</p>
              <p>Sheep and consequences</p>
              <p>More research will be needed to see if this
              same relationship holds for other species and environments,
              particularly land-based creatures and warm-blooded animals. One recent
              study in the journal Science suggests that global warming might be
              causing the same effect in Scottish sheep<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/warmingworldmaymeansmalleranimals/32774364/SIG=12n0ptrgh/*http://www.livescience.com/environment/etc/090703-the-incredible-shrinking-sheep.html"></a>, as the woolly beasts seem to have gotten smaller with milder winters over the last few decades.</p>
              <p>Whether or not these changes are adaptive to the animals undergoing
              them is uncertain and something Daufresne hopes to resolve with further
              research.</p>
              <p>Daufresne and his colleagues also want to
              look into just what the cascading effects of this shrinking might be to
              communities. One potential way the size change could reverberate would
              be through the food chain.</p>
              <p>"The size of the species is related generally to the position within
              the food chain, for example, the bigger you are, the [higher up] you
              are in the food chain," Daufresne said. With sizes shifting to the
              smaller end of the spectrum, "maybe the upper tropic level could be more sensitive to <span id="lw_1248140851_14" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">climate change</span>," which could affect the relationships between predator and prey, he added.</p>
              <p>The effect could also be bigger at higher latitudes where warming is expected to be starker, Daufresne said.<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/livescience/sc_livescience/storytext/warmingworldmaymeansmalleranimals/32774364/SIG=12joroa9f/*http://www.livescience.com/common/media/video/player.php?videoRef=GoldilocksGreen"><br> </a></p>
