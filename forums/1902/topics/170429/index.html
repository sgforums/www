Each house has a floor area of 600 sq feet. The ground floor has a living room, kitchen and a small room, which the Dilimanis use as a storeroom. There are two bedrooms upstairs, which is occupied by two young couples. Â“My wife and I sleep downstairs,Â” says Titus. "It's very comfortable.Â”<br><br>The house is sparsely furnished but the Dilimanis have clearly tried to make their new home appear inviting and cheerful.</div>

"We are afraid," says Titus, "but what can we do? WeÂ’d liked to have moved away but thereÂ’s no other place to go. Land is at such a premium here that we had to stay put."</div>

There is no running water and the Dilimanis, like their neighbours, have to wait for a water-tanker to bring water which is stored on the roof, in special tanks.<br><br>"It is not an ideal situation. We have to wake up really early to fill our tank," says Chalasih. Â“And sometimes itÂ’s not enough and we run out. Since there are so many of us living here, we tend to use a lot of water.Â”</div>

The plans include building a pre-school and a health clinic. There is even a plan to build a recreation hall with a library. Built along the key coastal highway, many think the future of Palana is very bright.<br><br>"I'd say we are the lucky ones," says Titus. "There are many people still homeless and living in transit camps. But we now have a roof over our heads. We thank the Lord everyday."</div>
