              <p>Thursday, July  9 08:31 am</p>
              <p>Reuters - Robert Evans</p>
              <p><strong>Poachers seeking horn for traditional medicines are driving once thriving populations of rhinos in Africa and Asia towards extinction, global nature protection groups said on Thursday.</strong></p>
              <p id="ynw-article-part2">In a report issued in Geneva, they said
              illegal slaughter of the already endangered animals is rising fast,
              with rates hitting a 15-year high amid stepped-up activities by
              Asian-based criminal gangs feeding the demand for horn.</p>
              <p>"Illegal
              rhino horn trade to destinations in Asia is driving the killing, with
              growing evidence of involvement of Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai
              nationals in the illegal procurement and transport of the horn out of
              Africa," the report declared.</p>
              <p>"Rhinos are in a desperate
              situation," said Susan Lieberman of the Swiss-based environmental body
              WWF-International, which issued the report together with the
              International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p>
              <p>The
              report, presented to a meeting of the United Nations- sponsored CITES
              agency which works to prevent trade in endangered species, said South
              Africa and Zimbabwe were seeing a particular surge in poaching.</p>
              <p>While
              between 2000 and 2005 a relatively low total of three rhinos were
              estimated to have been illegally killed each month in Africa out of a
              total population of some 18,000, 12 were now being slaughtered monthly
              in the two countries alone.</p>
              <p>In India,
              10 of the animals had been slaughtered for horn since January and at
              least 7 in Nepal, out of a total population for the two countries of
              just 2,400, the report said.</p>
              <p>In many Asian countries, rhino horn has long been regarded as a vital ingredient in folk cures for many illnesses as well as for male sexual impotency, although medical specialists say it has no healing or potency powers.</p>
              <p>Trade
              in any rhino parts is banned under the international CITES treaty, the
              Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p>
              <p>But
              the WWF's Lieberman said the upsurge marks "the worst rhino poaching
              for many years" and represents a deadly threat to the animals' survival
              around the world.</p>
              <p>It was time for governments "to crack down on
              organised criminal elements responsible for this trade, and to vastly
              increase assistance to (rhino) range countries in their enforcement
              efforts," she added.</p>
              <p>Steve Broad, who heads the TRAFFIC network
              that works with WWF and IUCN in monitoring wildlife trade, said a lack
              of law enforcement and a low level of prosecutions of arrested poachers
              was making the situation worse.</p>
              <p>"Increasingly daring attempts by
              poachers and thieves to obtain the horn is proving to be too much for
              rhinos, and some populations are seriously declining," he declared.</p>

              <p>Another note on the use of rhino horns frequently omitted.</p>
              <p><strong>Daggers</strong></p>
              <p>In a number of the Gulf States, men traditionally wear daggers. 
                                  In Yemen, in particular, the handles of the most expensive 
                                  daggers, called “Djambiyas“, are still made out 
                                  of a carved rhino horn. In contrast to the other materials 
                                  used, such as water buffalo horn and plastic, rhino horn improves 
                                  in luster with age. Thus it is the properties and quality 
                                  of the horn that interest both the makers and the wearers 
                                  of the daggers. Only recently has agate emerged as a high-quality 
                                  substitute for rhino horn dagger handles, although agate handles 
                                  are much more expensive.</p>
