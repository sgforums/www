These are his observations from within the normally secretive state.<br><br>I could travel more or less where I pleased for my work, and even though we always had translators and minders, I was rarely prevented from taking photographs.<br><br>I am under no illusions about the nature of the state. What I saw was how North Koreans live and work.</div>

But they are always empty. Very few people own cars.<br><br>Pedestrians and cyclists zig-zag across them as they are so unused to traffic.<br><br>But even though these roads host few vehicles, they are beautifully tended. Every Sunday, the people who live close by can be seen dusting down the gutter and pruning the shrubs on the road. Some might be visible in the distance here.</div>

Their motto is: 'Dig for victory'. In this case they seem to be digging for sheer survival.</div>

As they are too poor to afford ice skates, these boys have improvised with knife blades stuck onto blocks of wood.
