              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">Thursday, June 18, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #333333;"><br><br>New evidence underscores the theory of 
              human origin that suggests humans most likely share a common ancestor with 
              orangutans, according to research from the University of Pittsburgh and the 
              Buffalo Museum of Science. Reporting in the June 18 edition of the Journal of 
              Biogeography, the researchers reject as "problematic" the popular suggestion, 
              based on DNA analysis, that humans are most closely related to chimpanzees, 
              which they maintain is not supported by fossil evidence. <br><br>Jeffrey H. 
              Schwartz, professor of anthropology in Pitt's School of Arts and Sciences and 
              president of the World Academy of Art and Science, and John Grehan, director of 
              science at the Buffalo Museum, conducted a detailed analysis of the physical 
              features of living and fossil apes that suggested humans, orangutans, and early 
              apes belong to a group separate from chimpanzees and gorillas. They then 
              constructed a scenario for how the human-orangutan common ancestor migrated 
              between Southeast Asia—where modern orangutans are from—and other parts of the 
              world and evolved into now-extinct apes and early humans. The study provides 
              further evidence of the human-orangutan connection that Schwartz first proposed 
              in his book The Red Ape: Orangutans and Human Origins, Revised and Updated 
              (Westview Press, 2005). <br><br>Schwartz and Grehan scrutinized the hundreds of 
              physical characteristics often cited as evidence of evolutionary relationships 
              among humans and other great apes—chimps, gorillas, and orangutans—and selected 
              63 that could be verified as unique within this group (i.e., they do not appear 
              in other primates). Of these features, the analysis found that humans shared 28 
              unique physical characteristics with orangutans, compared to only two features 
              with chimpanzees, seven with gorillas, and seven with all three apes 
              (chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans). Gorillas and chimpanzees shared 11 
              unique characteristics. <br><br>Schwartz and Grehan then examined 56 features 
              uniquely shared among modern humans, fossil hominids—ancestral humans such as 
              Australopithecus—and fossil apes. They found that orangutans shared eight 
              features with early humans and Australopithecus and seven with Australopithecus 
              alone. The occurrence of orangutan features in Australopithecus contradicts the 
              expectation generated by DNA analysis that ancestral humans should have 
              chimpanzee similarities, Schwartz and Grehan write. Chimpanzees and gorillas 
              were found to share only those features found in all great apes. 
              <br><br>Schwartz and Grehan pooled humans, orangutans, and the fossil apes into 
              a new group called "dental hominoids," named for their similarly thick-enameled 
              teeth. They labeled chimpanzees and gorillas as African apes and wrote in 
              Biogeography that although they are a sister group of dental hominoids, "the 
              African apes are not only less closely related to humans than are orangutans, 
              but also less closely related to humans than are many" fossil apes. <br><br>The 
              researchers acknowledge, however, that early human and ape fossils are largely 
              found in Africa, whereas modern orangutans are found in Southeast Asia. To 
              account for the separation, they propose that the last common human-orangutan 
              ancestor migrated between Africa, Europe, and Asia at some point that ended at 
              least 12 million to 13 million years ago. Plant fossils suggest that forests 
              once extended from southern Europe, through Central Asia, and into China prior 
              to the formation of the Himalayas, Schwartz and Grehan write, proposing that the 
              ancestral dental hominoid lived and roamed throughout this vast area; as the 
              Earth's surface and local ecosystems changed, descendant dental hominoids became 
              geographically isolated from one another. <br><br>Schwartz and Grehan compare 
              this theory of ancestral distribution with one designed to accommodate a 
              presumed human-chimpanzee relationship. They write that in the absence of 
              African ape fossils more than 500,000 years old, a series of "complicated and 
              convoluted" scenarios were invented to suggest that African apes had descended 
              from earlier apes that migrated from Africa to Europe. According to these 
              scenarios, European apes then diverged into apes that moved on to Asia and into 
              apes that returned to Africa to later become humans and modern apes. Schwartz 
              and Grehan challenge these theories as incompatible with the morphological and 
              biogeographic evidence. <br><br>Paleoanthropologist Peter Andrews, a past head 
              of Human Origins at the London Natural History Museum and coauthor of The 
              Complete World of Human Evolution (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), said that 
              Schwartz and Grehan provide good evidence to support their theory. Andrews had 
              no part in the research, but is familiar with it. <br><br>"They have good 
              morphological evidence in support of their interpretation, so that it must be 
              taken seriously, and if it reopens the debate between molecular biologists and 
              morphologists, so much the better," Andrews said. "They are going against 
              accepted interpretations of human and ape relationships, and there's no doubt 
              their conclusions will be challenged. But I hope it will be done in a 
              constructive way, for science progresses by asking questions and testing 
              results." <br><br>Schwartz and Grehan contend in the Journal of Biogeography 
              that the clear physical similarities between humans and orangutans have long 
              been overshadowed by molecular analyses that link humans to chimpanzees, but 
              that those molecular comparisons are often flawed: There is no theory holding 
              that molecular similarity necessarily implies an evolutionary relationship; 
              molecular studies often exclude orangutans and focus on a limited selection of 
              primates without an adequate "outgroup" for comparison; and molecular data that 
              contradict the idea that genetic similarity denotes relation are often 
              dismissed. <br><br>"They criticize molecular data where criticism is due," said 
              Malte Ebach, a researcher at Arizona State University's International Institute 
              for Species Exploration who also was not involved in the project but is familiar 
              with it. <br><br>"Palaeoanthropology is based solely on morphology, and there is 
              no scientific justification to favor DNA over morphological data. Yet the 
              human-chimp relationship, generated by molecular data, has been accepted without 
              any scrutiny. Grehan and Schwartz are not just suggesting an orangutan–human 
              relationship—they're reaffirming an established scientific practice of 
              questioning data." <br><br>### <br><br>University of Pittsburgh</span></p>
