We have gotten this question: Â“I have seen both the sun and moon during a day. How does this happen?Â” The moon orbits around Earth once a month. Once each month, it comes nearly in between the Earth and sun . . . and at such times the moon rises with the sun and travels across the sky all day long. As it moves in its orbit, the moon gets farther from the sun on our sky's dome. It moves toward the east in our sky by about 12 degrees (about the width of your fist held at arm's length) each day. After two weeks, the moon is about 180 degrees from the sun. Then itÂ’s on the exact opposite side of the sky's dome from the sun. When the sun goes down in the west, the full moon rises in the east. Now weÂ’re a couple of days past full moon. The moon -- still moving eastward -- has moved more than 180 degrees opposite the sun . . . now itÂ’s beginning to move closer to the sun again on the skyÂ’s dome. At that time youÂ’ll see the moon higher in the west each morning for the next several days.</div>

The Big Dipper is an "asterism" . . . or noticeable pattern of stars . . .within the constellation Ursa Major the Greater Bear. The Big Dipper can be used to find Polaris, the North Star. Simply look in the sky, and draw an imaginary line between the two outermost stars in the Dipper's Bowl. This line points to Polaris. Keep that line going . . . and you will come to another famous constellation Cassiopeia. The Queen is very recognizable for having the shape of the letter "M" or "W," depending on what time of year and what time of night you see it. At this time of year, the Big Dipper is in the northeast in late evening, and Cassiopeia is in the northwest. These two constellations are "circumpolar" -- as seen from northerly latitudes, they never set. They circle endlessly around the North Star, are always opposite each other. In other words, when the Dipper is at about 4 o'clock -- as it appears on today's chart -- then Cassiopeia must be at about 10 o'clock -- using the North Star as the clock's middle.</div>

In the lore of the sky, Cassiopeia was a very vain queen of Ethiopia, mother to the lovely princess Andromeda. She claimed to be more beautiful than the Nereids, or sea nymphs. And so the gods placed her in the heavens so that she'd be upside-down for part of every night and part of every year. Tonight, if you look, the stars of Cassiopeia will be oriented in such a way that the Queen is upside-down. The stars of the queen are quite luminous -- its stars Schedar, Caph, and Gamma Cass all have approximately mid-second magnitudes. The star Ruchbach is close in brightness to them, with a magnitude of about 2.68. Segin trails the other stars in brightness with a third magnitude rating. Also be sure to sweep in this area with binoculars if you have access to a clear, dark, country sky. You'll see many hazy patches in this region, which are often open star clusters in our own Milky Way galaxy. A particularly easy one is M52, marked on today's chart. M52 looks like a hazy clump, but it's actually a cluster of some 200 stars, spanning about 15 light-years. This cluster lies an estimated 5,000 light-years away.</div>

You can see the fiery red star Aldebaran to the lower right of the now waxing gibbous moon. This star is part of a V-shaped grouping of stars that represent the face of the constellation Taurus the Bull. Aldebaran -- known as the fiery "eye of the Bull" -- is a giant star, some 45 times bigger in diameter than our sun. In other words, if Aldebaran replaced our sun in the solar system, its outer layers would extend halfway to the orbit of the innermost planet in our sun's family, Mercury. Another fiery red object is up in the south at this time-- the planet Mars.</div>

You can find it in the south-southeastern horizon to the lower left of the planet Mars. To the eye, the Hyades appears to be shaped like the letter V (you'd see many more stars if you looked through binoculars or a telescope). On the sky's dome, this V represents the face of Taurus the Bull. In the lore of the sky, the Hyades are half-sisters to another cluster of stars -- the dipper-shaped Pleiades star cluster. The reddish star Aldebaran appears to be a part of the V-shaped Hyades cluster. However, at about 60 light-years away, Aldebaran is only about half the distance to the Hyades star cluster in space -- and not so not a true part of the cluster.</div>

It reaches what is called its "inferior conjunction." That is when an interior planet (Mercury or Venus) passes between the Earth and the sun. It is rare to see an inferior conjunction because the sun is usually too bright and thus drowns out our view of the planet (the June 2004 transit of Venus being a notable exception.) Today's inferior conjunction is no exception. Thus, today's chart is not meant for viewing (please don't ever look directly at the sun!) It is meant for visualization purposes only.</div>

About a week from now when the moon is smaller and less present in early morning skies, will be a great opportunity to look for random meteors. We get lots of questions about where and when to catch meteor showers. To everyone who longs to see a Â“shooting starÂ” or meteor streaking across a clear night sky . . . itÂ’s possible to see a meteor any night of the year. Just recently on a holiday trip to Timberon, New Mexico, I spotted a minimum of 3-4 meteors each night just randomly gazing up in the sky. There are dozens of minor meteor showers, and also Â“randomÂ” meteors appearing in our skies that arenÂ’t associated with any shower. But, not all of us have the chance to be in a dark mountain or country area -- and so itÂ’s true that youÂ’ll have the best chance to see meteors on nights when a major meteor shower reaches its peak. You can always check <a href="http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/meteors/article_588_1.asp" rel="nofollow">Sky &amp; Telescope magazineÂ’s great web site</a> or <a href="http://comets.amsmeteors.org/" rel="nofollow">Gary KronkÂ’s page</a> to learn about upcoming meteor showers. The next best time to watch for meteors would be in mid-late April, when the Lyrid meteor shower will be in full swing (though a waning gibbous moon may drown out any spectacular views). One further tip -- youÂ’ll see more meteors after midnight than before, when EarthÂ’s spin will place you on the forward side of the planet with respect to our orbit around the sun.</div>

Above Sirius is one of the most easily recognizable and beautiful of constellations -- the constellation Orion -- easily spottable by its famous Â“BeltÂ” of three bright stars. Towards the upper left of Orion is the bright star Capella of the constellation Auriga the Charioteer. To the upper right of Orion are two bright red lights -- the star Aldebaran and the planet Mars (which has noticeably waned in brilliance since last November.) Sandwiched between the two red lights is the Pleaides star cluster, known for its striking dipper-like appearance.<br></div>

A small telescope shows about 50 stars here, but astronomers know that the Beehive actually contains some 400 stars.

ItÂ’s the brightest star visible from any part of Earth. A couple of months ago, Sirius was below our horizon. Now this star is relatively low in the southeast when night begins. And when we look at objects low in the sky, we see them through a greater thickness of EarthÂ’s atmosphere than when they are overhead. The flashing colors of Sirius now come from the refraction (or splitting) of starlight as it travels through Earth's atmosphere. All the stars have their light split in this way by our atmosphere. But the colors are more noticeable with Sirius, because it's such a bright star!</div>

Lots of people wonder whether the phases of the moon affect earthly weather, but thereÂ’s no evidence that they do. Still, thereÂ’s an astronomical reason why it might be colder outside for you this month than it was last month, even though last month had the December solstice and the least daylight of the year. The reason has nothing to do with the moon and everything to do with the Earth under your feet. ItÂ’s always coldest some weeks after the shortest day because the land beneath our feet canÂ’t change its temperature instantaneously. The whole hemisphere in which we live (both land and oceans) takes some time to lose heat after the time of least daylight. So the coldest weather of the year generally follows the time of least daylight by a month or so. This is called Â“the lag of the seasons.Â”</div>

The further south you are located on the globe, the better your chances of seeing Venus right now, though all locales would benefit from an unobstructed eastern view of the sky. If you happen to own a telescope or a pair of binoculars, you may be surprised to find that Venus takes the shape of a slim crescent on closer view -- about 6% illuminated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to tell a planet from a star<br><br>Thursday, January 26, 2006<br><br>Looking East-Southeast in Early Evening<br><br><img src="http://www.earthsky.org/skywatching/charts/20060126_1.gif"><br><br>Today's chart shows a view of the east-southeast in early evening, where the famous constellation Orion the Hunter resides with a smattering of bright stars and the planets Saturn and Mars. We get lots of questions about how to tell the difference between stars and planets. We might take a few tips from our ancient astronomers. When they looked into the skies, they noticed that most bright objects in the sky travel in fixed positions with relation to each other, while a few bright objects didn't seem to follow this pattern. They took the "fixed objects" and grouped them into constellations, whose movements were so regular and reliable that these groupings helped them find their way on the ocean, on land, and even helped them predict annual events like floods and harvests. If you were to look at the sky night after night, you'd notice the same thing. Stars will appear in fixed positions; think about how constellations retain their familiar shapes but still move across our sky. Planets, on the other hand, move in much more complex paths with respect to stars -- sometimes even appearing to move backwards in our sky, in an event known as retrograde. So, it'll take a little practice -- and some patience -- but if you can track the movement of objects in the sky for several nights in a row, you will be able to tell which are stars and planets by the movements that they make relative to each other in the sky. Another way of telling planets apart from stars is that stars appear to twinkle in the sky, and planets generally do not.</div>

Tonight there is a bright golden object ascending in the east shortly after the sun sets. This is the famous planet of the rings, Saturn. Today Earth passes between Saturn and the sun. Thus the sun is now opposite Saturn as seen from Earth. Astronomers call this an "opposition" of Saturn. Although Saturn is the faintest of the planets visible to the eye, and although this part of the sky has many bright stars, today's chart will help you spot it. Your best bet is to identify the twin luminary stars Castor and Pollux of the constellation Gemini. Due to the closeness of these two bright stars to each other, they should be fairly easy to spot in the night sky.</div>

Even at its dimmest, it easily outshines any other star or planet in the night sky. And sharp-sighted people can see Venus against the early morning light of sunrise in the southeast every morning for the next couple of weeks. As time moves on, and Venus rises earlier each morning, people will soon be wondering about the bright Â“morning starÂ” up in the east. But youÂ’ll know that that Â“starÂ” is actually our neighbor planet Venus!</div>

The image shows up fairly well on a computer screen -- but it won't show up at all in the real sky -- and you shouldn't ever look toward the sun without a protective filter. Today's chart is purely an illustration of the fact that the moon is new tomorrow. That means it's passing more or less between the Earth and sun as these bodies move in space. Thus, although the moon is near the sun in the sky, you won't see the moon anywhere in it. There are two reasons why. First, the moon's lighted face -- its "day side" -- is turned entirely away from us at this point. Also, the moon is hidden in the sun's glare. As the moon moves eastward in orbit around Earth, it'll edge slowly away from the sun on our sky's dome. When might you next glimpse the moon in the night sky? You might see it in the southwest after sunset tomorrow, but it'll be tough. In a couple of days from now, it'll be easier to see the moon as it'll be higher in the southwest at sunset, and its crescent shape will be a bit plumper.</div>

It's the sixth brightest star in the sky, and it's located just to the left of an other identifiable object -- the Pleiades, or Seven Sisters -- a misty-looking star cluster in the shape of a tiny dipper. Capella is the most northern of all the bright stars. Tonight, it looks like any ordinary bright star. However, when it appears lower in the horizon, it can appear as a multi-colored shining star. Its colorful appearance when seen low in the sky isn't unusual. Any bright star can appear to flash different colors when near the horizon -- because then you're looking at the star through a greater thickness of Earth's atmosphere than when the same star is overhead. In fact, it would be hard to overlook the current brightly flashing star low in the horizon in this area -- the dogstar Sirius.</div>

You will probably notice golden colored Saturn in this area first. Cancer is the faintest of the 12 constellations of the zodiac. You won't see much of this constellation with the eye alone, but some people describe Cancer's shape as resembling the spokes of a wheel. You can aim your binoculars in this direction, just next to Saturn to see one of the sky's hidden treasures. It's a cluster of stars called M44, otherwise known as Praesepe or the Beehive, and it's right in the middle of the Crab. As usual, the darker your night sky, and the farther you are from city lights, the better the view.</div>

These stars represent the Belt of Orion the Hunter. Also, notice the star Sirius nearby. On old sky maps, the mighty Hunter of the ancient myths is seen poised with an upraised club and shield, as though fending off the raging Bull, Taurus. Meanwhile, two meek animals seem to cower at the Hunter's feet. Lepus the Hare was described by Roman stargazers as being "swift," "light-footed,<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>" and "eared." Columba the Dove can be found to the south of the Hare. This little constellation is sometimes ignored in books about the sky, probably because it is so far south as seen from the U.S. Richard Hinckley Allen, in his classic book, Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, wrote that Columba was first seen in constellation drawings in 1603. But, he said, there are hints in early writings that stargazers knew the name Columba, and identified a Dove here, as much as 17 centuries ago.</div>
