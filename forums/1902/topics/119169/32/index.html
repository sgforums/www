You haven't been watching your spending habits and you may have been neglecting your duties.<br>Don't be too quick to judge others. Don't expect support from your mate.

Don't hold back.<br>Losses could occur if you haven't been careful when dealing with joint financial ventures. You have the stamina and determination to succeed.

Take time to look at any outdated papers or possible investments. You can't win and they won't listen.<br>Consider applying for a job in another part of the world. Difficulties will result if you have to deal with controversial groups today. Your disciplined attention to jobs will enhance your position.<br>The last thing youÂ’ll want is a boring start to the weekend, but unfortunately the minor constraints on your cash-flow suggest that youÂ’ll need to find less expensive forms of entertainment today.

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>If you keep busy you won't feel the personal pressures you are going through. Jealous colleagues may try to undermine you. Your love will not be willing to listen to your criticism.<br>You may find your self a bit frazzled if you allow someone to goad you into an unsavory debate. Social activities or travel should be in your plans. You may be angry if someone tries to take credit for something you did.<br>While you have everything going for you today your sense of judgment wonÂ’t be at its strongest, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. The fiery influence of Mars could make you a little impervious to the needs of others, which might make a communication blunder almost inevitable.</div>
