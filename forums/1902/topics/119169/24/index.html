A romantic dinner, followed by a quiet evening with the one who is enticing you, should be most satisfying.<br>You need to put some trust in others. If you can get away for a vacation, do so. Use your head and do things to your liking.<br>On the positive side someone, possibly a fellow water sign, will be on hand to provide support and reassurance while work or school and certain friends pull you in different directions with their expectations! Things will ease a little by tomorrow, but in the meantime just ride it out!</div>
