Visit friends you don't get to see that often. You should sit down with someone you trust and work out a budget that will enable you to save a little extra.<br>You will be your usual charming self and the partners you attract may be the adventurous type. Work quietly on your own. Sudden romantic infatuations could lead to a significant and prosperous connection. You'll be feeling a little restless today. Make some changes to your surroundings.
