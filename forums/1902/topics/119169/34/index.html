Any intimate relationships with colleagues will lead to gossip that could easily affect your position.<br>Do not get into uncertain financial deals. Your partner may make you feel jealous and unloved. Having your own business is a good idea.<br>This could be a tough day for you as there are two significant and challenging aspects to your ruling planet the moon.
