            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Don't hold back. You are best to avoid such unsavory circumstances, especially if you're in a group situation. You will have a blowup today if your partner does things that you feel are not aboveboard.<br>Your emotional reaction will be dependent upon your partner's responsiveness. Don't take your frustrations out on the ones you love. You may be tired of working for someone else.<br>It is likely to be an intense day for you too with the Saturn/Venus changes. Money should certainly improve, but you are likely to feel that little bit more restless with the world if you feel you canÂ’t delve into the deeper things in life a little, so try taking on a new interest that lets you explore the world more.</div>

Your ability to deal with humanitarian groups will enhance your reputation. Exercise your talents and present your ideas to groups you think you can contribute to.<br>A little overtime may help you reduce the workload. Health problems may prevail if you haven't been getting enough rest. Unexpected changes in friendships could occur.<br>The fire sun and the water moon are likely to affect you today, especially in terms of communications. ItÂ’s possible that youÂ’ll be torn between the demands of work or school, and your own needs, but if you hang in there your mood will shift when the moon moves into Leo, and youÂ’ll feel much happier.</div>

Sign up for seminars that will expand your business awareness.<br>With an excellent aspect from Pluto youÂ’ll find that you have the opportunity to do something rather out of the ordinary today, which, given your restless mood, will be a welcome break from the routine. Activities that bring you closer to water will appeal: from ice-skating to kayaking you should embrace your adventurous side.</div>

You may want to take a look at your direction in life.<br>Thanks to the moon in Virgo you are likely to be feeling a little frustrated today, especially when it comes to being able to express yourself.
