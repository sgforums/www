Advancement can be yours if you are assertive in your approach.<br>Don't let children hold you back from doing things you enjoy. Get busy on those home improvement projects that you've been procrastinating about. Involvement in financial schemes will be followed by losses.<br>Sometimes you can look back on the events of the day and wonder why you said something, and today will be one of those days where you just canÂ’t help putting your foot right in it in a noble attempt to do the right thing!

You could experience unusual circumstances and meet eccentric individuals. Don't be too quick to respond to a plea for help.<br>Your interests could lead you down avenues you never realized existed. Get involved in groups that can offer intellectual stimulation. You have a lot to offer.<br>Today is definitely a day for pampering yourself as the demands of the day could become just a little too much for you. Give yourself something to look forward to: plan an evening of a scented bath, followed by a massage, and donÂ’t forget the all important candles and music.</div>

Your childlike quality may get you into big trouble today if you neglect your responsibilities. Social events held in your home will be successful and entertaining for all.<br>You will easily blow situations out of proportion. Sign up for seminars that will expand your business awareness. Take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves.<br>If you feel the need to spread your wings a little blame it on Venus, which will move into Virgo today. This could either make you feel in the mood to explore other places, or it could make you feel as though your wings have been clipped! Just donÂ’t let yourself get into a rut for the next few weeks!</div>

Do not get upset about situations you cannot change. Don't let domestic problems interfere with your objectives.<br>Sit back. Passion is inevitable and commitments can be made during the heat of the night. Put aside any decisions concerning your position at work.<br>The sense of dissatisfaction that you may have experienced yesterday is likely to get an even tighter grip today, as an aimless mood takes hold. The planets arenÂ’t being particularly kind to anyone, but in your case a much needed mood boost will be easily achieved by a grueling session in the gym!</div>

You should socialize with clients or upper echelons of your industry if possible.<br>Family life is likely to take the focus today and for the next few weeks, thanks to Mars moving into Libra. Generally family relationships will improve massively and home life will become very relaxed. However, for today there are a few gripes that need to be settled with a family member!</div>

A welcome boost to your finances indicates that today will be a great day for hitting the mall, and because itÂ’s Saturday why not make a day of it?

Rely on the one you love for support and affection.<br>Don't go hog wild when it comes to entertainment or you could find yourself short of funds at the end of the month. You may be emotionally unstable if you let someone you care about get away with verbal abuse. Try not to allow your partner to lead you astray or upset your routine.<br>YouÂ’re likely to have quite an emotional day and youÂ’ll be more tempted to rely on other people for comfort and support rather than believing in yourself and striking out on your own. But by tackling any money worries by yourself, which will be temporary, youÂ’ll actually empower yourself!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You may be frazzled today. You can take advantage of opportunities if you are quick to make a move. If you have to deal with large institutions, be careful not to make waves.<br>You can make changes to your living quarters, but not everyone will be pleased with your efforts. Organize all the responsibilities that have to be attended to and make sure everyone knows what to do. Your ability to talk circles around your colleagues will help you forge ahead in the workforce.<br>ThereÂ’s likely to be times when you try too hard to please everyone around you today, especially close friends or family members. A reluctance to put your foot down is primarily thanks to the sun moving into Libra. If you feel youÂ’re being treated unfairly youÂ’ll need to say so!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Your boss may not be in the best of moods today. You'll have great insight. Rest and relaxation may be required; minor health problems will prevail if you don't watch your diet.<br>You're in a high cycle for romance. You will need to work diligently in order to accomplish even the smallest amount. Friends or groups that you're affiliated with may want you to contribute more cash than you can really afford.<br>Things should settle down nicely today, and any tensions from yesterday will melt away. The planets indicate a welcome boost to your finances, and although youÂ’d feel happy hoarding your gains youÂ’d feel happier still by treating yourself to something nice!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Try to enlist the help of those you trust in order to fulfill the demands being made of you. You'll find it easy to upgrade your environment by redecorating or changing your residence. Help if you can, but more than likely it will be sufficient just to listen.<br>Find ways to make extra cash. Start making things or reusing rather than buying ready made. Deception is evident around you. You may have a problem with coworkers if you try to tell them what to do.<br>If you find that youÂ’re in need of some adventure or excitement (and the great outdoors wonÂ’t really appeal today) then consider doing something that gets the old grey matter working. The planets suggest that you should concentrate on your more artistic talents today</div>
