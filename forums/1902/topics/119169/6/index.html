            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Think before you act if you wish to avoid friction. Don't go out of your way, and don't let these unexpected guests cost you money. Delve a little deeper if you really want to know the score.<br>Secret affairs will eventually backfire on you. Exhaustion will lead to minor injury if you don't know when to quit. You'll be excited about a promising business opportunity, but this is not a good day to push your luck.<br>Don't get ahead of yourself. If you assume something is going to happen, it probably won't. Concentrate on doing something creative and avoid any situation that may lead to a disagreement.<br></div>
