            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You need to keep everyone on your domestic scene too busy to complain. Don't go overboard; start small and work toward building it up slowly. You will gain knowledge through your adventure.<br>Your questions will help you ferret out secret information. Travel opportunities must be taken advantage of. Much knowledge can be obtained through the experiences you have.<br>YouÂ’ll need to rein in those desires to be a little wild and unruly today, Cancer, or youÂ’ll get nothing done. Not only will the influence of Jupiter will hold you back, but you will still have to watch you cash flow carefully.

Take time to deal with legal documents and the affairs of people who you may be indebted to.<br>You must be extremely careful not to let relatives or friends interfere in your personal life. Talk to your emotional partner about your intentions. Talk to an older, established individual about your present situation.<br>With the moon moving into Pisces, which is a water sign like Cancer you are likely to be feeling mega-sensitive today. This you can tackle in two ways: firstly avoid heavy or serious discussions for today, and secondly rent a couple of ultra weepie movies, which will help you release all those pent up emotions!</div>
