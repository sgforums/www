Deception may cause disputes you can do without.<br>Your versatile mind and common sense will allow you to come up with various solutions. Don't hesitate to sign up for creative courses or physical fitness programs. Relatives may play an important role in your social activities.<br>If you find that youÂ’re feeling a little twitchy today it could be that something is in need of a re-vamp, whether thatÂ’s your bedroom or the whole house. But before you consider a trip to the mall make sure that you plan any changes realistically, because you could take on way too much!</div>

Groups and organizations that indulge in social events to raise money will be conducive to meeting new and exciting lovers.<br>The moon shifts from Aries to Taurus today, but a wonderful aspect between the moon and the sun guarantees you one of those easy going days where youÂ’ll be able to kick back and chill.

ItÂ’s out with the old to make room for the new, which will make you feel much happier in the process!</div>

Need some adventure in your life? Exotic destinations beckon you.<br>A surge of water energy could make you feel that little bit more emotional today and you could overreact to something that you regard as an invasion of your space or your time. If you donÂ’t feel like too much company today be clear to your friends, and theyÂ’ll give you the space you need.</div>

Chances are you split up the last time because you didn't really want to make a commitment.<br>Like Taurus youÂ’re probably going to enjoy a boost in your finances; unlike Taurus youÂ’ll be in too much of a flaky mood to enjoy it!

Don't give up what you have until you can be certain just what it is you're getting.<br>Cutbacks at work will be a cause for worry. You're in the mood to do things such as competitive sports, or perhaps a night on the town. Be careful when dealing with investments.<br>A new moon heralds a new leisure activity for you, one that fires your interest and sharpens your mental faculties, but donÂ’t let it distract you from other aspects of your life. In addition, another more immediate distraction, in the form of something from the past, will resurface today, which youÂ’ll need to deal with efficiently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Exaggeration or deception coupled with overindulgence might be a problem. Concern yourself with legal matters and formulating contracts rather than finalizing your objectives. Your high energy must be directed into productive goals, or frustrations will occur.<br>In-laws or relatives may oppose your personal intentions. Delve into your work if you can't make amends at home. Any financial limitations will probably have to be dealt with on your own.<br>With the moon moving into your sign you can expect a rather wonderful day today, thanks to a trio of glowing aspects, and to a harmonious influence from the sun. However, if something from the recent past is still preying on your mind, today is the day to put it to rest once and for all.</div>
