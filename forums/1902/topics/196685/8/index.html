Go and visit your parents: This will give them great pleasure. You'll be working relentlessly in order to achieve the ambitions that you feel are now within your reach; you'll be favored by fortune. You'll have to cope with staunch adversaries, but it's you who'll triumph.</div>

Surrounded by those of whom you're fond of, you'll enjoy harmony and gaiety. You'll be easily on edge. At work, you'll start seeing the positive results of your past efforts. Beware of your current tendency to take your dreams for reality, as that could lead to irresponsibility and dilettantism, hence to failures.</div>

You'll be the object of some indelicate intrigues from one of your friends; but if you remain coolheaded, you'll get through this ordeal without any real problems; get rid of friends who don't deserve this name. You're likely to be inconstant in your efforts, with a clear tendency to take useless risks; try to dominate your impulsiveness. Above all, don't take financial risks, particularly for friends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>21 Oct 06<br>It's probable that your need of money will become very worrisome; what's essential will be to hold until the wheel turns, and it will turn in your favor almost right away. Life in your home will be subject to many turmoils and won't run the risk of monotony. You won't have the intention to let yourself be pushed around. Also, you'll refuse concessions and compromises. For once, gossip will leave you indifferent. In your work, you'll have a superb competitive mind; and woe betide those who will overshadow you or oppose your projects!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>22 Oct 06<br>In order to avoid possible conflicts, don't show yourself to be too categorical toward your close ones. You must spare your nervous system and keep a close watch on your diet. You'll be a glutton for work and you'll be congratulated on it. But you'll forget that family life needs gentleness and harmony; make efforts to show yourself under a more tender and merrier light. Your financial situation will evolve in a very favorable manner. You won't remain insensitive to the charm of a person who you recently met and you will begin to form sweet dreams about them.</div>

On the financial front, your rather dreamy and carefree side can make you miss some excellent opportunities; consequently it'll be useful to get help from a more realistic and qualified person. Endowed with an enormous amount of talent, you'll easily succeed in solving practical and material problems. Total complicity with your children. You'll feel harassed by a friend who won't stop burdening you with his unwanted advice.<br><br>24 Oct 06<br>At work, you'll have the best chances possible to bring your enterprises to a successful conclusion. Risks of inflammations, transitory fevers and above all rather painful raging toothache. Learn to feed yourself in a wholesome way; eat a balanced diet rich in organic fruits and vegetables.

            <div class='col-md body'>27 Oct 06<br>In your work, give precedence to flexibility and easiness, for you'll probably try too hard to achieve a gigantic project that you've been dreaming of for a long time, and some people will not see this with a good eye. The difficulties in your work may increase your present tendency toward edginess, even to the blues. See to it that your problems do not have a bearing on your home life. Force yourself to change your ideas. Make sure that your view of things is not distorted.<br><br>28 Oct 06<br>Your tastes for luxury will awaken; beware, then! Your enemies will occupy too much place in your mind; but life is too short for you to concern yourself with those whom you detest! Closely watch over your accounts and make sure that you've paid your taxes and other fiscal charges; otherwise you might get into serious trouble.
