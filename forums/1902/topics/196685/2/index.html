Increased financial potential: cleverness in transactions, luck in speculations. Do exercise so as to have a better blood circulation. All contracts will be favored. Be firm toward your close relatives and make them understand that there are limits that should not be trespassed.</div>

If you like new and pleasurable flirtations, you'll be well served; but don't hope to draw from them any possibility of stabilizing yourself on the amorous plane. Your couple life may suffer from your present carefree attitude. Careerwise, the stars will support your efforts at a career change or restyling.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rabbit people love to play under the moonlight. Quite fanciful, they respond to the power and beauty of nature and are always being pulled one way and the other to examine what they find. They are the luckiest of all twelve signs! But, it's more a result of "the harder I work, the luckier I get" than taking crazy chances. They are cautious, conservative, bright, and have a good head for business. Supremely pleasant to have around, these affectionate, naturally shy peacemakers seldom ever lose their temper. They sometimes appear to be singing the blues because of a natural but short-lived tendency towards despondency. Rabbits always inspire deep admiration and trust.<br><br>Famous RABBIT people: Hu Shih, Hu Yao-Bang, Kim Young Sam, Sally Ride, Leonardo Di Caprio, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Arturo Toscanini, Leontyne Price, Clare Boothe Luce, Tiger Woods.<br><br>METAL RABBIT Horoscope<br><span class="small">Feb 6, 1951 to Jan 26, 1952<br>Feb 3, 2011 to Jan 22, 2012</span><br><br>Metal Rabbits make a very big deal about the true lasting values of life. To them, fame is ephemeral but reputation is forever. They are the background movers and shakers, never seeking the limelight themselves but always paving the way for others to become successful. Among Metal Rabbits you may find the book agents, the art critics, teachers, political campaigners and the great organizers. Although too conservative to catapult themselves onto the map, the successful people who have made it because of them are legends. Though not social butterflies, Metal Rabbits are very likable and have tons of friends because of their sincerity and unabashed kindness. Financially, they need to be more conservative! A speculative nature makes them venture into risky territory. If they don't watch their pockets, they're in big time trouble. Love Life, on the other hand, is nearly perfect. The very caring ways of the Metal Rabbit lead them to experience poetically quiet and at the same time exquisitely intense relationships.<br><br>WATER RABBIT<br><span class="small">Jan 29, 1903 to Feb 15, 1904<br>Jan 25, 1963 to Feb 12, 1964</span><br><br>High on a mountain bluff, the Water Rabbit enjoys the immensity of solitude. Like typical Rabbits, the Water Rabbit is quiet, but don't let this fool you. Water Rabbits are always STRONG silent types. Beneath the passive reserve lies a smoldering ember ready to enjoy life to the fullest extent possible. In solitude there is peace, spirit, nature, strength, music, and a strong philosophical current that keeps anchor in the soul of Water Rabbit. The Neon and Glitter People truly admire the Water Rabbits for their individuality, not unlike that of the lone rugged cowboy seen against jagged mountain peaks. Water Rabbits make friends easily, but have a tendency to be too trusting. Gullibility is not a safe trait to have! Water Rabbits are happy to find creative outlets through their very fulfilling careers. Their determination to rise to the top makes them well regarded in their fields. When it comes to making money, it's "easy come, easy go" - money just slips through their fingers and Rabbits gasp with bewilderment, "Where did it go?" Time to find a good financial advisor. "Easy come, easy go" is also the mantra of their love lives. Falling in love too easily leads to heartbreak. Once they learn to hold back and find true love, they throw away romantic interludes for love everlasting.<br><br>WOOD RABBIT<br><span class="small">Feb 14, 1915 to Feb 2, 1916<br>Feb 11, 1975 to Jan 30, 1976</span><br><br>From the time Wood Rabbits were small children delighting in Story Time, Wood Rabbits have pursued knowledge. Charming conversationalists, they regale others with anecdotal glimpses into literature, history, and current events. They are lifelong members of the Legendary Rendezvous for People in the Arts and are frequenters of bookstores, libraries, and halls of academia. Their innate cunning makes them superb players not only in the game of chess but the game of life. No wrong moves allowed! Wood Rabbits are alert to new experiences, hang-loose philosophically, and very generous to friends and love ones. But, here's some good advice to Wood Rabbits everywhere! Find a good financial advisor. You might think it's hip to be The Big Spender, but, hey, look at it this way, what are you going to do on that rainy day? Hmmmmm? A little frugality will do you a world of good. Love Life for the Wood Rabbit is filled with rapturous sweetness, so incredibly generous in affection, it puts the partner's head in a spin. Fireplace cuddles are the way of life.<br><br>FIRE RABBIT<br><span class="small">Feb 2, 1927 to Jan 22, 1928<br>Jan 29, 1987 to Feb 16, 1988</span><br><br>The Fire Rabbits stand out from the crowd of other Rabbits. You might expect Rabbits to be passive, quiet, and loners. Not so, the Fire Rabbits. These extroverts are leaders of the pack! Fire Rabbits intuitively sense the right way to bring out the best in themselves and other people. They are brave creatures, thirsty for life. Others eagerly follow them because of the promise of adventure and great fun, and they are never disappointed. Visionary explorers, Fire Rabbits inspire others to see beyond the surface. Unlike other Rabbits, Fire Rabbits have the potential to be truly rich. Enormously capable and hardworking, Fire Rabbits can achieve great things others cannot match. Captains in charge of their lives, they experience smooth sailing in their careers. The multifaceted Fire Rabbits experience great versatility in their lives. Their interests can range from Agatha Christie to bungee jumping, from caviar to enchiladas, from snowskiing to Scrabble. Speaking of Scrabble, spell Love: L-O-V-E is very kind to Fire Rabbits. Excellent lovers, they rapturously charm their partners with cozy fireplaces, affectionate hugs, and, most of all, undying support and loyalty.<br><br>EARTH RABBIT<br><span class="small">Feb 19, 1939 to Feb 7, 1940<br>Feb 16, 1999 to Feb 4, 2000</span><br><br>In the middle of the night, the Earth Rabbit has light bulbs flashing, ideas and lots of them. At daybreak, this entrepreneurial Rabbit guided by inspiration, ventures into unknown territory and starts new projects, programs, and activities, rounding up enthusiastic people willing to back him/her all the way. Earth Rabbits are pioneers and we offer a standing ovation for the many wonderful innovations they develop. Only thing is, as hardworking and serious about their work as they certainly are, they get bored easily - the grass is always greener somewhere else. Consequently, they want to find bigger and bigger work and job hop from one place to another, sometimes not following through on prior commitments. Financial life suffers in the process. They really have trouble handling their finances. They don't have trouble with Love, however. Hearth and home symbolize love without end for the loving Earth Rabbits. Attention to the relationship and growth as a couple are important priorities. As a result, love is always bubbling over with the afterglow of warmth and affection.</div>

One of your children might cause you worries because of his dubious relationships; try to reason them firmly but calmly. As a general rule, don't act in spite of all common sense, turn back if you realize that you've gone the wrong way. At work, your success will be commensurate with the efforts you'll make<br><br>3 Jul 06<br>At your work, you may have difficulty accurately evaluating a situation and, therefore, may commit errors; it'd be better to postpone making any important decisions for now. Your excessive and unreasonable ambition could overwork you; appeal to all your practical and analytical senses so as to make a judicious choice in your activities. You'll entertain numerous projects aimed at better organizing your home life; you'll consider, for instance, fitting out your interior, acquiring new electrical appliances, or replacing cooking utensils.</div>
