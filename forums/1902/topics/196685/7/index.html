Beware, there'll be aggressiveness around you, and it will threaten your chances; you may show yourself to be too arrogant, which could discourage the goodwill of others. Because of your skin-deep sensitiveness, you may encounter sentimental, family or other difficulties. If you're a heavy smoker, do some walking in the fresh, open air so as to lessen your nervousness. Your back might give you discomfort; don't carry too heavy weights.</div>

Keep a close watch over your children. Your physical form won't be especially good: fatigue and tension will succeed each other, and you'll have to take more rest.

            <div class='col-md body'>28 Sep 06<br>You may feel mixed up in your affairs; put your papers in due order, and answer letters. Beware of your lack of lucidity. If you have difficult relationships with your close ones, try to have some detachment so as to judge the situation with a maximum of objectivity; you'll then solve the problems more rapidly. You'll flit about with much success; small love affairs will be numerous and charming.

            <div class='col-md body'>13 Oct 06<br>You'll have great chances to make a very significant sentimental encounter. Even in the most somber moments, try to see the brighter side of things. A little more nervous than usual, you'll have difficulty in mixing your private and professional life; all the same, surrounded by your close relatives and friends, you'll spend some very good moments. Pecuniary difficulties are to be foreseen; it would be better to postpone certain purchases that are not urgent.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>14 Oct 06<br>Financially, you'll be no doubt more at ease because you can carry out some good business deals or because you'll find a more remunerative job. Confident in your rich experience of life, you won't hesitate to give your close ones and friends counsels full of common sense. You'll need to pamper yourself a little by offering yourself an extraordinary gift -- if its price makes you hesitate, tell yourself that luxury is often a good investment. What's important is that all these moves will increase your morale.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>15 Oct 06<br>Be realistic, don't embark on obviously unbounded undertakings. The discussions in your family are likely to degenerate into arguments; therefore, content yourself with keeping silent, as an easing of the situation will take place shortly. Your relations with your family circle are likely to be a source of frustrations for you. You'll suddenly want to add something to your existence, more readily turning toward philosophy or religion.<br><br>16 Oct 06<br>Your sense of diplomacy will permit you to defuse a ready-to-explode bomb. In the sentimental area, the machine's likely to get keyed up, and if you don't rapidly put things in order, water and gas won't get along -- unless you really like explosive situations! Rivalries in your professional environment might arise; put yourself resolutely above these petty schemes. You'll have to think of reinforcing the natural defenses of your organism, otherwise you'll be subject to a lot of minor miseries.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>17 Oct 06<br>You must watch over your budget with the most extreme vigilance, for the general ambiance will incite exaggerated expenses, which nothing justifies. If you're careful about your resources, your month-ends will no longer turn into nightmares. You'll be again more lucid, more objective, and you'll get out of difficult situations satisfactorily if you don't lose heart. New sentimental adventures in view, provided that they last! Heartwise, you won't know where to stop, for you'll be always infatuated with the first person to come by.</div>
