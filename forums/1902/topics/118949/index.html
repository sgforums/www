            <div class='col-md body'>About Your Sign...<br><br>Sagittarians have a positive outlook on life, are full of enterprise, energy, versatility, adventurousness and eagerness to extend experience beyond the physically familiar. They enjoy travelling and exploration, the more so because their minds are constantly open to new dimensions of thought. They are basically ambitious and optimistic, and continue to be so even when their hopes are dashed. Their strongly idealistic natures can also suffer many disappointments without being affected. They are honorable, honest, trustworthy, truthful, generous and sincere, with a passion for justice. They are usually on the side of the underdog in society they will fight for any cause they believe to be just, and are prepared to be rebellious. They balance loyalty with independence.<br><br>Sagittarians are usually modest and are often religious, with a strong sense of morality, though they tend to overemphasize the ethical codes they follow and worship beliefs about God rather than God Himself. This means that, negatively, they regard rigid, unloving, intolerant adherence to ritual and conventional codes as more important than the truths they symbolize or embody. They sometimes pay lip service to religions and political parties in which they have ceased to believe because the outward forms satisfy them, yet they may not hesitate to switch allegiance in politics or change their system of belief if they see personal advantage to themselves in doing so.<br><br>They have both profound and widely ranging minds, equipped with foresight and good judgement, and they can be witty conversationalists. They love to initiate new projects (they make excellent researchers) and have an urge to understand conceptions that are new to them. they think rapidly, are intuitive and often original, but are better at adapting than inventing and are at their best when working with colleagues of other types of character that compliment their own. They are strong-willed and good at organizing, a combination that gives them the ability to bring any project they undertake to a successful conclusion. Their generosity can be balanced by their extreme care at handling their resources.<br><br>Sagittarians are ardent, sincere and straightforward in love, normally conventional and in control of their sexual natures. Yet if thwarted, they may easily allow their failure to embitter their whole lives or they may revenge themselves upon the opposite sex by becoming cynically promiscuous. They are more apt then the average to make an uncongenial alliance. If their marriages are successful, they will be faithful spouses and indulgent parents; but their innate restlessness will inspire them to use even the most satisfying mÃ©nage as a base from which to set out on their travels. They need to fell free and are often faced with the choice of allowing their careers to take over their lives at the expense of the love of their spouse and family. Sagittarian women are the counterparts of their men; even if they have no career to rival their love, they find it difficult to express affection and may run the risk of being thought frigid.<br><br>In other personal relationships they are reliable, seldom betraying any trust given to them. They can, however, be impulsively angry and both male and female Sagittarians know how to be outspoken and exactly what expressions will hurt their adversaries most. On the other hand they are magnanimous in forgiving offenses and are responsible when looking after the elderly in the family.<br><br>Their gifts fit Sagittarians for a number of widely differing professions. They are natural teachers and philosophers with a talent for expounding the moral principles and laws which seem to explain the universe. This gift enables them to be successful churchmen on the one hand and scientists on the other. The law and politics also suit them, as does public service, social administration, public relations and advertising. Travel and exploration naturally appeal to such restless souls and, if their opportunities are limited, they may find something of travel and change of scene in the armed forces or through working as a travelling salesman. Others may make fine musicians and, in the days before automobiles, they were said to be successful at horse trading and all activities, including sporting ones, concerning horses. This has been translated in modern terms into an interest in cars and aircraft - and again with emphasis on the sporting side racing, rallying etc. They are said to make good sports coaches, but their tastes in this direction may lead them into imprudent gambling, though the gambling instinct may be sublimated by carrying it out professionally as a bookmaker.<br><br>The vices to which Sagittarians are prone are anger they tend to flare up over trifles; impatience - they want to rush every new project through immediately and demand too much of colleagues who cannot work at the pace they require; and scorn of the inadequacies of others while expecting fulsome recognition of their own efforts. They may in one sense deserve recognition, because in completing a major project they will sacrifice their health and family relationships; in their family's eyes they may merit condemnation.<br><br>They can be exacting, domineering and inconsiderate in the work place; and boastful, vulgar and extravagant in their private lives. Their restlessness, if excessive, can jeopardize more than their own stability. some Sagittarians risk becoming playboys, wasting their lives away in frivolous pursuits. Others can develop a moralizing, religious fanaticism or else turn into hypocrites, their inner prudishness disguised by an outward appearance of joviality. Another side of the religiosity which is a danger in Sagittarians is superstition.<br><br>Possible Health Concerns...<br><br>Sagittarius governs the hips, thighs and sacral area; subjects suffer from ailments of the hips and thighs and are liable to sciatica and rheumatism. An alleged deficiency of silicon in their physiques can give them poor skin, nails and hair.<br><br>As they are often sportsmen indulging in dangerous pursuits, they are prone to accidents which arise from these. The ancient astrologers mention falls from horses and hurts from them and other four-footed beasts. The taking of risks in other sports is a danger to the modern Sagittarian, and he is also liable to accidents with fire and heat.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAGITTARIUS &amp; ARIES: - This is not a bad match while it lasts. Fun-loving, adventuresome, certainly compatible. Both you and the Ram like to do your own thing, therefore you often part on friendly terms as you go off in your own directions.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; TAURUS: - The Bull leads too structured a life for you to conform to. This is not a likely match. Taureans see you as a wanderer with no apparent direction.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; GEMINI: - You are polar opposites giving this connection plenty of chemistry, however outside activities tend to take you both in different directions. You both like to take chances and depend too much on luck.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; CANCER: - You are a traveler and the Crab is a homebody that automatically puts you on a different wave length. This combination makes a much better friendship. You could never live within the other's life-style and remain happy.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; LEO: - This is probably one of your best match ups. You bring out the best in one another. You both have a very carefree approach to life and love.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; VIRGO: - Virgo's do not handle your lifestyle well. You can not put up with the Virgoan's meticulous, detailed way of doing everything.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; LIBRA: - This is probably one of your best connections. You get the freedom you desire and both of you absolutely hate confrontation, therefore problems are just put on the shelf.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; SCORPIO: - The Scorpion cannot live with your freedom loving wandering spirit. When the jealousy sets in you'll be off to greener pastures.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; SAGITTARIUS: - You will shake well with one another. This combination is somewhat unpredictable. It's not always a lasting union due to a lack of being in the same place at the same time, but truly a hot affair.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; CAPRICORN: - You are impulsive, risk-taking and always looking for adventure that frightens the cautious Goat. This is really not a suitable union, You are far too different to ever exist together.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; AQUARIUS: - You both love adventure, travel and the great outdoors. You can have a lasting relationship, especially if it is a long distance romance.<br><br>SAGITTARIUS &amp; PISCES: - This is a passionate attraction, but unfortunately neither one of you can supply the other with the emotional factor required to make this coalition work.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You may get a new outlook as a result of your relationship with a Pisces. Pisces affects that part of your solar horoscope connected with home, long-range projects and basic security. The Neptune of Pisces blends with your Jupiter significator to open new horizons. You review your past and accept new views through Pisces. The two signs are not favorably aspected. This is a case of Fire (Sagittarius) and Water (Pisces). There are, naturally, problems in getting the elements to mix. But there is interest and it is a good combination where home, property, real estate and long-range security enter the picture.<br><br>Like Scorpio, Pisces has an aura of mystery that you find to the bottom of mysteries, to attractive. You want to get to the bottom of mysteries, to solve puzzles, to add to your holdings. Pisces, in turn, regards you as, an asset toward the fulfillment of ambitions.<br><br>Both you and Pisces seem to have individual motives or goals in this aspect of the relationship. It is not a self- less one. There are reasons for actions on both your parts, and if you are mature enough to know this, then there is more of a chance for ultimate success. There could be conflict as to who is running the show. With a Pisces, you tend to be independent, slightly selfish.<br><br>When you are ready to settle down, to change or take a view, then Pisces may be right for you. Otherwise, you could feel tied down, restricted, and even abused. On the brighter side, Pisces could make you a good home and could help you make investments that enhance your long- range security. Neptune and Jupiter could spell romance, but there is also a puzzling aspect. You might, with Pisces, be constantly wondering just where you stand and where you are going next.<br></div>
