Put your energy into your work or moneymaking ventures rather than into your emotional life today. Don't be too quick to voice your opinion. Listen to others carefully.<br>Conflicts over joint finances are likely. Put your efforts into making constructive improvements to your environment and to your state of mind. Things at work have been moving quickly and you may be feeling a little uncertain about the changes taking place.<br>Your second house, Capricorn, has been empty for quite some time, so now that Venus has moved into it you are likely to generate a more conscientious attitude to how you manage your finances. YouÂ’ll want to accumulate, rather than splash out, so committing to a regular savings plan will keep you happy.</div>
