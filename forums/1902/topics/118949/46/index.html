            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You need to concentrate on solving existing problems. Don't be afraid of opposition; your suggestions are valid. Be discreet with private information. Pleasure trips will promote romance.<br>Consider a conservative investment that will stay solid when everything else goes sour. You will find that social activities will be enjoyable and will promote new connections. Don't be critical or overly opinionated with dislikes; it could cause disapproval and unwanted opposition.<br>A sense of boredom could settle in today, making you feel listless, but this is only a temporary blip, caused by the moon affecting your ruling planet. A change of image will work wonders for both your confidence and energy levels, whether you opt for some new accessories or a whole new make-over!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Relatives may not be telling you the whole truth about a family situation. Secret affairs will only lead to heartache. You could expand your circle of friends if you get involved in unusual activities.<br>You will be misinterpreted if you get involved in other people's problems. The key to feeling good about yourself will be to do something about it. Try to spend time with those having similar interests.<br>Romance could raise its head today, but in a less than positive way! A negative aspect between your ruling planet and the moon means that youÂ’re likely to be less inclined towards cozy chats and more preoccupied with what everyone else thinks! However, some blue agate will soften that blunt exterior a little.</div>

Your mate will be pushing you to do things that you really don't want to do.<br>Normally, the weekend would see you out in the countryside enjoying the fresh air or down in the gym engaging in some new physical activity. Today, though, you are more in the mood for learning and itÂ’s a great time to start exploring. A visit to your local museum or library would make a great start!</div>
