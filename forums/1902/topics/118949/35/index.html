            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Don't be shy; if you want to spend more time with a special person, make a commitment. You may be uncertain about some of your coworkers and your boss. Do not borrow or lend money or belongings to friends or relatives if you wish to avoid any hassles.<br>If boredom has set in, find new and unique directions that offer interesting friendships. Concentrate on work or make changes to yourself. You need to take a break with the ones you love.<br>As the most practical of all the Fire signs you may find yourself feeling a little frustrated today. The energy of the planets is decidedly watery and the emotions that this stirs up for you may make you feel a little uncomfortable. You are always happiest when doing rather than feeling so try and keep your cool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You should not get involved in joint ventures. However, you may not attract the kind of interest you had in mind. You will have a problem holding on to your cash today.<br>Your tendency to overreact could get you into trouble. Family outings should include visiting friends or relatives. You are best to tuck your money away where no one will be able to touch it, including yourself.<br>Home is where youÂ’ll want to be today, spending time with your nearest and dearest. There will be a strong influence from the element of water, which governs your emotions, so if you find youÂ’re feeling more sensitive than usual donÂ’t worry.

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Go over your finances and figure out a solid budget. Opportunities for romance will flourish through travel. Opportunities to make financial gains through investments look promising.<br>Someone you live with could be frustrated and upset. You will have the discipline to make changes you feel are necessary. Your contributions will be valued and helpful.<br>You could be pulled in two directions today: you know you need to finish some task or honor some deadline, but you also want to make the most of the day and have fun! Unfortunately for you those obligations have to come first, so whether it is an unfinished assignment or paperwork it comes first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Don't share your dilemma with those you work with. Expressing yourself in novel ways should lead you down new avenues. Romance is quite possible if you are willing to approach someone who interests you.<br>Speak of your future goals, intentions, and commitments. You need to spend some time with individuals who have more experience than you. Be prepared to neutralize any threats.<br>The solar eclipse will have virtually no impact on your day today, but you may find that you need to slow down because you are taking on way too much! Plan, make a list, and sort out the important from the unimportant. Otherwise you could find that youÂ’re surrounded by half finished tasks by the end of the day!</div>
