            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Abrupt action will cause difficulties with relatives. Health problems may prevail if you don't take care of them immediately. Emotional situations could bring out your stubborn nature.<br>Friends and relatives may be hard to take today. You should be making plans to spend some time with the ones you love. You may attract attention if you get out socially.<br>It could be that you overexert yourself today in your efforts to impress someone who has caught your eye. However, if you rein in that outrageous behavior and learn the art of subtlety to make that someone special notice you youÂ’re more likely to succeed; remember, sometimes less is more!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Voice your opinions and contribute to the de bate. You need to be around friends and family. You will enjoy lavish forms of entertainment and should consider making arrangements early.<br>You're in the mood to spend time with your lover. Your lover may feel rejected. Don't let your partner get you going. You are best to travel or attend lectures or seminars.<br>Your ruling planet Jupiter makes its presence felt today with a major challenging aspect warning against extravagance and over indulgence. Creature comforts may be important to you, but thereÂ’s a danger that youÂ’re becoming too materialistic. Some voluntary work or meditation would help restore the balance.</div>

A change in position could be better than you thought. Trips will be enjoyable, and communication with your lover will clear up any misconceptions.<br>Controversial subjects should be avoided at all costs. Your outgoing, aggressive nature will attract someone you've been eager to meet. You may be more emotional than usual.<br>Your naturally sunny nature will take an almost child-like turn today as you are likely to indulge in a day of excess, which you will enjoy at the time, but probably regret later. YouÂ’ll be tempted to treat yourself to all the things on offer, but you can have too much of a good thing.</div>
