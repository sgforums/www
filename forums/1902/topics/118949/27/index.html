            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Exaggeration or deception coupled with overindulgence might be a problem. If you try to manipulate emotional situations you will find yourself alienated. Don't forget to let your mate know how much you care.<br>Don't promise to deliver the goods if you aren't positive that you can meet the deadline. Sit tight. Things aren't as bad as they appear. Try not to be too emotional with those around you.<br>Don't daydream about what you want to do -- start making arrangements. Make changes to your home or your living arrangements and you will eliminate part of your problem. Stick to what you start.<br></div>
