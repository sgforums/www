            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Your ability to stand out in a crowd will bring you the recognition you desire. Don't force your opinions on friends or relatives unless you are prepared to lose their favor. Losses are likely if you have left your financial affairs in other people's hands.<br>Read some books on self awareness. You will enjoy events that lean toward theater, art, or music today. Spend time getting into physical activities with your lover.<br>Oh dear; you might want to keep a piece of clear quartz with you today, because the planets are suggesting that youÂ’ll need a little bit of time and space to gather those flitting thoughts. An evening out will seem like a great idea, but youÂ’ll feel better resolving slight tension with a family member instead!</div>
