You may find that someone you live with may be irritable; you're best to leave them alone.<br>Rid yourself of that which is old and no longer of use. You will drive your emotional partner crazy today. Don't be too quick to judge your position or surroundings at work.<br>There is a planetary opposition today between your ruling planet Jupiter and the moon. Oppositions tend to create a sense of tension and for you this will be felt in relation to your daily routine. However, if you set about deciding on a major change in the usual weekend routine you will feel much happier and optimistic.</div>

You may have some difficulties with someone you live with.<br>You might experience an urge to establish your independence today. You may feel that you have relied on your close friends a little too much and you might find that you get a little irritated when someone volunteers some advice.
