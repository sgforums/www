Don't let your personal partner hold you back or slow you down. Do your own thing.<br>Any negativity that you experienced yesterday should disappear completely today, leaving you feeling refreshed and comfortable again. This will be a good day for romance because youÂ’ll be feeling much more settled, which should provide a welcome relief after those minor tensions yesterday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Your emotional reaction will be dependent upon your partner's responsiveness. Stretch the truth, and you may get blamed for something you didn't do. Minor health problems will flare up if you don't take care of yourself.<br>Don't let your partner start any arguments. Passion should be redirected positively. Trips should be your choice. Make changes regarding your status in society.<br>Money is looking great today and a trip to the mall is probably long overdue! A word of warning though, the influence of the sun in Leo could encourage you to spend recklessly, or to buy something that you wonÂ’t really want to wear, so take a strict and reliable friend to guide you!</div>

Refrain from arguing with your mate.<br>Offer consolation, but don't give them any direction. Travel should open doors that lead to exciting new adventures. Things at home may be somewhat rocky.<br>The moon in Libra is casting a very positive influence on many signs, including yours! Libra is the sign of balance, and will settle any feelings of restlessness. On top of that you might even feel the need for an image change today; whether you opt for a make-over or decide on a completely new style is up to you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You may want to stay in the background today. Your dramatic approach to life has probably gotten to your mate. Do not get involved in joint financial ventures.<br>Things will be emotional with your mate. Problems with ear, nose, or the throat are likely. You may have taken on a little too much, but you will enjoy every minute of it.<br>It seems that youÂ’ll have some great ideas, but if youÂ’re too assertive about them it could lead to tension with your work colleagues or your school mates. The best way for you to deal with this surplus of fire energy is to let off some steam in some demanding sports activity, like indoor rock climbing or tennis!</div>
