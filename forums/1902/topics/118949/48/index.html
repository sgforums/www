            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Take time to listen to children and help them with projects that seem impossible to them. You need to take a good look at all sides of an issue before making a decision. You may be confused regarding your love life.<br>If they don't like the plan, suggest that they con tribute a little. You may exaggerate your emotional situation. Be aware of any emotional deception. Do not sign legal contracts or documents today.<br>Mars will make itself felt today now that the negative aspect from the moon has gone. YouÂ’ll be full of beans and bouncing with enthusiasm, but youÂ’d do well to channel some of that surplus into something definite, otherwise you could find that, like Taurus, youÂ’ll squander those energies!</div>
