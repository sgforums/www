            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>If you haven't already, don't be afraid to start your own small business on the side. Disappointments are likely if your mate embarrasses you in front of friends. Your ideas may be a little ahead of their time; don't push them, instead just continue working on development.<br>Joining organizations will provide you with stimulating romantic contacts. Finish those changes you've been talking about making to your residence. You will drive your emotional partner crazy today.<br>The need for some independence will get stronger today, thanks to the influences of the moon, which has moved into your sign. If you find that youÂ’re feeling restless and easily distracted then donÂ’t worry; talking to a family member will help you through it and restore your good mood.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Don't bother complaining, do the work yourself. You will attract members of the opposite sex readily. Be aware of deception when it comes to your position, and be sure not to jump to conclusions.<br>Your greatest enjoyment will come through social activities and pleasure trips. Investments will not be as they appear today. Your energy will be high; however, if not channeled suitably, temper tantrums may erupt.<br>You are likely to be feeling constrained today. It might be that something or someone is stopping you from doing what you want to do. It could be that work or school is talking over everything right now and youÂ’re not able to enjoy your life. You need to introduce some fun time to the midweek!</div>
