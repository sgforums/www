In your haste to 'get on with it' you're stepping on toes, missing important details and generally making a bit of a mess.

If you're the type who loves experimenting, fixing things, tinkering with technology or indulging in messy arts and crafts, today is right up your street. Anything that gets your hands dirty is likely to please, especially if you have some kind of end 'product' to show for all that effort. Practical hobbies will be so absorbing that time will fly by.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New friends are a lovely possibility today, especially later in the day. Get out and about as much as you can, and talk to as many different people as possible. Yes, even vampires, werewolves, ghouls and the undead. You're bound to find a few people fascinating, and even if a new soul mate doesn't appear at least you'll have had some interesting Halloween conversations along the way!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though you can't take your finger off the professional pulse (there are far to many long term opportunities coming your way right now) you do need to reconnect with friends and family today. You've been a butterfly flitting about the social circuit for a few weeks now and there is a rest coming, but you've got a few days partying left in you first. It's especially important for singles to mingle and meet new people as it's your personal relationship planet, Mercury that lights up your social zone. Even attached Archers will enjoy the relationship growth that comes from mingling with both your mates and your date.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're keen to personalise things today, whether it's your room, your clothes or the cat (!). Creatively, you're really buzzing with ideas, but some of them may provoke the odd raised eyebrow or two from family or neighbours. Still, what do they know? Getting things just how you like them adds to your sense of security and belonging - which is really important today<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have a very powerful personality today, even if you don't realise it. Make sure you give others a chance to be heard - you're so persuasive that you can easily overshadow those around you. Deliberately choosing to take a backseat can be a sign of good leadership sometimes, so don't be afraid to walk away from the limelight for a while.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The stars are aligned in a way today that they won't realign in again for more than 200 years - that is to say, a Jupiter/Pluto conjunction in your sign. Suffice to say that what you are living through now is not going to be happening again any time soon. So try to make the most of it all, even if it's rough. Remember that Pluto is the planet that represents the healing crisis - the difficult moment which actually leads us to a better place. We all get lots of those in a lifetime but few will be as big as the one you're getting now.<br><br></div>
