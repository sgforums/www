            <div class='col-md body'>Before watching the video (that was smuggled out of Area 51), here's some background on the video.<br><br>( From<a href="http://%20http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/etview.html" rel="nofollow"> http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/etview.html</a> )<br><br>The color video footage, which lasts for a total of two minutes and fifty-five seconds, was apparently smuggled out of the secret Groom Lake "Area 51" facility in Nevada by a man referring to himself as "Victor". The video film depicts a Grey alien being interrogated at the government facility.<br><br>The footage first came to light on the Art Bell radio show on 13th March, 1997 when ufologist Sean David Morton was interviewed. Morton claimed the interrogation was fairly recent, sometime in 1996, and that renowned UFO expert Bob Dean apparently cried at the advanced screening of the film.<br><br>After claiming to have smuggled the film out of the Groom Lake facility in Nevada, Victor resolved to have the footage broadcast on network television as soon as possible in order to pulicly expose his claims. Victor believes that if his identity is discovered and he is subsequently assassinated, this would only further help to confirm the claims and authenticity behind the film.<br><br>Victor approached many television companies in his attempts to show the footage to the public. He first approached Fox TV, who turned him down after the problems in authenticity they had when the Roswell autopsy footage was shown by them. Fox felt they were being deceived for a second time. Eventually, in July 1996, Victor found an independent production company in Los Angeles, California called Rocket Home Pictures Productions, who agreed to produce a documentary based around the interview. Morton was brought in by Rocket's president, Tom Coleman, to give his views, thus being the first "outsider" to view the footage.<br><br>After seeing the interview footage, Morton provides a chilling and detailed description of what he saw:<br><br>"The film was shot through a large plane of glass. There was no sound accompanying the images. The interview took place in a darkened room, lit with an eerie greenish glow, I could make out the silhouettes of two men, one dressed in military uniform with what appeared to be the stars on the epaulet of his jacket, and another more casually dressed man with his hand occassionally rubbing his forehead. They sat with their backs to the camera at one end of a long table, which was littered with wires, chords and microphones. There were what appeared to be medical devices. One in particular was blinking erratically, as if it was monitoring a very sick heart. And there sitting at the end of the table was a small, beige-skinned, black-eyed, bulbous headed creature, the like of which haunt the nightmares of thousands of unwilling abductees."<br><br>Morton made many references to the creature's sick appearance and condition. The alien made very jerky movements and kept bobbing up and down. He continued to describe the apparently distressed state the creature was in.<br><br>"Its skin was a pinkish beige, but the rest of the head looked purple and bruised, as if it had suffered severe contusions across the skull."<br><br>The contents of the tape grew progressively more disturbing. Towards the end of the tape, the creature goes into what appears to be violent spasms, as if it was having a seizure. The mouth of the alien opens and closes before a foam begins to come out. At that point the heart monitor (as described by Morton) begins to start jumping wildly, at which point the man in the military looking uniform signals to a couple of medics, who rush into the frame and aid the alien. As the doctors treat the alien, the footage suddenly comes to an abrupt end.<br><br>The authenticity of the footage is seen differently by many people. Morton is convinced the footage is real due to strong relationships with stories of alien abductees and the information on the footage in the lower part of the frame.<br><br>I myself am dubious, but do recognise the factors which lead to its possible true authenticity. The ET's appearance and features are recognisable as those mentioned by hundreds of abductees. Known as "The Gourdos" or the more feared "Grey" species, the alien is instantly recognisable by any Ufologist.<br><br>Another factor helping the video's authenticity is the information etched into the bottom of the video. The footage has the characters DNI/27 burnt into the bottom line of the frame, along with what appears to be the time code numbers for date, minutes and seconds. The letters DNI could be an acronym for the Department of Naval Intelligence, the group responsible for the Area 51 base, a fact not many people know about. The DNI connection to Area 51 has been widely investigated. George Knapp, the TV journalist who encouraged Bob Lazar to go public with his knowledge has shown that Lazar's pay cheques from the time he claimed to be working at Area 51 had DNI stamped on them.<br><br>The best place to possibly determine the authenticity of the alien interview footage is the source, in this case a mysterious man known as Victor who won't reveal ANY specific details about himself in fear of discovery and assassination. If the man is telling the truth about his background at Area 51, then this is understandable. But how can the film be verified without any knowledge of it?<br><br>The producer of the documentary, Jeff Broadstreet, does know how Victor took the footage from the base. Victor told him he managed to obtain a copy of the video when in an unsupervised moment. Broadstreet stated the following:<br><br>"He was assisting in the process of downloading a large amount of video analogue tape to storage on DVD or digital video disc."<br><br>He further explains that Victor deliberately removed the audio track to protect the identity of the men in the video and to also help protect his own anonymity. Victor also told the producer that he thought the man on the left, who is seen with his hand to his head during much of the segment, is a military telepath apparently used to assist in communication with the creature.<br><br>Since the creature is obviously in a great deal of distress, when Broadstreet asked if the creature died later, Victor replied cryptically, "I'm not sure, but I know it was retired from the interview process."<br><br>According to Victor, the contents of the removed audio track involved an attempt at trying to obtain some form of technological information from the alien about the coordinates of a ship or object. He does not know, or wouldn't tell, whether the alien was attending the interview voluntarily or against his will after he had been recovered from some UFO crash retrieval operation.<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Kyo's comments :<br><br>Before watching the (silent) video footage, here are some comments that have been made by those who studied the video.<br><br>Ex-US military Colonel Bob Dean and UFO expert : "I was quite prepared to see a hoax, yet what I saw took me completely by surprise. It had a profound emotional impact on me. I knew what I was seeing was the real thing." He was angry at the way the alien was being treated.<br><br>Whitley Strieber, a multiple time ET abductee, is not sure if the video is genuine or fake. But he was distressed by watching the video of the alien creature - it invoked memories of his own abductions. "It's very difficult to watch this, because whoever made this video, whether genuine or not, knows something about the way they move." He never wants to see the footage again.<br><br>John Criswell, a Hollywood special effect technician called in to examine the video : "Just as I was sure it was some kind of puppet, it would start to lift up, jerk or move in such a way that would be very difficult to fake."<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>DOWNLOAD THE VIDEO HERE (hosted by CrowdedSkies.com) :<br><a href="http://www.crowdedskies.com/alien_interogation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.crowdedskies.com/alien_interogation.htm </a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(UltimaOnline's note :<br>The following is a letter from Dr Michael E. Salla, to Dr Dan Burisch, an ex-MJ12 associate. In the letter, Dr Salla expresses his dissapointment with Dr Burisch, for involving himself with the dubious US Govt MJ-12's treaty with the Greys extraterrestrials, including the Govt's agreement to allow the Greys to abduct and carry out experiments on humans in exchange for their extraterrestrial technology, instead of choosing friendship with the more benevolent and spiritually evolved Nordic extraterrestrials.)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>From : <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/tau_9_treaty.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatdreams.com/tau_9_treaty.htm</a><br><br>Tuesday, April 13, 2004<br><br>Dear Dr Burisch,<br><br>... ... ... ...<br><br>Dan (I hope you don't mind me being informal here since I hope we can continue to correspond) I wish to inquire about your `friendship' and experience with J-Rod where he performed a kind of mind-meld with you where your mind was flooded with information on the origins of life. No doubt this information has played an important role in your subsequent research into the Ganesh particle, and appears to be something that you highly value.<br><br>Perhaps, more significantly this information appears to be very highly prized by the controllers within the institutions of the Committee of the Majority/MJ 12 which puts you in this unique position of perhaps being the catalyst for disclosure of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. My question about your mind-meld encounter simply is did J-Rod ask your permission? Did he enquire as to whether you would accept the information he wished to share with you? In that sense, was he being a `true friend' in passing on that information to you? I ask because I have observed a distinct pattern in the way the J-Rods or `Greys' as more commonly known, interact with humans. The reports on the human and Grey/J-Rod interactions are quite varied ranging from the most sublime of spiritual experiences, to what many would consider to be exploitative. Nevertheless, the one common thread in these interactions is that the Greys/J-Rods simply don't ask permission when they initially interact with humanity. Permission or consent, typically comes after the first interaction which is forced or a result of compulsion upon an unwilling human subject.<br><br>Now you might inquire what's the relevance of asking permission if what is gained is mutually beneficial and uplifting, and isn't the result an important criterion for friendship rather than the process of asking first? My response is asking permission is demonstrating a respect for human free will, a recognition that the choices we make are the ingredients of human maturity as a species, rather than the end results of our human labors. By simply interacting with humans where the Greys/J-Rods abducted unwilling human subjects into their ships, downloaded their advanced information into humans, performed their `biological improvements', and a variety of other `mutually beneficial' projects, all typically done without first asking permission, the Greys/J-Rods were demonstrating a remarkable absence of a characteristic that is an important criterion for true friendship.<br><br>You may ask whether I'm setting a rather high standard for how extraterrestrials might interact with humanity, and whether we should just accept that mode of interaction chosen on by the Greys/J-Rods for passing on their information which in the end is `mutually beneficial'. I raise this issue since I do question whether the Greys/J-Rods can be `true friends' for humanity, and also wish to propose that there are another extraterrestrial races that have demonstrably shown a greater capacity of being the true friends of humanity.<br><br>You may not be aware that on February 20-21, 1954, President Eisenhower met with a delegation of humanoid extraterrestrials commonly described as `Nordics' which I will hence use as a `general description' for those extraterrestrial races that physically appear sufficiently like modern humans as to blend in without being recognized. The evidence for the Eisenhower-Nordic meeting has been quite sparse as might be imagined given the secrecy over all things extraterrestrial, but when all this disparate information put together it makes for a compelling case that such a meeting took place. I have subsequently learned that the meeting was even filmed. I've compiled the evidence that I could find into an article on my website: http://exopolitics.org/Study-Paper-8.htm<br><br>A significant fact is that the meeting occurred eleven days before the testing of the largest Hydrogen bomb ever by the US. The Bravo Test took place on March 1, 1954 at Bikini Atoll, and had a 15 megaton yield. The meeting with the `Nordics' did not go well since they apparently asked that the U.S. end the testing of the hydrogen bomb, yet offered no technological assistance in return, but only `spiritual advice', and believed that humanity had still not reached sufficient moral maturity for the advanced technologies the `Nordics' possessed.<br><br>It appears that the Nordics were not interested in reaching an agreement with the Eisenhower administration based on `mutual assistance' agreement, since they presumably were not motivated by what the national security agencies had to offer. The Bravo Nuclear Test indicated that national security officials, in particular those within the Committee of the Majority, thought that they could get better terms from *another* extraterrestrial race that would be more open to participating in an agreement based on `mutual assistance'. The treaty you refer to you in your reply Â–"Tau-9 Conference for the Preservation of Humanity" was I believe one aspect of this process. Now in exchange for their technological assistance, the Greys/J-Rod were given the right to conduct a limited biological program based on a variety of conditions that have subsequently been disputed by both sides in terms of compliance and led to military conflicts according to a number of whistleblowers such as Bob Lazar, Phillip Corso, Phil Schneider, Bill Cooper, Michael Wolf, et al. You are in a better position than I to comment on the accuracy of what has occurred and the contents of the treaty, but I would like to offer some comments about what I have observed from the nature of the interactions between the `Nordics' who first met with President Eisenhower and the human contactees who have subsequently reported on the Nordics.<br><br>The contactee reports between the `Nordics' and humans typically follow a pattern that can be found in such classic cases as George Adamski, Billy Meiers, Enrique Rincon and more recent cases such as Jay Solomon. I have subsequently heard from others who choose to remain anonymous about their contact experiences. Based on my research I believe that there is an active military-intelligence campaign to suppress information on these `contact' cases, as opposed to `abductions' involving Greys/J-Rods which by and large are allowed to be disseminated in UFO circles. This suppression of contactee reports makes it difficult to gain a sufficiently large sample of cases on which to draw firm conclusions. Nevertheless there is enough information that points to the `Nordic extraterrestrial' contact experience having the following characteristics for the contactee: 1. heightened interest in extraterrestrials; 2. establishing telepathic communication with `Nordics'; 3. physical meeting with Nordics; 4. subsequent physical sightings of Nordic ships; 5. voluntarily going on board of a extraterrestrial ship; and 6. Nordics give assistance to the contactee to disseminate his/her experiences to a wider audience.<br><br>Now this appears to be a classic contact pattern and the thing which strikes me as most significant in this process is that the `contactee' is asked for permission by the `Nordics' when moving through these various stages which is indicative of a high degree of respect for human free will. I believe this is very significant and indicates that the `Nordics' display a key characteristic that indicates that they are capable of being humanity's `true friends' in the sense of philia or brotherly love. This of course contrasts with my earlier comments about humanity and the compulsory nature of the initial interaction with Greys/J-Rods, and leads me to your own rather unique situation.<br><br>You are not doubt aware of the way in which information about your experiences has been allowed to leak out to the general public, and in the way in which you have been allowed to be interviewed by phone and in person by individuals outside of the compartmentalized network of black projects. This is quite unique and I have never heard of any other case where this has occurred, and suggests that you are indeed the subject of an `insider' supported initiative to disclose the extraterrestrial presence on terms that might be considered to be favorable to the Committee of the Majority. One can read many motivations into this but what I see is that this as an effort by the Committee to legitimate the historic decisions they have taken to work with the J-Rods/Greys, and establish agreements based on mutually beneficial projects.<br><br>I am very concerned that the result of a disclosure done in this way will be to legitimate the `spin' on human - extraterrestrial interactions that puts the Committee of the Majority in a favorable light. I suspect that the Committee does not intend to release information on the failed diplomatic negotiations with the `Nordics' involved in the 1954 Eisenhower meeting. This would be most unfortunate since in my view, it is these extraterrestrials that have shown they are most capable of being humanity's true friends, since they recognized that the fruit of any technology agreements would not be beneficial to the human condition simply because we were not yet morally mature enough to deal with this technology. Subsequent history has show the truth of this since all the technology achieved through interaction with the Greys/J-Rods has been kept secret, and we still for instance consume fossil fuels when there are alternative free-energy technologies that are secretly available.<br><br>Public disclosure is more than just revealing information on the secret extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and of the `mutually beneficial' projects that have been embarked upon. Disclosure is a rite of passage which marks an important milestone in human maturation where we enter into the greater galactic community. If the general public is given information about extraterrestrials that is sanitized of any mention of the earlier meetings that occurred with the Nordic extraterrestrials, or casts a negative light on them for their refusal to participate in `mutually beneficial' technology programs, then that would be most unfortunate. What we would have instead is a sanitized disclosure process based on a utilitarian principle of `mutually beneficial' projects, that resulted in much abuse by the Committee of the Majority in terms of how the fruits of these projects were dispersed. The Greys/J-Rods are complicit in this by virtue of their participation in these agreements, even though it was the decision of the Committee of the Majority not to distribute these technologies. This might be simply viewed as the Greys/J-Rods respecting the will of the leaders of the secret political committees set up to interface with the public, yet the behavior of the Greys/J-Rods in the abduction process suggests they are not champions of human free will.<br><br>I hope that by sharing these ethical and exopolitical insights with you, you may incorporate some of these into your efforts to promote a more transparent disclosure process. It appears that you have been chosen by the Committee of the Majority to play a significant role in disclosure of the most important event in recent human history. I hope that the fair mindedness and great integrity you have shown in your responses both to me and to others, influences you in giving some of the issues I have raised a fair hearing in what lies ahead. I feel that Providence has placed you in a unique position and that you have the necessary gifts to promote an outcome for the highest good of all. I wish you well in your efforts.<br><br>In peace and friendship,<br><br>Michael E. Salla, PhD<br><a href="http://www.exopolitics.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.exopolitics.org</a><br></div>
