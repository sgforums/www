            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Curlew Sandpiper</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Calidris ferruginea</span><br>Kedidi Pasir Kendi (Malay)<br><br>Curlew Sandpipers are the only medium-to-small wader in our region with a distinctive down-curved bill. The bill is rather long compared to their body size. They are commonly seen during the migrating season, often in large flocks of hundreds.<br><br>Curlew Sandpipers eat mainly worms, supplemented with bivales, gastropods, crustacea and sometimes seeds. When breeding, they eat mainly insects, especially flies and beetles.<br><br>Curlew Sandpipers forage on wet, soft mud by pecking and probing in an incessant "stitching" motion. They often keep this up for hours, foraging frantically as the tide retreats. They wash their worms before eating them! They feed both during the day and at night, whenever the tidal situation best suits their hunting style.<br><br>They rarely visit freshwater wetlands, foraging almost entirely on intertidal mud and often wade more deeply than other shorebirds.<br><br>When feeding, Curlew Sandpipers mix freely with other small waders but are themselves well dispersed. But they migrate and roost in flocks. They are among the few waders that roost by perching in mangrove trees, but also join mixed species roosts on remote beaches and bare clearings in mangrove forests.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding (June-July):</span> Curlew Sandpipers breed mainly in central Siberia and coasts and islands of the Arctic Sea, a few in Northern Alaska. They put on partial breeding colours before leaving for breeding grounds at the end of winter (mostly the males).<br><br>Curlew Sandpipers nest in high-arctic coastal tundra on elevated areas of rough grass next to bogs and pools. Males usually return to the same nesting site. A male declares his territory with a song flight and slow wingbeats and glides. Only females appear to incubate while the males leave early. Males generally travel further south than females.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> Although Curlew Sandpipers nest in a small area of Siberia, the birds then disperse over a wide area throughout the Old World including Australia and New Zealand. The major migration routes are to Africa; Black and Caspian Seas; Indian subcontinent; and Australasia. Singapore is a stopover on their way further south (August) and on their way back (March/April). They travel long distances non-stop. They winter on muddy, poorly vegetated wetland fringes, mainly coastal mudflats, estuaries, sandy shores, ponds; occasionally, inland swamps. But many non-breeders (mostly first year birds) may remain in their winter range all year.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Curlew Sandpipers are not considered at risk. But like other long-distance migrating waders, Curlew Sandpipers rely on wetlands to build up fat reserves for their marathon journeys.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/219.jpg"><br>Breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/220.jpg"><br>Non-breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/221.jpg"><br>Juvenile<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Medium (18-23cm), slender; bill black, long (3-4cm), slightly decurved; legs black, longish.<br><br>Females generally larger with longer bills.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adult:</span><br>Summer/breeding: head and underparts bright rufous/chestnut; back scaly brown.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Winter/non-breeding:</span> plain grey-brown above.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juvenile:</span> Like winter but with buffy wash on bre<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ast and flanks.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Call:</span> Described as a liquid chreep; gentle liquid rippling chirrup; complex song comprising a series of chatters, trills and whinnies.<br>curlew sandpiper in breeding plumage<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In flight:</span> White wingbar with white rump.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Similar birds:</span> Dunlin (Calidris alpina) a very rare visitor and migrant.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Whimbrel</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Numenius phaeopus</span><br>Kedidi Pisau Raut/Burong Gajah (Malay)<br><br>Whimbrels are large waders with distinctive long down-curved bills. These bills allow them to probe deeply into mud for titbits. And possibly gave rise to one of their Malay names which means "elephant bird"!<br><br>Whimbrels eat mostly burrowing crabs. The next major item on the menu are fish. But they will eat a wide variety of crustaceans, aquatic invertebrates, insects, worms and molluscs. They also snack on seeds, berries and leaves, particularly in late summer as insect populations begin to dwindle.<br><br>Whimbrels probe deeply and move as they feed. They may also pick off food found on the surface. They can take large prey, tearing it to pieces before eating it. In India, they pull fiddler crabs out of their burrows, tear off their larger claw before swallowing the titbit. A muddy food item may be rinsed before it is eaten.<br><br>Whimbrels forage on both mud and sandy surfaces, but avoid very soft mud. They are only found in coastal areas and do not forage inland.<br><br>Whimbrels generally feed alone or in small, spread out parties. At most times of year, they defend some kind of territory. On migration, they maintain a feeding territory that is guarded against other Whimbrels. But Whimbrels roost and migrate in large flocks. They prefer to roost on exposed shoals, tops of mangrove trees or in shallowly flooded clearings in mangroves which face the open sea.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding (May-August):</span> Whimbrels breed in the subarctic and arctic from Iceland across Eurasia, Alaska and Canada. They prefer to nest in boreal or low-arctic moorland and tundra next to the treeline. The male's courtship includes a high circling song flight comprising a prolonged bubbling. They don't have different summer and winter plumage.<br><br>Whimbrel nests are just a shallow depression on the ground, usually concealed in low grass or heather. They may also make a nest on top of a mound of moss or grass that is surrounded at the base with water. The hollow is lined with soft grasses, mosses and lichens. 2-5, usually 4 eggs are laid; these are bluish green to a light olive green with lavender and brown markings. Both parents incubate (22-28 days) and raise the young. As soon as the chicks are dry, they leave the nest and stay hidden among the surrounding vegetation. Both parents care for the chicks until they fledge in 35-40 days.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> Those Whimbrels that visit Singapore breed in Northeast Asia, migrating in winter to India, southern China, Southeast Asia to the Philippines and the Sundas. They migrate with other shorebirds, and often act as a sentinel species. Very wary, Whimbrels are often the first to alert the other birds to danger. Their peak arrival in Singapore is September-November, although a small number may be found throughout the year. Probably because many first year birds may remain in their wintering quarters throughout the summer. During migration, the Whimbrel roosts in mangroves, feeds on mudflats at the tideline with other waders. They may also be found inland, both around wetlands as well as short dry grassland, farmland, golf courses, parks.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Whimbrels are among the most abundant Curlews because of their extensive breeding range. Adult Whimbrels have few natural predators, aside from foxes and larger raptors. Few succumb to predation during migration, probably because they are very vigilant. Human impact is the biggest threat. Whimbrels are affected by habitat loss of nesting sites and refuelling staging posts along the migration route, and pollution of shorelines. In the early 1900s, they were hunted in the US as they migrated south. The slaughter had reduced populations there from thousands to a few hundred. Although hunting is less widespread now, there has been no apparent recovery to pre-hunting levels. They continue to be hunted in their wintering grounds, such as in Thailand.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/235.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">N. p. phaeopus</span> adult<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/236.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">N. p. variegatus</span> adult<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Large (40-46cm); neck longish; bill long (5-9cm), very decurved, pinkish at base; legs medium length bluish-grey; crown dark with prominent whitish supercilium and narrow buff crown stripe.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adult:</span> Crown-stripe more prominent.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Common Sandpiper</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Actitis hypoleucos</span><br>Kedidi Pasir (Malay)<br><br>Common Sandpipers are easily identified by their habit of "teetering": constantly bobbing head and tail while on the ground, particularly when feeding. Their Malay name sounds like their call.<br><br>Common Sandpipers appears to be the least specialised and eat a wide variety of prey: from minute invertebrates to crustacea, worms, insects, spiders, centipedes. They may even scavenge from food scraps thrown out by people from boats or waterside activities.<br><br>Common Sandpipers feed restlessly and deliberately. They run along the water's edge, visually locating prey on the surface and not by probing in the mud. Thus they avoid soft mud and prefer to forage on rocky coastlines and breakwaters. They may even forage in concrete drainage ditches, and inland grasslands. They may also dash after prey that they spot some distance away. They may swim or dive after prey. Prey is often broken up into smaller bite-sized pieces, e.g., crabs.<br><br>Common Sandpipers are abundant but typically feed alone or in pairs, avoiding areas where other more gregarious species feed. But they roost in small groups of about 30 and migrate in flocks.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding (April-July):</span> Common Sandpipers breed in northern Eurasia from the Atlantic across the continent to Central Japan. They usually arrive at their breeding grounds in pairs. Their breeding song is a repeated rising kittie-needie. They prefer to nest near water, including stony and fast flowing rivers, small pools, lakes, sheltered sea coasts. Their nest is usually a shallow hollow on the ground, lined with leaves and plant stalks, under overhanging plants. But sometimes in trees or shrubs, and even on rafts of floating vegetation. 4 yellowish eggs with dark mottling or spots are laid. The male does most of the incubation. (21-23 days). As soon as they are dry, the hatchlings disperse away from the nest to hide among the surrounding vegetation. The male does most of the rearing.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> Common Sandpipers migrate in small groups (rarely more than 200) or alone. They migrate well north, across much of the Old World including Australia, although few reach New Zealand. They are likely to be among the most numerous visiting waders but this is hard to confirm because they are widely dispersed in their winter grounds. They winter in a wide variety of wetlands that offer firm mud, sandy, rocky or grassy surfaces. These include mangroves, coastal dunes, estuaries, rivers, ponds, canals, reservoirs, rice fields.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> The Common Sandpiper (for now) faces no serious threats and are the most widespread and adaptable of shorebirds. Perhaps it is because they can eat a wide range of food.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/225.jpg"><br>In flight<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/222.jpg"><br>Breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/223.jpg"><br>Non-breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/224.jpg"><br>Juvenile<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Small (19-21cm), white eyebrows, brown side of bre<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ast, faintly barred wing coverts; bill short (2-3cm); legs short greenish.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adult:</span><br>Summer/ breeding: Arrow-shaped markings on the back.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Winter/non-breeding:</span> Plain grey-brown back, faint bars on coverts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juvenile:</span> Buff edges to feathers of brown parts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Call:</span> Described as a high-pitched descending piping see-see-see-see or twee-wee-wee in flight.

They focus on small fish. They also eat prawns, molluscs and insects. During breeding season, they feed mainly on insects.<br><br>Greenshanks stalk prey at a steady walk, pecking and probing occasionally. They may dash rapidly through the shallows if they spot a small fish within reach. They feed mainly in shallow water or at the water's edge, preferring soft mud. They feed both during the day and at night, whenever the tidal situation best suits their hunting style.<br><br>Wary birds, Greenshanks may feed alone, or with other waders. Rarely, they may feed in flocks of 20-30, well spread out. However, they roost in large flocks, where available on open ground. At high tide, they prefer to roost on stumps rather than branches in the tree crowns.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding (April-August):</span> Greenshanks nest mainly in taiga and forest zones of the Palaearctic from Scotland, Norway and east across Russia, Siberia to the Bering Sea. Nesting grounds range from moorlands with scattered trees, clearings in coniferous forests, forest marshes dotted with large and small lakes, or treeless upland bogs up to 5,000ft.<br><br>The Greenshank male does a switchback display flight, sometimes at great height. Most are usually faithful to their old nesting site and partner, but some males may mate with two females.<br><br>Greenshanks nest on the ground, usually next to a piece of dead wood. The nest is shallow hollow lined with grass and other plants. 3-5, usually 4 pale yellowish-green eggs with speckles are laid. These are incubated mainly by the female, particularly if the male has two females. They hatch in 23-24 days. As soon as their feathers dry up, the young disperse away from the nest, hiding among the undergrowth. Usually one parent leaves not long after the eggs hatch, leaving the remaining parent to raise the young. Sometimes, the parents split up the chicks between them, raising them separately. The young fledge in 25-31 days.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> In the winter, Greenshanks migrate to the Mediterranean Basin, Persian Gulf, China, South Africa, India, Indochina, Southeast Asia and even Australia. They winter on a wide range of wetland habitats both coastal and inland, but prefer estuaries to the open coast. In Singapore, Greenshanks are found in mangroves, mudflats, estuaries, sandy shores. Also freshwater wetlands: ponds, reservoirs, canals, rice fields, swamps.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Greenshanks are not endangered because their breeding grounds are extensive, and they breed in a wide variety of habitats.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/230.jpg"><br>Breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/231.jpg"><br>Non-breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/232.jpg"><br>Juvenile<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Large (30-36cm); bill long (4-6cm) slightly upturned, pale at the base.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adult:</span><br>Summer/breeding-head and neck heavily streaked, black feathers among grey on back.<br><br>Winter/non-breeding- less heavily streaked neck, back grey.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juvenile:</span> More heavily streaked neck, feathers on the back more broadly edged white, except at tip which is black.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Call:</span> Described as a loud ringing 3-note teu-teu-teu, usually in flight.

They are often mistaken for Greenshanks.<br><br>Marsh Sandpipers eat mainly worms, insect larvae and bivalve.<br><br>To find their prey, Marsh Sandpipers may wade up to their bellies in shallow water, walking briskly and steadily, pecking off titbits on the water surface, or sweeping around on the bottoms with their bills. They appear to prefer soft mud.<br><br>Wary birds, Marsh Sandpipers usually hunt alone, but on rich feeding sites may gather in co-ordinated groups, or join other waders.<br><br>However, they roost in large groups, often with other waders such as Greenshanks. Marsh Sandpipers do not regularly roost in mangroves but are attracted to open clearings in mangroves.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding (April-August):</span> Marsh Sandpipers breed in temperate zones from Southeastern Europe through Russia to Western Siberia and Ussuriland. The courtship song is a repeated tu-ee-u. On breeding grounds, the alarm call is a sharp chip.<br><br>Marsh Sandpipers nest around grassy and muddy shores of freshwater pools in steppes and boreal wetlands with lush grassy vegetation. But they may also tolerate brackish water. Nests may be solitary or in loose colonies with the nests about 10m apart. Both parents incubate and raise the young.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> Most Marsh Sandpipers winter in sub-Saharan Africa and in India; others in Europe. Fewer winter in Southeast Asia and Australia. Marsh Sandpipers tend to fly long distances and don't stop often at passage sites. They usually arrive late and leave early. Non-breeders may stay at the wintering grounds all year, or summer at intermediate sites. They prefer to winter on inland wetlands, both fresh and brackish, sometimes in large numbers of several hundred. In Singapore, they are found on mudflats, sandy shores, ponds, reservoirs and canals.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Marsh Sandpipers are particularly threatened by the overuse of insecticides and herbicides because they tend to forage in cultivated wetlands such as ricefields.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/228.jpg"><br>Juvenile<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/226.jpg"><br>Breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/227.jpg"><br>Non-breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/229.jpg"><br>In flight<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Medium (22-25cm), slender; head small; bill long (3-4cm) straight, needle-like; legs very long greenish-dull yellow.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adult:</span><br>Summer/breeding-Head and neck heavily spotted black becoming chevrons on flanks.<br><br>Winter/non-breeding-Back uniformly grey; darker on shoulders; underparts white.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juvenile:</span> Back feathers notched and edged with buff.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Call:</span> Short, high-pitched metallic tyeuk or yip when in flight.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In flight:</span> Legs protrude well beyond tail-tip; prominent white rump and lower back; no wing bars.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Similar birds:</span><br>Greenshank (Tringa nebularia): similar in flight.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Common Redshank</span></strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Tringa totanus</span><br>Redshank, Kedidi Kaki Dian/Merah (Malay)<br><br>Common Redshanks are quickly identified by their red legs, but confusion can occur if their legs are mud-covered. And juveniles may have greenish-yellow legs.<br><br>During the breeding season, Common Redshanks hunt insects, spiders, worms. The rest of the time, they also eat molluscs and crustaceans, and sometimes small fishes and tadpoles.<br><br>Common Redshanks patrol rocky, muddy or sandy shores walking in an easy continuous fast pace, regularly pecking at the surface. They find their food by sight and only rarely probe into the mud or sand.<br><br>They may also sweep their bills through the water. They follow the outgoing tideline, even wading or swimming into the water to be first to scour the emerging mudflats. They feed both during the day and at night, whenever the tidal situation best suits their foraging style.<br><br>Common Redshanks feed in dense flocks for safety, especially on open areas (mudflats or flooded grasslands) and at high tide. But at low tide, they spread out. Some adults may also defend feeding territories. They also roost together in large flocks, often with other waders.<br><br>Wary and nervous birds, Common Redshanks are often the first to panic and give noisy alarm calls to other nearby waders. When disturbed, they constantly bob their tail. They prefer marine habitats and only visit freshwater wetlands when high tides submerge coastal roosts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding (April-June):</span> Common Redshanks breed across the Pelearctic: Iceland, Britain, much of Europe, the Middle East, and temperate Asia (e.g., the Himalayas up to 4,500m). Common Redshanks are monogamous and pairs will return to the same site and same partner. Male courtship display includes a rising and falling "yodelling" song flight during which he vibrates his wings held downwards below the horizontal.<br><br>Common Redshanks nest on a wide variety of inland and coastal wetland habitats. They are usually breed in high density at coastal saltmarshes, inland damp grasslands, but are also found in swampy moorlands and high grass steppes. They may form loose breeding colonies and are not strongly territorial. In fact, when a predator attacks a nest, all the adults gather from a wide area to mob it.<br><br>The nest is just a shallow depression on the ground, concealed near or under vegetation, e.g., at the base of long grasses, with the grass stems forming a roof. The male builds the base and the female lines it with twigs and leaves. 3-5, average 4, eggs are laid. Both parents incubate, usually 22-25 days. The About a day after they hatch, the young disperse from the nest to feed themselves, although the parents keep a watchful eye on them. Initially, both parents look after the young. But the female usually leaves the breeding site first. The male remains to look after the young until they fledge at about a month old. Sometimes, the parents split up the chicks between them, raising them separately.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> Common Redshanks can be seen in large numbers during migrations, in flocks of up to 80. They are, however, less migratory than others of the Tringa species. Migration distances range from 500 to 6,500km one-way. They usually migrate at night. Some populations in Western Europe and Iceland are resident. Others winter in areas from Africa to the Philippines. In Singapore, they winter on muddy coasts, occasionally inland swamps, avoiding inland and freshwater areas. Their numbers peak around September.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Common Redshanks are not considered endangered. However, their numbers are falling primarily due to the loss of their breeding grounds as these are converted for agriculture and other human uses. On the other hand, grazing by domestic cattle actually helps to create suitable low-grass areas for Common Redshanks to nest.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/233.jpg"><br>Breeding adult<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/234.jpg"><br>Non-breeding adult<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/234d.jpg"><br>At Sungei Buloh in partial breeding plumage<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Medium-sized (27-29cm), slender; legs long and red (becoming redder during breeding); bill (3-5cm) stout with red base black tip; white rump and lower back.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adult:</span> Summer/breeding-Above darker, brown, mottled; below white with bars or streaks on bre<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ast.<br><br>Winter/non-breeding-Above and head and neck grey-brown; below white.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juvenile:</span> Above brown and streaked darker; bill dull reddish brown; legs greenish.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Call:</span> During flight, a loud teu-hoo or teu-hoo-hoo.

They moult mainly at their winter roost and so may arrive in Singapore with traces of their beautiful breeding plumage, and don their breeding colours just before they leave.<br><br>Pacific Golden Plovers eat mainly bivalves and other molluscs on their wintering grounds; as well as worms, crustaceans, spiders. During breeding season; berries are important, with snacks of seeds and leaves.<br><br>Pacific Golden Plovers find their food mainly by sight (as opposed to probing in the ground with their bills). They forage in a peck-and-run method; running quickly in an upright position, pausing to peck, then running again. Their preferred foraging ground is intertidal mudflats. Gregarious birds, Pacific Golden Plovers migrate, feed and roost in large flocks: usually up to 50, but more at good feeding sites.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding:</span> Pacific Golden Plovers breed in Siberian tundra and in West Alaska in June-July. Males usually return to the same nest site, even to the same spot. They form monogamous pairs. Relying on their excellent camouflage to avoid predators, they simply nest on the ground.<br><br>They prefer well-vegetated well-drained tundra, often on hillsides, ridges or raised polygons. The nest is just a shallow scrape lined with lichens. 4 eggs are laid, incubated by both parents (26 days). Soon after hatching, the chicks and parents move off to moist shrubby or grassy tundra. When threatened, the parent distracts the predator from the nest or chicks by pretending to have a broken wing. Both parents raise the young, but if the brood is late, only by the male.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> Phenomenal long-distance travellers, after breeding in the Arctic, these plovers migrate to spend winter almost half way around the world (5,000-13,000km away one-way). Some winter on tiny islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, a feat which requires precise navigation. Alaskan breeders winter in Hawaii, Fiji, South Pacific Islands, all the way to New Zealand. Siberian breeders migrate to Africa, India, Indochina, Southeast Asia all the way to Australia. Most winter on coastal mudflats, beaches, reefs. But they may also be found inland on short grasslands (such as airfields) or around freshwater pools, lakes, rivers, marshes, rice fields.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Like other waders, Pacific Golden Plovers are threatened by habitat destruction and water pollution.

These include insects, spiders and shrimps.<br><br>Their hunting style is a characteristic hesitant stop-run-peck, in a hunched position, usually higher up on the shore on drier sand or mud. They are often observed "foot-trembling", standing on one foot while rapidly vibrating the toes of the other foot on the surface. A few seconds later they run forward to peck at something. Probably, this vibration disturbs prey to betray their presence.<br><br>Little Ringed Plovers prefer to forage on tidal mudflats, shallow flood pools, open short-grasslands or even bare soil.<br><br>The wary Little Ringed Plovers often scatter to forage. They rarely join other waders in their mass flights or roosts. Usually territorial, they chase off other Little Ringed Plovers or small plovers from good feeding sites. Nevertheless, they may form small flocks of a dozen or so when moving and migrating. Their flight is rapid direct and low over the ground.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding:</span> Little Ringed Plovers breed in temperate to low arctic Eurasia from the Atlantic to Japan, as well as in Africa, China, northern continental Asia, the Philippines and New Guinea. Little Ringed Plovers perform courtship display flights of butterfly-like movements, with the male endlessly circling with slow and deliberate wing-beats. Although courtship is noisy, when the pair finally nest, they become secretive.<br><br>Little Ringed Plovers nest mainly on gravely river banks, lake shores or small islands, usually near fresh water. But they have also adapted to industrial sites. These include gravel works and rubbish tips!<br><br>Although usually solitary, some may be semi-colonial, nesting about 9m apart. They appear to purposely nest near aggressive shorebirds whose behaviour helps to keep predators away. The nest is simply a shallow scrape, sometimes lined with plants or stones.<br><br>3-4 eggs are laid and both parents incubate (22-28 days). Besides the parents, sometimes another bird (or even two) may help out with incubation, raising the young and even defending the territory. These helpers may be male or female and are believed to be the offspring or former partners from the previous season. The chicks are highly active, running quickly on their long legs. To distract predators from their eggs or chicks, the parents use the "broken wing" feint. The young fledge in 24-29 days, but the female may depart before that to lay another clutch of eggs or to migrate.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/203.jpg"><br>The eggs are very well camouflaged against their gravely nest site.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> Little Ringed Plovers are migratory over most of their range, although those that breed in some southern areas are resident. They winter southwards of their breeding sites, on muddy shores both inland and coastal. In Singapore, they are found on mangroves, mudflats, sand bars, ponds, reservoirs, marshes, grassland, riverbanks.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Little Ringed Plovers are adaptable to different feeding grounds during their migration. However, their breeding sites are affected by man-made changes that affect river flows. Nesting is disrupted by unseasonal flooding of gravel banks. On the other hand, lack of natural flooding also prevents the renewal of gravel beds, and they become overgrown and unsuitable nesting sites for these plovers. However, the birds usually recover quickly; often laying again days after losing their eggs or chicks. They also readily take over man-made sites such as gravel works, sewerage farms, beet factory settling ponds and even shingle roofs. Nevertheless, their numbers have declined and they are included in the Red List of some countries where they were previously abundant.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/213.jpg"><br>Breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/214.jpg"><br>Non-breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/215.jpg"><br>Juvenile<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Small (14-19cm); neck ring white unbroken; bill small (1-2cm); legs pinkish; bright yellow eye ring.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adult:</span> Summer/breeding-Bill black, yellow on mandible at the base; forehead white with black band separated from brown crown by narrow white border; brea<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>st band black.

During breeding, they feed on insects.<br><br>Unlike other plovers which use the run-and-peck method, the Mongolian uses the "sewing-machine" feeding action more commonly used by sandpipers.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Grey Heron</strong> </span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ardea cinera</span><br>Pucong Seriap (Malay)<br><br>The Grey Heron is the largest bird in Singapore, standing at 1m tall with a wingspan of 2m.<br><br>Grey Herons eat whatever they can catch: fish, amphibians, arthropods (insects, spiders), crustacea (crabs), and even small mammals (rodents), reptiles (hatchling turtles), small birds (catching these on the wing). They are not above scavenging, and stealing prey caught by other birds (e.g., the Purple Heron).<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/237a.jpg"><br><br>Grey Herons have long necks and powerful bills for a long and strong reach. They usually wait on the mud or at the water's edge to snatch passing aquatic prey. They can stand motionless for hours. Or they may wade slowly through shallow water or on mud freshly exposed by the tide. They may also stalk fish. They may even dive into deeper water. In Europe, some even follow farm ploughs to catch whatever is unearthed or flushed out in the process.<br><br>Although Grey Herons roost and nest in groups, they hunt alone. But when prey is plentiful, they may<br>feed in groups, evenly spaced out. They are most active at dawn and dusk.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/237d.jpg"><br><br>Small prey is tossed back into the bill alive. Larger ones are shaken or stabbed to death then manipulated to be eaten head first. Those too large to swallow whole are discarded.<br><br>In the Thai-Malay peninsula, mangroves are the Grey Herons' preferred place for hunting, roosting and breeding. Mangroves have the shallow waters and mudflats that their hunting style is best suited to, and the tall trees they like to roost and nest in. They are also found on the coast and occasionally in freshwater wetlands and grasslands further inland.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding:</span> Grey Herons breed from the low arctic to the tropics. In the Thai-Malay peninsula, Grey Herons appear to breed year-round. Courting rituals include a courting call, clappering of bills and displays of erected plumes with neck stretching and wing flapping.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/237c.jpg"><br><br>Grey Herons generally nest in colonies. Preferred nest sites are tall emergent trees, even dead ones. Their nests are large (40-45 cm wide) platforms solidly built out of sticks and lined with grass or fresh leafy branches. The males find and bring nesting materials to the females: the giving and receiving of sticks is done with lots of ritual. It is the female who does most of the actual construction.<br><br>3-6, usually 4, large greenish blue eggs are laid. Incubation takes 24-27 days. The young fledge in 7 weeks-3 months. Both parents feed and look after the young, who tug at their parents' bills to get them to regurgitate food for them. There is intense sibling rivalry and one may kill another, and even eat it.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/237e.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migrants:</span> Some Grey Herons that breed in the north migrate to the tropics, sometimes going beyond the range of resident, breeding tropical Grey Herons.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Grey Herons in Singapore are vulnerable to the loss of breeding grounds as mangroves and other suitable habitats are cleared. It is estimated that there are only 10 breeding colonies in the Thai-Malay peninsula, and the heronry at Sungei Buloh is one of these. In Singapore, there are about 250 individuals (as at 1997). They are found mainly on the northern coast of the island and appear most active in the Kranji area which includes Sungei Buloh Nature Park. For more details and photos on the colony at Sungei Buloh, check out Heronry: Home of the Herons. Elsewhere in the world, Grey Herons are hunted as food and as a pest on fish farms and competitors for game fish. They are also affected by pollution, pesticides and habitat destruction.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/237b.jpg"><br>Non-breeding<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/237.jpg"><br>Breeding<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Tall (90cm-1m, 1.5kgs).

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Purple Heron</strong></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ardea purpurea</span><br>Pucung Serandau (Malay)<br><br>The Purple Heron is the most colourful large heron in Sungei Buloh Nature Park, with a distinctive snake-like neck which is usually held in a prominent kink. Its colourful plumage actually provides excellent camouflage among the reeds.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/273d.jpg"><br><br>Purple Herons feed mainly on fish, but will also eat insects, amphibians, and occasionally shellfish, small mammals, reptiles and even small birds.<br><br>Purple Herons are shy and solitary hunters, and appear to hunt mostly at night continuing into the early morning. They don't often wade in deep water and prefer to stand-and-wait in cover, staying motionless for long periods in shallow water or perched on low dense trees and bushes. Their slim bills are large and strong enough to kill even large snakes. Their long necks give them a long and powerful reach.<br><br>One reason for their shyness could be because Grey Herons (Ardea cinera) often steal the Purple Herons' catch when they are hunting close to each other. Purple Herons become even more shy during breeding season, preferring to hunt near cover. Purple Herons defend their feeding territory from each other by aggressively puffing out neck feathers and raising crests.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/273f.jpg"><br><br>While Purple Herons prefer to roost in coastal areas (mangroves, marshes, estuaries), they prefer to feed in freshwater wetlands. In Singapore, however, they are mostly associated with mangroves and the coast. Although in world-wide distribution, they are more widespread than the Grey Heron, the Purple Heron is less tolerant of disturbed and artificial habitats.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Breeding:</span> Purple Herons are resident and breed from the tropics to mid-temperate countries. In Singapore, they appear to breed year-round with a peak in April-June. During breeding season, their colours brighten up and brea<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>st plumes become more pendulous. Courtship displays include fluffing up their neck feathers in elaborate gestures.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/273b.jpg"><br><br>Purple Herons nest in small colonies, often with other heron species. Some may nest alone. Preferred nest sites are dense reedbeds and thick vegetation where they pull down the reeds to make a platform. In Singapore, they nest at the base of dense Mangrove Ferns (Acrostichum sp.). They also nest in trees on a platform of twigs. The males find and bring nesting materials to the females, who do the actual construction of the nest. 2-5 pale blue-green eggs are laid. Incubation takes about 25 days and the young fledge in about 3 months. Both parents feed and look after the young, who tug at their parents' bills to get them to regurgitate titbits. There is intense sibling rivalry and often the younger chicks starve to death. They breed at about 1 year of age, and may live up to 23 years.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/273g.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Migration:</span> Those that breed far north migrate to spend the winter in Southeast Asia, including Singapore. Purple Herons fly with their necks folded back onto their shoulders, giving them a pouched or keeled look. In the past, migrants outnumbered breeders in Singapore, some coming as far away as from Russia. But now, breeders appear well established, particularly in Sungei Buloh Nature Park. For more details and photos on the colony at Sungei Buloh, check out Heronry: Home of the Herons.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status and threats:</span> Purple Herons are not considered as threatened as some other herons in Singapore because they are widespread and able to adapt to a wide range of breeding conditions. However, they are also affected by habitat destruction and water pollution. Populations in the Malay peninsula are hunted and also harassed by people who raid their nests for their eggs.<br><br><img src="http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/photos/273c.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Main features:</span> Tall (90-97cm). Plumage purplish-brown; long black crest; neck snakelike, white or cream with black line down the sides; bill yellow; legs and toes orange-yellow.<br><br>Bre<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ast plumes pendulous in breeding adults. Genders look alike.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juvenile:</span> Dull brown plumage; lacks crest, bre<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>ast plumes and black markings; streaked neck and underparts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Call:</span> Described as a loud resonant croak kranck; a staccato kar-kar-kar at the nest or when taking off.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In flight:</span> Blackish flight feathers, little contrast with dark grey-brown wings and back.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Status in Singapore:</span> Common resident and winter visitor throughout the island, as well as North and South offshore islands.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">World distribution:</span> Throughout the Old World in the tropical and warm temperate zones.
