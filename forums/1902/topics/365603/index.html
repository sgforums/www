              <p><cite class="vcard">by NINIEK KARMINI, Associated Press Writer        <span class="fn org">Niniek Karmini, Associated Press Writer</span> </cite> – Tue Jun 23, 6.15 am ET</p>
              <p>BANDUNG,
                      Indonesia – Indonesian scientists are reconstructing the largest, most
                      complete skeleton of a prehistoric giant elephant ever found in the
                      tropics, a finding that may offer new clues into the largely mysterious
                      origins of its modern Asian cousin.</p>
              <p>The
                      prehistoric elephant is believed to have been submerged in quicksand
                      shortly after dying on a riverbed in Java around 200,000 years ago. Its
                      bones — almost perfectly preserved — were discovered by chance in March
                      when an old sand quarry collapsed during monsoon rains.</p>
              <p>The
                      animal stood four meters (13-feet) tall, five meters (16-feet) long and
                      weighed more than 10 tons — closer in size to the woolly mammoth of the
                      same period than to the great Asian mammals now on Earth.<a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: none ! important; position: static;"></a></p>
              <p>Animal fossils are rare in the humid, hot climate of the equator because decomposition occurs extremely quickly.</p>
              <p>Following
                      a monthlong excavation, a team of seven paleontologists from the
                      Geology Museum in Bandung, West Java, set the bones in plaster for the
                      trip back to their office where they will be laboriously pieced back
                      together.</p>
              <p>"We believe from the shape of its
                      teeth that it was a very primitive elephant," but little else has been
                      verified, said paleontologist Fachroel Aziz, who is heading a 12-strong
                      skeletal reconstruction team.</p>
              <p>Scientists agree
                      it is the first time an entire prehistoric elephant skeleton has been
                      unearthed since vertebrate fossil findings began to be recorded in
                      Indonesia in 1863.</p>
              <p>"It is very uncommon to
                      discover a fossil like this in a tropical region like Indonesia," said
                      Edi Sunardi, an independent expert at Indonesia's Pajajaran University
                      in Bandung, West Java. "It apparently was covered by volcanic sediment
                      that protected it from high temperatures, erosion and decay."</p>
              <p>The
                      next challenge will be removing the delicate bones from their molds and
                      joining them into a stable, upright structure, a process that experts
                      said is already being hampered by a lack of funding, inadequate tools
                      and poor expertise.</p>
              <p>Indonesia, an emerging and
                      impoverished democracy of 235 million people, cannot afford to allocate
                      more than a token sum to its aging museums, even for projects that have
                      the potential to advance knowledge about the origin of key native
                      species.</p>
              <p>Gert van den Berg, a researcher at
                      Australia's Wollongong University who helped dig up the skeleton, said
                      tests are under way to determine its precise age and species, and that
                      they will help provide details "about when the modern elephants evolved
                      into what they are now."</p>
              <p>About 2,000 old
                      elephant remains have been found across the island nation over the past
                      150 years, but never in such good condition, Aziz said.</p>
              <p>"We want to exhibit it publicly because this is a spectacular discovery," he said.</p>
