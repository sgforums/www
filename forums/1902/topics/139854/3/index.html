He is likely to have died from dengue haemorrhagic fever, or DHF, a severe form of the disease that usually hits patients who have already suffered one or more previous bouts of dengue.<br><br>Health Ministry records show a sharp rise in DHF cases, although they still make up only about 3.5 per cent of all dengue cases here. There were 11 DHF infections here last week. This time last year, there was an average of three cases per week.<br><br>Meanwhile, the war against dengue is hotting up in laboratories across Singapore. A multi-centre research project launched recently, nicknamed Early Dengue or Eden, has scientists working to test kits that can detect the disease more quickly.<br><br>Most affordable tests can detect the disease only five to seven days after infection, but researchers are testing a tool developed by the Environmental Health Institute (EHI) that can detect it within hours of a patient falling sick.<br><br>Commercially available kits that use the same technique, known as polymerase chain reaction or PCR, cost about $100 per test, beyond the reach of many patients.<br><br>The new EHI tests, says the institute's head Ng Lee Ching, are likely to cost a fraction of the price of current PCR kits, though prices haven't been decided yet.<br><br>The Eden project also hopes to collect data on the early manifestation of the disease.<br><br>'Since dengue is usually diagnosed only five to seven days after a patient has fever, very little is known about how the disease progresses in adults in the early stages,' said principal investigator Adrian Ong from TTSH. 'That's what we hope to address.'<br><br>Dr Ong's team has already collected samples from 200 patients from Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic, 50 of whom later tested positive for dengue.<br><br>Only adults who have had fever for less than three days are eligible to take part in the study, which offers free dengue tests.<br><br>As part of the study, these patients had to return twice to the polyclinic to give blood, once three days after their first test and again after two weeks, so that researchers can track how the body reacts as the disease progresses.<br><br>In the long term, Eden researchers hope the genetic data collected from blood samples of infected patients could one day be used to devise drugs to fight the disease. There are currently no treatments or vaccines.<br><br>The Genome Institute of Singapore and the Novartis Institute of Tropical Diseases (NITD) are working on this aspect of the project.<br><br>'We are trying to understand what makes different people react differently to the same virus,' said Dr Subhash Vasudevan, who heads NITD's dengue unit.<br><br>radhab@sph.com.sg<br></div>

Radha Basu finds out more about this wily insect<br><br>The Aedes Aegypti and Aedes Albopictus mosquitoes, which cause dengue, are among more than 50 species of mosquitoes found in Singapore. They can be easily identified by their characteristic black-and-white stripes.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-09-09/h2b.jpg"><br>BRED IN CAPTIVITY: The Aedes Albopictus pupae bred in the research lab of the Environmental Health Institute at the Science Park. -- STEPHANIE YEOW<br><br>Aedes mosquitoes usually breed in clean, still pools of water, but they can breed in drain water and muddy water too. A film of water the size of a 20-cent coin is enough for a mosquito to lay eggs.<br><br>In the wild, it lives for about two weeks.<br>On average, a female mosquito lays 300 eggs during its life.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-09-09/h2c.jpg"><br>GROWING MENACE: Larvae of the Aedes Albopictus and Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which spread dengue, in the research lab. -- STEPHANIE YEOW<br><br>Aedes mosquitoes bite most often at dawn and dusk, and are generally active throughout the day. The malaria-causing Culex mosquito, on the other hand, is usually active at night.<br><br>Aedes mosquitoes thrive in warmer weather. Studies have shown that the length of time required for them to grow from an egg into an adult insect decreases dramatically as the temperature rises. At 15 deg C for example, it takes more than 40 days, but at 30 deg C, it takes only a week. However, in extreme heat, the gestation period increases again.<br><br>Higher temperatures also mean the dengue virus can replicate or multiply faster inside the mosquito.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-09-09/h2d.jpg"><br>WELL-FED: The Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes bred in the lab get sugar solution with vitamin B12. -- STEPHANIE YEOW<br><br>An Aedes mosquito is a strong flier - a recent local study found that they can cover up to 740m, which means it can cover several Housing Board blocks.<br><br>The mosquito can even reach homes in higher floors. A recent study by the Environmental Health Institute found Aedes mosquitoes on the 21st storey of a vacant Housing Board block where the lifts were not in operation.<br><br>An Aedes mosquito is usually infected by the dengue virus by biting an infected person. The virus needs to incubate in the mosquito for at least seven days before it can be transmitted.<br><br>Transmission is also through mosquito bites. An infected person shows signs of dengue - typically the abrupt onset of high fever - between two and 14 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.<br><br>Adult female mosquitoes carrying the virus can infect their eggs. However, the chances of this happening are very low.<br><br>Homes account for 55 per cent of all Aedes mosquito breeding sites.<br><br>Breeding has risen sharply in common Housing Board areas such as common corridors in HDB estates, rooftops and pump rooms. These areas now account for 36 per cent of all breeding sites, up from 21 per cent last year. These areas are under the purview of the town councils.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sept 9, 2005<br>It's more serious the second time around<br><br>By Salma Khalik<br>HEALTH CORRESPONDENT<br><br>IF YOU have a raging fever and have suffered from dengue before, get to a doctor fast - and tell him about your previous attack.<br><br>People suffering a second attack of dengue not only tend to get more sick, but they are also more prone to developing the potentially fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever.<br><br>Alerting your doctor quickly could make a difference in your treatment, said infectious disease expert Lee Cheng Chuan.<br><br>There are four strains of dengue virus. Once you have been infected by one strain, you are immune to it for life. But you can still catch the other three strains.<br><br>The National Environment Agency said the current dominant virus is Strain 3. Last year, it was Strain 1. In 2003, it was Strain 2.<br><br>This means people who got dengue in the past two years are susceptible in the current outbreak.<br><br>Dr Lee, a consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said the body needs five days to develop antibodies to fight the dengue virus.<br><br>People who have had a previous bout of dengue already have dengue-fighting antibodies.<br><br>Because the different strains are fairly similar, the antibody will bind to the virus. Unfortunately, because they are not exactly identical, the antibody is not able to neutralise the invader.<br><br>Instead, by binding to the virus, it opens a pathway for the virus to attack the body more quickly.<br><br>This is why someone suffering from a second attack of dengue tends to be more sick than someone getting it for the first time.<br><br>The same goes for babies less than a year old whose mothers have had dengue before giving birth to them. Babies retain their mother's antibodies for a year.<br><br>But there is some good news for second time sufferers. It is extremely rare for anyone to get a third attack of dengue.<br><br>Dr Lee said one theory is that the two sets of dengue antibodies give cross-protection against the remaining strains.<br><br>There is no vaccine or medication for dengue, which is why measures to prevent Aedes mosquitoes breeding are so crucial.<br><br>So far this year, the infection rate is at an all-time high, averaging more than 1,000 new cases a month. Four out of five patients need to be hospitalised.<br><br>Eight people have died from the disease this year.<br><br>Dr Lee said the earlier a patient is diagnosed with dengue and treatment is started, the less likely he is to get dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome.<br><br>Doctors monitor the patient's platelet count. If this goes too low, he needs to get platelet transfusion. They also keep an eye on the amount of blood. If this falls by 20 per cent, the patient is considered to be suffering from DHF.<br><br>They then need blood or other fluid transfusion. Otherwise, their vital organs may suffer from a lack of oxygen and may fail.<br><br>If their blood pressure falls to a dangerous level, they could go into shock and die.<br><br>NEA seeks blood, saliva samples<br>RESIDENTS of two HDB blocks in Sims Avenue have been asked to volunteer samples of their blood and saliva to find out how many people get dengue without showing any obvious symptoms.<br><br>Researchers from the National Environment Agency (NEA) hope to get about 100 participants among residents of Block 830 and 832 in Sims Avenue, a known hotspot for dengue.<br><br>Just last week alone, 20 people staying in that area were hit.<br><br>If they volunteer, officers will visit their homes to collect a cheek swab of saliva and 5ml of blood this weekend. All samples will then be analysed for antibodies against dengue, which will indicate infection in the past two months.<br><br>Studies abroad have shown that a certain proportion of infected people do not develop full-blown dengue fever, said Dr Ng Lee Ching, who mooted the study. Instead, they may have just a mild fever, she said.<br><br>But these overseas studies give a range of between 10 per cent and 90 per cent of people being asymptomatic.<br><br>Dr Ng, head of the NEA's environmental health institute, added: 'That's a huge difference and we would like to determine what the local situation is. Knowing this figure may help us in bettering vector control.'<br><br>LEE HUI CHIEH<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sept 11, 2005<br>Three theories on why dengue is out of control<br><br>Fumigation not effective as it does not kill enough mosquitoes<br><br>Foreign workers may have introduced a few strain here<br><br>Because of the successful drive in the 1970s, people now lack immunity<br><br>By Jeremy Au Yong<br><br>FOR the fourth week in a row, dengue cases have surged to record-breaking levels.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-09-11/p7_1.jpg"><br>PHOTO: AP<br><br>This week, more than 600 cases were reported in just five days, from Tuesday to Saturday. It surpasses last week's 546, 493 of the week before and 414 from before that.<br><br>With these mounting figures, the total number of dengue cases so far this year has gone beyond 9,000, including eight dead. This is more than double that of last year for the same period.<br><br>Many of the measures deployed to eradicate the 1973 epidemic in which 26 people died - extensive fogging, strict law enforcement and diligent inspection of premises - are still practised today. So, why are they not working now?<br><br>Experts give The Sunday Times three theories on how the war on dengue has changed.<br><br><strong>Fumigation does not work</strong><br><br>THAT'S because it does not kill enough of the Aedes mosquitoes. This point was made back in 1998 by Dr Paul Reiter, who was then chief entomologist of the dengue branch in the United States-based Centre for Disease Control. He said, after reviewing Singapore's Aedes control programme, that fogging killed only a small number of mosquitoes, took too much effort and money, and gave people the impression there was a quick fix.<br><br>Epidemiologist Duane Gubler - deemed by his peers as 'the grandfather of dengue' for his pioneering work in dengue prevention - agrees.<br><br>'Fumigation as it is now practised, is not effective in controlling, let alone preventing dengue transmission,' he said on the phone from Hawaii where he is the director of the Asia-Pacific Institute for Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases.<br><br>Dr Gubler's research in dengue control - done in the 1980s - forms the basis for the World Health Organisation's (WHO) current global strategy against dengue.<br><br>'The mosquito you are targeting is an indoor species that rests in closets where the insecticide rarely penetrates,' he said.<br><br>He added that fogging had worked in the Americas in the 1950s because DDT was used - an insecticide that was residual so it continued to work even after the fogging. The poison is banned in Singapore.<br><br>Dr Chusak Prasittisuk, WHO's regional adviser for vector-borne diseases in South-east Asia, said: 'Fogging works only in certain situations - if you do it at the right time, at the right place. The best way is still to go after and destroy the mosquito-breeding sites.'<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-09-11/p7_2.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>New dengue virus strain</strong><br><br>FOUR strains of dengue are currently known and Dr Gubler believes it is likely a new strain has entered Singapore. The new strain could have been introduced via foreign workers who were infected in their home countries. There are over 500,000 foreigners here on work permits and many come from dengue-prone countries such as Malaysia, India, Indonesia and the Philippines.<br><br><strong>Low immunity</strong><br><br>THIS is the paradox of the fight against dengue: Win the fight and you will be more vulnerable next time. Because Singapore did such a good job at eradicating the disease in the 1970s, experts say locals lack immunity against it.<br><br>Said Dr Chusak, based in New Delhi: 'The mosquitoes now have a higher probability of biting a non-immune human in their lifetime. As a result, fewer mosquitoes are required to spread an epidemic.'<br><br>A study in 2001 by epidemiologist Ooi Eng Eong showed that immunity levels here were low. Dr Ooi found that only 7 per cent of children aged between six and 15 have dengue antibodies. In contrast, a similar study in Thailand found the antibodies in over 70 per cent of school children.<br><br>The experts stressed that the best way to fight dengue is to target mosquito-breeding areas - any spot for even a small amount of water to collect.<br><br>Singaporeans are urged to change the water in vases daily, remove water that collects in plant pot plates every other day and to add granular insecticide into containers, vases and roof gutters.<br><br>When leaving for a trip overseas, they should cover the toilet bowls and overturn pails and watering cans.<br><br>Associate Professor Mary Ng, a microbiologist, who will be chairing a regional dengue conference at the end of the month, said: 'Until we can get a vaccine, everyone must do his best to go after the mosquitoes. That is the only way to beat the disease.'<br><br>jeremyau@sph.com.sg<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sept 17, 2005<br>Asia's mosquito menace<br><br>Governments are stepping up measures to curb spread of dengue<br><br>ALL over Asia, governments are scrambling to curtail the spread of dengue with the agenda topped by efforts to educate the public about the illness and control mosquito breeding areas such as stagnant pools.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-09-17/26.jpg"><br>PUBLIC ENEMY: The dengue-causing Aedes mosquito has struck fear into the hearts of many.<br><br>Thailand is advising its citizens to sleep under mosquito nets; the Philippines is urging local officials to keep an adequate supply of blood for transfusions.<br><br>The US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention called dengue this year's 'most important mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans' - ahead of malaria and encephalitis - with an estimated 2.5 billion people at risk worldwide.<br><br>The illness causes severe fever and can lead to vomiting, nausea and body rash. It can cause severe pain in the joints. Also called bone-breaker's disease, some dengue strains cause internal bleeding and death.<br><br>Dr Kevin Palmer, a mosquito-borne diseases expert of the World Health Organisation (WHO) who is based in Manila, said Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines all had a large number of dengue cases this year.<br><br>But Dr Palmer is most perplexed by the spike in Singapore, a highly-urbanised tropical city-state where at least 9,540 people have been hit with the virus for the year up to Sept 12, surpassing the previous record of 9,459 set for the whole of last year.<br><br>And for a disease that afflicts an estimated 50 million worldwide annually, according to the WHO, there remains no drug or known remedy. Most cases are reported in Africa, Asia and South America.<br><br>'It is largely a developing world's disease,' said Dr Subash Vasudevan, head of the dengue research unit at the Novartis Institute of Tropical Diseases in Singapore.<br><br>Governments have turned to various programmes to curb the virus' spread:<br><br>Thailand is teaching people to clear stagnant water by emptying containers around the home every seven days, to sleep in mosquito nets and to wear repellent, said Dr Chaiporn Rojanawatsirivet of the Public Health Ministry.<br><br>In the Philippines, an Aug 15 alert was issued after more than 100 villages were found to have clusters of cases.<br><br>Local governments have been asked to intensify educational campaigns about dengue fever, organise mosquito-control systems, ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment, have enough blood supplies for transfusions and increase surveillance of cases.<br><br>The disease has sickened 18,802 people in the Philippines through Sept 11 - a 26 per cent rise over the same period from a year ago. At least 259 people have died.<br><br>In Sri Lanka, a campaign asking residents to keep their premises clean and empty pots of stagnant water has seen infections drop to just over 3,000 so far this year, from 15,365 for all of last year.<br><br>Indonesia has recorded some 538 deaths while in Vietnam, the number of cases are down but some central provinces are showing an increase because of drought that has forced villagers to keep water in open containers. -- ASSOCIATED PRESS<br><br></div>

Lee Hui Chieh and Judith Tan find out more.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-09-20/mybfront2109t.jpg"><br>The dengue-carrying Aedes mosquito bites only during the day, breeds in clean water and can fly a distance of just 50m to 100m.<br><br>Not necessarily so, says Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA). Research by the agency's Environmental Health Institute has shown that the Aedes mosquito can bite at night under artificial light, can breed in water contaminated by repellent and can fly as far as 740m.<br><br>When push comes to shove, the enemy will adapt. And scientists have found mosquitoes to be quick at adapting to a changing environment.<br><br>There are two known dengue-spreading Aedes mosquitoes here: the Aedes aegypti and the Aedes albopictus.<br><br>Both have black and white stripes on their legs but the aegypti has two lyre-shaped silvery markings on its body, while the albopictus has one central line running down its body.<br><br>The aegypti is seen as a bigger menace than the albopictus as it tends to be found more often indoors than outdoors and as it tends to take multiple bites, often from different people, instead of just one bite like the albopictus.<br><br>The Aedes mosquito is usually thought of as being active during daylight hours, with the peak biting periods being dawn and dusk.<br><br>But studies have shown that it bites under artificial lighting too, so people at home and in offices at night may not be as safe from dengue as they think.<br><br>Another study has demonstrated how the Aedes mosquito can adapt to poor breeding conditions.<br><br>It usually lays eggs in clean stagnant water, avoiding dirty water. However, the study found that mosquitoes bred in water contaminated with repellent grew up to not exhibit any preference - dirty water no longer bothered them.<br><br>This means that if the mosquito has no choice, it could lay eggs in dirty water, breeding a new generation that will not have any problems doing so.<br><br>In another study published last year, the institute's medical entomologist and researcher, Dr Christina Liew, found that the Aedes mosquito can fly as far as 740m and as high as a 21-storey building, or 60m high.<br><br>She released female mosquitoes that had been fed blood with a special marker and tracked where they laid their eggs. The mosquitoes' mouths had been sealed shut with super glue to ensure they died after laying their eggs.<br><br>In a rural area, where there was just open land, the marked eggs were found as far as 740m away from the place where the mosquitoes had been released. In an urban area with buildings, they were found 568m away.<br><br>In an unused apartment block with no working lift, they were found quite evenly distributed over the building's 21 floors.<br><br>It had long been believed that the Aedes mosquito operated over much shorter distances and at lower heights.<br><br>'We have removed a lot of their breeding sites so they are now forced to fly further to find suitable sites,' explained Dr Liew.<br><br>'It's possible for them to adapt to conditions that were previously thought to be unfavourable, and that's why although vector control is so good, mosquitoes continue to breed.'<br><br>The current breed of mosquitoes is a result of selection and adaptation, said Associate Professor Rudolf Meier from the biological sciences department at the National University of Singapore.<br><br>'Every time we generate a new environment, some genetic strains of the mosquito will have a breeding advantage over others that are not as good at using the resources in the environment. The mosquitoes with the better means of exploiting the resources will replace those that are less capable,' he said.<br><br>'Is this through learning? No. Mosquitoes have little chance to learn. They never meet their parents and live for only a few weeks. But there is plenty of evidence that sophisticated behaviour can have a genetic basis.'<br><br>He added that when a population of mosquitoes is treated with insecticides, a small fraction of them will be naturally resistant to the chemical.<br><br>'Given that most of the 'normal' mosquitoes would have been killed by the insecticide, the few resistant survivors would have all the breeding sites in the environment at their disposal. They very rapidly rebuild the population, which now consists of mosquitoes that have genes conferring resistance to the insecticides and treating this population with the same insecticide again will be largely ineffective,' he explained.<br><br>He suggests that the only way around the problem is to resort to fogging and spraying only during a dengue outbreak. This will quickly reduce the size of the mosquito population to prevent infection.<br><br>'Fogging during an outbreak in the affected area is a good idea as long as it still kills any of the adult mosquitoes. The chance of getting infected is largely proportional to the number of mosquitoes in the area; that is, even a relatively small reduction in numbers can make a difference.<br><br>'Fogging in areas without an outbreak is more problematic because the fogging starts a selection process for resistance. Once the population has a high proportion of resistant mosquitoes, it will be difficult to reduce the number of adults quickly when an outbreak occurs,' he said.<br><br>Regular fogging, he said, will kill not only the mosquitoes but also their natural enemies, making the mosquito problem more serious. 'This leaves a stronger and more lethal mosquito population that would be increasingly difficult to deal with.'<br><br>The NEA is looking into how to enhance measures to deal with new information about the mosquito's behaviour.<br><br>So, what does all this mean for the individual?<br><br>'Don't be complacent about where the mosquito can be found; it could be in your home,' Dr Liew said.<br><br>The war continues.<br><br>E-mail: huichieh@sph.com.sg<br>juditht@sph.com.sg<br><br></div>
