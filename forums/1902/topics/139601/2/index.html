Stop catching colds</strong><br><br>As much as possible, avoid coming into close contact with infected persons, especially if they cough or sneeze.<br><br>A person with a cold is extremely contagious: he or she fills the air with fine particles of saliva or mucous which transport the virus microbe. Even if the person is careful to wipe his nose with tissue or a handkerchief, the microbes will be transported to his hands.<br><br>And studies have shown that these viruses are transmitted through hand contact. So if you have to shake hands with someone who has a cold, you would better wash soon after!<br><br>What can you do if you do catch a cold?<br><br>It is useless to take antibiotics: they have no effect on viruses. However, there are certain substances found in alcohol which help decongest sinuses, that is why a good hot toddy can work wonders. But take care of your liver: a toddy is just as good with a little rum as with a lot.<br><br>You donÂ’t have to get drunk to get better. You donÂ’t even have to drink it - just sniff some strong alcohol like cognac or brandy and breathe in the fumes.</div>

The strongest anti-oxidizing agent is Vitamin E, which is found in wheat germ oil and sunflower seeds.<br><br>Next comes Vitamin C (oranges, grapefruits, lemons, red peppers etc.).<br><br>Beta carotene also absorbs large amounts of radical liberals. This substance seems to act as a protecting agent against most types of cancer.<br><br>Where do you find it? In red vegetables (like tomatoes), orange ones (carrots), yellow (squash), and dark green (broccoli). All these are rich in beta carotene. So make them a regular part of your menu!</div>
