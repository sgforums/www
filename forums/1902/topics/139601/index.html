How to fight aging</strong><br><br>Did you know that just walking for 30 minutes, 3 or 4 times a week is enough to combat aging?<br><br>According to researchers at the University of California, one of the principle causes of deterioration of the human organismÂ’s physical faculties is its diminished ability to metabolize glucose. And they showed that even leisurely exercise, like taking a walk, plays an important role in keeping glucose metabolism functioning smoothly.<br><br>Do you spend the whole day sitting at your desk or in front of a computer screen? Why not get up occasionally and do a few minutes of physical exercise? DonÂ’t worry about what other people think.<br><br>In some Japanese companies, it is even become a collective habit. Every twenty minutes a bell sounds, and everybody gets up to do some stretching exercises, after which they sit down again as if nothing had happened. Japanese managers are convinced that their employees are more productive when they are relaxed.</div>

It is okay to worry, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at the right time</span>.<br><br>Psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania tell patients who suffer from anxiety to regularly do a daily twenty minute Â“worry session,Â” always at the same time and in the same place. Collect your head full of worries during the day (donÂ’t suppress them!) and then pour them out during your daily worry session.<br><br>Exaggerate your worries to the point of absurdity - knit your brows, make faces, let the sweat flow, shake and cower as much as you like. In other words, make a caricature of the part of yourself that is always worried, and in so doing exorcise it.<br><br>Eliminating worry will help prevent numerous psychosomatic illnesses, which result from living in a state of permanent anxiety.</div>

This according to the German Doctor Hans Nieper, founder of Eumatabolic Medicine, a new alternative mode of treatment which has become very popular in Germany. The carotene found especially in carrots prevents and can even cure cancer.<br><br>Dr. Nieper states, Â“If you smoke 60 cigarettes a day but drink 4 glasses of carrot juice, you will still be less prone to contract cancer than someone who doesnÂ’t smoke but who doesnÂ’t drink carrot juice.Â” Of course, if you donÂ’t smoke and do drink carrot juice all the better!</div>

If your work requires that you stare at a computer screen all day long or if you watch a lot of television, stop from time to time to do a few eye exercises.<br><br>For example, roll your eyes in large circles in both directions; look over to each side as far as possible and then go from up to down; or scan an imaginary text on the wall from left to right; or look out the window as far as you can following the horizon then return to a point right in front of you and begin again.<br><br>In this way, you will avoid long term eye problems, you will enlarge your inner space, and relax both your eyes and your mind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>6. How to beat asthma</strong><br><br>Asthma partially obstructs the bronchial tubes, making breathing difficult. The cause of asthma is still not known. But if you are an asthma sufferer, you can, through natural means, considerably reduce the number of asthma attacks you get.<br><br>A placebo study has shown that asthmatics who consume <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 gram of vitamin C per day had 4 times fewer attacks</span>. When they stopped taking vitamin C, the attacks resumed with the same frequency as before (Trop. and Geog. Med., Vol. 32, Mo. 2, 1980).<br><br>As for magnesium, it also works wonders! Dr. Zack H. Haddad of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southern California conducted a study on thirty children suffering from asthma associated with allergies.<br><br>Twenty of them drank a daily amount of mineral water rich in magnesium, while the others received no magnesium supplement. After three months, the first group had a higher level of magnesium in their blood, and they were able to breathe more easily.<br><br>So taking vitamin C and magnesium is an excellent way to prevent asthma attacks.<br><br>But what can you do to breathe more easily during an attack? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Simply drink 2 or 3 cups of strong coffee.</span> By activating blood circulation, it eases respiratory blockage.<br><br>In addition, the American Lung Association recommends the following exercise:<br><br>1. While standing, contract all your muscles. Keep them contracted for a few seconds.<br><br>2. Release the muscles, like letting the air out of a balloon. Relax all your muscles completely until you feel like a limp cloth.<br><br>3. Let yourself fall to the floor, and stretch out. Close your eyes and relax your face and your feet.<br><br>4. Imagine that you are floating on water. Concentrate on the effect the earthÂ’s gravity has on your muscles and on the pleasant feeling of being completely relaxed.<br><br>5. Breathe gently and quietly, as if you were about to fall asleep.<br><br>6. Open your eyes.<br><br>Practising this exercise when you feel an attack coming on, or once it is already started, will help you overcome your asthma condition.</div>

Losing weight: The Pakistani method</strong><br><br>Pakistani women have an amazing trick they use to stay slim: they keep a string permanently tied around their forearms. According to Dr. Drupas, a gentle but constant pressure on the nerves in the forearm stimulates certain glands, particularly those involved in weight control (thyroid, suprarenals).<br><br>Why donÂ’t you try it? Find two ordinary rubber bands and place them around your right forearm, one third of the way up between your wrist and elbow.<br><br>The rubber bands should exert noticeable pressure without cutting off blood circulation and should not slip or slide when you move your arm. This is not a tourniquet!<br><br>For best results, you have to wear the rubber bands constantly, even at night when you sleep. It is also recommended not to wear any other jewelry on the right arm.</div>

You can use the following technique to help others as well as yourself.<br><br>Before doing anything, make sure you donÂ’t do what you absolutely shouldnÂ’t: rub or press the eye, lift the eyelid, or remove contact lenses without washing your hands.<br><br>How to proceed?<br><br>Â· Examine your eye. Is it red? Swollen? Is it tearing? What do you feel? Does it itch? Burn? Is your vision blurred?<br><br>Â· Let nature do its work - it is usually effective. Tears and natural eye movements will usually get rid of the irritation.<br><br>Â· Try rinsing your eye with some warm water, or with drops. You can pull on the skin around the eyes, but donÂ’t touch the eyelid.<br><br>Â· If this doesnÂ’t work, wash your hands, and then lift both the upper and lower eyelids to locate the irritant. Is it on the inside of one of the eyelids, or is it stuck to the eyeball itself? Pour some sterilized, warm water on your eye to flush the irritant out.<br><br>Â· If you canÂ’t locate the irritant or if the discomfort persists after you have removed the particle, you would better consult a doctor.</div>

A few tricks for treating insect bites</strong><br><br>You donÂ’t have to sit back and just passively put up with insects, especially those that like to bite (mosquitoes, wasps etc.). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eat asparagus</span> and your sweat will develop an odor that repels insects. Or apply lemon oil to your skin.<br><br>If you are bitten, there are natural substances to soothe the irritation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aloe vera</span> has extraordinary powers of soothing skin disorders. It is available in forms for both internal and external application in most health and beauty stores.<br><br>If you have one of these amazing plants growing at home, cut the tip off one of the leaves (the leaf will heal itself). Apply the pulp and juice to the itching or swollen area.<br><br>Lightly boiled cabbage or leek makes an excellent analgesic poultice. Of course, if you are hiking in the woods, you might have a little trouble finding cabbage! Plantain also works well. Cut it and rub it to get to the juice then apply it to the affected area.</div>

Treat diarrhea without medication</strong><br><br>If you have ever been to a tropical country, you have probably experienced diarrhea: frequent and uncontrolled evacuation of liquid stool caused by bacteria in local water, milk or food.<br><br>Diarrhea can also be caused at home by excesses in diet (a diet that is too rich) or an allergic reaction to certain foods or medication or even by stress.<br><br>To treat diarrhea, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">avoid all solid food on the first day</span>. Drink liquids like water, apple juice, meat or vegetable boullion and tea. These will compensate for your loss of water - dehydration being one of the main dangers of diarrhea - and will give your intestines a period of rest.<br><br>If you have stomach cramps, rub your hands together for about a minute. Then place both palms on your abdominal region. The heat will soothe the pain.<br><br>On the second day, eat small quantities of solid food. Among the least irritating are cooked cereals (especially rice), biscuits and soft boiled eggs.<br><br>You can also try charcoal. It comes in tablet or capsule form (you can also get it off burnt toast!)<br><br>Chinese medicine has always considered ginger one of the best remedies for diarrhea. Dilute a tablespoon in hot water and add honey.</div>

Use seaweed to stimulate your immune system</strong><br><br>Japanese seaweed possesses remarkable immunizing properties, especially in fighting cancer.

Laminaria extract has proven 70% to 84% effective in suppressing intestinal tumors.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wakame</span>, another Japanese seaweed, is now familiar to many Westerners, thanks to the arrival in the west of Japanese macrobiotic cooking, which uses it a lot.<br><br>Pharmacologists at the University of Hawaii injected rats with an extract of this substance. They found that the seaweed helped prevent and cure cancer. The researchers claim that Wakame fights cancer by activating and strengthening the immune system.

How to prevent motion sickness - naturally</strong><br><br>Did you know that half a teaspoon of ground ginger is more effective than chemical medication in suppressing motion or sea sickness? And unlike most medication, it will not make you drowsy. Ginger has been used in the Orient for centuries to prevent sea sickness.<br><br>Researchers asked subjects who were especially susceptible to motion sickness to sit in a reclining chair that spun around at high speed. All the subjects who ingested a well known medication or who took a placebo experienced violent nausea and/or vomiting.<br><br>On the other hand, six of the twelve subjects who took ginger twenty minutes before the test experienced no discomfort. They consumed only 840 milligrams of ground ginger, which is the equivalent of half a teaspoon.<br><br>The Japanese have a very curious method of treating all kinds of motion sickness. They use an adhesive plaster to fasten an Â“umeboshiÂ” (a very salty fermented plum, available in most health food stores in the West) to their navel.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>18. Reducing your cholesterol</strong><br><br>To reduce cholesterol:<br><br>Â· First cut down on saturated fats. To do this:<br><br>Â· Eat lean meat. Select lean cuts and ask your butcher to cut off the fat.<br><br>Â· Drink skim milk instead of whole milk.<br><br>Do the same for all dairy products. Note that vegetarians have a much lower cholesterol level (almost twice as low as average) which is perfectly understandable, since cholesterol is only found in products derived from animals.<br><br>Â· Alcohol - in moderation. Not more than two glasses a day. However, it does appear that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol raises the number of HDL lipids (the good ones!), which break down cholesterol. (Moderation = two 4 oz. glasses of wine or two 12 oz. beers.)<br><br>Â· Do regular exercise, for example walking.<br><br>Â· Take Vitamin E. It reduces the risk of coronary disease.<br><br>Â· Calcium brewerÂ’s yeast, Vitamin C and Vitamin B-6 also combat the accumulation of cholesterol. And donÂ’t forget lecithin, which helps fight excess cholesterol, arteriosclerosis, hypertension and angina (as well as  soriasis, anxiety and diabetes - and reduces the likelihood of contracting cancer). Losing weight is a good way to raise your HDL level.<br><br>Â· Use poly-unsaturated, non-hydrogenated, cold pressed oil: corn oil, sunflower seed oil, soy, flax etc. A mono-unsaturated oil like olive oil can even raise your HDL level.<br><br>Â· Daily consumption of fish would be ideal for preventing cardio-vascular problems, as demonstrated conclusively in a number of studies on fish-eating populations (Eskimos for example). Ideally, you would eat fish twice a day. And as strange as this sounds, you should select the fattest kinds: mackerel, sardines, herring, salmon etc.<br><br>As for the oil in the fish, it is used to treat arterial disorders. Its effects can be felt in about six weeks. Fish oil contains two poly-unsaturated fatty acids which are very beneficial for the arteries.</div>
