Also got myself a 2nd hand <strong>Canon EF-S 60mm Macro lense</strong>. When to Sentosa 'Butterfly Park' last Monday for a little 'Insect' photo shooting.

Found that DSLR with a 'real' Macro Lense works better. Was using a PowerShot A610 before change to a DSLR...... but find that the A610 Macro capablitily is limited.<br><br>Also u must put ur shuttle speed to be 'faster'..... like 1/60 of a sec, to reduce bluring due to shaking hands. Macro as have a min distance between 'subject' and the lense...... too close, and the camera won't focus.....<br><br>Hope this helps....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Problem is the s3is claims to have a macro of 0cm . Which is quite true cos i been able to take a few shots of red ants using that . rather is the distance between macro and normal shot that the camera keep focusing non stop . I have a few pics loaded in the insect pictures thread which i believe has expired .</div>

Make a small hand movement, and the photo will be blur. If u used the flash.... it will be too close and 'over expose' the subject. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The photo of the flower came out blur &amp; dark..... if i use flash, the whole pic will be 'red' due to over-expose by strong flashlight.

Actually i buy this camera because its near to DSLR and the claims of 0cm macro and also its 12x optical zoom . I don't really earn much and have been changing job here and there also . So i don't want to spend too much money on my hobby . From what i understand , an extra lens for DSLR camera can easilly cost at least a few hundreds . Oh yah did you buy any dry box to protect and store your DSLR ? Wanted to buy 1 but quite exp . And no proper place for those cabinet type .</div>

I did check out both a Sigma and a Tamron lense before settling down with my Canon EF-S 60mm. Mainly due to size of the other lense. When both the sigma &amp; tamron is extended...... damn 'long'. I plan to use this camera in the future with a Underwater casing for my Scuba Diving...... if the Lense extend to too great a length, have problem finding a suitable casing...... not incl the cost extending the front of the casing.<br><br>As always..... money... or lack of money.... is the problem  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
