              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>BANGKOK, Thailand –
              Fossils recently discovered in Myanmar could prove that the common
              ancestors of humans, monkeys and apes evolved from primates in Asia,
              rather than Africa, researchers contend in a study released Wednesday.</p>
              <p>However,
              other scientists said that the finding, while significant, won't end
              the debate over the origin of anthropoids — the primate grouping that
              includes ancient species as well as modern humans.</p>
              <p>The pieces of 38 million-year-old jawbones and teeth found near Bagan in central Myanmar in 2005 show <span id="lw_1246546855_0" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">typical characteristics of primates</span>, said <span id="lw_1246546855_1" class="yshortcuts">Dr. Chris Beard</span>, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in <span id="lw_1246546855_2" class="yshortcuts">Pittsburgh</span> and a member of the team that found the fossils.</p>
              <p>"When
              we found it, we knew we had a new type of primate and basically what
              kind of primate it was," Beard said in a telephone interview from
              Pittsburgh. "It turns out that jaws and teeth are very diagnostic. ...
              They are almost like fingerprints for fossils like this."</p>
              <p>The findings were published in the Proceedings of The Royal Society B, a London-based peer-reviewed journal.</p>
              <p>Beard and his team from France, <span id="lw_1246546855_3" class="yshortcuts">Thailand</span> and Myanmar concluded that the fossils — which they dubbed Ganlea
              megacanina — came from 10 to 15 individuals of a new species that
              belonged to an extinct family of Asian anthropoid primates known as
              Amphipithecidae.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1246546855_4" class="yshortcuts">Wear and tear</span> found on the canine teeth suggest the tree-dwelling, monkey-like
              creatures with long tails used their teeth to crack open tropical fruit
              to get to the pulp and seeds — behavior similar to modern South
              American <span id="lw_1246546855_5" class="yshortcuts">saki monkeys</span> that inhabit the Amazon basin, Beard said.</p>
              <p>"Not
              only does Ganlea look like an anthropoid, but it was acting like an
              anthropoid 38 million years ago by having this feeding ecology that was
              quite specialized," Beard said.</p>
              <p>His team
              determined that the fossil was 38 million years old, making it several
              million years older than any anthropoid found in Africa and the
              second-oldest discovered in Asia.</p>
              <p>In 1994,
              Beard and his Chinese colleagues found fossilized foot bones of the
              anthropoid Eosimias — one of the worlds smallest primates — which lived
              between 40 million and 45 million years ago and roamed ancient rain
              forest on the eastern coast of <span id="lw_1246546855_6" class="yshortcuts">China</span>.</p>
              <p>Beard
              said the age of both fossils was the evidence he needed to challenge
              contentions that anthropoid primates had evolved in Africa, where Lucy,
              a 3.2 million-year-old fossil, was discovered in 1974.</p>
              <p>"This
              new fossil Ganlea definitely helps us argue — and we think the argument
              is pretty close to settled now — that when you go back this far in
              time, the common ancestor of monkeys, apes and humans was definitely in
              Asia, not in Africa," Beard said.</p>
              <p>In May,
              researchers unveiled a nearly intact skeleton of a 47 million-year-old
              primate — found in Germany and dubbed "Ida" — that they said provides a
              glimpse into how our distant ancestors may have looked.</p>
              <p>"We
              wouldn't claim Ganlea is missing link, but we know Ganlea is much more
              closely related to our ancestors than Ida ever was — even though,
              unfortunately, we don't have complete skeleton like they did for Ida,"
              he said.</p>
              <p>Jorn Hurum, who brought Ida to the <span id="lw_1246546855_7" class="yshortcuts">University of Oslo</span> <span id="lw_1246546855_8" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Natural History Museum</span>, said that it was too early to draw conclusions from the <span id="lw_1246546855_9" class="yshortcuts">Myanmar</span> fossils because only jawbones and teeth were found.</p>
              <p>"These
              fragments are still too few and far between," Hurum said. "This is the
              kind of scientific debate that will continue until more complete
              skeletons like Ida has been found, and this may take several hundred
              years."</p>
              <p>Stony Brook University Prof. John G.
              Fleagle, a paleontologist, said the discovery of Ganlea is important
              because it shows how several different primates found in Myanmar are
              related and provides interesting suggestions about a unique dietary
              specialization.</p>
              <p>But he said the Myanmar fossils
              do little to prove whether anthropoids evolved in Asia or Africa — or
              even whether Ganlea was an anthropoid or an early relative of lemurs.</p>
              <p>"This doesn't add anything new about whether anthropoids came
              from Africa or Asia or the broader evolutionary relationships of these
              particular primates ," Fleagle said.</p>
              <p>"The definitive features that would resolve it in people's mind
              would be in the skull," he said. "Without a skull to demonstrate the
              distinctive anthropoid features of the eye and ear regions, scientists
              will still continue to debate whether the dental similarities just
              indicate similar diets or are the result of a common heritage."</p>
              <p>Beard isn't letting the criticism slow him down. He and his
              team expect to return in November to Myanmar to continue searching for
              more fossils and exploring how anthropoids evolved in Asia and then
              migrated to Africa.</p>
              <p>"The question is when and how did this big evolutionary shift
              occur from Asia to Africa," Beard said. "That is something we are
              trying to establish. We have a team working in Myanmar which has ideas
              of places to go in Africa to try and pick up thread there."</p>
