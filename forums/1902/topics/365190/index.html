              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;">Wednesday, June 17, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #000080;"><br><br>Scientists have discovered a unique 
              beaked, plant-eating dinosaur in China. The finding, they say, demonstrates that 
              theropod, or bird-footed, dinosaurs were more ecologically diverse in the 
              Jurassic period than previously thought, and offers important evidence about how 
              the three-fingered hand of birds evolved from the hand of dinosaurs. <br><br>The 
              discovery is reported in a paper published in this week's edition of the journal 
              Nature. <br><br>"This work on dinosaurs provides a whole new perspective on the 
              evolution of bird manual digits," said H. Richard Lane, program director in the 
              National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the 
              research. <br><br>"This new animal is fascinating, and when placed into an 
              evolutionary context it offers intriguing evidence about how the hand of birds 
              evolved," said scientist James Clark of George Washington University. 
              <br><br>Clark, along with Xu Xing of the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute 
              of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, made the discovery. 
              Clark's graduate student, Jonah Choiniere, also was involved in analyzing the 
              new animal. <br><br>"This finding is truly exciting, as it changes what we 
              thought we knew about the dinosaur hand," said Xu. "It also brings conciliation 
              between the data from million-year-old bones and molecules of living birds." 
              <br><br>Limusaurus inextricabilis ("mire lizard who could not escape") was found 
              in 159 million-year-old deposits located in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang, 
              northwestern China. The dinosaur earned its name from the way its skeletons were 
              preserved, stacked on top of each other in fossilized mire pits. <br><br>A close 
              examination of the fossil shows that its upper and lower jaws were toothless, 
              demonstrating that the dinosaur possessed a fully developed beak. Its lack of 
              teeth, short arms without sharp claws and possession of gizzard stones suggest 
              that it was a plant-eater, though it is related to carnivorous dinosaurs. 
              <br><br>The newly discovered dinosaur's hand is unusual and provides surprising 
              new insights into a long-standing controversy over which fingers are present in 
              living birds, which are theropod dinosaur descendants. The hands of theropod 
              dinosaurs suggest that the outer two fingers were lost during the course of 
              evolution and the inner three remained. <br><br>Conversely, embryos of living 
              birds suggest that birds have lost one finger from the outside and one from the 
              inside of the hand. Unlike all other theropods, the hand of Limusaurus strongly 
              reduced the first finger and increased the size of the second. Clark and Xu 
              argue that Limusaurus' hand represents a transitional condition in which the 
              inner finger was lost and the other fingers took on the shape of the fingers 
              next to them. <br><br>The three fingers of most advanced theropods are the 
              second, third and fourth fingers-the same ones indicated by bird 
              embryos-contrary to the traditional interpretation that they were the first, 
              second and third. <br><br>Limusaurus is the first ceratosaur known from East 
              Asia and one of the most primitive members of the group. Ceratosaurs are a 
              diverse group of theropods that often bear crests or horns on their heads, and 
              many have unusual, knobby fingers lacking sharp claws. <br><br>The fossil beds 
              in China that produced Limusaurus have previously yielded skeletons of a variety 
              of dinosaurs and contemporary animals described by Clark and Xu. <br><br>These 
              include the oldest tyrannosaur, Guanlong wucaii; the oldest horned dinosaur, 
              Yinlong downsi; a new stegosaur, Jiangjunosaurus junggarensis; and the running 
              crocodile relative, Junggarsuchus sloani. <br><br>### <br><br>National Science
