Â“We at HazMat dread the days we have to deal with them.Â”<br><br>It happened late Tuesday afternoon. Dan Spisak was transporting a cookie shake through a narrow and dangerous area known as Â“the HallÂ” when he lost control and dropped the shake. Onlookers report that Spisak was heavily overloaded.<br><br>Rob Menke, friend of the heroic cat, had this to say: Â“When it happened, Dan sorta stood there. Finally, he said, Â“Uh, Rob...Â” and took a step forward. There, on the floor, was the open canister with the shake slowly pouring out."<br><br>Toxic cookie shake is a cold, viscous substance. Had it been more fluid, the disaster may have been more dire.<br><br>Â“It was pretty nasty, and Dan was no help; his arms were full. I quickly closed the canister to prevent more from spilling, but the substance already spilt was oozing toward it [the mattress in temporary storage in the Hall].Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.the-wabe.com/roadtrip/catshake1.jpg"><br><br>Â“I thought the mattress was a goner, but I went to get paper towels anyway. When I got back, the cat was already at work.Â”<br><br>With no thought to her own personal safety, the cat had jumped in and was busy dealing with the spill in her own personal way: she was ingesting the vile stuff.<br><br>Â“At first I was as dumbfounded as everyone else, then I started cheering,Â” recounts Menke. Â“She saved the mattress!Â”<br><br>When asked what prompted her to do such a daring feat, the cat had this to say: Â“Purrrrr.Â”<br><br><a href="http://www.the-wabe.com/roadtrip/catshake.html" rel="nofollow"><span class="small">Source</span></a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum, Jan 11, 2007<br><br><strong><span class="large">Stop animal abuse by teaching kindness, empathy</span></strong><br><br>I WAS aghast when I read the article, 'Cat strangled with nylon string' (ST, Jan 8 ). When will such abuse stop? Or have we become apathetic to such cruel acts?<br><br>A gracious society is not made up of just educated citizens, green trees, beautiful parks and the latest infrastructure. There is also humanity, kindness and empathy towards our fellow human beings and other occupants of this earth. Or have we forgotten this?<br><br>Killing for the sake of killing or for pleasure is plain wrong and deserves the strongest punishment. While justice is meted out to humans, our animal friends seem to deserve less of this justice. The maximum penalty for animal cruelty is a $10,000 fine and up to 12 months' jail. I can recall only one instance where an abuser was sentenced to a year in jail.<br><br>I believe this problem can be tackled at two levels.<br><br>The government authorities can teach kindness and empathy through campaigns and education. Set an example against killing; instead of culling strays, why not consider a humane method to control the stray population? Or start a kindness movement in school that encourages children to interact, play with and care for small animals.<br><br>As parents, siblings and friends, we can educate and impress on others the importance of humanity, kindness and respect for life - both human and animal.<br><br>Until we achieve this, we cannot call ourselves a gracious society.<br><br><strong>Khoo Hwee Boon (Ms)</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum, Online Story, Jan 11, 2007<br><br><strong><span class="large">Start Kindness Movement by caring for local stray cats</span></strong><br><br>I refer to the report Jan 8, 2007 "Cat strangled with nylon string".<br><br>A few days ago, I was walking behind a little girl, aged about seven year-old, accompanied by an elderly lady in her 70's, presumably her grandmother.<br><br>They passed by a sterilized tipped ear community cat.<br><br>The little girl screamed and made threatening gestures at the cat who ran to hide amongst the bicycles parked in the void deck of a block of HDB flats. The grandmother stood nearby and awaited, apathetically.<br><br>The following day, I passed by an elderly Peranakan lady, also in her 70's, who was feeding another sterilized tipped ear community cat at the same void deck, responsibly with shredded fish placed on a piece of paper (see attached photo). She said she "sayang" ("love" ) the community cats who gave her much joy in her old age. She said that sometimes she has to "marah" ("scold" ) the children from the nearby primary school, for hurting the cats.<br><br>I think we can no longer ignore the symptom of animal abuse such as what had happened to this cat at Simei - strangled with nylon string. How can we hypocritically claim to be a civilized society when such symptom of barbarism is occuring so often?<br><br>How can we inculcate kindness in our children when on a national level we are killing 13,000 cats every year, assisted with free loan of cat traps from the AVA and some Town Council officers freely engaging pest control firms to trap cats to be killed in respond to feeback from residents about cats?<br><br>Let's start a pro-active Kindness Movement by involving grass-root resources such as the schools, the RC's and Community Clubs to impart EMPATHY in our children as well as their adult guardians with project that involves the care of the community cats. Such program is a good antidote to the current perception that the young people nowadays are too engrossed with their self-satiation. Learning to be kind in children will also teach them to the kind to the increasing number of Singaporeans who are greying and perceived by some youngters to be "old, frail and useless". Perhaps this is how some people view the stray cats as well.<br><br><strong>Dr Tan Chek Wee</strong></div>
