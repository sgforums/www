Magnetic and self-possessed, Tigers are born leaders. They have an air of authority that prompts others to fall in line, which is exactly how they like it. Although they are magnetically charming and fun to be around, Tigers like to go it alone sometimes too. A Tiger's main interest is in following its ambitions -- and maintaining control.<br><br>Tigers are courageous beyond compare and generally come out ahead in battle, be it in the boardroom or the bedroom. Seduction is one area where the Tiger is definitely king! Noble and warm-hearted, Tigers have a natural, raw appeal that's extremely attractive to other Signs. They're not just about attraction, though; ever on the side of right, Tigers will fight the good fight to the bitter end if the cause is worthy. Opponents are wise to fear this feline.<br><br>A bit of caution is a good thing around Tigers, since they can pounce without warning. They experience mood swings and often feel things more intensely than others, the latter quality being both good and bad. They can react poorly under stress and are prone to emotional outbursts. This Sign's bristling sensitivity can send friend and foe running for cover.<br><br>A lesson that Tigers would be well-served to learn is "moderation in all things." Once these cats can find their center and direct their considerable energies toward worthwhile endeavors (as opposed to racing through life), they will accomplish much.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Tiger is the Horse or the Dog.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Tigers</span>: Tom Cruise, Bill Murray, Joaquin Pheonix.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">The Tiger is one of the most dynamic signs of the Chinese People. People born in Tiger Years are highly competitive, adventurous, and very confident in their own abilities - they are the sort who can and will get things done. Their towering passion, ambition and all-or-nothing attitude can take them all the way to the top in whatever endeavour to do. They crave excitement and get bored easily. Tigers fiercely stand up for what they believe in and for this, coupled with their courage and dedication, they are respected by both friend and foe.</span><br><br>The Tiger is: Enthusiastic, energetic, loyal, hot headed, impulsive Likes projects, challenges, is ambitious, dislikes high risks and quitters<br><br>Suited in business, politics, exploring, armed forces and tracks<br><br>Suited with a Horse, Dog, Dragon, Pig and Rabbit</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Outlook for 2006<br><br>Career<br>This Dog year, the career and wealth luck for the Tiger is stable. You will experience no serious setbacks, and progress will be good. Though this is the case, you do need to be wary of legal issues as well as dealings that involve lots of documentation. For Tigers who work in the public service industry, this year will be very good to them! There is indication of great progress at work, and even a promotion or a new position.<br><br>On the side, the Tiger person may inadvertently step on a few toes or bruise a few egos due to conflicts, so do take note and cool your heels before allowing yourself the chance to speak. Even so, the Tiger in best behavior could even cause this problem! The best solution for you this year is to work closely only with those you are very close to or familiar with, since this will ensure no enmity when you disclose something less than tactful! You should also work with your old clients rather than fish for new ones this year.<br><br>Relationship<br>Peach Blossom luck is not especially strong for Tiger people this Dog year, so single Tigers out there may have a few challenges in store for them when hunting for their potential partners. For the attached Tiger person, there are a few problems concerning third parties to your relationship, such as petty people who are out to break you and your partner up. Refrain from listening to any kind of gossip this year as a general rule, since these are sources of mischief that may disrupt the harmony between you and partner.<br><br>Health<br>For health in year 2006, the Tiger will enjoy wonderful physical health! But, you may be easily depressed and worried this year. Avoid overly Yin places such as funerals and graveyards, and do spend a lot of your time in hot, sunny climates to reduce this problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>25 June 2006<br>You'll be very sensitive to marks of gratitude, especially if these come from your children; and you yourself won't forget to be thankful to people who will have done you a service. A happy denouement may occur in your affective life; it's true that you've sufficiently worked to make this event possible. Congratulations! However, don't rest on your laurels; continue to work so as to strengthen these benefits.

In love, you'll hesitate to make a choice: You may not really know whom you love or whom you want to love! Obstacles of all kinds will arise in your work, but you'll succeed in overcoming them. You won't be in your top form, but take some rest and things will go better right away.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tiger people are sympathetic, kind, emotional, and sensitive. At movies, they can cry their eyes out! Despite their kindness, they can be extremely short-tempered. The rage of Tigers is terrible to behold but it also gives them the adrenaline needed for the sublimest of bravery. The Tiger is also a deep thinker and can make the most astonishing intellectual connections, with great mental agility. On the negative side, they tend to be suspicious and a bit self-centered, OK selfish, and indecisive. Above everything, however, the Tiger stands as a supreme emblem of protection over human life, admirable always.<br><br>Famous TIGER people: Sun Yat-Sen, Jiang Zemin, Ho Chih Minh,Princess Anne, General Charles de Gaulle, Charles Lindbergh, Beethoven, Queen Beatrix, King Juan Carlos I, Jonas Salk, Queen<br><br>METAL TIGER<br><span class="small">Feb 17, 1950 to Feb 5, 1951<br>Feb 14, 2010 to Feb 2, 2011</span><br><br>When opportunity knocks, Metal Tigers open the door. With characteristic Olympian zeal, they seize every chance to better themselves, with a competitive streak that lets nothing or no one get in their way. As aggressive as they are, though, they never trample upon the feelings of others. Always considerate, they are admired and well-liked for their sense of justice and forgiving spirit. They never waste energy holding grudges. Metal Tigers always have the unwavering support of their friends, colleagues, and family. Their industrious work habits usually lead them down a velvety smooth career path and Metal Tigers almost always know the beauty of having achieved great financial success. Because Metal Tigers have so much fire within themselves, they can also warm the hearts of loved ones, which they do with tender passion and compassion.<br><br>WATER TIGER<br><span class="small">Feb 8, 1902 to Jan 28, 1903<br>Feb 5, 1962 to Jan 24, 1963</span><br><br>Water Tigers do not go gently into the night. Full of intelligence bordering on genius, they imagine a beautiful world and know how to create it. Never liking to be alone, the gregarious Tigers surround themselves with loyal friends who lend their undying support. With such support, they can't help but prosper. A mercurial nature sometimes makes them antsy, impatient, and quarrelsome over little things. They do react very quickly, but also get over any ill feeling just as quickly. They are generally fair, humane, and quite reasonable in their dealings with people. They absolutely excel in the business world. Love for the Water Tiger is like a restless rogue, flitting about like a butterfly. You see, these Tigers are gypsies, always on the lookout for something better down the road, fickle to the core. Smart potential mates can catch them, however, and once this happens, Water Tigers are capable of experiencing the normal highs and lows of love.<br><br>WOOD TIGER<br><span class="small">Jan 26, 1914 to Feb 13, 1915<br>Jan 23, 1974 to Feb 10, 1975</span><br><br>Look no further than the Wood Tiger for true friendship. This compassionate human being is always ready to lend his or her shoulder for friends to lean on. Friends show a reciprocal spirit. When the Wood Tiger needs it, friendship and support are always there and indirectly help the Tiger's successful ascent up the career ladder. Once there, this Tiger experiences such prosperity, it's almost like winning the lottery, except it's earned good fortune. Wood Tigers are very creative in finding ways to make life exciting, never lacking inspiration to change what can be changed and to forge ahead with native wit and charm. When it comes to Love, the male Wood Tiger has to fight his fantasy of becoming a playboy. When he experiences that familiar lust-in-his-heart tickle, he has to give in instead to his ingrained gentility. When it's time for a Wood Tiger to marry, he nearly always attracts a very beautiful wife. Also gentle, the female Wood Tiger is very generous with love and kisses and is always good to her husband.

They work hard. They play hard. Whether it's tennis or the famous bottom line, they keep their feet solidly on the ground, setting high realistic goals. They steadily, consistently, achieve their goals, never plopping on the sofa, never shirking their responsibilities. Independent thinkers, they developed a strong sense of self-confidence at a very early age through the encouragement of friends and perceptive teachers. Luckily for everyone else, they realize that life is a two-way street and they do their best to bring out the best in others, doing so with great warmth and kindness. Earth Tigers make loyal friends and are remembered for their thoughtful ways. Financially, they're so-so. No, not bad, just so-so, unless they happen to be extremely business oriented then it's OK. When it comes to love and relationships, Earth Tigers are typical passionate Tigers. While not great romantics (sometimes they'd rather be off working while spouses stay home waiting), they certainly are faithful. In the long run, relationships do work out, and the couple's happiness is definitely worth waiting for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 Jul 06<br>Don't harbor ill feelings toward certain members of your family who might have hurt you recently. Beware of your brimming imagination and your exacerbated sensibility, which might impede your objectiveness. You may not be able to finish the work that was asked of you: try to justify yourself, don't feel or appear guilty. If money comes to you, don't spend it now: It'd be much better to invest it somewhere.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 Jul 06<br>The stars will endow you with lively enthusiasm and you'll see things with much optimism. You'll be overflowing with energy; profit by it so that you can quickly finish those various projects you've left pending for a long time, or to make the trip that you've perhaps postponed several times under vaguely plausible pretexts. You'll be very much surrounded and appreciated by your near ones, for your gentleness and kindheartedness will be unfailingly present.<br><br>3 Jul 06<br>You'll be in a very good physical shape but this should not be a reason for you to continue to live under excessive stress. You'll probably make a totally unexpected amorous encounter, will succumb to extraordinary love at first sight, or will feel exceptionally happy with the person you love. Certain disciplines of Chinese astrology and numerology can be beneficial to you; profit by them by having a reading so that you can know the orientations of your destiny better and direct it better.</div>

Don't let your small health problems drag on and plague your life; seek to cure them as soon as possible. The smallest disagreements with those you love will risk disturbing you profoundly. Beware, you'll be inclined to be too enthusiastic without proper judgment, be it in love or friendship! Everything will be easier if you tackle your problems one by one and with calm and lucidity.</div>

It would be the time to water down your wine so as to improve your social or family relationships. Your temperament will push you to commit excesses, notably food excesses; this may result in some nervous tensions or an increase in weight. If you want to be loved, then you must love -- sincerely, wholeheartedly.</div>

This compassionate human being is always ready to lend his or her shoulder for friends to lean on. Friends show a reciprocal spirit. When the Wood Tiger needs it, friendship and support are always there and indirectly help the Tiger's successful ascent up the career ladder. Once there, this Tiger experiences such prosperity, it's almost like winning the lottery, except it's earned good fortune. Wood Tigers are very creative in finding ways to make life exciting, never lacking inspiration to change what can be changed and to forge ahead with native wit and charm. When it comes to Love, the male Wood Tiger has to fight his fantasy of becoming a playboy. When he experiences that familiar lust-in-his-heart tickle, he has to give in instead to his ingrained gentility. When it's time for a Wood Tiger to marry, he nearly always attracts a very beautiful wife. Also gentle, the female Wood Tiger is very generous with love and kisses and is always good to her husband. Wood Tigers in general have a very fulfilling and happy family life, with no regrets.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Today would be the best day to ask for a pay raise or some honorific distinction. If you suffer from arterial troubles, be more careful than usual. In love, don't talk about your old relations, don't say anything that may arouse or keep up jealousy. Avoid being too demanding with your children, for they are not angels!</div>

It will be the moment to buckle down to very personal projects and to give free rein to your imagination. Ask yourself if you've done your best to make your parents, as well as your children, happy.</div>
