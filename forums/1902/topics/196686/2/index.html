            <div class='col-md body'>9 Jul 06<br>Your charming power will grow tenfold; this charm, you'll use not only in love but also to obtain financial support or help. Tenacity and dedication will be your main qualities; even if you encounter important obstacles, you'll refuse to give up. Physically, you must redouble your vigilance and caution so as to prevent accidents; it'd be better not to travel, especially by airplane, and to avoid all sports competition, which also implies an increased risk.</div>

The Moon will protect your love affairs; everything will go well on this front and any recent disappointments or delusions will be shelved indefinitely. Learn to profit by the present without regretting the past or being anxious for the future. You can greatly improve your health by pursuing a program of daily exercise.</div>

You'll probably be interested by a small flirtation; it would be prudent not to take it seriously, for the astral aspects concerning love life seem rather unfavorable. Under the prevailing difficult economic circumstances, show utmost vigilance so as not to fall into the traps of swindlers and rip-off merchants of all kinds.</div>

Your family relationships will become much more harmonious than they have been lately. In love, listen to your heart for once and put your reason aside. If you're single, you'll feel a growing need to get married; if you live in couple, you'll experience a renewal of passion.</div>

Have confidence in your intuition, which will be excellent. Harmony will prevail in your emotional life, be it concerning your love affairs, your family or your friends. Your indecisiveness will be increased by the present astral configurations; to remedy this, make a decision and stick to it. Difficulties in your work; have patience and be stoic</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>14 Jul 06<br>The stars advise that you avoid making expenses that are not planned in your budget, for if you buy what's superfluous, you'll soon have to sell what's necessary! Try by all means to control your excessive edginess: do sports, relaxation, yoga and take strolls in the countryside or mountains.

            <div class='col-md body'>15 Jul 06<br>You'll begin to go through a phase of deepening and strengthening in many domains. In a general way, self-confidence and optimism will be needed. Loneliness, the indifference of people and sometimes boredom may perhaps drive you to looking for friendships in questionable circles; don't let yourself be taken in by them. You'll have an opportunity to multiply interesting encounters, to have access to a very closed entourage, and to obtain the support of influential people. Profit well by these favorable astral influxes.</div>

You can carry out delicate negotiations successfully, enter into fruitful agreements, or solve some thorny problems superbly.

Remember that a good ambiance at your work is not a matter of course but needs to be created; and don't forget that to pursue one's career is one thing, to be happy in one's work is another.<br><br>20 Jul 06<br>Try to be reasonable -- you are inclined to invest too much in your love affairs. Arguing with your loved ones is nothing disastrous, but it can be if you lose your temper. Your inner contradictions become more acute and may cause you some uneasiness. Try to control your irritability and tendency toward anger. The circumstances evolve in such a way as to help you occupy a much higher position in your career.</div>

If you've until now had much difficulty making real friends, this time you'll spare no effort so as to know true friendship; you'll preserve it very carefully because, for you, it will double your joys and reduce your sorrows.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 Aug 06<br>You'll be in a position to gather great professional or social satisfactions, to obtain support, to increase the number of your allies. But you must refrain from following the slope of your subjectivity; beware of unrealistic expectations! This astral ambiance will allow you to remain available, if only to satisfy your need to be loved, which is more acute than usual. It will create an atmosphere that's stimulating, fervent and propitious to renewal and unusual encounters. Clear your medicine cabinet of all useless or out-of-date drugs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 Aug 06<br>Psychologically, you'll be subject to rapid changes of mood. Dream as much as you want so as to console yourself of the hard realities of life; but don't let yourself be swamped by your dreams. Heartwise, you can expect profound joys. You'll be happy knowing that you're appreciated in a really gratifying manner by the beloved one whom you value, who inspires in you feelings of admiration, and in whom you discover the qualities of nobility and generosity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>3 Aug 06<br>If you love original and agreeable flirtation, you'll be well served this time. Do not dramatize anything: All things can be improved one day or another. Watch over your children more closely. More haste, less speed! If you hurry too much, you'll soon no longer know that your objectives are and what they consist of. Noticeable improvement of the state of your finances; sheer luck seems possible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4 Aug 06<br>Don't be too much grieved about the wrongs people have done you: The world is made of good people, but also of wicked people, and you can do nothing about it! Even though you may be fascinated by certain mysticisms, keep some skepticism. Hurry up to discuss a familial question with your spouse. Careerwise, your ambition can be a factor of success if you don't let yourself be taken by wrong self-pride.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 Aug 06<br>Some disappointments can be expected in one field or another if you forget that all truth is not good to be told. The planetary influences will be favorable to you in the family domain -- very harmonious family atmosphere. If you want to succeed in a given endeavor, then simply show energy and willpower. It's not love that will tempt you, but you need to prove to yourself your power of life and death over hearts; beware of possible painful backlashes!</div>
