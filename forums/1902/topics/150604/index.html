            <div class='col-md body'>... are bad for us?<br><br>got this in my email:-<br><br>In October of 2001, my sister started getting very sick. She had<br>stomach spasms and she was having a hard time getting around. Walking<br>was a major chore. It took everything she had just to get out of bed;<br>she was in so much pain.<br><br>By March 2002, she had undergone several tissue and muscle biopsies<br>and was on 24 various prescription medications. The doctors could not<br>determine what was wrong with her. She was in so much pain, and so<br>sick...she just knew she was dying.<br><br>She put her house, bank accounts, life insurance, etc., in her oldest<br>daughter's name, and made sure that her younger children were to be<br>taken care of. She also wanted her last hooray, so she planned a trip<br>to FL (basically in a wheelchair) for March 22nd.<br><br>On March 19th I called her to ask how her most recent tests went, and<br>she said they didn't find anything on the test, but they believe she<br>had MS. (Multiple Sclerosis)<br><br>I recalled an article a friend of mine E-mailed to me and I asked my<br>sister if she drank diet soda? She told me that she did. As a matter<br>of fact, she was getting ready to crack one open that moment... I told<br>her not to open it, and to stop drinking the diet soda!!! I e-mailed<br>her the article my friend, a lawyer, had sent.<br><br>My sister called me within 32 hours after our phone conversation and<br>told me she had stopped drinking the <span style="color: red;">diet soda </span>AND she could walk!!!!<br><br>The muscle spasms went away. She said she didn't feel 100% but she<br>sure felt a lot better. She told me she was going to her doctor with<br>this article and would call me when she got home.<br><br>Well, she called me, and said her doctor was amazed! He is going to<br>call all of his MS patients to find out if they consumed artificial<br>sweeteners of any kind...<br><br>In a nutshell, she was being <span style="color: red;">poisoned by the Aspartame in the diet<br>soda</span>... and literally dying a slow and miserable death.<br><br>When she got to FL March 22nd, all she had to take was one pill, and<br>that was a pill for the Aspartame poisoning! She is well on her way to<br>a complete recovery ... and she is walking!!! No wheelchair!!!<br><br>This article saved her life <span style="color: red;">If it says "SUGAR FREE" on the label, DO<br>NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!!</span><br><br>....to be continued</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL<br>CONFERENCE on "ASPARTAME," marketed as <span style="color: red;">'NutraSweet,' 'Equal,' and<br>'Spoonful.'</span><br><br>In the keynote address by the EPA, it was announced that in the United<br>States in 2001 there is an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic<br>lupus. It was difficult to determine exactly what toxin was causing<br>this to be rampant.<br><br>I stood up and said that I was there to lecture on exactly that<br>subject.<br><br>I will explain why Aspartame is so dangerous: When the temperature of<br>this sweetener exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol in ASPARTAME<br>converts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn causes<br>metabolic acidosis. Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of<br>fire ants. The methanol toxicity mimics, among other conditions,<br>multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus.<br><br>Many people were being diagnosed in error. Although multiple sclerosis<br>is not a death sentence... methanol toxicity is!<br><br>Systemic lupus has become almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis,<br>especially with <span style="color: red;">Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi</span> drinkers. The victim usually<br>does not know that the Aspartame is the culprit. He or she continues<br>its use; irritating the lupus to such a degree that it may become a<br>life-threatening condition. We have seen patients with systemic lupus<br>become asymptotic, once taken off diet sodas.<br><br>In cases of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, (when in reality,<br>the disease is methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms disappear.<br>We've seen many cas es where vision loss returned and hearing loss<br>improved markedly.<br><br>This also applies to cases of tinnitus and fibromyalgia (musculoskeletal pain and fatigue)<br><br>During a lecture, I said, "If you are using ASPARTAME (NutraSweet,<br>Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms,<br>spasms, shooting, pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo,<br>dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, unexplainable depression,<br>anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss...you<br>probably have ASPARTAME poisoning!"<br><br>People were jumping up during the lecture saying, "I have some of<br>these symptoms.<br><br>Is it reversible?" Yes! Yes! Yes! STOP drinking diet sodas and be<br>alert for Aspartame on food labels!<br><br>Many products are fortified with it!!!<br><br>This is a serious problem. Dr. Espart (one of my speakers) remarked<br>that so many people seem to be symptomatic for MS and during his<br>recent visit to a hospice; a nurse stated that six of her friends, who<br>were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is<br>beyond coincidence!<br><br>Diet soda is NOT a diet product! It is a chemically altered, multiple<br>SODIUM (salt) and ASPARTAME containing product that actually makes you<br>crave carbohydrates. It is far more likely to make you GAIN weight!<br><br>These products also contain formaldehyde, which stores in the fat<br>cells, particularly in the hips and thighs. Formaldehyde is an<br>absolute toxin and is used primarily to preserve "tissue specimens."<br><br>Many products we use every day contain this chemical but we SHOULD NOT<br>store it IN our body!!!<br><br>Dr. H. J. Roberts stated in his lectures that once free of the "diet<br>products" and with no significant increase in exercise; his patients<br>lost an average of 19 pounds over a trial period.<br><br>Aspartame is especially dangerous for diabetics. We found that some<br>phy sicians, who believed that they had a patient with retinopathy, in<br>fact, had symptoms caused by Aspartame. The Aspartame drives the blood<br>sugar out of control. Thus diabetics may suffer acute memory loss due<br>to the fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are NEUROTOXIC when<br>taken without the other amino acids necessary for a good balance.<br><br>Treating diabetes is all about BALANCE. Especially with diabetics, the<br>Aspartame passes the blood/brain barrier and it then deteriorates the<br>neurons of the brain; causing various levels of brain damage,<br>seizures, depression, manic depression, panic attacks, uncontrollable<br>anger and rage.<br><br>Consumption of Aspartame causes these same symptoms in non-diabetics,<br>as well.<br><br>Documentation and observation also reveal that thousands of children<br>diagnosed with ADD and AHD have had complete turnarounds in their<br>behaviour when these chemicals have been removed from their diet. So<br>called "behavi our modification prescription drugs" (Ritalin and<br>others) are no longer needed. Truth be told, they were never NEEDED in<br>the first place!<br><br>Most of these children were being "poisoned" on a daily basis with the<br>very foods that were "better for them than sugar."<br><br>It is also suspected that the Aspartame in thousands of pallets of<br>diet Coke and diet Pepsi consumed by men and women fighting in the<br>Gulf War, may be partially to blame for the well-known Gulf War<br>Syndrome.<br><br>Dr. Roberts warns that it can cause birth defects, i.e., mental<br>retardation, if taken at the time of conception and during early<br>pregnancy. Children are especially at risk for neurological disorders<br>and should NEVER be given artificial sweeteners. There are many<br>different case histories to relate of children suffering grand mal<br>seizures and other neurological disturbances due to the use of<br>NutraSweet.<br><br>Unfortunately, it is not always easy to convince people that Aspartame<br>is to blame for their child's illness. Stevia, which, which is a sweet<br>herb, NOT A MANUFACTURED ADDITIVE, helps in the metabolism of sugar,<br>which would be ideal for diabetics. It has now been approved as a<br>dietary supplement by the FDA. It is known that for many years the FDA<br>outlawed this true sweet food," due to their loyalty to MONSANTO<br>Chemical Company.<br><br>Books on this subject are available:<br><br>EXCITOTOXINS: THE TASTE THAT KILLS written by Dr. Russell Blayblock<br>(Health Press 1-800-643-2665) AND: DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S<br>DISEASE-written by DR H. J. Roberts, also a diabetic specialist.<br><br>These two doctors will soon be posting a position paper with case<br>histories on the deadly effects of Aspartame on the Internet.<br>According to the Conference of the American College of Physicians, "We<br>are talking about a plague of neurological diseases directly caused by<br>the use of this deadly poison."<br><br>Herein lies the problem: There were Congressional Hearings when<br>Aspartame was included 100 different products and strong objection was<br>made concerning it's use.. Since this initial hearing, there have been<br>two subsequent hearings and still, nothing has been done. The drug and<br>chemical lobbies have very deep pockets. Sadly, MONSANTO'S patent on<br>Aspartame has EXPIRED!!<br><br>There are now over 5,000 products on the market that contain this<br>deadly chemical and there will be thousands more introduced.<br><br>Everybody wants a "piece of the Aspartame pie." I assure you that<br>MONSANTO, the creator of Aspartame, knows how deadly it is. And isn't<br>it ironic that MONSANTO funds, among others, the American Diabetes<br>Association, the American Dietetic Association and the Conference of<br>the American College of Physicians? This has been recently exposed in<br>the New York Times. These cannot criticize any additives or convey<br>their link to MONSANTO because they take money from the food industry<br>and are required to endorse their products.<br><br>Senator Howard Metzenbaum wrote and presented a bill that would<br>require label warnings on products containing Aspartame, especially<br>regarding pregnant women, children and infants. The bill would also<br>institute independent studies on the known dangers and the problems<br>existing in the general population regarding seizures, changes in<br>brain chemistry, neurological changes and behavioural symptoms. The<br>bill was killed.<br><br>It is known that the powerful drug and chemical lobbies are<br>responsible for this, letting loose the hounds of disease and death on<br>an unsuspecting and uninformed public.<br><br>Well, you're informed now!!!! YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW!!!!<br><br></div>
