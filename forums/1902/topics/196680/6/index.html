If you often feel tired, take good breaths of fresh air while doing mild exercises; don't unwind by choosing too taxing a muscular activity, which would only increase your fatigue. You must assert your intentions better and stand by the ambitions you've set for yourself. Your home will be the theater of profound changes; it will be necessary to handle them with much coolheadedness.</div>

Differences and mutual incompatibilities will be felt; they're very likely to afflict the wonderful stability and harmony of your couple; show patience and tolerance! It'll be necessary to let your close relations act more or less in their own way, otherwise you'll risk having big fights within your family circle.<br><br>24 Oct 06<br>Certain natives of this sign will be assailed by almost irresistible fantasies. It'll be the moment to go discovering, to broaden your horizons; you must follow up on your new friendly relationships, as they are going to enrich you intellectually. Accept the precious advice from your family's circle instead of being obstinate. Don't do anything unusual for the moment at your work, because nothing positive will come out of it for you. You'll often ask yourself anguishing questions about life, death and the hereafter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>November 14, 2006<br><br>Do not continue to hesitate; you should hurry to plunge into your projects. Beware of euphoria: Do not spend the money that you will not have already earned and which is not yet in your purse! Be an open book for your nearest and dearest so that your home will be a haven of peace. It is possible that your relationships with your beloved one will be disturbed, but you can overcome this ordeal if you show goodwill.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>November 15, 2006<br><br>Things will improve in your social life and, more particularly, in your material life. Don't chew over sterile rancors in your corner. Your children's aggressiveness will put your patience to the difficult test. Avoid excesses of meats and fats, and your stomach will be grateful to you. Your love affairs will undergo ups and downs; you won't be very romantic, although you'll give the impression of being so.</div>

You'll be at times too emotional and at other times too nervous, burdened with doubts, unstable and having difficulty focusing your attention. Try to avoid making any important decisions today. Measure out your efforts and try to take a rest before you begin feeling too tired.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>November 17, 2006<br><br>A day that's favorable to sentimental encounters. Living as a couple, avoid competing with your spouse. You're likely to have a slight drop of vitality. You'll be seized by a craving for spending; if you go shopping, it'd be prudent to be accompanied by a person who'll be able to slow down your urge to spend and give you advice. Your qualities will be highlighted and your personal efforts rewarded. In family, there'll be a very happy atmosphere; don't revive an old quarrel.</div>
