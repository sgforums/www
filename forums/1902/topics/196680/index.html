            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/1_rat.gif"><br>Though the Western rat is reviled as little more than a bottom-dwelling disease carrier, this animal is viewed much differently in the East. The Eastern rat is revered for its quick wits and its ability to accrue and hold on to items of value; rats are considered a symbol of good luck and wealth in both China and Japan. Clever and quick-witted, the Rat of the Chinese Zodiac is utterly disarming to boot. Possessed of excellent taste, this Sign flaunts its style at every turn. Its natural charm and sharp, funny demeanor make it an appealing friend for almost anyone. The Rat likes to know who is on its side and will treat its most loyal friends with an extra measure of protection and generosity.<br><br>Behind that sweet smile, though, Rats are keen and unapologetic promoters of their own agendas. This Sign is motivated by its own interests, which often include money; greed can become a problem if the Rat isn't careful to keep its priorities straight. This Sign's natural powers of charm and persuasion can definitely come in handy! Although they are often hoarders, Rats can be very generous to those in their "pack," namely friends and family members who have proven their loyalty. Others might perceive them as quick-tempered and sharp-tongued, but never boorish. Verbal jousting is a great pleasure for the Rat, a Sign that everyone around will quickly learn either to love or to hate.<br><br>Rats enjoy being on the outside looking in, as the outside affords a view into the inner workings of a system or situation. The Rat's keen mind always seeks out new knowledge, to be stored away for future use. This ever-curious Sign also welcomes challenges as a way to stay sharp. If boredom sets in the Rat is no fun at all, but that isn't likely; this Sign knows how to keep itself entertained.<br><br>A valuable lesson for Rats is to learn to consider others above themselves, at least sometimes. If they can develop their sense of self and realize it leaves room for others in their life as well, Rats could find true happiness.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Rat is the Dragon or the Monkey.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Rats</span>: Gywneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Ben Affleck.</div>

It is a very sociable sign; Rat people tend to be very talkative and are almost never found sitting quiety on their own. Be aware, however, that this affable front conceals a scretive, crafy and opportunistic personality. Rats can be quite greedy and calculative. being perfectionists they can be difficult to work with, but their considerable talents may be enough to make up for it.</span><br><br>The Rat is:  Popular, life of the party, observant, problem solver, diligent, imaginative, disciplined, thrifty, friendly.<br><br>Suitable as a writer, engineer, entrepreneur, pilot, lawyer<br><br>Well suited with a Dragon, Monkey, Ox, Rabbit and Snake</div>

There are plenty of potential for closing lucrative deals - they key is to spend a little on your customers to achieve the last crucial affirmative. Rats will also prosper if they work on improving their PR skills this year - you will have to be the King (or Queen) or Gab in order to strike! There is also an indication of a pay rise or a promotion for Rats, too - make use of your decision-making and managerial abilities to prosper.<br><br>Relationship<br>For your love life, it's a time for some unusual setbacks. This year may see them feeling very incompatible to their spouse or partner, and they might not even seem to get along with members of the family, too. You may experience quick tempers, and flare out of proportion too! Remember to guard your fiery emotions in times of conflict, and you will thank yourself later for the hindsight.<br><br>For single Rats, though, it is a time full of excitement and fun!<br><br>Health<br>There are dangers related to water for you this 2006 - do refrain from watersports for the year! You may also be a more than a little susceptible to road injuries as well, especially when you are driving. Keep your eyes peeled at all times on the road, and you will do wonderfully.</div>

Some disagreements may arise between you and your spouse; try to be open-minded. On the physical plane, try to relax by different means. The food excesses that you recently committed may result this time in digestive troubles. You'll have to pay for your overindulgence, but you did enjoy yourself so much!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rat people are so charming and attractive they are always surrounded by friends and admirers. They can also be lone tumbleweeds, seldom making lasting friendships. Known as Perfectionists, they never want to lose face. It takes an understanding friend to get them to "put on the dancing plumes." Rat people have vivid imagination and are known for creating extraordinarily magic moments in time. Not surprisingly, the sensitive Rats have the gift of insight and clairvoyance, so you better watch out what you think around them!

This is a natural born leader who inspires everyone through unparalleled leadership! Quite the visionary, the idealistic Rat will see cathedrals in the middle of the desert and make believers out of non-believers. He or she has all the traits necessary to win and keep friends, charm, sincerity, trustworthiness, as well as a sense of humor and grand adventure. The enormously capable Metal Rats are very successful in their career, with financial rewards keeping them forever in clover. When it comes to love, Metal Rats' hearts tend to be a bit brittle because they have been wounded by past love affairs. However, when the Rats finally find the right person, they will do all they can to pursue love, using every means at their disposal.

Commanding and eloquent, always the center of attention, the Water Rats also have a soft side that endears them to the world. When the world needs, Water Rats are there. Humanitarian fighters against hunger, illness, sadness, they try to bring happiness to others through their compassionate endeavors and smiling warmth. When the world wants a friend, it's the loyal and sincere Water Rat which draws them in. The Water Rat has a successful career but money-wise, it's pretty much middle of the road. Changing free-spending ways could lead to financial security if they are willing to make the effort. Their natural charisma attracts members of the opposite sex like wildfire, but Water Rats often don't set their standards high enough and are quite indiscriminate in seeking love affairs, until they finally settle down later in life. Once this happens, they advance pretty far exhibiting oodles of charm with their loved ones.<br><br>WOOD RAT<br><span class="small">Feb 5, 1924 to Jan 23, 1925<br>Feb 2, 1984 to Feb 19, 1985</span><br><br>Wood rats don't care about firecrackers and whiz-bam-boom special effects. Still waters run very deep! Somewhat introverted and shy in social gatherings, Wood Rats nevertheless make a big impact when it comes to career, finance, and entrepreneurial projects. A big ego keeps this one focused on the big picture, talking only when necessary to make the next move. The enterprising Wood Rat knows and lives the rules in human dynamics: compromise, flexibility, "playing it by ear," the Golden Rule, and generosity. In the Love Boat, don't expect the Wood Rat to whisper a lot of sweet nothings; again, still waters run deep. They don't need words, they ACT their love, showering affection, kindness, and respect on their loved ones, who love them in return.<br><br>FIRE RAT<br><span class="small">Jan 24, 1936 to Feb 10, 1937<br>Feb 19, 1996 to Feb 6, 1997 </span><br><br>With bon mots and sparking wordplay, the witty Fire Rat engages in spirited discussions and debates on all matters of intellectual inquiry. These free spirits like to find their own way in life and resent well-meaning friends who suggest other ways of doing things. They are independent, that's all, certainly not stubborn, and this independence leads Fire Rats to pursue adventure over status quo, competition over coasting, and persistence over giving up. Free spirits are naturally attracted to other free spirits who approach love with interdependence, never clinging or cloying. Fire Rats are like Flamenco dancers, passion exploding with sensuality. Ardent lovers for sure, Fire Rats are deeply devoted to friends, family, and loved ones.<br><br>EARTH RAT<br><span class="small">Feb 10, 1948 to Jan 28, 1949<br>Feb 7 , 2008 to Jan 25, 2009</span><br><br>The early years of the Earth Rat's career seemed like nothing but burning the midnight oil at the time. But in retrospect, the strong work ethic, discipline, caution, and long hours are what led to their current life of abundance for themselves and their families. Today there is more time to enjoy the fruits of their labor and to do the things they put off for too long. Life is filled with weekend escapades, longer excursions, and membership in the Unofficial Adventurer's Club, which requires its "members" to live life to its fullest. One very fulfilling area of their lives is Love &amp; Romance, hearts and flowers all the time. Earth Rats are very dependable souls and always attentive towards the needs of their loved ones. Together, they share a love that will last for all the moons of their lives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 Jul 06<br>You'll concern yourself much with your life and will already be thinking about your next vacation. Above all, don't mix sentimental relationships and money, as it would be an explosive mixture; it won't be in your interest to borrow or lend money from even your friends. In love, as well as in business, you'll have a versatile mind and will excel in the art of confusing the most simple things; fortunately, this will have only transitory effects this time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 Jul 06<br>You'll be subjected to a sentimental whirlpool: love at first sight, disputes, jealousies -- everything will be there! If you try to hatch out unrealistic projects, you'll risk having important financial problems. You'll be able to bring everything to a successful conclusion if you organize your efforts in a more methodical manner. In your work, you'll have the possibility to concentrate all your energy on the achievement of objectives dear to your heart; don't hesitate any longer.<br><br>3 Jul 06<br>You'll spare no effort to make your family home a haven of peace and love, and you'll fear conflicts so much that you'll prefer to turn a blind eye to certain problems. You'll have the opportunity to meet many interesting persons. Try first to find out the points you have in common with them in the cultural fields before tackling questions of a sentimental or material order. You'll achieve a feat in your work and receive warm congratulations for that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4 Jul 06<br>The sense of contact, which is inherent in your sign, will be reinforced; profit by it to present certain delicate requests or to hasten the conclusion of certain affairs. If continued, the worries and nervous tension resulting from your disorderly activities may end up badly affecting your health. You may feel a little disappointed by the turn taken by recent events: You had expected much from them, and yet there were only delays in your projects. Have patience, things will straighten themselves out slowly but surely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 Jul 06<br>You'll very probably single yourself out by your childishness and eccentricity. Beware, risk of frequent bouts of hiccups for certain natives of the sign; if the situation lasts for more than a few days, a visit to a doctor may be necessary. You'll have unpredictable reactions, and your enthusiasm toward your entourage will often be followed by a withdrawal into yourself; this disconcerting comportment will make you rather difficult to understand. Expect some unusual money coming in.</div>

The stars will incite you to assert yourself; don't miss this opportunity to develop your professional position.

In your conjugal relationships, you won't always show enough objectivity, and this could sometimes lead you to bad faith; conflicts with your spouse may arise if you persist in your errors. You'll be in an excellent physical form; you'll attach increased importance to your external appearance.</div>
