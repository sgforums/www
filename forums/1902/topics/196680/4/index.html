Beware of what you're going to say, for you could grieve one of your family members; turn your tongue seven times in your mouth before speaking. You'll lack lucidity, which may cause you to commit grave errors of judgment. In love, be sincere and put your cards on the table so that your partners can know exactly what they are up to.</div>

Your good humor will facilitate your contacts with people within the framework of your career or private life; interesting encounters can take place. You'll enjoy much enthusiasm and strength. On the other hand, your judgment will be less sure than usual because you'll lack both objectivity and aloofness from situations.</div>

For natives of this sign who are living in a union, a happy event could very well come to illuminate your joint lives. Cope courageously with the problems of an administrative, fiscal or legal order. A favorable day for the launching of a new undertaking. Risks of high blood pressure; slow down your life tempo.

Even though your cholesterol level is a little high, nothing prevents you from eating a few eggs per week; amino acids indispensable to our bodies are abundantly present in egg proteins. Anything can happen to upset your present amorous situation; what's important is to provoke chance and to be ready to seize it. Your children will be a source of satisfactions to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4 Sep 06<br>The planetary influxes of the day will cause you to be very fastidious toward your partner; he or she will be surprised at your reactions -- which will be much more abrupt and sharp than usual -- and will feel much at a loss. This day will highlight your mental faculties; you'll understand many things that seemed very obscure to you before. At your work, things will be both more difficult and more motivating; you'll make considerable progress. This climate encourages fits of anxiety; confide yourself in somebody.</div>

Your reflexes at your driving wheel will be slightly lessened; be very careful in order to prevent an accident. This astral climate will not make you very reasonable in financial matters: You'll be inclined to spend too much. Your love affairs will be favored, but on the condition that you don't impose your will and that each partner can preserve his or her independence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>6 Sep 06<br>Remain true to yourself, don't try to be like others. You'll lack dynamism and will want to do nothing; on the other hand, in certain cases you'll be overflowing with bubbling energy to the point of succumbing to excessive nervousness. Don't let yourself be clouded by gratuitous beliefs; it will be enough to use good common sense so as not to believe that the moon is made of green cheese. At work, patience must prevail in all cases. Money wounds are not mortal, but you could have avoided them.</div>

Your current romance will go through a rough patch; will it succeed in passing this test? This will depend mostly on you, for your mate seems to value you very much and is ready to make concessions. In your work, you'll be tempted to take great risks so as to reach your objectives rapidly; be aware of your limits as much as of your possibilities.
