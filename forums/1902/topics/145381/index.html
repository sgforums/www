            <div class='col-md body'>Aug 1, 2005<br>Global warming making hurricanes more ferocious<br><br>DENVER - Latest research on global warming seems to show that major storms spinning in both the Atlantic and the Pacific since the 1970s have increased in duration and intensity by about 50 per cent.<br><br>Global warming making hurricanes more ferocious<br>Scientists call the findings both surprising and alarming because they suggest global warming is influencing storms now - rather than in the distant future.<br><br>But the research does not suggest global warming is generating more hurricanes and typhoons.<br><br>These trends are closely linked to increases in the average temperatures of the ocean surface and also correspond to increases in global average atmospheric temperatures during the same period.<br><br>Before this study, most researchers believed global warming's contribution to powerful hurricanes was too slight to accurately measure.<br><br>Most forecasts do not have climate change making a real difference in tropical storms until 2050 or later.<br><br>Theories and computer simulations indicate that global warming should generate an increase in storm intensity, in part because warmer temperatures would heat up the surface of the oceans.<br><br>Especially in the Atlantic and Caribbean basins, pools of warming seawater provide energy for storms as they swirl and grow over the open oceans.<br><br>This year marked the first time on record that the Atlantic spawned four named storms by early July, as well as the earliest category 4 storm on record.<br><br>Hurricanes are ranked on an intensity scale of 1 to 5.<br><br>In the past decade, the south-eastern United States and the Caribbean basin have been pummeled by the most active hurricane cycle on record. Forecasters expect the stormy trend to continue for another 20 years or more. -- AP<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GLOBAL WARMING AND INTENSIFYING STORMS<br><br>THE LATEST research on global warming and storms was done by climatologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who looked at data collected from actual storms rather than using computer models to predict future storm behaviour.<br><br>He studied records of storm measurements made by aircraft and satellites since the 1950s. He found the amount of energy released in these storms in both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific oceans has increased, especially since the mid-1970s.<br><br>In the Atlantic, the sea surface temperatures show a pronounced upward trend. The same is true in the North Pacific, though the data there is more variable, he said.<br><br>'The total energy dissipated by hurricanes turns out to be well correlated with tropical sea surface temperatures,' he said. 'The large upswing in the past decade is unprecedented and probably reflects the effects of global warming.'<br><br>But some scientists questioned his methods. For example, he did not consider wind speed information from some powerful storms in the 1950s and 1960s because the details of those storms are inconsistent. -- AP<br></div>
