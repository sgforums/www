              <p><em><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Thursday, June 11, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><br><br>Failing to see the forest for the trees 
              may be causing us to overlook the declining health of Wisconsin's forest 
              ecosystems. <br><br>Even areas with apparently robust trees and lush canopies 
              are threatened as forests are increasingly fragmented by roads and development, 
              becoming isolated green islands in a sea of agricultural fields, housing tracts, 
              and strip malls, say University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers. <br><br>A new 
              study is revealing that decades of fragmentation of Wisconsin's forests have 
              taken a largely unseen toll on the sustainability of these natural ecosystems. 
              <br><br>The long generation times of trees and other plants have masked many of 
              the ecological changes already under way in the patches of forest that remain, 
              says study co-author Don Waller, a professor in the Department of Botany and 
              Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at UW-Madison. "Things may look 
              healthy, but over time we see an erosion of biodiversity," he says. <br><br>To 
              better catalog the changes at work, he and colleagues looked beyond the trees to 
              the forest understory — the shrubs, grasses and herbs covering the forest floor 
              — to witness how Wisconsin's forests are really faring. Their results, published 
              online June 8 and appearing in an upcoming issue of the journal Conservation 
              Biology, show that fragmentation is reducing the abundance and diversity of 
              native plants in southern Wisconsin forests. <br><br>The findings highlight the 
              effects of increasing urban development and road density, especially in the 
              southeastern part of the state. Land use changes have a pronounced impact on the 
              islands of forest that remain, even when these are protected as parks or natural 
              areas. <br><br>"These forest patches are not just losing species — their whole 
              biological nature is changing," says David Rogers, an assistant professor of 
              biological sciences at UW-Parkside who led the study while a UW-Madison graduate 
              student. "Surrounding landscape factors, like urbanization and agricultural 
              dominance, are now determining which species can survive in these little 
              patches." <br><br>One unique quality of the current work is that it builds on a 
              detailed trove of historical data collected throughout the state in the 1940s 
              and 1950s by renowned UW-Madison ecologist John Curtis. More than 50 years 
              later, Rogers and others revisited many of Curtis's sites in southern Wisconsin 
              to see what changes time has wrought. <br><br>Though negative effects of 
              fragmentation on biodiversity have gone largely unrecognized in the past, the 
              impacts appear to be intensifying over time, the researchers say. Nearby cities 
              and towns now strongly affect local woodlots, causing smaller plots in 
              particular to lose species. <br><br>"When we isolated these forest patches 50 or 
              100 years ago, we were dooming species to extinction," says Waller. "It may not 
              happen right away — and in that sense it's an 'extinction debt' — but it will 
              accumulate over time." <br><br>They believe that isolation takes its biggest 
              toll on forest plant diversity by cutting off routes for native plants to 
              re-colonize areas where local populations may have disappeared. "Plant species 
              might go locally extinct for lots of different reasons," including natural 
              cycles of turnover, Waller says. "But typically the area will be re-colonized 
              very soon by nearby populations of the same species. That's what does not happen 
              once a habitat becomes isolated or that patch becomes smaller." <br><br>The 
              connections between local plant communities and more distant landscapes have 
              increased markedly. The bottom line is that humans appear to be having larger 
              cumulative impacts on Wisconsin's forest communities than even ecologists 
              previously appreciated. <br><br>This realization has important implications for 
              how we should manage southern Wisconsin's remaining forests, Rogers says. The 
              scientists are now working to identify the specific factors driving the observed 
              ecological changes. <br><br>"People are a really important part of the system," 
              Rogers says. "We are having a greater influence over our local ecology, whether 
              we want to or not. That puts the responsibility on people to take care of it, 
              protect it and maintain it." <br><br>### <br><br>University of
