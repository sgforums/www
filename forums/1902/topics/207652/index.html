The flowers and leaves are best used fresh and added only during the last few minutes of cooking. Basil works well in combination with tomatoes. Finely chopped basil stirred into mayonnaise makes a good sauce for fish. Use as a garnish for vegetables, chicken and egg dishes. Large lettuce-leaf basil can be stuffed as you would a grape leaf.<br><br>Basil doesn't keep well in the refrigerator. Instead, place the cut stems in water and keep them on the windowsill. Sprigs stored this way will remain fresh a week or more.<br><br>Basil doesn't retain its flavor well when dried. Instead, layer basil between sheets of waxed paper and freeze. The leaves will darken when frozen this way, but you'll be pleasantly surprised at how well it will retain aroma and flavor. You can also fill ice cube trays with chopped basil, and then cover with water and freeze. Basil ice cubes are great for soups and stews.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medicinal Use</span><br>To relieve sore gums, swish out the mouth often with a tea made from eight basil leaves in a cup of boiling water. A basil leaf tucked into the mouth over an ulcer and kept there for as long as possible will ease the pain.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Uses</span><br>Basil in the bath is refreshing.<br>Leaves and flowers can be dried for potpourri.<br>Burn sprigs of basil on the barbecue to deter mosquitoes.<br>A bunch of basil hung over the kitchen window or a pot of basil in the windowsill will deter flies.</div>

Curly leaf parsley is often used as a garnish.

One of the compounds of the essential oil is apiol.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: green;"><span class="large">Thyme</span></span></strong><br><br>Thyme is an invaluable element in the kitchen: it blends with and enhances many other herbs without overpowering them.  Thyme is best known as one of the primary components in a classic bouquet garni. When combined with fresh sprigs of parsley and leaves of bay, it will enliven and give depth to the flavor of soups, stews and sauces. A native of the sunny Mediterranean hillsides, thyme is also a key element in the traditional, dried, aromatic blend Herbes de Provence.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Thymus_vulgaris.jpg/240px-Thymus_vulgaris.jpg"><br><br><strong>Common types of thyme</strong><br>While there are over 100 varieties of thyme, all of which are fragrant to some extent, there are three that have a special place in the kitchen: lemon thyme (Thymus citriodorus), caraway thyme (Thymus herba-barona), and common thyme (Thymus vulgaris).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lemon thyme</span> is a compact, upright shrub that grows to a height of 12 inches. The leaves are tiny and heart shaped, ringed with a splash of yellow. As the name implies, lemon thyme has a bit of a citrus tang, but is milder than most other thyme. This makes it a natural choice for seasoning seafood dishes and even sweets. The citrus flavor also helps to lighten fatty dishes. The natural, volatile oils also work as a digestive aid. These same pungent oils make lemon thyme a favorite in aroma therapy for the treatment of asthma.<br><br><img src="http://www.sallys-place.com/images/food/column/gilbert/thyme.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Caraway thyme</span>, although difficult to find, makes an intriguing addition to meat dishes and is especially tasty in combination with garlic and wine. It is a low-growing variety that forms a dense, dark green mat. It spreads quickly, making it a good ground cover, especially with its soft, pink blossoms.  <strong>Creeping thyme</strong> (Thymus drucei) also called "mother of thyme" or "wild thyme," is another low-growing variety, more often used for gardening than for cooking. It is ideal for filling in garden pathways and between stepping stones in areas of light foot traffic, producing a soft, fragrant carpet under foot.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common or garden thyme</span> (Thymus vulgaris) is the variety with which people are most familiar. A shrubby perennial that grows six to twelve inches, its narrow, pale grey, green leaves have a pungent, woody aroma. A native of the Mediterranean, it grows in areas where there is plenty of sun and good drainage. Drought conditions tends to concentrate the oils, producing a more potent herb. When cooking with thyme be sure to add it early in the process so the oils, and thus the flavor, has time to be released.<br><br><img src="http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/pictures/thym_01.jpg">     <span class="small">Flowering garden thyme</span><br><br><strong>History &amp; Uses</strong><br>The use of thyme has been recorded as far back as 3000 BC when it was used as an antiseptic by the Sumerians. The early Egyptians also used thyme as one of the ingredients in their mummification process.<br><br>The hills of Greece are covered with wild thyme, and thyme honey from the tiny pink and lavender blossoms is plentiful. To the ancient Greeks, thyme came to denote elegance, and the phrase "to smell of thyme" became an expression of stylish praise. Thyme was widely used: medically, in massage and bath oils, as incense in the temples and as an aphrodisiac. Even the origins of the word thyme are Greek: from the word thymon meaning "courage."<br><br>The Romans also associated thyme with courage and vigor, bathing in waters scented with thyme to prepare themselves for battle. The Scottish highlanders of old would prepare a tea of wild thyme for the same purpose, as well as for warding off nightmares. During the Middle Ages, European ladies embroidered a sprig of thyme on tunics for their knights, again as a token of courage.<br><br>More recently, noted herbalist Culpeper recommended an infusion of thyme to relieve "the headaches occasioned by inebriation."<br><br>In literature, thyme is often associated with the activities of fairies. Shakespeare's Oberon, king of the fairies, speaks of knowing "...where the wild thyme grows." The English variety of wild thyme referred to has the highest concentration of volatile oils. Perhaps this accounts for its use as one of the main ingredients in a 17th century recipe which "enables one to see the Faeries."<br><br>With its elfin leaves, delicate blossoms and subtle, woodsy flavor, it is easy to see why thyme might be associated with things elusive and magical, even in the kitchen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: orange;"><span class="large">Use of herbs: fresh or dried better?</span></span></strong><br><br>There are various opinions concerning the question whether herbs should be better used fresh or dried. Several herbs lose their flavour partially or in full when dried: Examples include coriander, parsley, tarragon, bear's garlic and dill, but also curry leaves and lemon grass.<br><br>Advanced drying technology may in some cases preserve the original flavour, at least in part; but these herbs are, even with best dehydration equipment, always better used fresh than dried. Better preservation may be achieved with special preparations, (e.g., pesto made from basil).  The loss of fragrance is mainly due to two causes: Aroma components escape to the air (evaporation) or may be chemically destroyed, mainly by oxidation.<br><br>Some herbs, however, show a different, even paradoxical, behaviour: Their spiciness actually increases when dried. Sometimes, one reads an explanation of that effect stating that on drying, structures in the plant tissue collapse which results in increased mobility and availability of the essential oil which can now easier diffuse into the foods. Besides thyme, that phenomenon can be observed in oregano and rosemary: For all three herbs, the (skilfully) dried herb surpasses the fresh one in intensity by a factor of two or three.</div>

"eight-horn" ) is a spice that closely resembles anise in flavor, obtained from the star-shaped pericarp of <span style="font-style: italic;">Illicium verum</span>, a small native evergreen tree of southwest China. The star shaped fruits are harvested just before ripening. It is widely used in Chinese cuisine, and to a lesser degree in South Asia and Indonesia. Star anise is an ingredient of the traditional five-spice powder of Chinese cooking. It is also one of the ingredients used to make the broth for the Vietnamese noodle soup called pho.<br><br>Star anise contains anethole, the same ingredient which gives the unrelated anise its flavor. Recently, star anise has come into use in the West as a less expensive substitute for anise in baking as well as in liquor production, most distinctively in the production of the liquor Galliano.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Galliano-and-glass.jpg/125px-Galliano-and-glass.jpg"><br><br>Star anise has been used in a tea as a remedy for colic and rheumatism, and the seeds are sometimes chewed after meals to aid digestion.<br><br>Although it is produced in most autotrophic organisms, star anise is the industrial source of shikimic acid, a primary ingredient used to create the anti-flu drug <strong>Tamiflu</strong>. Tamiflu is regarded as the most promising drug to mitigate the severity of bird flu (H5N1); however, reports indicate that some forms of the virus have already adapted to Tamiflu. A shortage of star anise is one of the key reasons why there is a worldwide shortage of Tamiflu (as of 2005).<br><br><img src="http://www.makantime.com/ingredientguide/images/glossary/staranise.jpg">          <span class="small">Star Anise</span><br><br><img src="http://www.makantime.com/ingredientguide/images/glossary/anise.jpg">          <span class="small">Anise</span><br><br>Star anise is grown in four provinces in China and harvested between March and May. The shikimic acid is extracted from the seeds in a ten-stage manufacturing process which takes a year. Reports say 90% of the harvest is already used by the Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer Roche in making Tamiflu, but other reports say there is an abundance of the spice in the main regions - Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan.<br><br><strong>Japanese star anise </strong>(<span style="font-style: italic;">Illicium anisatum</span>), a similar tree, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not edible </span>because it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highly toxic</span>; instead, it has been burned as incense in Japan. Cases of illness, including "serious neurological effects, such as seizures", reported after using star anise tea may be a result of using this species. Japanese star anise contains anisatin, which causes severe inflammation of the kidneys, urinary tract and digestive organs.</div>

They are often pickled in vinegar or sherry as a snack or just cooked as an ingredient in many dishes. They can also be stewed in boiling water to make ginger tea, to which honey is often added as a sweetener.<br><br>Mature ginger roots are fibrous and nearly dry. The juice from old ginger roots is extremely potent and is often used as a spice in Chinese cuisine to cover up other strong odors and flavors such as in seafood and mutton.<br><br>Ginger is also candied, is used as a flavoring for candy, cookies, crackers and cake, and is the main flavor in ginger ale, a sweet, carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage, as well as the similar, but somewhat spicier beverage ginger beer.<br><br>A ginger-flavored liqueur called Canton is produced in the Guangdong province of China; it is advertised to be based on a recipe created for the rulers of the Qing Dynasty and made from six different varieties of ginger.<br><br>Green ginger wine is produced in the United Kingdom traditionally Crabbie's and Stone's, in a green glass bottle.

Ground and fresh ginger taste quite different and ground ginger is a particularly poor substitute for fresh ginger. Fresh ginger can be successfully substituted for ground ginger and should be done at a ratio of 6 parts fresh for 1 part ground. You generally achieve better results by substituting only half the ground ginger for fresh ginger.<br><br>In Myanmar, ginger is used in a salad dish called gyin-tho, which consists of shredded ginger preserved in oil, and a variety of nuts and seeds.<br><br>In traditional Korean Kimchi, ginger is minced finely and added into the ingredients of the spicy paste just before the fermenting process.<br><br>In India, ginger is used in all sub-varieties of the indian cuisines. In south India, ginger is used in the production of a candy called Inji-murappa ("ginger candy" from Tamil). This candy is mostly sold by vendors to bus passengers in bus stops and in small tea shops as a locally produced item. Candied ginger is also very famous around these parts. Additionally, in Tamil Nadu, especially in the Tanjore belt, a variety of ginger which is less spicy is used when tender to make fresh pickle with the combination of lemon juice, salt and tender green chillies. This kind of pickle was generally made before the invention of refrigeration and stored for a maximum of 4-5 days. The pickle gains a mature flavor when the juices cook the ginger over the first 24 hours.<br><br>Ginger has a sialagogue action, stimulating the production of saliva.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/ARS_ginger.jpg"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">25.4-pound ginger root</span><br><br><strong>Medicinal uses</strong><br>Medical research has shown that ginger root is an effective treatment for nausea caused by motion sickness or other illness, and also contains many antioxidants.<br><br>Ginger ale and ginger beer have been recommended as "stomach settlers" for generations in countries where the beverages are made.

The name coriander derives from Latin <span style="font-style: italic;">coriandrum</span>, which was first noted by Pliny (the Elder). The Latin word derives in turn from Greek <span style="font-style: italic;">corys</span>, a bedbug, plus <span style="font-style: italic;">-ander</span>, "resembling", and refers to the supposed similarity of the scent of the crushed leaves to the distinctive odour of bedbugs (largely forgotten in this age of insecticides).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Uses</span><br>All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the most commonly used in cooking. Coriander is commonly used in Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, South Asian, Latin American, Chinese, African and Southeast Asian cuisine.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Coriander.jpg/180px-Coriander.jpg"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leaves</span><br>The leaves are variously referred to as <strong>coriander leaves</strong>, <strong>cilantro</strong> (in the United States, from the Spanish name for the plant), <strong>dhania</strong> (in the Indian subcontinent, and increasingly, in Britain), <strong>Chinese parsley </strong>or <strong>Mexican parsley</strong>. The leaves have a very different taste from the seeds, similar to parsley but "juicier" and with citrus-like overtones. Some people instead perceive an unpleasant "soapy" taste and/or a rank smell. This taste is believed to be a genetic trait, but has yet to be fully researched.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fruit</span><br>The dry fruits are known as <strong>coriander seeds</strong>. In some regions, the use of the word <span style="font-style: italic;">coriander</span> in food preparation always refers to these seeds (as a spice), rather than to the plant itself. The seeds have a lemony citrus flavour when crushed, due to the presence of the terpenes linalool and pinene. It is also described as warm, nutty, spicy, and orange-flavoured. They are usually dried but can be eaten green.<br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/Coriander.png/180px-Coriander.png"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Roots</span><br>Coriander roots are used in a variety of oriental cuisine.
