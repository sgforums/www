            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">GARLIC</span></strong><br><br>Garlic (<span style="font-style: italic;">Allium sativum</span>) is a perennial plant in the family Alliaceae and genus Allium, closely related to the onion, shallot, and leek. It does not grow in the wild, and is thought to have arisen in cultivation, probably descended from the species <span style="font-style: italic;">Allium longicuspis</span>, which grows wild in south-western Asia. Garlic has been used throughout all of recorded history for both culinary and medicinal purposes.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a6/Czosnek_1511.jpg/240px-Czosnek_1511.jpg">     <span class="small">Garlic plants</span><br><br>The portion of the plant most often consumed is an underground storage structure called a head. A head of garlic is composed of a dozen or more discrete cloves, each of which is a botanical bulb, an underground structure comprised of thickened leaf bases. Each garlic clove may often be composed of just one leaf base, unlike onions, which almost always have multiple layers. The above-ground portions of the garlic plant are also sometimes consumed, particularly while immature and tender.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Garlic.jpg/180px-Garlic.jpg">    <span class="small">Garlic bulb and individual cloves, one peeled</span><br><br>Garlic has a powerful pungent or "hot" flavor when raw, which mellows considerably when it is cooked. Raw or cooked, garlic is noted for its strong characteristic odor, and for giving those who eat it a distinctive breath odor as well. Some cultures accept the odor of garlic more than others. Northern European cuisines, for example, use garlic only modestly and tend to cook it for long periods of time to diminish its strength.<br><br>Like other members of the onion family, garlic actually creates the chemicals that give it its sharp flavor when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell of a garlic clove is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids. The resultant compounds are responsible for the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic.<br><br>Although people have come to enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals like birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/Czosnek2_1511.jpg">     <span class="small">Garlic flowerhead</span><br><br><strong>Culinary use</strong><br>Garlic is most often used as a seasoning or a condiment. When crushed or finely chopped it yields allicin, a powerful antibiotic and anti-fungal compound (phytoncide). It also contains alliin, ajoene, enzymes, vitamin B, minerals, and flavonoids.<br><br>Garlic is widely used in many forms of cooking for its strong flavor, which is considered to enhance many other flavors.<br><br>When eaten in quantity, garlic may be strongly evident in the diner's sweat and breath the following day. This is because garlic's strong smelling sulfur compounds are metabolized forming allyl methyl sulfide. <span style="font-style: italic;">Allyl methyl sulfide </span>(AMS) cannot be digested and is passed into the blood. It is carried to the lungs and the skin where it is excreted. Since digestion takes several hours, and release of AMS several hours more, the effect of eating garlic may be present for a long time.<br><br>The well-known phenomenon of "garlic breath" is alleged to be alleviated by eating fresh parsley. Because of its strong odor, garlic is sometimes called the "stinking rose".<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Garlic_Press_and_Garlic.jpg/180px-"><br><br><strong>Medicinal Uses</strong><br>Garlic has been used throughout the ages to ward off disease, and has saved many lives in epidemics of infectious diseases. It is antibacterial and gives protection against colds and flu. Garlic improves circulation and lowers blood pressure. In clinical studies, garlic reduced cholesterol levels. Further studies indicate that garlic may have a positive role in the prevention of coronary heart disease, thrombosis and arteriosclerosis. It may even offer some degree of protection against cancer.<br><br><strong>Superstition and mythology</strong><br>Garlic has been seen as a force for both good and evil. A Christian myth says that after Satan left the Garden of Eden, garlic arose in his left footprint, and onion in the right. Even in Europe, though, many cultures have turned to garlic as a protective force or white magic, perhaps because of its reputation as a powerful preventative medicine. Central European folk beliefs considered garlic a powerful ward against devils, werewolves, and vampires. To ward off vampires, garlic could be worn on one's person, hung in windows, or rubbed on chimneys and keyholes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: green;">WASABI</span></strong><br>(a spice)<br><br>Wasabi  (<span style="font-style: italic;">Wasabia japonica</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cochlearia wasabi</span>, or <span style="font-style: italic;">Eutrema japonica</span>) is a member of the cabbage family. Known as Japanese horseradish, its root is used as a spice and has an extremely strong flavor. Its hotness is more akin to that of a hot mustard than a chile pepper, producing vapors that burn the sinus cavity rather than the tongue. The plant grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Wasabi_crop_2006-07-29.JPG/220px-"><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Wasabi_crop_2006-07-29.JPG" rel="nofollow">Wasabi growing on Japan's Izu peninsula</a><br><br><strong>Culinary uses, History and Cultivation</strong><br><br>Wasabi is a condiment traditionally served with raw fish (sushi and sashimi) and noodle (soba) dishes in Japan. The ground root-like rhizome pungently flavors many foods in Japanese cuisine and its bright green color adds color contrast, for which Japanese dishes are famous. In the last twenty years, because of low supply of fresh Wasabi rhizomes, substitutes made of mixtures of horseradish, mustard and food coloring have taken the place of freshly prepared Wasabi. Other parts of the Wasabi plant are also used. The leaves and petioles are picked or can be powdered for use as Wasabi flavoring, used now in many foods.<br><br>Wasabi is generally sold either in the form of a root, which must be very finely grated before use, or as a ready-to-use paste, usually in tubes approximately the size and shape of travel toothpaste tubes. Once the paste is prepared it should remain covered until served to protect the flavour from evaporation. For this reason, sushi chefs usually put the wasabi between the fish and the rice.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/WasabiOnOroshigane.jpg/220px-"><br><br>In traditional Japanese cuisine, Wasabi is prepared by grating the fresh rhizome against a rough surface. Some Japanese Sushi Chefs will only use a sharkskin grater. The sharkskin gives grated Wasabi a smooth, soft and aromatic finish.<br><br>The best way to enjoy the full flavor of Fresh Wasabi is to spread a little on the fish and then dip the fish side of the sushi into soy sauce so that the sauce does not touch the Wasabi. Good Fresh Wasabi and Wasabi paste does not just have add spicy hotness, and sweetness but also a gentle fragrance to assist the taste of fresh fish with soy sauce.<br><br>Many diners, however, prefer to mix the Wasabi paste with soy sauce, called "<span style="font-style: italic;">Wasabi-joyu</span>," and use this as a dipping sauce for the raw fish, or mix the Wasabi directly into a bowl of noodles.<br><br>Tofu topped with soy sauce and Wasabi paste is an example of another traditional food using Wasabi. Wasabi leaves pickled in sake brine or soy sauce are popular accompaniments to white rice. It should be pointed out that a considerable amount of the volatile aroma and taste of the Wasabi paste would be lost when mixed with soy sauce or a heated dish.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Wasabi_tube.jpg/180px-Wasabi_tube.jpg"><span class="small">A tube of wasabi</span><br><br><strong>Why Real Wasabi?</strong><br><br>Don't be fooled. The green smooth textured clump on the side of your sushi dish is rarely real wasabi. More commonly it is ordinary horseradish with food coloring added.<br><br><img src="http://www.japan-guide.com/g3/ib2311_01.gif"><br><br>Real wasabi is one of the rarest and most difficult vegetables in the world to grow. Few geographical areas are suited for growing wasabi.<br><br>More recently,  wasabi has found widespread appeal in western cuisine due to its unique flavor. Used as an ingredient in dressings, dips, sauces and marinades, wasabi is a versatile spice and is rapidly becoming one of the most popular new flavors.<br><br><strong>Wasabi and imitations</strong><br><br>Almost all sushi bars in America, and most in Japan, serve imitation wasabi because the real product is relatively more expensive. Imitation wasabi is usually made from horseradish, mustard, and green food coloring (sometimes spirulina), often as a powder to be mixed with water to make a paste. Since real wasabi loses its flavor if dried, its presence as an ingredient in some powders is of questionable value.<br><br><img src="http://homepage3.nifty.com/maryy/eng/wasabi1.jpg"> <span style="font-style: italic;">Hon Wasabi</span><br><br>A real and fresh raw wasabi is often called <span style="font-style: italic;">'hon-wasabi' (true wasabi</span>) specifically to differentiate from other fakes.  Once grated, it presents an excellent mild flavour and taste not comparable to a commercial tubed paste or ones that are made from powdered (<span style="font-style: italic;">'kona'-) wasabi</span>, those are prepared just from only (100%) dried and powdered (European) horseradish, called "<span style="font-style: italic;">seiyo'o - wasabi</span>," which is FAR different from the Japanese green and fresh horseradish, and they contain mustard and colorants as additives to presume the wasabi.<br><br>But such fakes are playing an important role today because the real wasabi is so precious and difficult to obtain.  Without such products, we cannot easily taste wasabi and sushi cheaper.  We should not and could not simply disregard such artificial fake wasabis, or they are also great as <span style="font-style: italic;">hon-wasabi </span>indeed.<br><br><img src="http://homepage3.nifty.com/maryy/eng/wasabi_pwd.jpg">   Wasabi powder</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: orange;">HORSERADISH</span></strong></span><br><br>Horseradish (<span style="font-style: italic;">Armoracia rusticana</span>, syn. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cochlearia armoracia</span>) is a perennial plant of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages. The plant is probably native to southeastern Europe and western Asia, but is popular around the world today. It grows up to 1.5 metres (five feet) tall and is mainly cultivated for its large white, tapering root, although the leaves are also edible.<br><br><img src="http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/pictures/armo_01.jpg"><br><br>Its root is used as a vegetable or ground in a condiment called prepared horseradish, and has at times been used as the bitter herbs in the Passover meal in some Jewish communities. Horseradish, sometimes blended with cream and called horseradish sauce, is often served with roast or boiled beef or sausages, as well as smoked fish. Horseradish is also used in some prepared mustards. Also, much of what is styled wasabi is actually common horseradish dyed green.<br><br>The horseradish root itself has hardly any aroma. When cut or grated, however, enzymes from the damaged plant cells break down sinigrin (a glucosinolate) to produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), which irritates the sinuses and eyes. Once grated, if not used immediately or mixed in vinegar, the root darkens and loses its pungency and becomes unpleasantly bitter when exposed to air and heat.<br><br><img src="http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/pictures/armo_02.jpg"><br><br><strong>Culinary Uses</strong><br><br>Horseradish is a very popular spice in Central and Northern Europe, where the fresh root is grated and eaten together with cured ham or cooked or roasted meat (e.g., British roastbeef); at Easter time, cured ham with horseradish is a traditional meal in Austria. Since the aroma is so volatile and instable, the tearful process of grating must be repeated several times during the meal. Horseradish preservatives, usually grated and tinned root with a few stabilizing additions, are available, but true lovers of the root think them inferior, though much more convenient.<br><br>The pungent allyl isothiocyanate is not heat resistant; therefore, horseradish is only seldom used for warm foods and then added immediately before serving. Even in cold water, allyl isothiocyanate is not stable for longer than a few minutes. However, in sour environment the hydrolysis of thiocyanates takes place much more slowly.<br><br><img src="http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/pictures/armo_10.jpg">     <span class="small">Horseradish flower</span><br><br>In Austria, freshly grated horseradish (or tinned product) is frequently mixed with grated apples (sour varieties preferred, otherwise some lemon juice is needed) and then eaten as a spicy relish to fried or cooked meat. This mixture (Apfelkren) can be stored for about one day without substantial loss in pungency. To prevent darkening of the apples (enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds by oxygen), the apples may shortly steamed before mashing them; this won't much affect the flavour but gives a softer, smoother texture.<br><br><strong>Creamy Horseradish Sauce</strong><br><br>Yield: 1 cup<br><br>Ingredients:<br>2/3 cup freshly grated horseradish<br>1/3 cup white vinegar<br>1/3 cup mayonnaise<br>1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br><br>Preparation:<br>Combine the horseradish and vinegar in a blender container. Process at high speed. Add the mayonnaise and blend well. Add the oil and continue blending at high speed until purÃ¨ed. Refrigerate, covered, until serving time.<br><br><span class="small">Recipe taken from "The Purple Kiwi Cookbook" by Karen Caplan</span><br><br><img src="http://www.asiamex.com/images/prods/2426.gif">     <span class="small">Bottled horseradish</span><br><br><strong>History</strong><br>by Judy McCann<br><br>Horseradish is a perennial herb and a member of the mustard family, to which cauliflower and Brussels sprout belong. This pungent root grew in Greece more than 3,000 years ago. Medieval people regarded horseradish as an aphrodisiac and claimed it to be the cure for everything. From the Bible, it is known as one of the five "bitter herbs" and is traditionally served at Passover. Folklore also has it that the Indians used horseradish to treat toothaches. Horseradish syrup was taken as a cough medicine.<br><br>The plant was brought to the New World from England, but Germans, and Eastern Europeans had been complementing their meals with it long before the English.<br><br>The word "horseradish" first appeared in print in 1597 in John Gerard's English herbal on medicinal plants. A different view is that this herb was first called "harsh" radish because its volatile oils were bitter on the tongue. The word "horseradish" is believed to denote large size and coarseness, while "radish" comes from the Latin radix, meaning root.<br><br><img src="http://img.recipezaar.com/img/recipes/63/14/6/small/picsD0AB9.jpg">     <span class="small">Horseradish potatoes</span><br><br>Perhaps the first person to grind horseradish for profit was Henry J. Heinz (Oct. 11, 1844), the founder of the mammoth H. J. Heinz Company. As a small boy, Heinz helped his father grind the root in the basement of their home. It wasn't until the fall of 1933 that studies were initiated by the Illinois Agricultural Department. The most recent discovery came at M.I.T., where scientists say that the enzyme "horseradish Peroxidase" removes a number of pollutants from waste water -- another testimonial to the potency of this surprisingly delicious root!</div>

It is rich in vitamin C and iron.<br><br>Rocket has been grown as a vegetable in the Mediterranean area since Roman times, and was considered an aphrodisiac. Before the 1990s it was usually collected in the wild and was not cultivated on a large scale and not scientifically researched until the 1990s. Today, it is cultivated in various places, especially in Veneto, and available throughout the world.<br><br><img src="http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/pictures/eruc_07.jpg">    Rocket leaf<br><br><strong>Varieties</strong><br>Scientifically, arugula consists of three species: <span style="font-style: italic;">Eruca sativa, Diplotaxis tenuifolia</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Diplotaxis muralis</span>.<br><br>Two main forms are found - wild rocket, with smaller, more peppery leaves, and wide leaved or cultivated rocket, with a less pronounced taste.<br><br><strong>Sensory quality</strong><br>All rocket species have a distinct, pungent-aromatic flavour; the pungency increases with the age of the leaf. The aroma is often described as nutty, herbal or green; voices from people who dislike the herb speak about penetrating or petroleum-like.<br><br><img src="http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/pictures/eruc_08.jpg">     Wild rocket<br><br><strong>Culinary uses</strong><br>The potent flavour of rocket became quite popular in a couple of European countries, and also in the USA. Although the herb had enjoyed considerable popularity all over temperate Europe in the Middle Ages, both for the aromatic leaves and the pungent seeds, its cultivation was neglected afterwards, and since the 18.th century, rocket was practically restricted to the Mediterranean, where it grows wild. Now, rocket is back to Western and Central Europe.<br><br>In the last years, there was a constant trend to use more herbs in cooking, and every year new herbs become known and available. At present, rocket as well as basil, coriander and bear's garlic (the latter only in Central Europe) have become symbols of good cooking that can hardly be ignored by any chef.<br><br><img src="http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/pictures/eruc_05.jpg">     <span class="small">Wild rocket, flowering plant</span><br><br>The most typical use of rocket is as a flavouring for salads; it lends an interesting, spicy note to all kinds of lettuce, but I like it less for tomato salads. Chopped rocket leaves are a good garnish for many Mediterranean foods, but care must be taken that the rocket flavour does not dominate. Rocket leaves prepared with olive oil, aceto balsamico and freshly grated Parmigiano cheese makes an excellent appetizer for any Mediterranean, especially Italian, feast.<br><br>In its pungency, rocket reminds of the various cresses (e.g. garden cress, water cress); but it has, in addition, a powerful flavour of its own which some people dislike, at least on first try.  In Italy, it is often used in pizzas, but is only added after baking. It is sometimes used as an ingredient in pesto, either in addition to basil or as a (non-traditional) substitute.<br><br>If heated (boiled or steamed), rocket quickly loses all pungency, but acquires a characteristic, rather subtle flavour that fits well to some kinds of tasty food, e.g., Italian pasta or risotto dishes. In such applications, however, one needs a lot of rocket to impart a noticeable flavour, and one should keep the heating period as short as possible<br><br><img src="http://www.fotosearch.com/comp/FDC/FDC001/901199.jpg">    <span class="small">Arugula</span></div>
