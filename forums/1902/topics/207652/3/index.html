            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: green;">WHAT IS A HERB?</span></strong><br><br>Herbs are plants grown for culinary, medicinal, or in some cases even spiritual value. The green, leafy part of the plant is typically used.<br><br>General usage differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs. A medicinal herb may be a shrub or other woody plant, whereas a culinary herb is a non-woody plant.<br><br>Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Herbs.jpg/180px-Herbs.jpg"><br><br>Other definition of herb:<br>1. culinary and medicinal plant: a low-growing aromatic plant used fresh or dried for seasoning, for its medicinal properties, or in perfumes. Sage and rosemary are herbs.<br><br>2. botany plant without woody stems: a seed-producing flowering plant that does not produce woody stems and that forms new stems and leaves each season<br><br>3. A plant whose stem does not become woody and permanent, but dies, at least down to the ground, after flowering.<br><br><strong><span style="color: brown;">WHAT IS A SPICE?</span></strong><br><br>A spice is a dried seed, fruit, root, bark or vegetative substance used in nutritionally insignificant quantities as a food additive for the purpose of flavoring.<br><br>Many of the same substances have other uses in which they are referred to by different terms, e. g. in food preservation, medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics, perfumery or as vegetables. For example, turmeric is also used as a preservative; licorice as a medicine; garlic as a vegetable and nutmeg as a recreational drug.<br><br>Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are leafy, green plant parts used for flavoring purposes. Herbs, such as basil or oregano, may be used fresh; spices, however, are dried.<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Spicesindia.jpg/180px-Spicesindia.jpg"><br><br>Other definition of spice:<br>1. aromatic plant substance used as flavoring: an aromatic plant substance used as a flavoring, e.g. nutmeg or ginger<br><br>2. flavorings from plants: food flavorings derived from the nonleafy parts of plants<br><br>3.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: olive;">Indoor Herb Gardening</span></strong><br><br>Herbs can also be grown indoors for year-round enjoyment. Growing herbs indoors is no more difficult than growing them in the garden.<br><br>Indoor plants will need essentially the same conditions as herbs grown outdoors -- sunlight and a well-drained soil mix that is not too rich.<br><br>Select a south or west window. Different herbs have different light requirements, but most need a sunny location; in winter, "grow lamps" or fluorescent lamps are helpful in supplementing light.<br><br>When planting, mix two parts sterilized potting soil and one part coarse sand or perlite. To ensure sweetness of the soil, add a cut of ground limestone per bushel of soil -- or 1 teaspoon of lime per 5-inch pot. There should be an inch of gravel at the bottom of each pot to ensure good drainage.<br><br>Consider the water needs of each herb. Growing plants need more water as do plants in clay pots or hanging baskets. Misting and grouping the plants on a tray of moistened pebbles will help keep them in a humid condition. Don't drench herbs -- avoid getting herb roots soggy.<br><br><img src="http://www.herbkits.com/images/stackandgrowherbs2.jpg"><br><br>Annual herbs can spend their full life cycle in a pot indoors. Perennial herbs, however, will do better if you place them outdoors during the summer. Plunge the pot in soil up to its rim, or keep it in a protected location on the porch or patio.<br><br>Herb plants need sun during the summer months, so place them accordingly. To prevent the loss of foliage and avoid plant damage, bring herbs indoors before frost. A light frost is helpful on mint, chives, and tarragon; it tends to induce a rest period and make the resulting new growth firm and fresh.<br><br>You can maintain an indoor herb garden indefinitely by periodic light feeding, yearly repotting, renewing annuals, seasonal moves outdoors for perennials, and occasional pruning. Water plants as needed. Use several planters or a divided one to allow for different moisture needs of plants.</div>

According to legend the Delphi oracle chewed bay leaves, or sniffed the smoke of burning leaves to promote her visionary trances.<br><br>Bay, or laurel, was famed in ancient Greece and Rome. Emperors, heroes and poets wore wreaths of laurel leaves. The Greek word for laurel is dhafni, named for the myth of the nymph Daphne, who was changed into a laurel tree by Gaea, who transformed her to help her escape ApolloÂ’s attempted rape. Apollo made the tree sacred and thus it became a symbol of honour.<br><br>The association with honour and glory continue today; we have poet laureates (Apollo was the God of poets), and bacca-laureate means Â“laurel berriesÂ” which signifies the completion of a bachelor degree. Doctors were also crowned with laurel, which was considered a cure-all. Triumphant athletes of ancient Greece were awarded laurel garlands and was given to winners at Olympic games since 776 BC. Today, grand prix winners are bedecked with laurel wreaths. It was also believed that the laurel provided safety from the deities responsible for thunder and lightning. The Emperor Tiberius always wore a laurel wreath during thunderstorms.<br><br><img src="http://www.ag.arizona.edu/arboretum/pwalk/images/phot69.gif"><span class="small">Bay leaf plant</span><br><br><strong>Did you know?</strong><br>Herbalists recommend using bay leaf oil for snakebites, wasp and bee stings, bruises, scrapes and many other ailments, including rheumatism.

They are referred to only in the plural, because they grow in clumps rather than as individual plants. <span style="font-style: italic;">Allium schoenoprasum</span> is also the only species of Allium native to both the New and the Old World.<br><br>Its species name derives from the Greek words <span style="font-style: italic;">skhoinos</span> (sedge) and <span style="font-style: italic;">prason</span> (onion). Its English name, chive, derives from the French word <span style="font-style: italic;">cive</span>, which was derived from <span style="font-style: italic;">cepa</span>, being the Latin word for onion.<br><br><img src="http://www.eatanddrink.co.uk/images/Herbs/chives.jpg"><br><br>Chives grow in clumps, with their round, hollow, grass-like leaves reaching a height of 9 inches or so. The stems are firm, straight, smooth, and, like the leaves, bright dark green. The flowers, which bloom for two months in midsummer, form round deep purple or pink globes that make an attractive garnish.<br><br><strong>Use of Chives</strong><br>Culinary uses for chives involve shredding its leaves (straws) for use as condiment for fish, potatoes and soups. Because of this, it is a common household herb, frequent in gardens as well as in grocery stores. It also has insect-repelling properties which can be used in gardens to control pests.[<br><br>Chives are easier to snip with scissors than cut with a knife. The snipped chives give a hint of onion flavor to egg dishes, cheese soufflÂ¨Â¦s, salads, soups, cream cheese sandwiches, and sour cream dressing for baked potatoes. Chive butter is great with grilled chops and steak.<br><br><img src="http://www.gardenguides.com/herbs/art/chives.jpg"><br><br><strong>History and Cultural Importance</strong><br>Chives have been cultivated in Europe since the Middle Ages, although signs of its usage date back to 5000 years ago, used by the Chinese.<br><br>The Romans believed chives could relieve the pain from sunburn or a sore throat.

Besides its use as vegetable, it also has attractive flowers.<br><br>A relatively new vegetable in the English-speaking world but well-known in Asian cuisine, the flavor of garlic chives is rather more like garlic than chives, though much milder. Both leaves and the stalks of the flowers are used as a flavoring similarly to chives, green onions or garlic and are used as a stir fry ingredient.
