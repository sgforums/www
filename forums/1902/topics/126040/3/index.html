Did it work? Legend knows.<br><br>In present times, as with most cow and goat milk, dairies provide this fine substance. Not just any dairy; camel dairies! Unfortunately, these are found mostly in Africa and Australia, and sparse even there. Going closer to the source, however, (in most cases) a camel herder is the actual provider of milk. He or she will hand-milk his/her camels and sell the milk to the dairies. And it's no easy task to milk a camel! They must not be stressed, annoyed, startled, distracted, angry, sad, impatient, or offended in order for them to let go of their treasure. And of course, they must know their milker personally.<br><br>Since pasteurization of camel's milk is a fairly recent concept (within the last couple of decades), those who drink the milk most--mainly in Africa--drink it fresh from the source. This has included everyone from everyday Joes to the royalty for thousands of years. Now, nearly everybody has access to camel's milk, they just have to know where to look. Since its pasteurization, more people have been drinking the milk since it's been on the market. One female's milk can sustain 40 children in a day.<br><br>What?<br>what's in this milk, anyway? what makes it so good for you?<br>amel milk, just like goat milk or cow milk or person milk, is, well, milk; the early stalks of life's food. Now, this milk is unique in that it is used as food for humans as much as it is for drink. Since the camel is built to live in such harsh earthly conditions, its milk has to be equally adapted to keep its young alive in times of little or no other food. For that reason, it is very nutritious.<br><br>High in protein, casein, potassium and Vitamin C, this milk can be the sole dietary source for a human, or a camel for that matter for a long period of time--providing the minimun balance of nutrition. It contains less lactose than human's milk, making it fairly easy to digest as well. Fat content is low, while water content is high, to sustain a person being in a dry, hot environment where where water, not fat, is needed to live. It's no wonder that a camel's milk is both the drink and meal of choice for many a desert nomad family.<br><br>Where?<br>where in the world is camel milk being used?<br>amel milk is primarily used in the desert of North Africa. It is, consequently, most helpful to the people of that arid region, as they share the same environment as the camel and thus, the same climatical hardships and needs. It is common in other desert areas of the world as well, to which the dromedary is native. The western hemisphere has gotten only a few peeks at this seemingly astounding camel's milk, and although they hardly share the same environment, it could prove beneficial to them as well; camel's share closer genes to humans than either cows or goats, the most common milk sources in other areas of the world. The camel's cousin, the llama, is quite common in the west, though, and is also an equally helpful source of milk for those of a different climate.<br><br>When?<br>camel milk?? when was this miraculous discovery made?<br>amel's milk (and the camels too), has been a necessary base of living for desert tribes for thousands of years in Africa. All of these tribes had to be nomadic (moving from place to place) to find adequate resources, and not only did they need to carry their goods with them, but they needed a food source to sustain them when other resources wore thin. Undoubtedly, these people have been milking camels as long as they've been domestic. As mentioned earlier, Cleopatra even has history with the dromedary camel and it's miraculous milk.<br><br>Many things flare up and die down, fads and raves of all sorts, but people still use camel's milk. It must be so beneficial, so stable and healthy, then, that its use will expand and take over the western world. Only time can tell.<br><br>Why?<br>why exactly would one want to drink this?<br>rom what you have previously read, you should have learned that camel milk is as nutritious as some food and quite suitable for desert dwellers in specific. What you haven't learned, though, is how the milk keeps in high and low temperatures, what good ice cream it makes, and how it's so tasty and even sweet (even if it's an acquired taste to the western tongue).<br><br>Camel's milk keeps longer than cow's milk when refrigerated, and because of the heat of the desert, it doesn't spoil very soon and doesn't curdle at all on its own. It does, however, sour and it can be made easily into ice cream to keep longer, with a little added fat and not too much added sugar (due to it's natural sweetness). It doesn't just keep--it keeps for a year and a half.<br><br>So why do people drink camel's milk? It prevents famine, is convenient in the desert, keeps fairly well, tastes good, is nutritious, and its bearer is good for so many other things. The question, really, should be why don't people drink camel's milk?<br><br>How?<br>how else is camel milk used beneficially?<br>esearch dictates three active uses of camel milk: for camels to drink, for people to drink, and for people to use on their skin. Baby camels, as mammals, drink their mothers' milk for the early stages of their lives. This is, in fact, the initial reason that camel milk exists, which practically goes without saying. But as usual, human intervention has complicated matters a little.<br><br>We've already discussed the matter of humans drinking camel milk, but not humans using the milk to benefit their skin.

            <div class='col-md body'>Comparing camel milk with others...<br><br>Any one tried b4??<br><br>Cow Milk<br>cow milk vs. camel milk<br>s most of us know, cow's milk is most the most commonly acquirable milk in the world. Sold in virtually every grocery store and convenience store in the United States, billions of people consume the milk of a cow in a single day. The reason is, simply, because it's easy to get milk from a cow. It's health, however, can be debated. Fat globules are slightly larger than that of a camel, goat, or human, making digestion difficult for many people. Those of Native American ancestry have increased difficulty, as their hertitage doesn't include the consumption of cow's milk, contrary to those of European, Asian, and African descent. Cow's milk lacks the amount of protein, energy, essential vitamins, casein, fat, and lactose contained in camel's milk as well, indicating both by digestion and nutrition that camel's milk is the healthier of the two.<br><br>Goat Milk<br>goat milk vs. camel milk<br>Camel milk, as charts show, is richer and more nutritious than goat's milk, higher in virtually every important substance (except water), including protein, casein, fat, lactose, energy, and Vitamin C. Goat's milk does have the advantage, however, in its calcium and phosphate supply (important elements in milk to human health), both higher than in the milk of a camel. Contrary to camel's milk, goat's milk can be made easily into cheese and has a widespread base across America and Africa, due to the environmental versatility of the goat. Its milk, while not as nutritious, is easier to obtain than camel's milk and perhaps healthier than cow's milk.<br><br>Human Milk<br>human milk vs. camel milk<br>When it comes to milk in relation to a species' health, none will ever prove healthier than the milk of the same species. The only thing left worth debating is the question of whether a person (or animal) should continue to drink milk after the weaning process and the animal reaches adulthood. If milk is unnecessary (at least that of their species), maybe the adult should move on to something that better suits their nutritional needs. Again, I turn to camel's milk, which is lower in fat but higher in protein than human's milk, which is meant for human babies, not human adults. Camel milk is less as well in energy, water, and even lactose, though it retains more casein and protein. Human milk, unlike cow milk, goat milk, and even camel milk, is not readily available virtually anywhere unless one is an infant. It is not made into cheese, butter, ice cream, or yogurt. Perhaps the beauty of human milk is that over all these years, it has remained completely natural. And since this milk has always proved easily digestable and healthy to a growing baby, it probably still holds the top spot of healthiest the milk for humans.<br></div>

Did it work? Legend knows.<br><br>In present times, as with most cow and goat milk, dairies provide this fine substance. Not just any dairy; camel dairies! Unfortunately, these are found mostly in Africa and Australia, and sparse even there. Going closer to the source, however, (in most cases) a camel herder is the actual provider of milk. He or she will hand-milk his/her camels and sell the milk to the dairies. And it's no easy task to milk a camel! They must not be stressed, annoyed, startled, distracted, angry, sad, impatient, or offended in order for them to let go of their treasure. And of course, they must know their milker personally.<br><br>Since pasteurization of camel's milk is a fairly recent concept (within the last couple of decades), those who drink the milk most--mainly in Africa--drink it fresh from the source. This has included everyone from everyday Joes to the royalty for thousands of years. Now, nearly everybody has access to camel's milk, they just have to know where to look. Since its pasteurization, more people have been drinking the milk since it's been on the market. One female's milk can sustain 40 children in a day.<br><br>What?<br>what's in this milk, anyway? what makes it so good for you?<br>amel milk, just like goat milk or cow milk or person milk, is, well, milk; the early stalks of life's food. Now, this milk is unique in that it is used as food for humans as much as it is for drink. Since the camel is built to live in such harsh earthly conditions, its milk has to be equally adapted to keep its young alive in times of little or no other food. For that reason, it is very nutritious.<br><br>High in protein, casein, potassium and Vitamin C, this milk can be the sole dietary source for a human, or a camel for that matter for a long period of time--providing the minimun balance of nutrition. It contains less lactose than human's milk, making it fairly easy to digest as well. Fat content is low, while water content is high, to sustain a person being in a dry, hot environment where where water, not fat, is needed to live. It's no wonder that a camel's milk is both the drink and meal of choice for many a desert nomad family.<br><br>Where?<br>where in the world is camel milk being used?<br>amel milk is primarily used in the desert of North Africa. It is, consequently, most helpful to the people of that arid region, as they share the same environment as the camel and thus, the same climatical hardships and needs. It is common in other desert areas of the world as well, to which the dromedary is native. The western hemisphere has gotten only a few peeks at this seemingly astounding camel's milk, and although they hardly share the same environment, it could prove beneficial to them as well; camel's share closer genes to humans than either cows or goats, the most common milk sources in other areas of the world. The camel's cousin, the llama, is quite common in the west, though, and is also an equally helpful source of milk for those of a different climate.<br><br>When?<br>camel milk?? when was this miraculous discovery made?<br>amel's milk (and the camels too), has been a necessary base of living for desert tribes for thousands of years in Africa. All of these tribes had to be nomadic (moving from place to place) to find adequate resources, and not only did they need to carry their goods with them, but they needed a food source to sustain them when other resources wore thin. Undoubtedly, these people have been milking camels as long as they've been domestic. As mentioned earlier, Cleopatra even has history with the dromedary camel and it's miraculous milk.<br><br>Many things flare up and die down, fads and raves of all sorts, but people still use camel's milk. It must be so beneficial, so stable and healthy, then, that its use will expand and take over the western world. Only time can tell.<br><br>Why?<br>why exactly would one want to drink this?<br>rom what you have previously read, you should have learned that camel milk is as nutritious as some food and quite suitable for desert dwellers in specific. What you haven't learned, though, is how the milk keeps in high and low temperatures, what good ice cream it makes, and how it's so tasty and even sweet (even if it's an acquired taste to the western tongue).<br><br>Camel's milk keeps longer than cow's milk when refrigerated, and because of the heat of the desert, it doesn't spoil very soon and doesn't curdle at all on its own. It does, however, sour and it can be made easily into ice cream to keep longer, with a little added fat and not too much added sugar (due to it's natural sweetness). It doesn't just keep--it keeps for a year and a half.<br><br>So why do people drink camel's milk? It prevents famine, is convenient in the desert, keeps fairly well, tastes good, is nutritious, and its bearer is good for so many other things. The question, really, should be why don't people drink camel's milk?<br><br>How?<br>how else is camel milk used beneficially?<br>esearch dictates three active uses of camel milk: for camels to drink, for people to drink, and for people to use on their skin. Baby camels, as mammals, drink their mothers' milk for the early stages of their lives. This is, in fact, the initial reason that camel milk exists, which practically goes without saying. But as usual, human intervention has complicated matters a little.<br><br>We've already discussed the matter of humans drinking camel milk, but not humans using the milk to benefit their skin. There are camel milk dairies that provide a milk-based soap for an environmentally safe, vitamin-rich, youthful experience in cleanliness. Camel milk in particular is special; it contains extra protein which, when found in milk, is used as a moisturizer. Its ability to healthfully 'plump the skin,' ward off bacteria, provide healthy vitamins, and smooth lines is a timeless tradition in skin-care and what healthier way is there to treat your epidermus than with all-natural ingredients?<br><br>Obviously, camels and the milk of camels get little recognition with the good they can possibly do for the world.
