            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Don't depend on coworkers to help; they may only hold you back. Your lover may disappoint you in such a way that estrangement will follow. Listen, but don't make any rash decisions.<br>Look before you leap. Your irritability will lead to family squabbles. You are best to ask questions if you aren't certain about issues that are confronting you.<br>If you are overdoing it at work or school then just pause a minute and take a look around; you might find that your colleagues or friends are feeling neglected and would appreciate a little of your time too. You would be wise to remember that old saying: all work and no play!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Changes in your home may be alarming at first. Don't bother trying to make someone you live with see your point of view. Be careful while traveling.<br>Put in some extra hours and finish those careful jobs before you move on to some fun and games. You should get into programs that will enhance your appearance and help you to be the best that you can. You may find out that someone is trying to undermine you.<br>It is possible that a lack of confidence will have you overcompensating at work or school, but the problem will actually be less significant than you first suspect. Minor miscommunications are likely, but you will be able to laugh them off if you hold onto your sense of humor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You should regain some of your self esteem if you get involved in organizational functions. You may find that your anger stems from lending or borrowing money. Better still, take your mate and let them foot the bill.<br>Educational pursuits can bring interesting, helpful people. You're eager to learn. Toning, fitness, pampering should all be scheduled.<br>Although itÂ’s Sunday you will be feeling in a very get up and go mood, ready to take on the world; unfortunately the world is probably taking a break today! To avoid feeling restless and bored you should throw yourself into some team sport that involves some competition to use up all that surplus energy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Don't be too quick to judge your position or surroundings at work. Real estate investments could be to your ad vantage. Set the ball in motion and be relentless until you complete the project.<br>Investments concerning your residence will be profitable. Someone you live with may feel totally neglected. Ideas may sound good, but be careful if people are just looking for handouts.<br>You will experience a rather impulsive streak today and you could end up saying something tactless if you donÂ’t think before speaking. This tendency towards clumsiness is thanks to the influences affecting your ruling planet. Just keep your head down, count to ten before speaking, and wait for it to pass.</div>
