            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Don't lament to a friend about any grievance regarding your mate, or it may be hard to rectify your relationship. They will not have the patience to wait for you to complete things that they've asked you to do. Family responsibilities are escalating.<br>There might be a problem with a will or with an insurance policy. Don't turn down offers that include sports activities or children. Don't let your personal dilemmas interfere with your goals.<br>Your ruling planet, Mars, has moved into Leo, which will be quite significant for all Aries folk. YouÂ’ll be more driven than you have been and far less emotional. That boost of confidence may feel welcome, but watch for overly confident behavior that can be misunderstood by friends and colleagues!</div>
