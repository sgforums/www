Resist secret affairs that could be detrimental to your reputation. Today is not the day to try to comer people by giving them ultimatums.<br>Your feelings of hyper sensitivity are likely to continue affecting your mood through-out the day. Indulging these moods will make you feel better than trying to ignore them, so spoil yourself as much as you like: scented baths, massages and weepie movies are the way to go.</div>
