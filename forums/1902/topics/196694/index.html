            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/meepop/misc/11_dog.gif"><br>In the West, the Dog is man's best friend, but in Chinese Astrology this Sign is a little more unpredictable than that. Dogs are loyal, faithful and honest and always stick to their firm codes of ethics. However, this Sign has trouble trusting others. It's generally quite trustworthy itself -- except for the occasional "little white lies" the Dog tells in order to make things go more smoothly. The Dog makes a wonderful, discreet and loyal friend (despite any white lies) and is an excellent listener. This Sign tends to root for the underdog and its keen sense of right and wrong makes it duty-bound to the core. The Dog's mantra seems to be, Live right, look out for the little people and fight injustice whenever possible.<br><br>Dogs can also be rather dogmatic, too. They don't go in for light social banter; instead, they go straight for home, expostulating on the topics that are most important to them. At these times the Dog's narrow-minded or stubborn side can become apparent; this Sign has trouble staying light and calm when an important issue is at stake. This Sign can also be very temperamental; mood swings characterize its emotional life and often the Dog needs to run off to be alone in order to recuperate. Part of the problem is the result of this Sign's load of irrational fears that turn into niggling anxieties that turn into hurt feelings and occasional grouchiness. This sensitive Sign needs to warm up to others over time and gradually learn to trust them. Without that trust as a foundation, Dogs can be judgmental and coarse.<br><br>The Dog's discerning nature does make it an excellent business person, one who can turn that picky, guarded nature into a keen sense of the truth of another's motives. Where love is concerned, Dogs often have a tough time finding the right match. They can be so anxious and overwrought in the romance dance that they'll stress their partner to the max! In any forum, this Sign is happiest when able to be quite physically active; at home or at work, the Dog will always be constructing something new or cleaning something up in order to make things better. Dogs need to work on controlling their irrational worries and would also be well-served to relax their mile-high standards, which can sometimes wind up alienating the ones they love.<br><br>The most compatible match for a Dog is the Tiger or the Horse.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Famous Dogs</span>:  Madonna, Uma Thurman, Steven Spielberg.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Outlook for 2006<br><br>Career<br>The Dog this will be inundated with lots of surprises this Dog year for the work front! There are plenty of ups and downs for you this year, but you will enjoy yourself every step of the way. Try to learn from your mistakes during those down moments, and capitalize the moments when you are on top form. Embrace new opportunities, and do not be afraid to experiment and venture in uncharted territories! But, do not be rash in making judgments and double-check on all documentation.<br><br>Love<br>The Dog may even feel a little lonely at times this 2006, and feel very secretive about this situation. The best thing the Dog can do is to speak out his or her feelings and emotions! Though you may feel like bottling up, do tell a friend or your partner about how you feel. Keep optimistic, and have a positive outlook in love and relationship matters!<br><br>Health<br>Work and daily stress will cause insufficient sleep for the Dog, causing weakness to the immune system. Rather than fall to sicknesses, the Dog needs to balance work and personal time to ensure proper rest. Keep your spirits (and metabolism rate!) up by joining the gym, or participating on other physical activities. These will be very good for you.</div>

There'll be no lack of amorous adventures, but these will give you only a few satisfactions. If you're single, you'll want to get married as soon as possible. Increased risks of an infection; a very strict hygiene must be followed in order to maintain your health.</div>

Look, listen and observe, but don't let people know you are doing so: This tactic will prove to be very efficacious. If you happen to be in disagreement with some of your nearest ones, don't shy away from explanations, but try to get to the heart of the problem in order to find out its causes.</div>

You'll be able to sweat blood so as to obtain what you want; however, beware not to be ruthless toward others. Sentimental life is likely to be mediocre; instability will reign in couples, each spouse wanting to live their own life. Your health will be good on the whole despite some nervousness.</div>

You'll know how to take up necessary precautions so as to achieve your dearest project. You'll be very busy with your work and filled with the need to prove to your superiors what you're capable of. You should relax more and go to bed earlier than usual. As you'll be very sensitive to weather changes, you'll have the impression of being tired.<br><br>26 June 2006<br>Your love life will be threatened by monotony and routine; appeal to your imagination. Think of profiting by all possible tax reductions; if necessary, ask specialists for advice. Resist your present desire to acquire a costly object. This climate will be favorable to disputes and quarrels: speak only if you're obliged to. You'll have stormy relationships with your entourage, at your workplace as well as in your home; however, you'll be well disposed to make concessions and to recognize your errors.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dog people are loyal and honest and obedient, guardians of the house at night. They can be counted on to keep secrets and for always doing the right thing. They can be emotionally distant and do not mix well in social gatherings where they are often seen as wallflowers. They do better with one-on-one relationships and find happiness in the happiness they bring to others, such as finding the most perfect gifts for their friends. While it is true that they have sharp tongues and are a bit stubborn and eccentric, in a work situation they tend to work very well with other people. What is more, they always seem to have money and make excellent leaders. Because of their high moral stance, they are inspiring beyond measure.<br><br>Famous Dog People: Chiang Chin-Kuo, Zhou En-Lai, Lee Teng-Hui, Benjamin Franklin, Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley,Jacques Cousteau, King Carl XVI Gustaf, Yitzhak Rabin, Golda Meir, Mother Teresa, Jane Goodall, Prime Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien<br><br>METAL DOG<br><span class="small">Feb 10, 1910 to Jan 29, 1911<br>Feb 6, 1970 to Jan 26, 1971</span><br><br>This one takes a very conservative approach to every aspect of life, somewhat coasting along looking at the scenery with dreams and goals unrealized but the spirit always fulfilled. Ferdinand the Bull is their Poster Boy; they always stop to smell the flowers. Nothing wrong with this, but it's important to find a balance so there aren't so many unfinished tasks. Ironically, they tend to be materialistic, but don't have the patience necessary to acquire big ticket items and major success is illusory. But like gypsies, they move with the wind, taking what comes, with noble chin held high, always finding in life a kind of beauty which does indeed sustain them very much. They make very good friends, loyal to the bone, always finding delightful ways to help others. Friends always know where they stand because of their directness and frank manner. The Love &amp; Romance Department usually finds a very handsome male and a beautiful female, each incredibly attractive to the other and sincerity reigns in their communication. The Metal Dog doesn't like to take too many chances, preferring conservative and traditional ways of romance. Sometimes, they become virtual love slaves, a little too passive for their own good. Time to stand up and reclaim your individuality! Learn to be more pro-active!<br><br>WATER DOG<br><span class="small">Jan 28, 1922 to Feb 15, 1923<br>Jan 25, 1982 to Feb 12, 1983</span><br><br>Water Dogs are real charmers, easily attracting friends and colleagues into their inner circle. Handling the ins and outs of human relations is so easy for them! They know how to smooth over any personal situation with their kind, honest, easy-going nature. Always empathetic, always rational, their ability to play Devil's Advocate helps open up whole new ways of approaching problems and finding solutions. Their views on life are expansive because of an ingrained wanderlust which has taken and will continue to take them to exotic locales about the globe. They adapt like chameleons to new environments and new people and their lives are all-encompassing, full of rich adventure. Financial and career success comes to the Water Dogs later in life -- just watch these late bloomers burst open! Regarding their love life, when it comes to dating and romance, their temperature ranges from hot to cold, from one extreme to another. Sometimes they want a commitment, other times they run Geronimo. But, when true love finally comes, and it will, they have it made. Their relationships are filled with good honest communication and genuine kindness and total caring for their partner. Marriage will be as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar.<br><br>WOOD DOG<br><span class="small">Feb 14, 1934 to Feb 3, 1935<br>Feb 10, 1994 to Jan 30, 1995</span><br><br>Whatever Wood Dog wants, Wood Dog gets. When they set a goal, they doggedly pursue the right course of action, no matter what obstacles are in the way, and always finish as winners. They accomplish great things and enjoy most fulfilling careers and educational quests. Pursuing the right course of action is a constant theme in their lives, be it dealings with other people, the expression of their strong sense of justice and sense of ethics and morality. They protest wrong! They cry out at injustice! They want to always correct the wrongs of life. They are very strict on themselves and although expecting the best from others, they never alienate or come across as "holier than thou" because of their very generous personalities. Their lives are heroic and they are very deserving of others' trust and respect. Wood Dogs deal with Romance the same way as they do their career, nothing less than an all-out effort to win the object of their affection. Do they win? You better believe it!<br><br>FIRE DOG<br><span class="small">Feb 2, 1946 to Jan 21, 1947<br>Jan 29, 2006 to Feb 17, 2007</span><br><br>Right off the bat, let's say that Fire Dogs are very attractive! Not only themselves but all the people surrounding them are life's beautiful people. Their natural inclination is to conveniently turn an eye away from perversity. They view all of life through rose-colored glasses. Grays and beiges lead to momentary confusion. They don't know how to deal with adversity and when confronting a mountain, will walk all around the foothills for hours before even getting started. This person's life is filled with dichotomy. On the one hand, they know that hard work and effort will make things happen, but they sometimes accept the status quo. They dream of a bright future but wind up chasing windmills. And despite an overabundance of energy, their careers sometimes stand still. They see-saw from timidity to having grand adventures. They are on a sure course when it comes to friendship and love, though. Very well liked, their social circle is broad and their love life is full of energy and fire. You see, the firedog is a lovebird!<br><br>EARTH DOG<br><span class="small">Feb 18, 1958 to Feb 7, 1959</span><br><br>The Earth Dog is well grounded, both feet solidly on the ground. Perfectionists at heart, they see that projects have a beginning and an end, and all they have to do is see things all the way through. A driving force propels their lives and they know they must never waver in reaching their goals, whether it's dealing with people, daily projects, or sailing around the world. Earth Dogs are brimming with confidence and are always finding four-leaf clovers. Luck happens! In the Love Arena, they take a somewhat lackadaisical approach; i.e., love is no big deal, it's just a natural part of life. If it happens, fine, but no great enthusiasm is lost here. The best person for the Earth Dog is a strongly independent someone who relishes freedom and has an identity apart from the relationship. When the Earth Dog and their mate do come together, it will be beautiful.</div>
