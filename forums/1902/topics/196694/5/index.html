            <div class='col-md body'>3 Oct 06<br>This will be a day of good luck for your love affairs, especially if they're secret. Flourishing health. But risks of stomach disorders for some natives; refrain from canned food, raw vegetables, fatty and saucy dishes. Very harmonious familial atmosphere. A day full of diverse satisfactions if you get involved thoroughly in all your undertakings; on the other hand, a lack of enthusiasm will cause you great setbacks.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>4 Oct 06<br>A very propitious day for studies, research, intellectual activities. Beware of your marked preference for very highly seasoned dishes, marinated meats, sauces that burn your palate. Why not try Chinese, Vietnamese or Japanese dishes instead? These rather subtle astral aspects will advise you to put things in order in your life, to destroy certain elements of the past that have become useless or even cumbersome, and to work for a simplification of existence in many fields; sort out your papers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 Oct 06<br>At the sentimental level, do not commit yourself these days, give yourself more time for reflection. Confused relationships with your nearest and dearest, probably because of your changing moods. Don't hesitate to defend your rights. If you feel rather tired and a little bit depressive, ingest vitamins, try to amuse yourself and don't insist on forcing things. You'll have good inspirations and will be able to strengthen your material situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>6 Oct 06<br>A stroke of financial luck. Be more flexible with your close ones if you want to have peace. If you still suffer from migraines or sleep troubles, don't despair; have recourse to homeopathy, but refrain from strong allopathic drugs. You'll succeed in taking up a very difficult challenge, and this will bring your optimism to a peak. You'll integrate yourself better into the social and professional domains that attract you. You'll make interesting or useful friendship ties.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>7 Oct 06<br>The attitudes of those whom you love will seem very negative to you; it will be difficult for you to find an area of understanding or harmony, and then you'll tend to withdraw into yourself or, occasionally to flare up in anger. Risks of sentimental storms, perhaps even a rupture; but this won't be totally negative. You'll be inclined to keep a low profile and no longer systematically seek to occupy the fore of the scene. You'll win in depth and also in lucidity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>8 Oct 06<br>If you're single, you'll have the possibility of stabilizing your love life. At work, you'll assert yourself and will enjoy general admiration despite some small jealousies. Learn to seize opportunities and you will receive the blessings of the stars. Your various obligations will compel you to stay often away from your home, but that might displease your mate. Try to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>9 Oct 06<br>You'll want things to revolve around you, and you won't hesitate to indulge in a whirl of outings and receptions. You'll have a very good appetite; moreover, you'll have absolutely no desire to be moderate, and so you may have to pay a very high price for your excesses. Punch, vitality and high spirits will inhabit you. You'll make quick decisions, and your mind for initiative will allow you to profit by interesting opportunities in the material and professional fields.

Numerous are the natives who will lack critical mind and who will be cheated by unscrupulous partners or will let themselves be drawn into dubious affairs.

Try to calmly bear the criticisms that will be made against you; in this way your success will be assured. If you live in couple, make a great effort to hear your mate out.

Somewhat shaky health: You'll easily feel tired and will have difficulty recuperating. You'll be squarely confronted with what you hate the most -- namely, administrative annoyances.

Be sure that you are on good terms with various public administrations, more particularly with the tax administration.<br><br>16 Oct 06<br>Be careful of your at-the-surface sensitivity, which will make you react in an instinctive and thoughtless manner. You'll be able to live a dazzling adventure with your soul mate. Not reasonable for two pennies, you'll most likely upset the balance of your budget, precisely because you won't be a penny short; in fact, you'll have a tendency to live above your means.

            <div class='col-md body'>26 Oct 06<br>Don't let yourself be affected by birds of ill omen. Be cautious in your couple life, not because of possible external aggressions, but because of your tendency to act the wrong way; nothing will be more harmful for your relationships than your misplaced self-pride. The strange and the weird will invade your daily routine; don't worry, but rather take advantage of it! If you're suffering from headaches or dizziness, try to take more rest and remain aloof from your worries.</div>
