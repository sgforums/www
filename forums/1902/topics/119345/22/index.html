            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You can make major gains professionally by completing projects on time. You'll communicate easily and develop new friendships. Do your own thing without drawing attention to it.<br>You can make personal changes that will enhance your appearance and bring about greater social activity. You're in a high cycle for romance. Try to avoid serious discussions with loved ones.<br>The need to do something entirely different and out of character could quite probably kick in today. Pluto will have you feeling like you need more out of life, and if you channel this feeling into something positive then you will soon realize that the world is your oyster!</div>

The influence of Venus and the sun will introduce some much needed harmony and contentment into your day.
