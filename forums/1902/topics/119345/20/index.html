            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Underhandedness regarding legal matters or contracts must be counteracted. Your generous nature could be taken advantage of. Expect your workload to be heavy.<br>If you can't get ahead in the company you're with, perhaps it's time to move on. It may not be the best day to confront employers or to present your ideas. Be supportive in order to avoid confrontations.<br>A couple of conflicting aspects could put you in rather an aloof mood today, which could unintentionally distance your nearest and dearest. If you feel the need for some space just gently explain to your friends and then curl up with a good book or your favorite film; tomorrow will be better!</div>

Drastic changes regarding your personal attitude are evident.<br>Friendships come under the spotlight today, but unusually for Capricorn (who is probably the hardest working sign of the Zodiac) youÂ’ll be inclined to not give work or school one hundred percent.
