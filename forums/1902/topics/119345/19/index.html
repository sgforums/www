Overindulgence will mean poor health.<br>It could be that you start to feel ignored or that no one is really listening to you today. This wonÂ’t actually be the case; itÂ’s a low mood that is distorting the way you see things. Indulge in a pampering session or a new hairstyle to banish those negative thoughts.
