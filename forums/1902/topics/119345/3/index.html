            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You can stabilize your situation if you compromise. The things that usually make life fun for you are now changing. Private information gives you the inside track on how to go about attaining a career goal. Colleagues may try to undermine you when talking to superiors. Close deals that have been up in the air and move on to new ones that appear to be profitable. Family outings will make you feel secure and happy. A short trip or attending a trade show or conference will result in some fascinating ideas and opportunities. Love will be in a high cycle, so don't forget to include your partner or, if single, someone to whom you are attracted.<br></div>
