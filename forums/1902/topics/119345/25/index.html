You will find that unfinished projects at home will be most satisfying.<br>Later in the week your boss will pat you on the back for a job well done. Keep calm. Someone around you is bouncing off the walls. You will be emotional about your personal life.<br>You are usually one of the most down-to-earth signs, but todayÂ’s tricky planetary formation could bring out your more restless, fickle side.

Make sure to arrange in advance to spend quality time together. Think before you act.<br>DonÂ’t be surprised if you feel a little wooly-headed today. The transit of Venus into Sagittarius means that you might not see the wood for the trees, but you will start getting flashes of inspiration as your creative streak awakens.
