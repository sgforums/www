            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You will meet new friends and enjoy a multitude of new activities. You can help other people with their financial problems by setting up a budget for them. Most partner problems are a result of both people not living up to their promises.<br>Family may not want to get involved but an entrepreneur will. Frustrations and limitations could cause anxiety today. Romantic opportunities will be plentiful if you go out with friends.<br>An adventurous mood is likely to overtake you today, thanks to the shift in influences. Typical Capricorns are rarely impulsive, so take advantage of this temporary mood and indulge your wants. Even though itÂ’s not the weekend thereÂ’ll still plenty to do to fulfill your wildest (okay, reasonable) dreams!</div>

Don't believe everything you hear.<br>Travel will be on your mind; however, be careful and proceed with caution as minor accidents will cause delays. Deceit with coworkers is apparent. Try not to push your philosophies on others.<br>Some people claim that money makes the world go round, but in your case today itÂ’ll be friends! YouÂ’re likely to be in an anxious mood, worried about your cash reserves and fretting over a romantic development (or lack of it!) Turn to your friends, who will be able to offer bundles of reassurance!</div>

Make the most of it, because tomorrow will bring yet more challenging moments for you and everyone. Get as much done today as you can; tomorrow you wonÂ’t be in the mood for restrictions!</div>

Be careful disclosing information. You can expect to feel confused about your personal prospects.<br>Another unusual and rather demanding day could keep you on your toes today! Essentially your typically down-to-earth attitude will be challenged by a very untypical streak of rebelliousness that youÂ’d do well to indulge!

Expand your knowledge and sign up for courses and seminars.<br>Communications are likely to set the pace for today!

            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You can gain distinction; however, it may be for the wrong reasons. Anger may cause you grief; control your temper and try to sit back and calm down. It is best not to upset the apple cart if you learn information that may damage a colleague's reputation.<br>You need to get out and have some fun to reduce tension. You will communicate easily and should be able to develop new friendships. Positive changes regarding your personal status are evident.<br>You could find that you are feeling particularly sensitive to someoneÂ’s needs today, especially in matters of friendship or romance.

Do not get into uncertain financial deals.<br>With the moon in your sign and thanks to the influence of Pluto you are likely to be in need of controlling your more aloof side. Your need for order and proficiency could test other peopleÂ’s patience today so try to recognize other peopleÂ’s efforts, which will help lessen those Capricorn traits!</div>

Use your high energy and dynamic approach to win favors from superiors. You will find your vitality is lowered.<br>Thanks to the moon youÂ’re likely to be feeling a little dissatisfied, perhaps even feel as though youÂ’re being neglected by a close friend or a partner. ItÂ’s the planets that are making you feel like this; resist the urge to console yourself with lots of shopping and concentrate on soothing your nerves with aromatherapy instead!</div>

Do not lend money to friends, or contribute more than necessary to groups unworthy of your cash.<br>Look at your options before making commitments that could jeopardize your financial position. You can persuade even the toughest opponents to think your way. Don't let your emotions interfere with moneymaking deals.<br>You might find that you are particularly charming today in terms of romance, but youÂ’ll still be inclined to let things pass you by! Things look more promising for the evening, as long as youÂ’re prepared to do a little groundwork. Remember that saying: no pain, no gain, Capricorn!</div>
