Your input into their activities will help bring you closer together. This might not be a day for hasty decisions.<br>This could possibly turn out to be one of those more memorable days where you suddenly have a flash of inspiration or insight, especially at work or school, which starts you thinking about your future.

Opportunities to get involved in self improvement projects will be rewarding.<br>The strong influence of the planets in Libra suggests that you might be inclined to follow rather than lead for the sake of keeping the peace. YouÂ’re one of the quieter signs anyway, which means that you will need to draw on all your reserves to make sure that you are heard today!</div>
