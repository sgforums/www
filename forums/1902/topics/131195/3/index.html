            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Sheep</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Sheep</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL SHEEP - 1871, 1931, 1991</span><br><br>The Metal Sheep will have great faith in himself and know the value of his talents. He can camouflage his high degree of sensitivity by putting up a brave front, although actually he has a very vulnerable ego and is easily offended by offhand remarks.<br><br>Metal reinforces his flowing artistic tastes and he will be inspired to search continuously for beauty in all forms. His home could be a master piece of interior decoration, as he is most concerned about harmony and balance in his daily life. Leaving a familiar environment can be traumatic for him; he will find it hard to adjust to change.<br><br>This type of Sheep will also aspire to security in both his domestic and financial life. His services won't come cheap, although he is not averse to handing out free meal tickets now and then.<br><br>His social activities will be limited to those people he cherishes or those who could be of use to his career. The uninitiated will have to wait for him to warm up to their advances.<br>Beneath his calm and helpful exterior, the Metal Sheep has unstable emotions that he finds hard to control. As a result, he can be possessive, jealous and overprotective of his loved ones. He should allow people about him more freedom. Expecting everyone to be at his beck and call will only cause resentment, as well as resistance to the invaluable contributions he could make.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER SHEEP - 1883, 1943, 2003</span><br><br>This type of Sheep will be extremely appealing to others. There may be dozens of people around who will want to mother him, and if he is in need of help - he can summon and army.<br>Popular but not really knowledgeable, meek but innately opportunistic, the Water Sheep will seek out people he can rely on. When Water is joined with his basic sign, it encourages him to travel the route of the least resistance. He is impressionable and will always go along with the wishes of the majority or those who have strong influence on him. But while he may readily absorb the ideas of others, he will still cling to what he is accustomed to. He fears changes in his life style and will not be too crazy about exploring the unknown.<br>Although he has a diversified personality and can mix well with almost anyone, he also has a martyrdom complex and will feel rejected and persecuted whenever he is not allowed to have his way.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD SHEEP - 1895, 1955, 2015</span><br><br>A thoughtful, good-humored Sheep, with leisurely ways, but mindful of other people's wishes. He is sentimental and strives to please; with Wood as his element he will be prevented from being too flippant. His nature will be steadier and more generous and he will have high moral principles.<br><br>This loving Sheep will have complete trust in those he believes in. He will put his life in their hands with the faith of a child. Even while he knows his intrinsic worth, this Sheep allows others to take advantage of him. He capitulates too readily when harassed and makes unwise sacrifices for the sake of keeping the peace.<br><br>The Wood Sheep has the tendency to mother others and can be most devoted to those he cares about. He will be overwhelmed by the circumstances of those less fortunate than himself and may have a collection of human as well as animal strays to feed.<br><br>His good deeds and compassion will not go unrewarded. Because he won't mind supporting others, money will always come to him when he is in need. He will receive financial help or inherit money from unlikely sources.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE SHEEP - 1907, 1967, 2027</span><br><br>The Fire Sheep is sure-footed; he is more courageous about following his intuitions and he will take the initiative in his work.<br><br>His creativity lies in his ability to dramatize rather than invent. He can highlight strong points and play down weaknesses. Even experimenting with vivid colors, he can still produce restful and pleasant compositions.<br><br>He would like to own a stately home if possible, because he is indulgent where his personal comforts are concerned and he likes to entertain lavishly. Consequently, he is likely to overextend himself financially and mismanage his own affairs.<br><br>Fire makes him very energetic and aggressive. He is outspoken when offended. He will exhibit an enticing personal grace but his emotionalism could, at times, defy logic.<br><br>When the Fire Sheep is negative, he is given to wistful thinking without realizing the benefits of his present situation. He reaches for the proverbial pie in the sky and will be sullen and spiteful when discouraged by reality.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH SHEEP - 1859, 1919, 1979</span><br><br>This is type of Sheep is optimistic and more self-reliant. In spite of his strong attachments to the domestic scene and devoted loyalty to family members, he will still try to maintain a certain degree of independence.<br><br>Earth as his element makes him conservative and careful. He won't like to waste money but he won't be counting the pennies either. But being a Sheep, he will still find it difficult to deny himself. What may appear as luxuries to other people will be bare necessities to him.<br><br>However, just as he plays hard, the Earth Sheep will work hard. He can take his responsibilities seriously and will go out of his way to help his friends. It is unlikely that he will ever turn his back on someone in trouble.<br><br>Although he may be more adept at concealing his emotions, this particular Sheep is also prone to being neurotic and ultradefensive when criticized.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Sheep</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Sheep and his Ascendants</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the mouse - 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.</span><br><br>An Opportunistic and crafty Sheep. Both signs here are emotional and self-indulgent. But the mouse's presence could make him more dependable and less inclined to fall apart during a crisis.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Ox - 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.</span><br><br>A Sheep who radiates charm mixed with the Rabbit's rugged authority. Punctual, conservative and more set in his ways.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born during the Hours of the Tiger - 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.</span><br><br>Feline impetuosity accentuated by the Sheep's exquisite but whimsical ways. Creative, innovative and great on the stage, but his temperamental side makes him volatile and undependable.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rabbit - 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.</span><br><br>A clever but unobtrusive Sheep who is not as charitable as he pretends to be. Cannot be counted on to commit himself readily to anything which involves a great deal of work or sacrifice. Shuns too much involvement.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dragon - 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.</span><br><br>A Sheep with great determination. The Dragon in him imparts the much needed courage and conviction for him to carry out his ideas and plans. But the Sheep here still has a strong need for adulation and appreciation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Snake - 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.</span><br><br>A Sheep with great potential and a fine, uncluttered mind. The Snake makes him self-assured and competent. He can make up his own mind and keep his emotions to himself.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Horse - 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</span><br><br>A Sheep who may really like to swing. Very expressive, expensive and fanciful. The popular Horse in him will be in hot pursuit of money while the dominant Sheep side will certainly know how to dole it out.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Sheep - 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.</span><br><br>Very ardent and responsive, but also somewhat of the clinging vine variety. Would prefer to rely on others to serve him or do his dirty work. May have many notable talents to offer, but basically he is a worrier, frets a lot and is indecisive.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of Monkey - 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.</span><br><br>The monkey may make the Sheep more inclined to taking action and give him self-assurance in the bargain. He could also have the Monkey's delightful way of looking at the sunnier side of things.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of Rooster - 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br><br>Fermenting with ideas that may never materialize. The Sheep is too dependent and the Rooster in him contributes nonsensical solutions. No doubt, he will be brainy and have many positive qualities, but someone else will have to tap his resources and organize his life for him.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dog - 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.</span><br><br>A Sheep that is more rational and sensible. The Dog gives him more strength of character and helps him to face reality. Will not be easily given to tears or self-pity.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Pig - 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.</span><br><br>A Sheep who will always lend you a shoulder to cry on. But you better have your shoulder ready as he expects the same privilege if you are to be his friend. Hopefully, the sturdy Pig will make him more able to bear his trials and endure hardships without cracking up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Monkey</strong></span><br><br><strong>Year of the Monkey</strong><br><br>Everything will be workable this year. At least the agile Monkey will not give up before trying every angle. There will be success even in impossible ventures, there will be inventions and improvisations galore. Politics, diplomacy, high finance and business will be engaged in one big poker game with everyone trying to outbluff each other. A rather amusing and exciting time in which everyone will be given the opportunity to try his hand at the game. no direct confrontation here, as the Monkey is one who can laugh off his mistakes and improve his bargaining prowess in the next round.<br><br>This is a year that will find us all trying to get a better deal by outsmarting the other man. It his hard to keep track of who is winning, as the right hand has no idea of what the left hand us up to. One thing is for sure, this will be an extremely progressive time. We will all steam ahead, and even if we do not apply ourselves to the utmost, we will be carried forward by the surging tide of the Monkey's natural talent for learning and advancement.<br><br>The lucky imp of a Monkey who rules this year will urge us to gamble, speculate and exploit risky but ingenious options. If you are quick on the draw, this year will yield huge dividends. It is definitely not a year for the faint-hearted or slow-witted. The Monkey gives no concessions and asks none in return. If there is a recession, the year of the Monkey will quickly put an end to it. Business will skyrocket under his optmisitc and shrewd influence. The Monkey's resourcefullness will amaze and confound everyone.<br><br>It is very interesting to note that America was born in the year of the Fire Mokey, 1776. Perhaps this explains her phenomenal growth and fantastic achievements within such a short span of time.<br><br>It is said that the Monkey's year will bring many new and unconventional ways of doing things. The motto of this year should be: "Don't take No for an answer!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Monkey</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Monkey Personality</strong><br><br>People born in the year of the monkey can cope with almost any intricacy with a sober mind. Ambitious and knowledgeable as they are, they can achieve great success in whatever career they decide to embrace.<br><br>However, they have their weak points, such as a strong sense of superiority, egoism and vanity. So it is easy for them to become jealous when others achieve something or acquire something they don't have.<br><br>They also have strong sense of competition and planning, but always keep this a secret. Their talent in seeking wealth, planning for success and demonstrating power cannot be compared with people born in the years of the other zodiac animals.<br><br>One of the character traits of people born in the year of the<br>monkey is the firmness. Though some of them appear to be shy, they are adamant inside.<br><br>They like to appreciate and show their wit and bravery. They take it for granted that other people are nothing in comparison with them, and they never conceal their happiness and pride. But sometimes their cleverness may overreach itself. When they are playing petty tricks to get something profitable with the least effort and money, or putting forward some shrewd proposals, people may become suspicious of their motives and moral qualities.<br><br>Certainly this doesn't mean that they are good for nothing. If we look at them from another angle, we find that their weak points somewhat reflect their intelligence. When they direct their wisdom into the proper channels, they blaze many new trails and initiate various kinds of inventions. Moreover, since they are always in high spirits whether they have failed or not, and are determined to manage their business with great perseverance, they achieve marvelous things in the end.<br><br>Monkey people usually adopt the policy of making large sales at a small profit when doing business. Unlike the generous "tigers" and hard-headed "dragons," the "monkeys" square accounts in every detail and accumulate much wealth by saving small profits. Their acumen and economic success are really surprising!<br><br>Being ever-victorious, they are never satisfied with what they have had. They want have a try at everything, and never waste a second in doing their work.<br><br>They have a strong sense of self-protection. If surrounded, they will try their best to quickly break through any encirclement. Generally speaking they behave carefully and evenly. But when they are incessantly harassed, they will fly into a rage.<br><br>Girls born in the year of the monkey are always in high spirit and full of glamour. Wherever they go, they bring happiness to everyone. Witty and agreeable, they are good partners. At exciting evening parties, recreational activities and sumptuous banquets, you can't miss their busy figures!<br><br>They are talented in imitating and acting. Always cheerful and energetic, they go straight toward their life aims with indomitable spirits. They never tell their secrets to those who are not their friends, though they speak in a loud voice.<br><br>Though fun-lovers, they never waste time in doing something to no avail. They're good at using well-chosen fictions when chatting with different people on different occasions, and taking advantage of other people's weaknesses to control them. As they are perfectionists, it's difficult for their inferiors to please them or take money out of their pockets, unless they have done something perfectly.<br><br>Always neatly dressed, women born in the year of the monkey are particular about their appearance, especially their hair styles. By the way, overusing cosmetics may make their skin rough, because it is easy for them to get allergic reactions.<br><br>Most of the people born in the year of the monkey have the spirit of working in earnest, and they are good at managing financial affairs. If political or economic circles want to achieve certain aims, it is wise to recruit such people. But only when they're fully on your side, can they be ideal cooperators.<br><br>They have some of the characteristics of strategists. For example, they are always ready to seize any favorable chance to achieve their goals, and before they take action they will carefully plan for strategic changes and decent leeways.<br><br>They are full of humor and resources, which makes it easy for them to get what they want. But few people dare to believe in and make friends with them because they're generally complicated and mutable and seldom care if they have violated the interests of other people.<br><br>To do them justice, they are somewhat indispensable in the real life. Their talent-for managing money matters is the admiration of the people born in the year of the mouse, and their wisdom may inspire and enlighten "dragons." Besides, people born in the rabbit, sheep, dog and ox have much respect for their versatility, and the "pigs" and "rooster" like to have them as cooperators.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Monkey</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Monkey Child</strong><br><br>The Monkey child will be captivating. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, he won't keep still for a moment. Mischievous, jovial and very competitive, he will steal his way into your heart. Skillful at flattery and extremely good at playing up to your weaknesses, the incorrigible Monkey will always get what he is after.<br><br>Curious, unpredictable and ingenious, this youngster will usually be found fidgeting with some device. Don't be too upset if he breaks his toys. It is simply because he is not attracted by the outer decor; he takes things apart to get inside and see what makes them tick. Intricate or mechanically moving contraptions never fail to amuse or fascinate him. He will be forever tugging at your apron strings and stomping after you with brilliant questions about the universe.<br><br>One of these days, when you are about to throw away that unreliable clock that never worked well, your Monkey child will pick it up and fix it with a hairpin. He is never contented with what he has. The grass always look greener to him on the other side. The ambitious and conniving little imp will always have his eye on other people's possessions.<br><br>He is constantly goaded to improve himself and he prides himself on his vast accumulation of knowledge and skills. He will be involved in a myriad of activities. Today he will be investigating the theory of photography and tomorrow he may be building himself an amateur radio. The remarkable thing is that the Monkey can spread his attention to several subjects and be able to master them all. He can be snobbish and cocky and will like to tease others with his versatile wit. Optimistic and forever hopeful, he will never concede defeat. He will try and try again until he succeeds.<br><br>The Monkey child will have a selfish streak and may refuse to share what he has while skillfully helping himself to other children's toys. Excitable, pretentious and crafty, he will be oblivious of any regulation that restricts him. He should be taught that life is not a one-way street. Even when he does share, he will carefully consider what he can get in return. Even the smallest Monkey is adept at weighing the pros and cons. He will try foul at the slightest edge others may have over him, but he expects you to close both eyes if the scales tip in his favor.<br><br>Then, just when you have reached the saturation point and become totally exasperated with him, the Monkey will turn on his sweet saintly smile, apologize from the bottom of his heart, pour flattery all over your wounds and stand on his head to make you laugh. You will forget all the harsh measures you were going to take against him and be his willing captive all over again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Monkey</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Monkey</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL MONKEY - 1860, 1920, 1980</span><br><br>This is the fighting Monkey. Strong, sophisticated and independent, he will have an irrepressible urge for financial security. Capable of making wise investments, this type of Monkey will prefer to run his own business or else earn money from outside work if he has a regular job. He is consistent and will be able to hold on to his savings if he doesn't speculate in risky ventures.<br><br>Metal makes him ardent and demonstrative in his affections. He will have high aspirations and may appear to be status-seeking or overdramatic at times in his behavior.<br><br>Characterized by a lively disposition, the passionate Metal Monkey can be warm, positive and very convincing. He will sell you anything conceivable and his designs, if he is creative, will be both aesthetic and useful. The Metal Monkey could be an excellent trend-setter.<br><br>When he is negative, the analytical Metal Monkey can be exceedingly self-conscious and proud. His loyalties will be few and linked only to himself.<br><br>Hard-working and practical, he shuns assistance from others and will be more than able to take care of his own interests.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER MONKEY - 1872, 1932, 1992</span><br><br>This is a cooperative but speculative Monkey. The "You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours" sort of person. Yet, in spite of his dignified and worldly appearance, this type of Monkey takes offense easier than other Monkeys. He will have a secretive although kind nature, and can be deft and patient in the pursuit of his objectives.<br><br>Water mated with his native sign imparts to him greater sense of purpose. But he will know not to be too direct or obvious in showing his intentions. He can compromise with grace and will know how to work around barriers rather than waste his time and energy in knocking them down.<br><br>The Water Monkey will have flair and originality; he motivates himself as well as others with his pleasant ways, and his ideas meet little resistance because of his ingenious way of introducing them. He will present things in their best possible light. He has a keen understanding of how human relationships function and will use this knowledge to achieve his ends.<br><br>When he decides to be negative, the Water Monkey can suffer from lack of direction. He vacillates and becomes in turn erratic, evasive and meddling.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD MONKEY - 1884, 1944, 2004</span><br><br>Good communications with others will be essential to this type of Monkey. But he will not like to pry into the affairs of those around him if possible, and prides himself on being able to keep his house and accounts in good order.<br><br>Although he is basically honorable and desirous of prestige, this Monkey will be restless and have a strong pioneering spirit. He is aware of everything that is going on around him and is very curious about new inventions or modes of thinking. The Wood element gives him an intuitive mind which will be able to foresee the course of events. He searches constantly for answers and will not take setbacks calmly.<br><br>While maintaining his own admirable standards, the Wood Monkey will strive constantly to elevate himself above his present station. He is always looking forward and never quite satisfied with what he has. On the outlook for greener pastures, this type of Monkey will leap at new challenges.<br><br>This resourceful person will establish order in whatever work he decides to take up. He is rarely given to exaggeration or speculation. Carefully, carefully, he whittles away the opposition bit by bit.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE MONKEY - 1896, 1956, 2016</span><br><br>An energetic, gesticulating Monkey, who will show traits of being a natural leader and innovator. He is self-assured and determined, expressive and truthful with his emotions and very interested in the opposite sex.<br><br>The Fire element will lend him great vitality, and he will have a tendency to dominate or teach those less aggressive than himself. He will possess a fertile imagination and should not let his ideas run away with him. He is inventive but not always careful.<br><br>The Fire Monkey will have a powerful and constant drive to be on the top of his professional field. He is competitive to the extreme and will be capable of great jealousy. His creativity is born of willpower, necessity and initiative, and these will enable him to upstage others and keep one step ahead of the game.<br><br>The Fire Monkey is the most forceful of all the Monkeys. He relishes being in full control and can be opinionated, stubborn and argumentative when he is negative. He is lucky in speculative ventures and he can correctly evaluate risks. But in spite of the bold and collected face he presents to the public, this type of Monkey hides morbid suspicions of how others may be deceiving him.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH MONKEY - 1908, 1968, 2028</span><br><br>A placid and reliable Monkey who may have a cool and collected nature. He is expansive and given to disinterested acts of charity.<br><br>He quietly demands admiration and appreciation for his talents and services, and when this is not forthcoming, he can sulk and become insolent.<br><br>He is likely to be an intellectual and will be academically studious or very well read if he cannot pursue a higher education. Generally, he will be honest and straightforward and will achieve distinction through his thoroughness and devotion to duty.<br><br>The Earth Monkey will not be too fond of entertaining unless it is a necessity, but he will be genuinely kind and loving to those he cares for. Less concerned about his ego, he can devote himself unselfishly to the good of all. He will value his integrity and can even be over-conscientious about operating only within the law.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Monkey</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Monkey and his Ascendants</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the mouse - 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.</span><br><br>Sparkling personality. Nothing will stop this combination from savoring everything life has to offer and hanging on to his money at the same time. Gets to eat his cake and keep it, too.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Ox - 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.</span><br><br>A stodgy Monkey, straitlaced but with better credentials. Less inclined to pull tricks on you. And even when he does, it's hard to tell as he keeps such a straight face.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Tiger - 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.</span><br><br>A forceful and exuberant Monkey. Both signs here are too self-confident and wary of other people. He could land smack in a heap of trouble and still be unwilling to take advice or concede defeat.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rabbit - 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.</span><br><br>A subtle, less mischievous Monkey with more caution and restraint in him. Could be almost psychic in his assessments and dealings with others.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dragon - 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.</span><br><br>An overconscientious and doubly ambitious Monkey. With his own phenomenal prowess and the Dragon's high-powered drives, he usually bites off more than he can chew.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Snake - 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.</span><br><br>If the wisdom of the Snake is thrown into this combination, we could have a Houdini in the making. A Monkey with great intellect and penetrative powers. Could have been here and gone before you know it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Horse - 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</span><br><br>A not-so-persevering Monkey who will change sides without a moment's notice. A gamesman who usually plays by his own rules.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Sheep - 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.</span><br><br>A dreamy, romantic Monkey with many wiles. Still inclined to the opportunistic and conniving, but has a more agreeable and acquiescent nature.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Monkey - 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.</span><br><br>A sacrosanct imp. This extremely adroit and highly evolved personality will be convivial and supremely optimistic. There isn't anything he cannot get away with.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rooster - 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br><br>An unconventional and adventurous Monkey with very high aspirations. With the Monkey's aptitude, perhaps even the Rooster's daydreams could come true.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dog - 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.</span><br><br>An emotionally detached and rustic Monkey. Most likely to be a cool satirist. Still, he is immensely popular because he never loses his sense of humor or departs from reality.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Pig - 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.</span><br><br>A sporting and less self-conscious Monkey. With the Pig's presence, he is less spurious and easier to deal with. Will strive hard to keep his end of the bargain.<br></div>
