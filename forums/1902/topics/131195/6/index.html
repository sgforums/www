            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rabbit</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Rabbit</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL RABBIT - 1891, 1951, 2011</span><br><br>This type of Rabbit could be sturdier physically and mentally than Rabbits belonging to other elements. He will not be as compromising either. He has unshakable faith in his own powers of observation and deduction and more often than not he is convinced he has the right answer and solutions to his problems. He can assume responsibility admirably well and will display a good deal of initiative in his work.<br>Metal matched with his animal sign will make him more preoccupied with his desires, goals and creative urges. He will be more cunning, but his ambitiousness will be carefully concealed with cool logic and intelligence.<br>A connoisseur par excellence, he will know how to live and will savor the good things life has to offer in a refined way. While he may be indifferent to the opinions of others, he is emotionally and physically moved by good art, music and other forms of beauty. His basic self-assurance and discerning eye will make him an excellent judge of any kind of creative art forms; he may become a collector of great distinction, if he has the means, because of his impeccable taste. Whatever career he chooses he will make his mark early as he is naturally a thorough and devoted worker.<br>But like all true romantic spirits, this type of Rabbit could be inclined to dark moods, and works well only when he is sufficiently inspired. Ardent in love and with great depth and foresight, still he will allow only a handful of people into the inner sanctum of his life because of his many hidden inhibitions.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER RABBIT - 1903, 1963, 2023</span><br><br>This is a meditative type of Rabbit with fragile and emotional nature. He cannot bear harassment or any other unpleasantness, such as dissent and bickering. Perhaps this is due to the fact that he is too emphatic and can pick up the thoughts and feelings of others with uncanny accuracy.<br>He will possess an excellent memory and may have the kind of mental power that, without his knowing it, transmits his ideas to others. Consequently,he attracts the people he wants, and he may be surprised by the many supporters who rally to his defense when he least expects it.<br>However, he is a subjective soul and his perspective gets distorted by the emotional barriers he sets up. He is not very decisive and in many cases could easily fall in with the dictates of others.<br>His delicate sensitivity makes him dwell too much on the past and hence he is often reminiscing on long past injuries and indulging in self-pity. In his negative moods, he suspects other's motives, is uncommunicative and overimaginative. In his positive state, he could call upon all cosmic powers to come to his aid. He is never without friends and influence if he does not carry his neutrality to extremes.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD RABBIT - 1915, 1975, 2035</span><br><br>When Wood is exalted in this lunar sign already governed by Wood, it could produce a generous and especially understanding Rabbit who will be too charitable at times for his own good. No doubt he has real and solid ambitions, but often he is intimidated by authority and may choose to ignore mistakes made in his presence in order to maintain the status quo. As a result, others are tempted to take advantage of his sympathetic and permissive attitude.<br>However, this type of Rabbit usually works out well. He thrives in large corporations or other institutions where he can slowly and diplomatically climb the ladder of success, one rung at a time. Group effort and togetherness appeal to him and give him the kind of security and reassurance he needs. But because of his innate desire to feel part of the group, he may become a bit too bureaucratic and hedge when he has to make a decision that might offend people or set a precedent for a controversial case. In his refusal to meddle or take sides, he may end up hurting everyone, including himself. He should be more discriminating and decisive and take the necessary steps to insulate himself against those who prey on his generous nature. As he is one who is able to bend gracefully without ever breaking, this Rabbit will have no trouble fitting in anywhere he chooses.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE RABBIT - 1927, 1987, 2047</span><br><br>Definitely a demonstrative, fun loving and affectionate type of Rabbit. He has more strength of character than the other Rabbits. In spite of Fire making him more temperamental, he is still able to mask his emotions with charm and diplomacy.<br>His personality is easy and natural. People respond positively to his ideas because he expresses them so well.<br>Fire may make him prone to emotion and outspoken in expressing his wants. He is more capable of leadership than other Rabbits and his rule is tempered with discretion and moderation. Despite his outgoing and progressive ways, he will never approve of outright confrontation with his enemies and will prefer to use subtle plots or deal with go-betweens as natives of his sign are so adept at doing.<br>This type of Rabbit will have a high level of intuition and even psychic ability. He is intensely aware of changes in his surroundings and easily moved to anger, hurt or disappointment. He could also become terribly neurotic when negative. He requires approval, whole-hearted and inspiration in order to sparkle.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH RABBIT - 1879, 1939, 1999</span><br><br>A serious and steadfast type of Rabbit, he has definite patterns of thought and is capable of well-calculated moves. He deliberates before giving in to his emotional inclinations. His balanced and rational personality wins him favor in the eyes of his superiors, as does his realistic approach to his goals.<br>The Earth element makes him more constant and less indulgent, although his constancy will be of a passive sort. His introverted nature causes him to turn inward when beset with problems and he must be in accord with his inner self before he acts. He never hesitates to appropriate whatever resources are available and will use them wisely.<br>He is materialistic sort of person, and his well-being is his prime concern, making him indifferent to the needs of others when they are not in accordance with his plans. Still, he possesses the humility to acknowledge his shortcomings and will strive to overcome them if he can.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Dog</strong></span><br><br><strong>Year of the Dog</strong><br><br>Paradoxically the year of the Dog will bring happiness and dissent in the same boat. The Dog's domestic auspices will bring harmony to home life, patriotism to one's country and unwavering fealty to whatever cause you wish to support.<br>On the other hand, his rigid willpower and unbending sense of justice will also lead to major confrontations with the weaker side getting the upper hand. It is a year in which controversial issues will be awarded a hearing and unconventional but effective changes will be introduced. Equality and liberty will be advocated by the Dog's noble influence.<br><br>We will become more idealist in our views, shedding some materialism by doing charitable acts or otherwise championing some worthy projects, It is a year in which we will shift away from the pursuit of the almighty dollar and become a little more reflective. A perfect time to reassess our sense of values, polish up our virtues and go on crusades against tyranny and oppression.<br><br>In spite of the Dog's dismal outlook, he brings stability because people do not usually date to challenge his authority when they see how intent he is on keeping the peace. The year of the Metal Dog is more feared than others as he is said to bring war and calamity.<br><br>Needless to say, the Dog's resoluteness and intensity will cause clashes, upheavals and rebellions of all sorts, but it will be his good sense and largess that will also smooth things out in the end. His unselfishness will predispose us to be more bighearted than we normally are.<br><br>This will also be a year in which we will wish we could relax more without the cynical Dog constantly casting worries on our minds. Then again, perhaps it will be the Dog's ever-watchful eye that will be the main force in keeping this time calm.<br><br>Aside from this feeling of uneasiness, there should be no cause for alarm. We can go about our business as usual since the Dog makes the perfect sentry.<br><br>The Dog's year will lend integrity to our intentions and make us act in good faith. Nothing should concern us so long as we stick to the righteous path.<br><br></div>

At the same time, they will never backbite anyone, and they will rush to help when there's danger somewhere.<br><br>Gifted with a special sensitivity, they have keen insight into other people's minds.

These friendships became deepened through usual contacts, such as visits and chats over tea, etc. And they always seem to have the friends in need.<br><br>They are energetic and ambitious, and prefer to bury themselves in work that interests them. It's a pity that they lack patience. They seldom get frenzied in love as do people born in the year of the horse or tiger, but they often show the utmost solicitude toward their sweethearts in a quiet way.<br><br>It seems that those born in the night are more aggressive than those born in the daytime. But all of them will live a peaceful life with abundance in daily necessities.<br><br>They can get along in harmony with those born in the year of the horse, snake, monkey, pig, or even the dog, but not the ox or sheep, and especially not the rooster.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Dog</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Dog</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL DOG - 1910, 1970, 2030</span><br><br>This type of Dog can be unwavering in his convictions and highly critical of every infraction of the law according to his own interpretation. However, his principles are of highest kind and fundamentally he is noble and charitable. He will give himself to a lifetime of selfless dedication if he finds an object or cause worthy of his devotion. Yet he can be ruthless when aroused and will pursue his enemies until they are annihilated.<br><br>The Metal element combined with his lunar sign, which is also governed by Metal, produces a double Metal sign, which is extremely formidable. Orientals call this combination the "Iron Dog" and look upon its year with much apprehension as it could be either very good or very bad, depending on whether it takes on a negative or positive course.<br><br>Likewise, the stern and principled Metal Dog will exhibit the same traits and will exercise strong mental discipline over himself and take things very seriously.<br>His loyalty is unquestionable and he has strong political views. Never indecisive, he will pick a side and never desert his affiliations. Consequently, even though he hates injustice and foul play, this type of Dog can resort to extreme measures when he insists that others subscribe to his views.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER DOG - 1922, 1982, 2042</span><br><br>An intuitive type of Dog, who will be difficult to lead astray. Water gives him more reflective qualities and he will be sympathetic to the views of the opposite side. However, despite his pleasant personality and democratic stance, he does not establish very strong personal bonds to those close to him and is often too liberal where he should be more firm.<br>More easygoing than other Dogs, he will tend to be lenient with himself as well as with others, often indulging in self-gratification and adventurous sprees. But because his strong temperament will be toned down by the Water element, this Dog is able to contain his emotions to an admirable degree and will present calm and charming exterior.<br><br>A good counselor, fair judge and legal-minded operator, the Water Dog will be fluid in expressing himself, using psychological approaches that are hard to refuse or refute. He is fated also to have a large circle of friends and his company will be much sought after.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD DOG - 1874, 1934, 1994</span><br><br>An enchanting, warm-hearted and even-tempered sort of Dog, who in spite of his candor and wariness of strangers will form close and lasting relationships with those he chooses to befriend and love. Honest, considerate and well-liked, this Dog person seeks intellectual stimulation and will work hard to develop himself.<br><br>Wood gives him a more stable and generous nature and he will seek growth, balance and beauty in his environment. He will also be attracted to money and success but will preserve himself from too much materialism. With an aptitude for dealing with vast numbers of people from all walks of life, he or she will act with maturity and common sense.<br><br>The Wood Dog will be popular and will gravitate toward refinement and social graces despite his hidden assertive qualities. Energetic and cooperative, he will like to deal in partnerships or ally himself with powerful affiliations.<br><br>He is basically group-oriented and will be eager to please as many of his associates as possible. Thus, this type of Dog can sometimes be held back because he refuses to move without the sanction and backing of others. He must learn independence even if it means rocking the boat on occasion.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE DOG - 1886, 1946, 2006</span><br><br>A highly dramatic and attractive type of Dog who will be thrown into the limelight by his alluring yet friendly personality. He will be defiant and rebellious when forced to do something against his will, but he will be very popular with the opposite sex. Although he may be the life of the party type, he is still careful to practice what he preaches and will not be spoiled by success and fortune. Fire makes him very fierce when attacked; nor will he make threats he cannot carry out. His bite is just as strong as his bark.<br><br>The buoyant and self-assured Fire Dog has great magnetic charm and can convince others to follow his lead. His independent spirit and courage will see to it that he is never afraid of getting involved with others. He will constantly thrill to new experiences and adventures. But he needs a strong shining example to pattern himself after. He will relate better to people older than himself, those from whom he can learn a great deal or whom he can depend on to bring stability into his life.<br><br>Fire makes him or her more creative and pure in expression. He will be charged with super willpower and a natural honesty that people find hard to resist. His outgoing character combined with the Dog's basic faith and idealism will help him to succeed in ambitious endeavors and to overcome great barriers.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH DOG - 1898, 1958, 2018</span><br><br>This Dog will be an impartial dispenser of sound advice and justice. An efficient and constructive thinker, he moves slowly and with good purpose. He is faithful to his beliefs but will bow to the majority rule. Vigilant and careful, he will appreciate the proper use of money and power and have a fixed scale of values from which he seldom deviates.<br><br>Quiet, kind-hearted but secretive, he will understand how to inspire others and instruct them wisely. Yet because of his high moral standards and unfailing idealism, he tends to overperform and may demand excessive dedication and loyalty from others.<br><br>A good fighter and an equally good survivor, this Dog is practical and less sentimental. The realistic Earth Dog will value his individualism and self-respect and will speak without reserve straight from his heart. He will not abuse powers bestowed on him and will delegate duties with a keen insight into other people's potentials. He is never totally suppressed by defeat nor overconfident in victory.<br><br></div>

Amusing, diverse and gay. A splendid interlacing here of character and ingenuity.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rooster - 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br><br>A preaching Dog. And, believe me, he would rather preach than practice. Very analytical, and competent to achieve his goals, but it takes him so long to get to the point.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dog - 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.</span><br><br>A defensive, ever-alert Dog.

Big spending and lavish plans are the rule of the day. The mighty Dragon sneers at the prudent and penny-pinching. He gambles for all or nothing. He will stimulate us to think and act big, even overstepping the bounds of caution.<br><br>Orientals consider this to be an auspicious year to get married, have children, or start a new business , as the benevolent Dragon brings good fortune and happiness.<br><br>However, this is also a time to temper our enthusiasm and look twice before taking a plunge. For although the lucky Dragon showers his blessing indiscriminately on all, he disappears when the time comes for making retributions for our errors. Success as well as failures will thus be magnified. The Fire Dragon is especially feared, as he wreaks more havoc than the Dragons of the other elements.<br><br>In the Dragon's year, fortunes as well as disaster will come in massive waves. This is a year marked by a lot of surprises and violent acts of nature. Tempers will flare the world over and everyone will be staging some real or imaginary revolt against constrictions. The electric atmosphere created by the might Dragon will affect us, one and all.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Dragon</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Dragon Personality</strong><br><br>People born in the year of the dragon are full of vitality and strength. To them, life is a colorful leaping flame. Though assuming airs of self-importance, being prejudiced, making arbitrary decisions, and indulging in some of the wildest fantasies, these people are always adored. They are proud, aloof and frank. They establish lofty ideals at an early age, and require others to have same ideals.<br><br>In China the dragon symbolizes an emperor and power. It is said that people born in the year of the dragon are powerful. A child born in this year enjoys shouldering heavy loads, even if he is the youngest one in the family, while an older child born in this year often shoulders the responsibility of bringing up his brothers or sisters.<br><br>Persons born in the year of the dragon are quite energetic, and their anxiety, yearning, and enthusiasm can be almost as passionate as religious fervor, like the burning fire sprayed by a dragon in legends. They have the potential of achieving great accomplishments, and like to act boldly and resolutely, always putting on a great show as they do so. Although often successful, they are likely to be destroyed and to become self conceited or mad about power if they are unable to control their enthusiasm.<br><br>Sometimes such a person will believe that he is greatly restricted by society, tenderness and honeyed words. When he flies into a rage, he can become extraordinarily rude and inconsiderate.<br><br>Though his emotion can be as fierce as a volcano, he does not always give himself over to blind emotions. He may act stubbornly and arbitrarily and lose his reason when he flares up. But he will forgive you afterwards and wishes to be forgiven. Sometimes he may forget to apologize. In fact he can become so busy with his work that he will have no time to explain himself. Though hot-tempered and arbitrary, he is respectful to elders. No matter what differences he may have with his family, he will offer his help resolutely and generously, leaving differences behind if his family needs his help.<br><br>It is difficult to compete with people born in the year of the dragon, because they are strong and decisive, but not cunning. They like to win success by relying on their own strength, and they are often disgusted with those playing tricks. Due to over-confidence and often misled by illusions, persons of this sort are slow to react to surrounding conspiracies and upcoming dangers, and usually cannot effect countermeasures in time. They are too proud to ask others for help, and will not withdraw even when there is great disparity in strength. They are frank, and never tell a lie.<br><br>A person born in the year of the dragon has clear objectives in life, never idling about. He must have a cause to strive for, an objective to be realized, and the opportunity to make mistakes. Without ambitious plans, and the ability to pull his forces together to start afresh after failure, he is like a train that cannot run because of a shortage of fuel.<br><br>Women born in the year of the dragon are usually nobel ladies, and will never submit to oppression meekly. They may even outshine men in doing "men's jobs." You can never underestimate such a woman, for she might defeat you or even lead to your destruction.<br><br>Judged by her clothes and ornaments, you may find her to be a serious person. She likes practical clothing the most, clothes without ruffles, ribbons, and unnecessary buttons and bows. She loves to wear loose and comfortable clothes, which are suitable for moving about, and dislikes tight ones that are restrictive. In fact, if she is interested in military or public causes, she will gladly wear a uniform.<br><br>Such a woman has a strong sense of self-respect. Though she often likes to put on airs, she does not wish others to treat her like a sage. She needs mutual respect among people, and tries her best to respect others.<br><br>Though people born in the year of the dragon have many shortcomings, their radiance lights up everyone. They are magnanimous, and never envy others.<br><br>Such a person finds pleasure in helping others, and you can always count on their help. They are extroverts who have a deep love for nature, and such a person may become a great travel buff, a good talker, or a sportsman.<br><br>The weather at the time a person is born in the year of the dragon affects their later life. If born in stormy weather, such a person will lead a stormy life, which is full of risks, and experience hardships and dangers; if born on a day of gentle breezes and calm waves, such a person will be protected throughout his life and will have a lovely temperament.<br><br>A person born in the year of the dragon will either marry early or remain single. He will live a happy single life for he will be preoccupied by his work and career and will often be visited by his worshipers; therefore, he will not feel empty and lonely.<br><br>Such a person is neither extravagant nor stingy. In other words, he will be generous and will never care about whether he has made ends meet or not.<br><br>Such a person will not keep silent for long, and will struggle to free himself from distress sooner than others will. He is happy, and opposes gentleness. Being firm and persistent, courageous and resolute, he will give the least consideration to the consequences when striving to realize his aim, and will even plunge headlong into an abyss. He sees himself as coming into this world to realize his ideals. The more you might want to make him change his route so as to get around difficulties, the more he will become stubborn. He deserves to be called a pioneer, and will live up to expectations even when in a bad mood.<br><br>Such a person is frank, and can never disguise his intentions. He does not guard his thoughts as though they were hidden in a vase to keep secret. Even if he promises not to reveal a word, he may blurt it out when he gets angry.<br><br>He has true and sincere love, which comes from the depths of his heart. You can be sure of his true love.<br><br>If he is rude, he will probably have a strong destruction force.<br><br>People focus their attentions on persons born in the year of the dragon when they are present, and handle affairs according to their thinking. Such a person can arouse everyone's fervor, while he himself does not need to be encouraged, for he is energetic enough. You will never lose faith in an honest "dragon," for he seldom wavers, and will never be terribly suspicious. He has an innate explorative spirit, and tries to succeed at one stroke.<br><br>Though the "dragon" makes people feel dazzled, he is not a profound thinker, and only when he is able to control the magic power described in legends can he create wonders.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Dragon</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Dragon</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL DRAGON - 1880, 1940, 2000</span><br><br>This type could well be the most strong-willed of the Dragons. Honesty and integrity are paramount virtues to him and although he may be bright, open and expressive, he is also unbending and critical.<br><br>Action-oriented and combative, he will seek out and motivate those on his own level of intelligence or social standing. He has little patience with the lazy and the foolish. Unpliable Metal combined with his natural lunar sign, Wood, will also enable him to intimidate weaker beings into submitting to his will. Otherwise, he is the magnificent warrior at his best.<br><br>He is tremendously intense and will stake his life on his convictions. It is futile to try to convince him that certain things just cannot be done. This type of Dragon will try to exorcise whatever evil he sees in life and could be fanatical regarding his convictions and moral beliefs.<br><br>When he is negative, he will have exaggerated views of his own importance. He is a bit short on diplomacy and has the habit of going it alone if others disagree with him or refuse to accept his leadership.<br><br>The strong Metal Dragon will rush in where angels fear to tread. He will succeed because he will give himself no other recourse. He burns his bridges behind him so that he cannot turn back once he attacks.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER DRAGON - 1892, 1952, 2012</span><br><br>A less imperious type of Dragon who favors optimum growth and expansion. He can put aside his ego for the good of all and is less selfish and opinionated. An inhibited but progressive person, he tries hard not to be as conspicuous as other power-hungry Dragons. Neither is he going to be labeled as the conciliatory one. He can assume a wait-and-see attitude and his wits are as formidable as his strength of will.<br><br>The Water Dragon lives by the to-thine-own-self-be-true philosophy and will not seek revenge on those who choose to go the opposite way. democratic and liberal-minded, he can accept defeat or rejection without bitterness.<br><br>Water is calming and beneficial to his lunar sign and he will know how to act wisely and do what is essential for his progress. He is quick and reliable and is capable of marketing his ideas with untiring devotion. He is likely to be successful as a negotiator, as he knows when, where and how to apply force.<br><br>His main drawback is that he may be like an overoptimistic builder who forgets to reinforce the foundation. By trying to hold on to too much he may lose everything. He must learn to make difficult choices and to relinquish whatever is unfeasible or unnecessary. This way, he will be able to devote his energies to fewer but more rewarding endeavors.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD DRAGON - 1904, 1964, 2024</span><br><br>A creative and magnanimous type of Dragon capable of developing bright, new revolutionary concepts. Wood combined with his sign makes him good at formulating and implementing his ideas and working cooperatively with others, even if he may be a bit condescending on occasions.<br><br>Gifted with an exploratory nature, the Wood Dragon loves to look into cause and effect theories; his every action will be guided by sound logic. However, he also has a tendency to overinvestigate subjects or to submit people to endless debate when he is faced with opposition.<br><br>Nonetheless, here is a generous Dragon who is amendable to taking the middle road; who tries to offend as few people as possible; who subtly conceals his domineering ways. The Wood element produces a less fierce and unreasonable variety of Dragons who will compromise when he sees it is to his advantage. Still, as a Dragon, he will ultimately have to relate everything to his oversize ego and will condescend to change only when he is sure of the benefits to himself.<br><br>Not as vindictive or self-centered as Dragons of the other elements, he will still be outspoken, proud and fearless when challenged.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE DRAGON - 1916, 1976, 2036</span><br><br>The most righteous, outgoing and competitive of all Dragons, the Fire Dragon will expect a lot from everyone. But while he may be demanding and aggressive, he is also blessed with enormous energy and has a lot to offer in return. The trouble is that he may go around with an air of superiority plus authority and make people fear or shy away from him. His leadership qualities are often marred by his desire to be treated like the Messiah. Fire matched with his forceful lunar sign will give him overzealous and dictatorial inclinations. He pushes too hard even where there is little resistance.<br><br>In reality, he is an open and humane person given to impartiality and uncovering the truth at all costs. His criticisms are objective and he has the power to arouse the masses with his vibrant personality. A natural empire builder, he will look toward the supreme order of things, with himself at the helm, of course.<br><br>Because the Fire Dragon is often enveloped by insatiable personal ambition, he is short-tempered, inconsiderate and unable to put up with anything less than perfection. He also overgeneralizes or jumps to conclusions, frequently lumping people into categories without allowing for or even perceiving their individual differences.}<br><br>Nonetheless, here is a performer of the highest degree who could easily be a source of inspiration to his fellowman and a personality who will catch the public eye - when he learns to master his negative traits and communicate more humbly with others.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH DRAGON - 1868, 1928, 1988</span><br><br>This sociable, executive-type Dragon will have a compulsive drive to control his environment and the people who surround him. As a Dragon, he is bound to be autocratic and it would be folly to expect less. However, he will be fair and appreciative of other people's opinions, even if he doesn't agree with them. Earth makes him realistic, stable and, oftentimes, even a bit impersonal.<br><br>Although not as severe as the other Dragons, he will still have the basic urge to subjugate others. But he will approach problems with reason and his leadership is less dictatorial. He works incessantly to develop his talents and exploit his resources.<br><br>The Earth Dragon's self-control does not mean that he is lacking in initiative. It's just that the Earth element influences him to be unhurried and his aspirations are more liable to be solid and uncluttered.<br><br>Straight as a rod, this aristocratic Dragon is quiet, strong and brave. Given to reflection and organization, his outbursts of temper will be few, nor will he demean himself by arguing with those beneath him when he is angered. However, he will retaliate quickly once his dignity is offended.</div>

The mouse's affectionate nature also makes it difficult for him to be absolutely objective and decisive.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Ox - 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.</span><br><br>Slow-moving Dragon who likes to be sure of what he is doing. Nonetheless, he is still breathing fire and could employ the Buffalo's heavy-minded ways in dealing with those that cross him.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Tiger - 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.</span><br><br>Could get hysterical when plans go awry. He has the Tiger's wild impulses and is motivated by emotional reasons. On the other hand, he could be a compulsive worker, too.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rabbit - 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.</span><br><br>Strength and diplomacy combined. A quiet Dragon given to reflection and sound thinking. Very strong and subtle.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dragon - 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.</span><br><br>The high priest or priestess type.

Will probably have to establish a cult of his own if he wants to have a large following.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Snake - 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.</span><br><br>A Dragon who plots every move and executes plans with precision. Slightly sinister and overambitious, but the Snake's charm masks this intensity.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Horse - 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</span><br><br>A gregarious wit who may like to gamble with high stakes. No party is complete without him. But the Horse's preoccupation with his own selfish desires may overshadow the Dragon's sense of duty.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Sheep - 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.</span><br><br>Modest and understanding, this Dragon is one who can really get things done to perfection without having to resort to brute force.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Monkey - 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.</span><br><br>A superstar in his own right. A good combination of strength and guile. He jokes and clowns around but don't be fooled - he is made of steel and you'll never get past him.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rooster - 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br><br>A fearless and imaginative Dragon with immeasurable pride and some of the Rooster's folly. Never a dull moment!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dog - 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.</span><br><br>A down-to-earth Dragon with practical ideas. The Dog in him makes him assess situation in a more detached way and lends him good humor and stability. May also have a nasty bite when he is angry.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Pig - 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.</span><br><br>Deeply devoted and warm-hearted Dragon. Wonderful to have as a friend as he will go all out to support you. The Pig's influence may even give this Dragon a touch of humility.</div>
