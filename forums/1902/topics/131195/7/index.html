            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Pig</strong></span><br><br><strong>Year of the Pig/Boar</strong><br><br>A year of goodwill to all. An excellent climate for business, and industry in general will prevail. People will be more free and easy on the whole and the complaisant attitude of the Boar will generate a feeling of abundance. But in spite of the favorable auspices here, like the Boar we will hesitate, waver and undermine our own abilities when opportunity calls.<br><br>The Boar's year is one of plenty. La dolce vita is very much advocated and practiced by the sensual Boar. If life is worth living, it mist be lived to the hilt. Such is his motto. The Boar is as lavish with gifts as he is with affection. He takes pride in being chivalrous and extravagant. It would be ill-advised to overspend this eyar of make sizable investments without thorough investigation. We may also come to regret impulsive acts of generosity made on the spir of the moment.<br><br>The fortunate Boar carries with him contentment and security. This is one year in which you could be happy without having or needing a lot of success or money to make it so. There will not seem to be many hurdles to overcome and the placid Boar radiates a sense of well-being. Still, a great deal of prudence is recommended in money matters, as the Boar is always susceptible to swindlers.<br><br>This year will find us entertaining a lot more than usual and getting ourselves involved in all sorts of charitable and social functions. We find it a lot easier to make friends in the Boar's tolerant and expansive atmosphere.<br><br>Watch out for excesses, though, as the Boar tends to overindulge himself in anything when given the opportunity. Weight watchers will have a tough time and may face losing (or rather, gaining) battles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Pig</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Pig/Boar Personality</strong><br><br>People born in the year of the pig are steady and resolute in doing things, and honest and warm-hearted to other people. Competent and persistent as they are, they will spare no efforts in fulfilling any job assigned to them.<br><br>Though simple-minded, they always have their own opinions. They hope that everything will be peaceful and everyone happy. They can get along well with others because of their leniency and generosity, and they have patience in perfecting themselves and fulfilling their jobs, which makes them good teachers. However, they will fly into a rage when forced to, but they never harbor a grudge and stab another person in the back.<br><br>They are always faithful to friends and set a high value on friendship. They have an interest in giving and participating in parties. Besides, they are good peacemakers in others' eyes because of their honesty and trustworthiness.<br><br>The more you know them, the deeper your friendship will grow. Besides honesty, they are also warmhearted and careful about their attire. Whenever a friend is in need, they will never hesitate to help.<br><br>Their honesty and warm hearts also win them a lot of respect and help, and make them confident and happy.<br>You may turn to them for consolation and help when you are in low spirits. They will never snub a person, and will help him minimize his troubles.<br><br>Women born in the year of the pig like to keep their homes free from dust or untidiness. They have strong characters, paying respect to others as well as to themselves. They may devote all their efforts to succeed in the career they love, oblivious of any reward. Nobly motivated, they keep helping friends afar in secret ways, and host their husbands' friends with great attention and answer children's questions with great patience. People feel at ease with them. The places where you find them are always full of happy laughter.<br><br>However, people born in the year of the pig are quite gullible and easily believe in others, even person they know little. So it's a pity that they can't be good treasurers.<br><br>They are generous in sharing what they have with others. But they are blunt in speech and actions, sometimes just shrugging off other's insults toward them. And they are near-sighted, only paying attention to the present. No wonder they can always extricate themselves from agony quickly and worry little about misfortunes.<br>Their kindness to others can't shade their firmness in careers. But success is not easy for them to achieve because they are overcautious and indecisive.<br><br>Honest as these persons are, they usually achieve success by hard work rather than by cheating or stealing.<br><br>They have a strong passion and good energy and patience for their work. But sometimes their excessive energy will become the bane of reprobation. When they fail to distinguish the harm in some of the fun they enjoy, they may be easily used by evil people and sink into vice.<br><br>They will be hard-working all their lives, sparing no effort in doing everything. Though too much energy will eventually cost them, they can have smooth sailing all the same with the help of their pleasant character.<br><br>Their main shortcoming is the fact that they seldom say "no" to others, and always force others to take a mean course in doing things, blurring the line between right and wrong.<br><br>They will go into bankruptcy at least once in their lives, but they can manage to retrieve the loss in the end, and they will learn from the experience to become more clever and brave than before.<br><br>They often become extremely pessimistic or self-indulgent when they lose everything or lack the ability to help others, the cause of which is their deep belief in fatalism.<br><br>Though somewhat cultured, they lack profound insight and usually judge things by appearance alone.</div>

Dependable and determined, he will lead in school activities and acquire prestige by his perseverance and dedication. This youngster will be courageous in the face of great odds and he will not whimper or complain., As a matter of fact, he will be endowed with a remarkably strong body and can withstand a good deal of pain and suffering without crying.<br><br>The Boar, like the Rat, will have a hefty appetite and you won't have to force him to eat or pamper him like the Sheep child. He will work hard cheerfully and will not be easily depressed or discouraged. His placid exterior masks his passionate nature. The amorous Boar finds it difficult to be casual or detached in his affections. If he loves his parents, he will worship the very ground they walk on; if not, he will punish himself with remorse and guilt instead of blaming anyone else. He will not need as much attention as other children but he must be assured that he will have your support when he seeks it.<br><br>The Boar child has a certain individualism of his own. He will allow you to be the boss so long as you do not expect him to be your slave. His give-and-take attitude will make him popular around the neighborhood. He strives more for the fun of winning rather than for the rewards. Often, he may not treasure his belongings and may give things away easily.<br><br>In spite of his excellent ability for organizing group effort, smoothing out rough edges and calming fiery natures, the Boar will have trouble taking sides, questioning other people's motives or restraining himself from indulging in his rich tastes and love of comfort on the sly.<br><br>This is one child who can take reproach with a positive frame of mind. Setbacks can instill him with renewed vigor. Whenever he instigates changes, he will always be able to convince everyone involved of their necessity. The Boar child will put all his strength, conviction and dedication behind anything he undertakes.<br><br>With his soft approach and gentle persuasiveness, the Boar can and will inspire others to do his bidding. It is he who needs more discipline if his talents are not to go to waste. He may excel at planning functions, projects and other people's activities, but he is lazy about applying the same rules to his own daily life.<br><br>Whatever he does, you will find this child constantly looking for more ways to work off his huge supply of energy. Wherever he is, you will find a lot of togetherness. He loves to seal relationships with a special glue of his own. In him, you will see unselfishness and a truly great passion for living.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Pig</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Pig</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL pig - 1911, 1971, 2031</span><br><br>A proud passionate pig with overpowering sentiments, who values his reputation. Intense and more dominating than others, this type of pig often has excessive appetites and could lack refinement or tact.<br>He exerts less control over his personal life and is very sociable and extroverted. Openly demonstrative with his affections and pure-minded, he underestimates his enemies and overestimates his friends. He is not likely to be secretive and will be direct and trusting, even credulous.<br>Ambitious and forceful, but not always objective, the Metal pig could be a dangerous opponent, as he can be violent in expressing his anger or resentment.<br>This type of pig will not concede defeat graciously. He is not a quitter and can be relied on to have immense powers of endurance. An active doer blessed with great positive strength, the staunch Metal pig will have enough vigor for ten.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER pig - 1863, 1923, 1983</span><br><br>A persevering and diplomatic pig with all the qualifications of an outstanding emissary. Perceptive at discovering people's hidden desires, he will be resourceful in bargaining with his opponents. Still, Water makes him look for the best in others and he often refuses to believe their evil intents until the last moment. This type of pig has a touching faith in his beliefs and loved ones. A believer in miracles, he can be used by others if he is not careful.<br>The cordial, peaceful and earnest Water pig will be a great party-goer. He will stick scrupulously to the rules of the game, showing his goodwill by meeting others more than halfway.<br>Still true to his pig nature, he will have his basic passions and outpourings of love. When he is negative, he can be preoccupied with sex, enjoyment of rich foods, excessive drinking or indulging in other expensive luxuries at the expense of others.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD pig - 1875, 1935, 1995</span><br><br>The Wood pig can manipulate others with expertise. Although he is interested in his personal gains, he will also be inclined to devote a lot of his time to charitable organizations and is excellent at running social functions and club activities. He loves to help all those who come in touch with him and will try his best to get along with everyone. He is a splendid promoter; thus he will be good at getting financing for his business deals.<br>Extremely good-hearted, he will recommend clemency even for the most unworthy and is often not choosy about whom he associates with. Consequently, his unworthy friends could dupe him or drag him down into the mud with them if he is too much in their company.<br>Yet he will also be rewarded for the confidence he places in people and he will assume important positions because of his gift in bringing people together.<br>Wood makes him expansive but still scrupulous enough to operate by accepted modes. He will seek to be connected with the right people and will undertake ambitious corporate ventures.<br>A persuasive talker, the Wood pig will love to entertain and set up a congenial atmosphere wherever he goes. His positive and bright ways will encourage people to support both his vices and virtues.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE pig - 1887, 1947, 2007</span><br><br>Fire will conduct powerful and intense emotions to this courageous pig. He will display stouthearted heroism in all his endeavors and could follow his plans through with pigheaded determination.<br>He could reach the highest level of achievement or fall to the lowest depth of degradation, depending on which path he chooses and how tight a rein he has over his immense energy and sensuality.<br>The Fire pig will never fear the unknown; intrepid, optimistic and trusting in his own innate ability, he will try his luck at anything and succeed against vast odds. He is motivated by love and will try to accumulate wealth in order to provide a gracious life style for his all-important family. He doesn't mind doing favors for anyone, even strangers, and will be famous for his generous handouts to friends.<br>When he is in his negative state, this pig can be willful, bullying and guilt-ridden, but generally he is characterized by largesse and lack of prejudice. He will favor manufacturing or labor-oriented enterprises because he will enjoy employing a large number of people if given the opportunity.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH pig - 1899, 1959, 2019</span><br><br>A peaceful, sensible and happy type of pig who may have enough sense to benefit himself. The Earth element makes him productive and he will like to take on financial responsibilities or related activities and plan for his own future.<br>Renowned for his steadiness and patience, he will tie himself mercilessly to an objective until he attains it. His willpower will enable him to endure stress and carry burdens well beyond the capacity of others.<br>Devoted both to work and family, the Earth pig will show a diligence and drive that will be hard to surpass. He will not be authoritarian; he will push himself but not others.<br>Although this person may be portly because of his fondness for food and drink, he has an ability for not worrying himself too much over his problems. His ambitions are reasonable and not above his reach. Therefore, he will find the security and material success he craves.<br>A kind, thoughtful friend, reliable associate and helpful employer, the Earth pig will steer clear of troubled areas and look for tranquility and domestic harmony in his life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Pig</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Pig and his Ascendants</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the mouse - 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.</span><br><br>With the mouse behind him, this is a pig that is better equipped to make investments and assessments. He is less likely to be left high and dry. Both signs here are very sociable and know how to make the most out of carefully cultivated friendships.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Ox - 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.</span><br><br>A strong-tempered pig with more precise habits and opinionated views. The Ox will see to it that he does not get too carried away by his sensuality. Can be relied upon to watch his waistline.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Tiger - 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.</span><br><br>A daring, big-hearted and athletic pig. Fine performer and organizer. Both signs here are basically led by emotions and this makes him easily influenced by others.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rabbit - 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.</span><br><br>An easygoing but sagacious pig who will not carry any more burdens than he has to. A great party man, too - but he also never forgets to collect his commissions. Not as obliging as he says he is.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dragon - 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.</span><br><br>A strong, dutiful pig with immense devotion to those he loves. Both signs here are strong but innocent. His successes will only be equaled by his failures.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Snake - 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.</span><br><br>A meditative and more stealthy pig who will pursue his goals with more consistency. Here the Snake could relax the pig's scruples and make him take what he wants. He may also have an oblique way of looking at justice.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Horse - 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</span><br><br>A pig with more mettle. For once, the Horse should be commended for making the pig more selfish and inconsiderate in order to achieve personal profit and recognition.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Sheep - 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.</span><br><br>A compassionate and sentimental pig. Too polite and easily conned. Will work hard for others or be overly generous. Attracts parasites as well as influential supporters.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Monkey - 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.</span><br><br>Will not be led up the garden path. A pig who conceals greed under his friendliness. The Monkey here will be able to spot the tricksters and protect the pig from his own naivet?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rooster - 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br><br>An unorthodox and impractical pig with all good intentions. Performs splendid tasks for free and is absurdly tenacious in unrewarding exercises. The Rooster is too quixotic and the pig is too obvious of his true worth.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dog - 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.</span><br><br>A direct, logical and less sensuous pig who will be guided by the Dog's sound judgement. Will never tolerate deceit. If you trick him, he will come after you with a posse and you can be sure he has swarms of tough friends.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the pig - 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.</span><br><br>A rough diamond. Still waiting for expert hands to cut and polish. All his fine qualities are intact and just waiting to be discovered. Look more closely, please.</div>
