            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Ox</strong></span><br><br><strong>Year of the Ox</strong><br><br>We will feel the yoke of responsibility coming down on us this year. No success can be achieved without conscientious efforts. The trials and btribulations the Ox year brings will be mainly on the homefront. It is a good time to settle domestic affairs and put your house in order.<br><br>Way-out fashions, abstract art forms and newfangled notions will be given an impressive stare by the phlegmatic Ox, while politics and diplomacy will simply be treated with indifference. Better stick to routine and uspport conservative policies. Frivolities are out!<br><br>This year will no doubt bear fruit, but the motto is: "No work, no pay!" Time waits for no man; if we are too lazy to sow then we can blame no one if we have nothing to reap. We will find a great many things requiring our attention, and the list of what needs to be done will seem endless. The Spartan influence of the Ox will be a constantly cracking whip over our heads. Better to apply oneself diligently than waste time arguing with the authorities. They will prevail, as the year of the Ox favors discipline.<br><br>Most conflicts this year will arise more from a lack of communication and refusal to give in on small technicalities than anything else. But hang on and be patient. Everything will be sorted out and we will be rewarded for our efforts--so long as we remember to do things the conventional way. This is no time for tricky shortcuts.<br><br>For the rebels, it may be worthwhile to point out that although the stoical Ox is soft-spoken, he carries a big stick, and this is his year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Ox</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Ox Personality</strong><br><br>People born in the year of the ox are steady, plain and quiet. They arrange things system-atically and they are patient and tireless.<br><br>They are usually ready to take other's advice and act with justice. But it is not easy to change their minds because they are stubborn and sometimes prejudice.<br><br>Because people born in the year of the ox are reliable and steady, they are trusted by their superiors or persons in authority.Where there is responsibility, you will always find them. However, they should be careful not to be carried away by success.<br><br>Their dauntless character and logical way of thinking is covered up by their plain appearance. Their intelligence and nimbleness are covered up by their reticence and restrained manner. Although they may be introverted by nature, when an opportunity is presented they can become quite dignified and eloquent speakers. They face danger fearlessly, and betray no fear in face of threats. They have a natural and intense trust in themselves. All of these features help them to put everything into order in times of trouble.<br><br>People born in the year of the ox do things in an orderly way. They follow settled rules, respect traditional concepts, and always do things the way other people want them to. So people can foresee what they will do the next. They believe that only those who have a down to earth style of work may never be defeated. People born in other years can achieve success depending on their intelligence or other's help. But people born in the year of the ox depend on their own tenacious will and active spirit of devotion. They never believe in chance, keep their words, and once a word is spoken will not take it back even when pulled by a team of four horses (what is said cannot be unsaid). They take an indifferent attitude towards common biases. They will do their jobs with single-hearted devotion, and never give up when something is half-way done.<br><br>They are naive when they think about other people's secrets. They cannot fully understand the feelings of others, and seldom cheat others to win their love. Poetry and serenades seldom appear in their lives, even the gifts they give will be durable and practical. Since people born in the year of the ox are quite traditional, it may take a long time for a man born in the year of the ox to propose marriage to a woman. Such a man may be broad minded and maintain good order, but when he proposes marriage to a pretty girl, he will become clumsy and slow in speech. If you happen to be married to him and trust him completely, he will never disappoint you and will be loyal to you all his life. Although he cannot give you mounds of diamonds, or chests of leather clothing, he will try to make your life as comfortable as he can, and never ask for your help.<br><br>If you are lucky enough to marry a woman born in the year of the ox, you will find that she is a serious person. She will iron your clothing like your mother once did, never forgetting to fold the newspaper on your desk, and will make you delicious breakfasts. She will be very neat and always punctual. After your marriage you will never lack clean clothing, you will never wear stockings with holes in them, and you will never have to eat burnt food. Thus she will be an ideal wife.<br><br>If a man born in the year of the ox feels unhappy about something, this unhappiness will have developed little by little. His memory is precise and can last for a long time. If you harm him, he will remember every detail. People born in the year of the tiger or rooster will complain when they find themselves in adverse circumstances. And those born in the year of the sheep and rabbit will become somewhat sulky. But those born in the year of the ox are different. They will try to reduce their pain and tension through hard work. If they are frustrated in love, they will work hard and refuse the coming "danger" by remaining single.<br><br>People born in the year of the ox do not like to owe other people money. The money they repay will be accurate to the last decimal point. And they will have the same requirement of others. If they owe you something without expressing thanks, they will never forgive themselves. You will not get empty thanks from them; they dislike flowery language and flattering words because they think this harms their honor.<br><br>People born in the year of the ox are very patient. But they can be horrible if they lose their tempers. At such times they will lose their senses and attack those who hurt them like angry bulls. The only way to cool the anger of a person such as this is to stand away from him and let him cool down gradually. But there is no need to worry, they will not get into a fight unless they are driven beyond the limits of forbearance.<br><br>Their words are the rules of their family. They know how to give an order and how to make others follow their order. They hope other people carry out their orders firmly and adhere to their principles on key matters. Although they do not easily become excited, they love their wives and children and they are willing to do anything for them.<br><br>People born in the year of the ox have their feet planted on solid ground, and they are not swayed by their emotions. If you ask for their advice on some problem, you will find their support to be quite reliable. All of them have good physiques, and are seldom sick, they trust themselves and never compromise. They show contempt for other's weaknesses.<br><br>People born in the year of the ox are born with the ability to lead. They know how to keep people within the bounds of discipline and they are often quite strict. They think one must fulfill one's duty, and do not put barriers in other's roads. Their shortcomings are their stiffness and awkwardness, their calculating nature and their rather standoffish attitude. They are never sly, and do not know how to show consideration for others. They have the qualities of a good soldier. This makes them unsuitable for public relations work and foreign affairs. However people respect them because they are honest, effective, and have a strong sense of principle. If they can try to develop more of a sense of humor and enthusiasm, they will live happy lives.<br><br>People born in the year of the ox do not willing seize chances to gain advantage by trickery. They have a strong sense of morality. They never reach their goals in any improper way. They advocate self-reliance. They do not want people to help them. So if you want to give them help, you will have to implore them in order to do so.<br><br>People born in the year of the ox are cautious. They like long-term, stable investments. They are not gamblers, and others taking risks only annoy them.</div>

Both of them have the spirit of devotion and so they can get along with each other well. The sentimental mouse and the clever snake also can get along well with the ox. People born in these two years will take care of an ox. People born in the year of the rabbit, dragon, and horse, as well as others born in the year of the ox will also have a good relationship with them, but these relationships may not be close ones. People born in the year of the dog may consider the ox very dull because the ox generally lacks a sense of humor. People born in the year of the sheep and the tiger will complain that the ox has too much authority over them.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ox and RAT</span><br><br>Very compatible.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Ox</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Ox Child</strong><br><br>This child will not be a crybaby. He is unusually tough and can endure hardship. A rugged individualist, he tends to begin speaking late and would rather settle arguments with his fists. Stubborn and unyilding, he can turn the house upside down when he puts him mind to it. He is not the fussy type but will be adamant about the few concessions he demands. One of them will be his privacy.<br><br>He won't resent discipline and in fact will welcome your fixing a schedule for him. He may insist on having his meals served at the same time each day but he will not be particular about food. He thrives on regularity; knowing where everything is and what is expected of him will give him a sense of security. A girl born under this sign will go for order and neatness at home.<br><br>The Ox youngster enjoys taking charge when mother or teacher is away and is stern and unsympathetic to offenders. He can and usually will give you an unbiased opinion, as he is not easily influenced or taken in by flattery. Instead of bribing or begging him to do something unpleasant, it will be more effective to simply tell him, "It is an order!" He is not argumentative by nature but you must gain his respect before he will obey you.<br><br>He relishes teaching younger children and will show remarkable patience and perseverance in waiting for what he wants. Being the strong, silent type, he may not readily reveal his feelings. He can be deeply hirt and no one may even suspect it, because the Ox child is a very private person. Although he may put up a blunt, strong-willed and loyal front, the Ox is terribly naive about the realities of life. He needs to be protected in this respect and he will rely heavily on moral support from his parents, teachers and family.<br><br>At school, he may be an exemplary student as he is not one to lock horns with the authorities. His serious and no-nonsese outlook on life makes him avoid joking or clowing around. He should be encouraged to express his emotions and develop his sense of humor.<br><br>Above all, he will be reliable and responsible. He will win the repsect of his elders as well as his peers. The Ox child will be an outstanding example of both an excellent leader and follower and perform his duties well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Ox</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Ox</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL OX - 1901, 1961, 2021</span><br><br>This type of Ox will have strong clashes of will with people, even his superiors, who do not agree with his views. He expresses himself clearly, intensely and resolutely and can never be accused of being vague about what he wants. He will stick to his guns at all cost; when necessary he can be quite eloquent - and will use all his abilities to the full when he wants to forge ahead.<br>He is not very affectionate by nature but could have scholarly inclinations and be a lover of classical music and art. He has a strong sense of responsibility and can be relied upon to keep his word, which shouldn't be too difficult as he or she will be a person of few words.<br>At times, he tends to force issues; he can become a one-man army when he is obsessed with succeeding in his objectives. He can become a fanatic about them. Tough and arrogant, he does not know the word "failure". A person of remarkable stamina, he will require little rest or diversion. He won't mind working around the clock if that is what it takes to get things done. He can be narrow-minded and vengeful when he doesn't get his way.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER OX - 1853, 1913, 1973</span><br><br>This is a more realistic than idealistic type of Ox. Patient, practical and unrelentingly ambitious, he possesses a shrewd mind mind and a keen sense of values. He puts things to their proper use and has many notable contributions to make because he knows how to bide his time and organize his activities.<br>This Ox will be more reasonable and flexible and is open to suggestions, although he may still not approve of change or unconventional methods being introduced into his life. But he is not as stern as other Oxen and will not be unhappy if asked to bend to the wind. He is primarily concerned about improving his status and security and will uphold law and order in everything he undertakes.<br>He will make his mark by working well with others and can steer his own course without any difficulty, provided he does not get too rigid or demand too much from others. He can concent mouse on more than one goal at a time and can wear out and wait out the opposition by this methodical calmness, patience and determination.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD OX - 1865, 1925, 1985</span><br><br>This type of Ox is less rigid and at least conscious if not considerate of other people's emotions. He reacts more quickly than others of his sign and is likely to be more graceful socially. He will be admired for his integrity and ethics. He is fair and impartial although his lunar animal sign draws him towards conservatism. He understands and operates within a fixed social system and will be a much better showman than the Oxen of the other elements.<br>Given the chance and motivation, he will embrace new and progressive views; he is less stubborn and able to concede to majority rule.<br>He could climb to great heights, amassing wealth and achieving prominence, if he can succeed in founding and developing sizable industrial outfits. He has strong drive and will exploit his potentials to the maximum. He understands the importance of coexistence and will link his ambitions to a larger order of things. He is capable of teamwork and is likely to be corporate-minded.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE OX - 1877, 1937, 1997</span><br><br>This Ox is a combustible performer and the type most drawn to power and importance. His native sense of control is reinforced but so is his strong temper. As a result, he can be more forceful and proud than the other Oxen, with the exception of the quiet Metal Ox. He is materialistic and may have a superiority complex. Consequently, he tends to eliminate persons or things he considers useless or inappropriate without attempting their true worth. He is objective and outspoken and can be too harsh to those who dare oppose him.<br>The Fire element here could turn his hard-working tendencies towards the military - or even all-out war against his opponents. He tends to overestimate his abilities and may show little patience or consideration for the feelings of others. Otherwise, he is basically honest and a fair person who does not like to take advantage of others if he can avoid it. His family will benefit most from his labors as he is apt to be very protective to his loved ones and will see to it that they are always well provided for.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH OX - 1889, 1949, 2009</span><br><br>This is an enduring although less creative type of Ox who is always faithful to his duties. He knows his limitations and realizes his imperfections quite young in life. He will shine in any career he decides to undertake as he is practical, industrious and prepared to pay the price demanded for success. He contributes his share willingly and will favor practical and worthy endeavors.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Tiger</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Tiger Child</strong><br><br>A Tiger child could be a bundle of joy and a holy terror at the same time. A little live wire who dashes about sparkling with activity, he will throw himself into the thick of things. Even a very quiet one will know exactly where the action is and make a bee line for it.<br><br>He is a charming, bright and self-confident chatterbox, and there will be no holding him back. His insatiable curiosity and inquisitiveness will lead him to pounce at anything that moves, and he will get into all sorts of predicaments. Hyperactive and high strung, he likes romping, screaming and rough play.<br><br>Like the Dragon, he may also bully those less aggressive into submission. But people will also be naturally drawn to him by his warm, affectionate and gregarious character.<br><br>The Tiger child will express his feelings outright. You will have to put up with his strong opinions on how things should be run and he will air his views without hesitation. He doesn't like anyone to keep secrets from him and he himself is poor at keeping them.<br><br>Since he does not bottle up his emotions, you will know immediately when something is troubling him. Just be sure he is given enough outlets to release his pent-up energy.<br><br>If the Tiger's assertiveness is unchecked, he could dominate his parents completely and turn into a dreadful brat. He should be taught to hold his temperamental character in check early, as well as to listen to reason and understand the values of compromise. But the little rebel won't just take your work for it. He won't be himself if he does not keep testing the boundaries and limits set for him. It will be no mean task making him toe the line. But the earlier he realizes who is boss, the better for him and everyone else around.<br><br>However, if he is given the proper stimuli of discipline, coupled with love, warmth and loads of understanding, no other child will respond as spontaneously as the lovable little Tiger. Life may not always run smoothly with him around, but then it would be all too empty without him. Having a Tiger child will be a reward in itself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Tiger</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Tiger</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL TIGER - 1890, 1950, 2010</span><br><br>This is definitely not a reticent type of Tiger. The Metal Tiger is bound to be active, aggressive and passionate. He may or may not be artistic but he will certainly see to it that he projects a glamorous image and personality that will not go unnoticed. Self-centered and ostentatious, he is a competitive and untiring worker when motivated in the right way.<br>He will approach his problems in a direct or even a radical way and is never in doubt about what he wants to accomplish. The problem is that he wants too much and too soon. He tends to be overoptimistic about expected results.<br>When Metal is combined with his native lunar sign, it could produce a Tiger who can be sudden, unorthodox and drastic in his actions. He is a person who is constant only to himself and his desires, even if he has to step on a few toes along the way. This particular Tiger is easily stirred by both good and bad influences and will tend to act independently, as he hates having his freedom curtailed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER TIGER - 1902, 1962, 2022</span><br><br>This type is an open-minded Tiger who is always inclined toward new ideas and experiences. He also has a gift for seeing things objectively, because the Water element combined with his lunar sign gives him a calmer nature. He is humane and an excellent judge of the truth, as he can relate to the way others feel. He is intuitive and has a well-developed faculty for communicating with people.<br>This more realistic type of Tiger has his finger on the pulse of the people and knows the things he deals with. He makes few errors in his assessments. His mental abilities are above par, but like all Tigers, he sometimes waste precious time procrastinating. Still, he is rated as less temperamental than the other Tigers, as he can control his emotional urges and concent mouse on his endeavors.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD TIGER - 1914, 1974, 2034</span><br><br>This is a tolerant type of Tiger who evaluates situations in a practical and impartial light. He is democratic in his views and understands the importance of enlisting others' co-operation in order to advance more rapidly. He will attract a lot of friends and supporters, as he can mingle with people from all walks of life.<br>The Wood element gives him a more even and affable disposition, and his charming, innovative personality is very conducive to group efforts. He is sought after in polite society, and has the knack of bringing incongruous people together. But mostly his loyalty is to himself. No one is indispensable to him. If you quit the club, well, he will wish you good luck and waste no time replacing you.<br>The Wood Tiger is also inclined to be the least penetrating of the Tigers. He may prefer to scan the surface of things and maintain only the semblance of order. Actually, he lacks depth and permanent control. Adept at delegating chores and skillful at commanding and manipulating people into performing for him, he will take on a minimum amount of responsibility. As his lunar sign is not blessed with any great ability for self-discipline, he should not embark on more than he can handle. But it will be hard for him to admit his limitations, and Tigers of all colors do not take readily to criticism, no matter how constructive or kindly given.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE TIGER - 1866, 1926, 1986 </span><br><br>This type of Tiger finds it difficult to contain his enthusiasm and boundless energy. He is always ready for action and for going from one place to another. Transient by nature, he is most concerned with the present. He is independent and unconventional, and his moves are hard to predict. The only thing one can be sure of is that when he acts, he will be dramatic and influential. Fire makes him even more expressive than he already is. This Tiger never fails to impress anyone he is after or to transmit his electric vitality to any project he decides to undertake.<br>He seeks constantly to convert his nervous energy and inspirations into forceful action. At times, he is downright theatrical. Generous to the hilt, he will also display more leadership qualities than Tigers of the other elements. To him, everything he does is worthwhile and imperative, so don't try to tell him otherwise. He is a thoroughly optimistic soul and has no use for doomsday prophets.<br>Brilliantly commanding, imposing and open, the Fire Tiger is sensual and finds it hard ever to be impersonal about anything in his or her life.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH TIGER - 1878, 1938, 1998</span><br><br>This type of Tiger will possess a quieter and more responsible personality. He will look for feasibility in what he does; he will not jump to hasty conclusions and upholds equality and justice. Concerned about others and given to uncovering the truth himself, he is a mature and sensible in outlook.<br>This Tiger will be steadier than other Tigers as the Earth element gives him a longer attention span; this enables him to work diligently and objectively on important matters without getting restless. Although he may not be as brilliant and decisive as other Tigers, he is generally clear-headed and reasonable. He sees issues in their true light and rarely allows his emotions to cloud his vision.<br>He is also the type of Tiger most apt to form relationships on the basis of usefulness rather than personal or sexual attraction. He is an intellectual and more of a worrier than a daredevil. He applies his knowledge and capabilities to areas with which he is familiar and which will reap the largest harvest.<br>Sometimes he can become too proud, insensitive and callous, especially when he is so wrapped up with his own concerns that he cannot identify with anything outside the scope of his objectives.<br>The Earth Tiger is the least likely to go to the bohemian life, no matter what he may like others to believe. First, he will make it to the top. Then, when he has proven to society and the world that he has the ability and the genius, he may act in a radical, scandalous or unconventional way, just to be different or to be noticed, as all Tigers love to be. Nonetheless, he will always be serious about his work, as his native element makes him desirous of status and recognition through stability and labor.<br><br></div>

Let's just hope everything will be in the right proportions. If it is, there's no telling how far this fellow will go.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rooster - 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br><br>Fascinating personality. The troublemaker meets troubleshooter here. He won't let you get away with anything and he will insist on being heard - as if you were ever given any choice.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dog - 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.</span><br><br>Reasonable and more co-operative Tiger, resulting from the Dog's inherent common sense. His bullying tactics will be discouraged by the Dog's strict sense of fair play, but his tongue will be sharper than a razor.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Pig - 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. </span><br><br>Impulsive and naive. Happy and contented - so long as he gets what he wants. Could still turn vindictive under pressure, but you will find him going out of his way to please his family and friends.<br><br></div>
