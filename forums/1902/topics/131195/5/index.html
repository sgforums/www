Life will be hectic and punctuated with adventures. People will find themselves reckless, romantic and carefree. A definite time for advancement. We will find it quite agreeable to keep in step with the delightful Horse.<br><br>This will be a time when decision and projects will be incorporated at high speed and with efficiency. Action will be the key word. Everything is on the go and we should take care not to drive ourselvs too hard. It will be a rewarding but exhaustive year.<br><br>Exhilarating yet frustrating at times, this year's pace will tax our reserve energies and leave us feeling depleted. It is a good time for letting off steam and doing all the whimsical things you ever dreamed about. Listen to your senses. The wind may be changing constantly, but once you have picked up the scent, follow your intuitions.<br><br>Planning and procrastinating will be shoved aside. The impulsive influence of the Horse, coupled with his self-confidence, will dictate our actions and emotions. Industry, production and the world's economy will be on the upswing. Tempers, too, may be a bit frayed in areas of diplomacy and politics. But good humor will prevail.<br><br>Brace yourselves, the volatile Horse will quicken our pulses and bring tension and stress into our everyday lives. The Horse's tempo is fast, his disposition sanguine but erratic. But in spite of everything we will retain his common sense approach toward money matters. An excel- lent time to strike out on your own. There will be freedom of movement this year. Be brave, bold and shocking !<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Horse</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Horse Personality</strong><br><br>People born in the year of the horse are sanguine, sharp-minded, dress fashionably, gifted with a silver tongue, and have acute insight. But they fall in the snares of love easily, and break away from them lightly.<br><br>Most of the people born in the year of the horse leave their homes when they are young; those who stay at home start their careers early. They are vigorous and energetic. Their most striking point lies in their strong self-confidence, gentleness, and the ability to act as agents in financial transactions.<br><br>They do not adhere to old habits and like to show off. In dress, they usually select light colors and peculiar styles, gorgeous but vulgar when they take part in activities or parties.<br><br>They like to be engaged in intellectual activities and sports, and people can see this from their skillful actions, graceful posture, and eagerness while speaking. They react quickly and can decide promptly and opportunely. A person born in the year of the horse is generous, likes to join in fun, and are totally easy going persons. They are flexible, active and intelligent, and can usually control others.<br><br>However, they are impetuous and stubborn in temperament, and have fiery tempers. Most importantly, they cannot recognize their own weaknesses, and are therefore slow to change. They want others to work as quickly as they do, and if they fail to obtain satisfactory results, they are full of complaints and their faces become clouded. A person born in the year of the horse is always enormously proud of his own success, has many good ideas, and is good at solving knotty problems. He can achieve great success in dealing with chaotic matters. However, he usually feels satisfied and is intoxicated with the small achievements he has made. Moreover, he is often forgetful and absent-minded. Therefore, you should always supervise such a person and urge him on so that he will not become slack.<br><br>These people are self-centered and like to be surrounded and served by their relatives and friends. They can channel other people's thinking to their own by using excellent words. And they will not give up until they have poured out all their thoughts, dancing with joy.<br><br>People born in the year of the horse believe that their aim in life is to "seek individual freedom and happiness." If you happen to favor this creed, they will not stand at your side for they only believe in their own happiness. However, they are not greedy,selfish, or envious. They will only get angry, but never engage in intrigue or conspiracy when there is trouble on all sides.<br><br>Such people are not selfish about material matters. They do not make enemies of others intentionally, but others should not impose their opinions on them. They can scarcely wait when others do not comply with their acute thoughts and agile behavior. They may become excellent actors, but are not suitable to become teachers.<br><br>The contradictions in their temperament should be attributed to their changeable moods. They act according to their own intuitions. It is impossible to ask such a person to explain this, or to make a rational analysis of it. However, they can promote the further development of an activity by using their potential, which makes people gasp with admiration. They are often engaged in several activities at the same time, and are good at controlling situations. They put their plans into practice without hesitation once they have made up their minds. They either rush about to devote themselves to their careers, or they become extremely fatigued, and lie down.<br><br>It is difficult for a person born in the year of the horse to adapt himself to the schedule worked out by others, and they are too impatient to observe regulations. But they love stimulating jobs.<br><br>You should talk to such a person simply and clearly, otherwise he will not concent mouse on what you are saying. You should tell him directly whether a plan is feasible or not, and he will appreciate your sincerity and frankness. You should not suppress his emotions excessively, otherwise he will burst into anger, and leave the table or a meeting.<br><br>These persons are unwilling to be with people they dislike. They have their own ideas or thoughts, and it is difficult to make them submit to others. They also usually have a large circle of acquaintances and friends, and make new friends every day. But, they never rely on their friends too much.<br><br>They are always active in stirring up situations, and can bring about sunshine in winter.<br><br>They try to do things quickly, but lack persistence, and they cannot endure hardships over a long period of time. They are flexible, and can adapt themselves to circumstances. When meeting with others, they will not be as blunt as people born in the year of the dragon. For example, they will not visit you without notifying you in advance. On the contrary, they may send you a calling card first, or telephone you before visiting you at your convenience.<br><br>A woman born in the year of the horse likes to arrange all things in perfect order. She is so energetic that she would like to appear in ten different places simultaneously, if that was possible.<br>Her appearance, which may be like a lithe soap bubble, gives people fresh and bright feelings. Some of the women born in the year of the horse are gentle, while others are so arrogant and unyeilding that one can hardly control them. However, they can always win people's appreciation. Family is only a part of their social life, and a woman born in the year of the horse will not always stick to an old place over a long period of time.<br><br>She will have deep love for tender plants, natural scenery and pleasant sounds. She has unusual methods for entertaining, and her imagination and passion may be aroused by the roar of the waves and rustling of leaves. She will become overjoyed and full of eagerness when she throws herself into nature. If you fall in love with such a woman, remember not to shut her into your own little worlds.<br><br>People born in the year of the horse may be rich, but the property that they own is not safe as they do not worry about protecting it, and therefore they may lose a part of it. They spend extravagantly, and like to make fun of others, both of which are by-products of their imaginative nature. They like to make their marks in the world, and often take the lead when there is nobody else to take responsibility for a decision.<br><br>They are quite sensitive to crises of love, and will lose everything if disappointed in live. There are many things that they finish unhappily, and they may experience several broken marriages during their lives.<br><br>Those born in summer are usually more able to cope with their lives than those born in winter. When they are middle aged, which are their peak years, they will be capable and experienced, able to bear responsibilities, and scarcely ever fettered.<br></div>

(Many horse youngsters are also born left-handed.)<br><br>This child will tend to be disobedient, stubborn and willful when held back, but he is not the whinning, crybaby type.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Horse</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Horse</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL HORSE - 1870, 1930, 1990</span><br><br>A popular but peripatetic and unruly type of Horse. demonstrative, impetuous and bold, he will be a most engaging personality. He is highly amorous and very appealing to the opposite sex.<br>Gifted with a prolific mind and fine intuition, he can be extremely productive when he is positive. It would be difficult trying to keep up with him as he seems to be everywhere at the same time.<br><br>Blesses with strong recuperative powers, the Metal Horse is never out of action for long. He is constantly seeking excitement and climbing to breathtaking heights.<br>Metal will make this Horse more stubborn and self-centered than other types of Horses. He may be a proverbial bubbling stream filled with brilliant ideas but he is not a consistent administrator. If his work gives him no satisfaction, no fun, no rewarding stimulation, he will become irresolute and irresponsible. He cannot exist on a diet of daily routine. Nor can he function with someone glancing over his shoulder. He thirsts constantly for new experiences and challenges. When he is negative, he will have an irrational need for liberty and be unable to establish deep personal involvements for fear they may curtail his freedom or make demands on his time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER HORSE - 1882, 1942, 2002</span><br><br>A cheerful, dapper Horse with excellent business acumen, inordinately concerned with his own well-being, status and comfort. He is very adaptable to change and can make extensive adjustments without batting an eyelash.<br><br>This nomadic type of Horse could be more restless than the others. A travel bug and sports enthusiast, he won't let any grass grow under his feet.<br><br>He could also have the habit of changing his mind frequently and may take up an entirely different course of action without bothering to give any explanation. His mind and movements are guided by sporadic bursts of nervous but inspired action.<br><br>He will have a delicious sense of humor and can be very amusing when he wants to be. A smart and colorful dresser, he can discourse on any subject with anyone.<br><br>When he is negative, he is pretentious and inconsistent and can exhibit a deplorable lack of consideration for others. The Water Horse must develop long-range planning and dedication.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD HORSE - 1894, 1954, 2014</span><br><br>Friendly, cooperative and less impatient, this type of Horse could be the most reasonable of the lot. But he will still resist being dominated. The Wood element enables him to discipline his mind better and he will be capable of clear and systematic thinking. The Wood Horse will have a happy disposition and be very active in social affairs. Amusing and a good conversationalist, he is not overly egoistical and will not constantly vie for the headlines.<br><br>But, as he is progressive, modern and unsentimental, he will throw out the old and welcome in the new. Changes and new inventions capture his imagination and he will not shrink from trying the unconventional.<br><br>He will like to explore many other fields but will try hard to fulfill his responsibilities first. The strong, high-spirited and sanguine Wood Horse does not have a lazy bone in his body, but he would do well to learn to be more cautious and discerning.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE HORSE - 1906, 1966, 2026</span><br><br>A flamboyant and itinerant Horse with a superb intellect and great personal magnetism. He tries to bring about the changes he desires through force and sheer willpower.<br><br>This is a double Fire sign (Fire also being the Horse's fixed element), and it will produce a native who is highly excitable and hot-blooded.<br><br>The Fire Horse is easily distracted and is too inconsistent to stick to repetitive tasks. He has flair, wit and charm but his continuous stream of bright ideas makes him extremely volatile. His personality is many-faceted and he requires a great deal of spice and variety in his life. He is happiest leading a double or triple life or having several professions to his credit.<br><br>He will love to travel, anticipates action and change and works most efficiently when put in charge. He rarely accepts supervision from others, even his superiors.<br><br>The Fire Horse is a thrill-seeker. He can sort out and deal with all kinds of people and situations within a minute's notice. He is skillful at resolving sticky affairs but is not above being argumentative.<br><br>This type of Horse will have the gifts of ingenuity and resourcefulness but not perseverance.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH HORSE - 1918, 1978, 2038</span><br><br>A happy, congenial Horse; more precise and slow moving. He is apt to be more logical but less decisive. He likes to consider all sides of a question before acting.<br><br>With Earth as his element, he will be less abrupt. He can settle down and learn to toe the line when necessary. He offers less resistance to authority. Still, he is a finely tuned animal with an ability to sniff out feasible investments. He can bring shaky business back to life and give impetus to lagging industries.<br><br>Although he is the look-before-you-leap type, he is, nonetheless, very capricious about little things and will not make up his mind easily. He may hedge on one occasion and then take on more than he can handle on another.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Horse</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Horse and his Ascendants</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the mouse - 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.</span><br><br>A merry-making, more companionable Horse with the affectionate mouse in him. Both signs are good at acquiring and handling money.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Ox - 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.</span><br><br>A serious, perhaps even consistent Horse after the Ox gets through toning down his relentlessness. Could stick to one thing at a time and will not fall madly in love so easily.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Tiger - 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.</span><br><br>A good combination of daring and skill. The Tiger has the daring, the Horse the ability to steer out of trouble. Now, if only the doubting Tiger will follow the Horse's uncanny hunches.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rabbit - 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. </span><br><br>A Horse with a touch of moderation in his actions. His rich and sometime vulgar tastes will be reduced by the Hare's discerning preferences.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dragon - 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. </span><br><br>A race Horse who can't help winning or stop running for that matter. Too powerful for inexperienced hands to handle. He also has the tendency to overreact!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Snake - 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.</span><br><br>Let's hope the Snake can distill some of his wisdom into this Horse. The result will be that he may move slower but is more assured of success with the Snake's guidance.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Horse - 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</span><br><br>A thoroughbred who really knows his business. He may have a very restless and fidgety nature, but he moves with amazing grace. Bur he is also conceited and insufferably capricious.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Sheep - 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. </span><br><br>A Horse that is less boisterous, with some of the Sheep's harmonious and compassionate ways. Still flirtatious and fun-loving.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Monkey - 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. </span><br><br>A strong alliance of agility and wits. Both signs are egoistic and swift. He will always strike out for himself. A glib talker you will find hard to pin down.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rooster - 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br><br>A competent and perceptive Horse with an ultrasunny disposition. With the Roosters dauntless outlook on life, he will never feel the need to worry.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dog - 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. </span><br><br>A more faithful and honest Horse. But both signs here are practical, agile and mentally sharp; this may make him condescending, impatient and easily agitated.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Pig - 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. </span><br><br>A more steadfast and cooperative Horse with some of the Pig's sincerity. He may be less shifty but, at times, he is also too complacent.<br><br></div>
