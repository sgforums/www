The fickle-minded ways of the Horse may also make his love life turbulent.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Snake</strong></span><br><br><strong>Year of the Snake</strong><br><br>A year for reflection, planning and searching answers. A good time for shrewd dealings, political affairs and coups d'etat. People will be more likely to scheme and ponder over matters before acting on them. An auspicious year for commerce and industry.<br><br>Solutions and compromises can be arrived at, but not without some mutual distrust at first. The Snake likes to resolve his differences one way or another. If he fails and things cannot be peacefully settlked, then he will declare war.<br><br>Looking back into history, we find that the year of the Snake has nevever been tranquil. Perhaps this is becuase it is the strongest negative force in the cycle and it follows the Dragon year, which is the strongest positive one. Many disasters which had their beginning in the year of the Dragon tend to culminate in the year of the Snake. These two signs are very closely related and the calamities of the Snake yearsoften resulted from excesses committed during the Dragon's reign.<br><br>This will be a lively time for romance, courtship and scandals of all sorts. A good year to pursue the arts. Fashion will become more elegant and fluid; music and the theater will blossom; and people will strive for a more sophisticated life. Notable contributions will also be made by science and technology.<br><br>The venerable wisdom of the Snake will be evident in many facets of our life, particularly in those requiring decisions. Although everything may look refreshingly quiet ont he surface, the year of the Snake is always unpredictable. The Snake's cool and collected front hides the deep and mysterious ways of his nature. It should be noted that once the Snake uncoils to strike, he moves like lightning and nothing can stop him. Similarly, changes that occur during the Snake's year can be as sudden and devastating.<br><br>Tread lightly and be more cautious this year. Gambling and speculation is strictly taboo. The consequences will be overwhelming. The Snake is not merciful.<br><br>Whatever else happens, the Snkae will give us faith in our convictions and oerce us to act and to act forcefully during his reign. This is not a year for fence-sitters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Snake</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Snake Personality</strong><br><br>People born in the year of the snake may become philosophers, theologians, politicians, or cunning financiers. The snake is the most enigmatic of the twelve zodiac animals.<br><br>Such persons are elegant, and enjoy reading, listening to great music, tasting delicious food, and going to the theatre. They are fascinated with all beautiful things in life. Many of the most beautiful ladies and the men with strongest personalities were born in the year of the snake. Therefore, you should have good luck if you were born in that year.<br><br>A person born in the year of the snake usually acts according to his own judgment, and doesn't follow the views with others. He may be a religious believer or a pleasure-seeker. In either case, he would rather believe in his own conjectures than accept the advice of others, and he is generally right.<br><br>They are not annoyed by lack of money, and are usually lucky enough to own everything they need. If such a person is short of money, he can change the situation quickly. However, he shouldn't gamble, for he may lose everything he has. If he sustains great losses, he will soon come to realize his error and recover from it so that he will not be hit later. Generally, he will be cautious and alert when doing business.<br><br>These persons are oversuspicious, which is their nature. They hide their suspicions, acting as if nothing is on their minds. They are also generous with money. However, such a person may be famous for heartlessness. To realize an important goal, they may act to eradicate anyone who gets in their way, without any feeling of shame.<br><br>Some people born in the year of the snake may speak in a leisurely or listlessly way, but this does not mean that they are slow in thinking and action. They like to think deeply, plan carefully, and make a systematic and appropriate exposition of their views. They usually speak with great care.<br><br>A person born in the year of the snake often shows a strong desire for control when associating with others, and can be strict with them. To a certain extent, he will not trust his friends. He will never forgive anyone who breaks a promise. He easily becomes excessively nervous when he is frightened or feels doubtful about something.<br><br>When such a person is irritated, he will cherish a bitter hatred. However, he will act with such hostility in a secret way. He shows his resentment with ice-cold hostility instead of bitter words. Some of the people born in the year of the snake may strike their enemies a deadly blow.<br><br>A woman born in the year of the snake will be quiet, serene, and have an outstanding appearance. When you look at her carefully, however, you may find that she is not perfectly beautiful. If you look at her facial features separately, you may see that her nose can be too big, or her eyes too close. But she will be quite charming if you look at her in her entirety. She acts confidently and calmly. She often strolls sluggishly, which impresses people by her love of comfort, though, in fact, she is always busy thinking.<br><br>Such a woman likes to follow the fashion and be properly dressed. She loves treasures and jewelry. If she has enough money, she will buy the best and real diamonds, pearls, and other jewelry. You would best not give her gold-plating jewelry or replicas, for she may not accept your gift because it seems to be fake.<br><br>She is also strict in choosing friends. If she herself does not have power and money, which she advocates, she will often marry a rich and powerful man. As long as her husband has potential, she will try her best to help him to succeed. She acts as a perfect hostess when showing her husband how to make use of every opportunity in his life. With such guidance, support and devotion, the husband will have no choice but to try his best to climb the social ladder.<br><br>People born in the year of the snake usually have a sense of humor. In desperate situations, they can enliven the atmosphere with jokes and talk cheerfully and humorously even under great pressure. However, there are some exceptions. Some of these people are icy, some often ridicule others, and some are even grim.<br><br>Now you can see that it is not easy to deal with a person born in the year of the snake, especially when he thinks one way and behaves in another. There always lies an alert heart behind his serene appearance. He has a strong will, and will try his best to hold fast to his position. He is so cunning that when you think you may have seized him, he has already slipped away.<br><br>Chinese people believe that persons born in the spring or autumn of the year of the snake are the most formidable, while those born in winter are quiet and obedient, for a snake hibernates during winter. Those born in nice weather are happier than those born in terrible weather, and they feel content more easily.<br><br>A person born in the year of the snake is a passionate lover, who always makes eyes at persons of the opposite sex. You will make a mistake if you think that such a person is always in love, for they are sensitive toward and yearn for everything, and so their eyes shine with the enthusiasm of first love when they make a good deal.<br><br>People born in the year of the snake, especially those who like to be in the limelight and struggle for fame and gain, often lead turbulent lives that are full of passion, forcing them to rack their brains.<br><br>As the core force in disturbance and difficult situations, a "snake" will face danger fearlessly, and deal with unforeseen disasters. He has a strong sense of responsibility and clear goals. He may become most powerful if he combines his lofty ideals with inborn advantages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Snake</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Snake Child</strong><br><br>The Snake child is a complex personality. Quiet, alert and intelligent, he will have a serious nature and is inclined to be particular. Being the worrying type, he will take on a pensive outlook on life. He is studious and hard working in school and likely to be the teacher's pet. Do not spoil him; the Snake child will be all too aware of his charms. He can be sulky, vindictive and temperamental when not given his way.<br><br>Although secretive and brooding by nature, this child will be able to discipline himself. He makes up his mind easily about what he wants and will be very practical in setting his goals. You won't find him reaching for something he knows is unattainable. Persistent, realistic and unrelenting, he will stick to a task until he masters it.<br><br>Besides his natural aptitude for learning and a high I.Q., this child has the ability to keep his own counsel. He will not interfere with others and would prefer others to mind their own business, too. Careful and attentive, he knows how to keep himself out of trouble. HE may not be very outgoing but he makes long and lasting friendships.<br><br>A capable and meticulous planner, this child excels as a lader, as he will use his powers wisely and fairly. Other children will look up to him and support him. However, he could have ulterior motives for some of his actions. He is so intent on being first that he may not care what he has to do in order to be No. 1<br><br>His many talents and natural abilities will make him vastly sough after but he will also be the object of jealousy and vicious lies. He must learn to live with criticism and to bear the risks of being among the elite.<br><br>His reticent character makes him hide his pain; he is likely to hold grudges for a long time. He is often misunderstood because he refuses or fails to explain himself properly. His lines of communication with others are sometimes poorly connected.<br><br>Whatever happens, the Snake child will always strike out for himself. In life, he will know precisely how to use people and situations to his best advantage. There will be no holding him back; he is destined for fame and fortune.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Snake</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Snake</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL SNAKE - 1881, 1941, 2001</span><br><br>This type of Snake will be gifted with a calculating, intelligent mind and forceful willpower. Armed with discriminating tastes and a keen eye for locating opportunity, this Snake person can be a scheming loner. He likes to move quickly and quietly. He will establish himself in a solid position before you have a chance to stop him.<br>Metal combined with his native sign will make him crave luxury and easy living. Thus, he will devote himself to the pursuit of wealth and power. His vision is clear and farsighted and he will aspire to the best of everything.<br>The Metal Snake is also by far the most secretive, evasive and overconfident. Consequently, he often suspects others of hidden motives - sometimes to the point of paranoia.<br>In spite of his ability to wield power and influence, this Snake will have an envious steak in him and will try constantly to outdo the opposition, either by fair means or foul. He finds it hard to accept defeat or failure.<br>Possessive, domineering and, at times, strangely uncommunicative, he will mark out his path early in life and stick to it with dedication. He can be generous and cooperative with others, but always in a guarded sort of way.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER SNAKE - 1893, 1953, 2013</span><br><br>Just as water seeps through practically any barrier, so will a Snake born in its year wield encompassing influence through his profound insight.<br>This unassailable Snake is gifted with strong charisma and an inquisitive nature. Shrewd, business-minded and materialistic, the Water Snake possesses great mental abilities and powers of concentration. He can block out distraction, and brush aside unimportant issues for effective overall planning. He never loses sight of his goals or gets out of touch with reality.<br>Artistic and well-read, the intellectual Water Snake is also practical. He is adept at managing people as well as finances. While he may assume an unperturbed appearance, in actuality this particular Snake person has a long memory and harbors lifetime grudges. He could have the patience of Job combined with the bite of a King Cobra.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD SNAKE - 1905, 1965, 2025</span><br><br>An earnest Snake with kindly wisdom and a prophetic understanding of what is going to prevail in the course of events, especially in history.<br>He has a need for complete intellectual freedom, but in his affections he will be constant and enduring. He seeks emotional stability as well as financial security. This type of Snake will express himself well and could be an eloquent speaker.<br>The Wood element in conjunction with his fixed element of positive Fire will make him very interesting. He will shine like a beacon light, attracting instead of pursuing the objects and people he desires.<br>He will have expensive habits and could be vain about his personal appearance. Because he craves admiration and public approval, he will do his utmost to achieve lasting and large-scale success.<br>The Wood Snake is well-informed but he gathers knowledge not for its own sake but to put such information to everyday use. Good judgement, discretion and a sharp sense of values will make him a superb investor and appreciator of the fine things in life. Here is an amenable Snake who will be very close to art, music, the theater and the beauty of the Earth.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE SNAKE - 1857, 1917, 1977</span><br><br>An intense and masterful Snake. Active in mind and body, he performs energetically. Fire added to the already imposing Snake personality can give him great public appeal and charisma. He exudes confidence and the ability to lead. People will vote for this type of person if he chooses to go into politics.<br>Although he may hold open forums to solicit or assess the views of the majority, the Fire Snake is terribly suspicious by nature and has total faith only in himself. He is too quick to censure and to condemn. Sometimes he insulates himself with a closed circle of friends and advisors, thereby isolating himself without knowing it. His strong, almost maniacal desire for fame, money and power will make him insist on concrete results. Persevering and uncompromising, he sets his sights on the highest goals and once he gets to the top, he will cling to power indefinitely.<br>The Fire Snake is the most sensual, fervent and jealous kind of Snake. He will display excessive love or hate and be very preoccupied with himself.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH SNAKE - 1869, 1929, 1989</span><br><br>The warm and spontaneous variety of Snake who will form slow but correct opinions of people. More principled, persistent and reliable, the Earth Snake will be able to communicate with the public and function effectively in group activities.<br>Armed with a peripheral vision and basic Snake ambition, he can take control and bridge gaps during times of confusion and panic. He or she will not be easy to intimidate and may refuse to be influenced by the crowd. This Snake reserves the right to pass his own judgement.<br>By and large, this will be the most graceful and enchanting of all the Snakes. Cool, collected and immensely charming, he will be loyal to friends and have an army of supporters.<br>Conservative and frugal with money, the hard-working and systematic Earth Snake will succeed in banking, insurance and real estate investments and can reconcile his needs with his resources. Here is a Snake who knows his limits and who will be careful not to overextend himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rooster</strong></span><br><br><strong>Year of the Rooster</strong><br><br>The optimism of the Monkey year overlaps the year of the Rooster, but the Rooster tends to be overconfident and is prone to come up with nonsensical plans. While the colorful Rooster brings bright and happy days, he also dissipates energy. Better stick to pratical and well-proven paths. Forget about that controversial best seller you were going to write. No get rich quick schemes this year, please!"<br><br>It may require a greate deal of effort this year to resist going off on wild goose chases. Refrains from making speculative ventures. Disappointments and conficts will result. The Rooster likes to flaunt his authority and a lot of trouble can come from his domineering attitude. But since he also symbolizes the good administrator and conscientious overseer of justice in the barnyard, the peace wil still be kept. Everything will be precariously balanced in the Rooster's year, as his dramatic personality can set off all kinds of petty disputes.<br><br>This year we may have to expend maximum effort for minimum gain. Try not to fuss too much. Details do need looking into, but don't forget to view the whole picture. Be cautious. Do not aim too high. One is liable to get shot down.<br><br>Politics will adhere to hard-line policies. The diplomatic scene will be dominated by philosophical orators who rave a lot about nothing. Governments will be found flexing their muscles at each other, but just for show. There may be no real confrontations. It is just that everyone will be too occupied with himself to hear or care what the other person is saying.<br><br>The self-consious influence of the Roostser will cause us to take offense at the smallest slight. We will tend to be terribly ostentatious about the splendid image we think we project. Dissensions and debates on all fronts will signify the Rooster's penchant for argumentative exercises and will not be likely to do permanent damage to anyone when taken in the right context.<br><br>This will be a buoyant year in spite of the Rooster's knack for making simple things complicated. One thing is for sure: he sledom comes up empty-handed. This is the year of one very self-sufficient bird that will never go hungry.<br><br>Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut and check facts and figures before making unprecedented moves. We should all get by without too much hardship. Our pockets will not be empty although our nerves may be a bit frayed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rooster</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Rooster Personality</strong><br><br>People born in the year of the rooster usually are good looking and like to show themselves off. Instead of being idle, they always appear to be decent and shrewd in public, even the most timid one of them.<br><br>Gossips and more sensible observers (good at watching other people's expressions and weighing their words carefully) are two typical kinds of people born in the year of the rooster, both of whom are difficult to get along with.<br><br>But they also have some fine traits. For example, they are shrewd and earnest in fulfilling their duties, talented in doing organizational work, and frank. They are also bold enough to<br>point out and criticize other people's unhealthy activities. Yet inevitably these traits have bad effects, which make these people liable to find fault in others, to show off their intelligence without caring about the others' feelings, and to persist in their own viewpoint in disputes even after such a viewpoint has proven to be wrong.<br><br>In addition, they are excellent actors. In a happy mood and nimble manner, they are always radiant and attract others' attentions. They also usually take advantage of any chance to exaggerate their own adventures and achievements. With talent in speaking and writing, they are ever ready to deliver a speech on any topic, and will never give up in argument. So if you want to understand them better, you should tolerate their intrinsic contentiousness. No matter how difficult it may be for you to make concessions, you'd better control yourself, otherwise there will be a hot fight. But to do these people justice, we need to recognize that they are inwardly kind, though they appear to be outwardly contentious.<br><br>It is when they are in low spirits that they always wedded to their own ideas, denying any shortcoming they may have. Perhaps they don't intentionally mean to impose their viewpoints on other people, but they put them forward to indicate their own significance. Such obstinate confidence only prevents them from seeing themselves objectively and clearly realizing the harm they may be causing by flaunting and exasperation.<br><br>One of their strong points is their capability for managing money matters. They can always make ends meet by careful calculation and strict budgeting. If you're used to spending waste-fully, you might ask one of them to keep your money. He will surely help you design a strict financial budget and limit your unnecessary expenditures. With his help, your savings will accrue and your money will be spent in a more reasonable way.<br><br>Besides, they excel in housekeeping and tackling troublesome problems. But generally they lack originality, and though good at fulfilling assignments are not pioneers.<br><br>Sometimes they will spend extravagantly, but only for themselves. They like to design their offices, residences and themselves in a showy way so as to catch everyone's eyes, and they pay particular attention to their titles and awards, which they regard as manifestations of their greatness. Winning the love of the opposite sex and the favor of their colleagues are other reasons for them to spend money, in addition to decorating their homes.<br><br>Generally speaking, they are quite picky, always striving for perfection. They are reasonable, and are good observers of principles, often taking a dim view of those who try to push their way into the front of the line.<br><br>When they're too far away from their ideals, they will be quite disappointed. One of their shortcomings is their powerlessness in the midst of setbacks. So they should avoid splitting hairs or going up blind alleys, but should look for other ways to make a better living.<br><br>Things are quite different for women born in the year of the rooster. They are most devoted to their duties and seldom boast of their successes. They can do well in any social work, and their colleagues will be easily influenced by their exceptional vitality. Besides, they are patient and kind enough to do jobs that require carefulness and flexibility. They can be good teachers and good wives.<br><br>They are used to showing the utmost concern for other people, for perfection in things. They like to give instructions to people who have gone down the wrong path and can't tolerate their losing direction again. If their pride is hurt by others, they will not retort with bitter words; and if they have forgiven somebody, they won't harbor previous ills any longer.<br><br>They like to live in a simple and natural way, which is reflected not only in their dress but also in their work.<br><br>All people born in the year of the rooster have a good chance to achieve fame because of their competence in the work. They excel in winning their superiors' appreciation by wisdom and high efficiency. But they usually won't try their best to do things they are not interested in.<br><br>It's easier for them to gain fame and reward in ordinary posts than it is for others, so they'd better base themselves on ordinary work to fully manifest their capabilities, and they should act with caution in carrying out long-term plans.<br><br>They also need to temper their volatile dispositions in a rigorous and controlled manner so as to remain sober-minded and not involve themselves in disputes. They should listen to other people's opinions modestly to have an objective view of things.<br><br>They like flattery and seek the limelight. They are sensitive to criticism of themselves, and always try to defame their opponents instead of acknowledging their own faults.<br><br>They show much concern for their families, are gifted with vivid ideas, and have complete confidence in their own ability to achieve success in their work. But they can be dangerous to others because, full of sense of competition, they will drive their opponents into an impasse when they are ablaze with anger.<br><br>In a word, people born in the year of the rooster, are usually bloated with pride and are sure to leave a deep impression on others, whether one of respect or one of disgust.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rooster</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Rooster Child</strong><br><br>As a child the Rooster-born will be a self-starter. A good student, fast learner and industrious little soul, he or she will be forever poking around for answers. You can rely on him to pursue his studies, or anything else that attracts him, with self-generated zeal. It will be a joy to teach him, as he is sharp, intelligent and precise. He will have all the tendencies of a bookworm.<br><br>The Rooster child will be neat and orderly. He will do things in the proper sequence and is a creature of meticulous and exacting habits that will sometimes really annoy you. He won't be reticent about his opinions either--more of a wise guy around the house. Tough and well-disciplined, he will save the most pocket money among the children. He could be petty about minute discrepancies and will plan the simplest routine with military precision.<br><br>This child will probably be the most discriminating critic you can find for miles around. Be glad, even if it hurts to have your ego dented so often. This is because the Rooster is pure-minded and hates hypocrisy. His criticism and clinical observations will just be factual statements and he has no intention of offending you personally. Sometimes he is really astonished why you should get angry when he is trying so hard to point out all the relevant flaws to you. Then again, he really couldn't care less what others think of him. He has to speak his mind as his is a true independent spirit.<br><br>The Rooster child will be very demanding of his parents, but in turn he will be just as dependable when called upon to do his part. Not one to cry for help, he will detest weakness and dependency in others. If you are slipping, he will be the first to notice and call it up to your attention. He can't he;p it as this is just part of his nature. He tends to be bossy, too, so if you are not careful, your little child will soon be running your life.<br><br>Optimistic and dauntless, the Rooster will never change his course of action even if the whole world condemns him. You may have to watch helplessly as he rushes headlong off a cliff, as he won't take any advice once he has made up his mind. Just keep praying that some of his wild idealistic schemes work. He is never too practical when it comes to his own life. But one day, who knows, his unheard-of ventures may hit it big. Many millionaires were born in the year of the Rooster and they all have one other thing in common besides money--they were all eccentric.<br><br>What is more enervating is the fact that he will be completely blind to his own faults. Don't bother to debate with him; it will be a waste of time as he never admits he is wrong. His is the right way and no Buts about it!.<br><br>In short, the high-powered and resplendent Rooster will have many splendid talents (which no doubt he will carefully enumerate to you), but he carries with him a whole bag of idiosyncrasies, too. He will never take the middle of the road. With him, you either sink or swim. His simple " love me or leave " attitude means that if you wish to support him--you must be prepare to go all the way.</div>

Investigative, optimistic and idealistic, he will have a passionate attitude toward work.<br>Metal will make him opinionated and headstrong and he will have a strong need for importance and fame. He could be fastidious about his self-conceived image and cannot subscribe to the viewpoints of others readily. He has the gift of oratory, which he may use to drown out the voices of his opponents. Although he is factual and reasonable, he finds it hard to be totally impartial when his ego is directly challenged.<br>If he cannot relate well to others or make real efforts to compromise, his talents could be wasted and his genius will go a-begging. Overrationalizing and analyzing could be disastrous. When he is negative, he will even subject a blooming romance to a routine clinical examination. He should curb his urge to overkill.<br>The Metal Rooster could be inhibited with his emotions despite his outward bravado. He will insist on order in his life and will demand hygienic conditions or even sterile cleanliness in his surroundings.<br>But while this acquisitive Rooster is attracted to material wealth, he will also be concerned about social reforms. He will feel committed to extend his services and know-how to all humanity and will find fulfillment in solving social problems or instigating reforms for the advancement of mankind.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER ROOSTER - 1873, 1933, 1993</span><br><br>This is the intellectual type of Rooster who will employ cultural pursuits. He has tremendous energy and initiative at his disposal and will seek to use his resources or enlist the help of others to speed up progress.<br>With Water as his element, he will be given to clear thinking and practicality. You can reason with him, as he will be compliant when faced with insurmountable odds. He is not as austere or self-sacrificing as other Roosters.<br>Proficient in the use of the written word and a commanding speaker, the Water Rooster can sway the masses and incite willing action from others. He will have strong scientific leanings and will be interested in health, medicine and technology. His mind functions with computerlike efficiency and thus he could lose sight of the main issues when he overstresses details. Systems and procedures fascinate him and when he is obsessed with perfection he could be bureaucratic and trivial.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD ROOSTER - 1885, 1945, 2005</span><br><br>An expansive type of Rooster who can be more considerate of others and have a wider outlook on life. Although he is much less stubborn and opinionated, he still has the tendency to complicate matters and get caught in a maze of his own making. He should learn to contain his enthusiasm and to avoid overexerting himself and expecting everyone else to have the same stamina and devotion that he has. No matter how well meaning his intentions may be, prescribing unrelieved clockwork and regimentation may drive his subordinates crazy.<br>Wood makes him progress-oriented, and when Wood is matched with his virtuous qualities of honesty and integrity, he will excel in his performance and his charts and graphs will amaze everyone.<br>Open-minded, fair and sociable, he can give unselfishly of himself to the welfare of others. He will seek to contribute to or improve existing social conditions. Desirous of congeniality, he will seek close association with the people he works with and will have excellent record of reliability. Still, he will be basically a Rooster and he will not water down his biting comments when inflamed and will always work to protect his security. Life will be a dream for him if he does not take on too many high-flying projects all at the same time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE ROOSTER - 1897, 1957, 2017</span><br><br>Possibly a shooting star. With Fire as his element, this Rooster will be vigorous, highly motivated and authoritative. He will be able to operate independently and with great precision and skill, although he could also be temperamental, overdramatic and nervous at times.<br>Strongly principled and single-minded in his pursuit of success, he will display above-average managerial abilities and leadership. The diligent and intense Fire Rooster will abide fanatically by his own views and conduct his own fact-finding tours and feasibility studies. He will be unmoved and unswayed by the feelings or personal opinions of others, but he will be professional and ethical in his dealings.<br>At times, he is too inflexible to make workable compromises and will take to putting people and situations under a microscope for observation. If things do not measure up to his expectations, he could assume the role of an Inquisitor or cause major upheavals.<br>Yet he does have organization talents and in spite of his other shortcomings, this type of Rooster will have the noblest intentions behind his actions. He could project a stimulating and dynamic public image.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH ROOSTER - 1859, 1919, 1969</span><br><br>A studious, analytical and probing Rooster who will dig for the truth, mature early and compile his own irrefutable information. Earth ensures that he will be accurate, efficient and careful in carrying out assignments. He will know how to brush aside the trimmings and view the hard, cold facts for himself. With him, you will get the bottom line first.<br>Unafraid of shouldering vast responsibilities, he will still cling to his Rooster's reputation for not mincing words. He is unpretentious and dogmatic and will have strong missionary tendencies. He loves conducting sermon-on-the-mount sort of meetings, exhorting everyone to work harder and follow his shining example. He can lead a simple and austere existence when he finds his job rewarding. Fanatically systematic, he will keep notes, file data and record everything he does for posterity.<br>A hard taskmaster, strict educator and much dreaded critic, the Earth Rooster will sow and reap from dawn to sundown and have bushels and bushels of success to show for his effort if he can bring himself to be practical in his aspirations.<br></div>

The Chicken is more convivial and acceptable with the mouse in him. Still argues, but in a more pleasant manner.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Ox - 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.</span><br><br>The Ox, with his hooves firmly planted, could bring the flighty Chicken down to earth. But both signs crave authority and can be harsh when given absolute powers. Type that could use a sledgehammer to kill a fly.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born during the Hours of the Tiger - 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.</span><br><br>Magnetic but a bit incoherent by nature. Could blow hot and cold in the same breath. The Rooster's analytical qualities may be swamped by the Tiger's impervious ways. Result is more misplaced self-confidence than normal.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Rabbit - 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.</span><br><br>A quiet, efficient bird who always manages to get his worm. A Rooster less likely to cause trouble, but an expert at bluffing.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dragon - 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.</span><br><br>A Rooster who will not let you usurp one iota of his power. The Dragon within makes him ultra-assertive, fastidious and fearless. Will mow down the opposition with the finesse of a bulldozer.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Snake - 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.</span><br><br>A wise and wiry fowl. The Snake makes him aloof and secretive. This Chicken may even learn to mind his own business and keep his opinions to himself.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Horse - 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</span><br><br>A nifty, practical Rooster with fast and sharp reflexes. Both signs here have colorful and flamboyant tastes, but the Horse could teach the Rooster not to waste time on unfeasible ventures. Result is that his pursuits could pay higher dividends.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Sheep - 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.</span><br><br>An amiable, less assertive and bashful Rooster. The Sheep's coyness could mellow the Rooster's brash ways. A good thing after all.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of Monkey - 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.</span><br><br>A crafty but congenial Rooster, who is more purposeful and adept at making conciliatory deals. A happy-go-lucky, successful and plucky Chicken.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of Rooster - 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</span><br><br>A double dose of meticulous efficiency and criticism that few can swallow. Likely to be very notable, highly eccentric and overly particular. He will be in a class of his own.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Dog - 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.</span><br><br>A calculating, erratic but fair Rooster. The Dog makes him less cocky and opinionated. Still, you must expect great color from this combination of two equally idealistic minds and sharp tongues.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Born During the Hours of the Pig - 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.</span><br><br>A complacent Rooster who will insist on helping you whether you like it or not! His brilliance may be on the surface and he is a social butterfly, but then he is unselfish and quite incapable of dishonesty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Sheep</strong></span><br><br><strong>Year of the Sheep/Goat</strong><br><br>This is a smooth year following that of the energetic Horse. A year to relax and make peace with oneself as well as with others. Things progress slwly and we find ourselves more sentimental and emotional. The Sheep's influence will draw us closer to home an dour families. We find ourselves caring more about those close to us and being more liberal with our time and money.<br><br>Patron of the arts, the Sheep will bring out all the creativeness in our natures. We will be productive and imaginative in artistic and aesthetic ventures. The pessimistic vibrations cast by him will also make us oversensitive and fretful of little problems. In our undertakings, we may beocme easily discouraged or hypercritical when things are not to our liking.<br><br>On the world scene, things will be tranquil and subdued. Take time off to cater to your whims and fancies. Make new friends and travel; invest in art and antiques. But keep a tight hand on your purse string, too, as there could be repercussions caused by overpsending.<br><br>Hopefully, the Sheep's love of harmony and keen ense for coexisting with his enemies will preserve this year from many upheavals. The moderates and doves will be heard and heeded. Wars, international conflicts and mutual animosities usually end in the year of the Sheep.<br><br>The serenity of the Sheep's peaceful ways will slow things down a bit for the more intensely active signs, but after all, this is not a year for whirlwind activities--it is one for introspection.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Sheep</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Sheep/Goat Personality</strong><br><br>It is lucky that the sheep is ranked eighth in the series of Chinese zodiac animals, for the number "eight" in China is an auspicious one, symbolizing peace and prosperity.<br><br>Generally speaking, people born in the year of sheep are generous, just and kind, and easily touched by other people's misfortunes. They are meek, and somewhat timid by nature. When everything goes extremely smoothly in their lives, they appear graceful, if they are artists, and are creative, if they are workers. If something goes especially wrong in their careers or other aspects of life, they will become very sentimental and pessimistic, even world weary.<br><br>Behaving gracefully and kind-heartedly, they are always respected and admired by others. They are used to guiding their own conduct by liberal rules as well as treating others with leniency. Besides being good housekeepers, they are also fond of children and pets. Though mild in disposition, they never yield under pressure. It is impossible to force them to do something. When coerced, they will behave in an intransigent way; and when challenged in an argument, they will remain silently anger rather than repeat their opinions or show their displeasure.<br><br>Pure and kind as they are, they are always ready to help others who are in need of care or money. Throughout their lives they never worry about the three necessities: food, housing and clothes. Wherever they go, they will make friends with other people, and they will treat their colleagues honestly. Those born in the year of sheep are destined to have good marriages. They will be loved not only by their spouses, but also by family relatives.<br><br>It is said people born in the winter of the year of sheep will go on rough and rugged paths throughout life, for winter is a season without the green grass that sheep to live on. Actually, whatever adversity they find themselves in, they needn't be too worried, for other people are always willing to help them. Even when they are in abject poverty they can survive on material donations from their parents or relatives, or through social protection and promotion from the rich and powerful. In all, people born in the year of the sheep can easily get out of difficulties and failures with the help of others who love them.<br><br>They like to do things that they are interested in, and realize their dreams in a natural way. When there's something they are unwilling to do, they always refuse with the greatest gentleness and patience. No one knows their true feelings on such occasions, unless they are in rage. As a matter of fact, they are good at settling disputes and creating a harmonious atmosphere around themselves.<br><br>They seldom speak in a straightforward way, especially the less well-bred ones among them, which often annoys other people. Never count on them to pour out everything on their minds at once. People must get to know them little by little. In order to encourage them to say more, people should nod from time to time to show their agreement, and always leave some leeway out for them.<br><br>It's best for people born in the year of sheep to cooperate with someone who has a strong character. Only under strict working rules and the leadership of hard-minded colleagues, can they make full use of their abilities and work efficiently. So it's best to help them get rid of their "dependent mentality."<br><br>They like to live within their usual circle. They attach great importance to their families, favorite foods, birthdays and other festivals. They usually celebrate such special occasions in a showy way, and they are extremely serious about their own birthdays. They may feel heart-broken if they get no congratulations from others.<br><br>It seems that people born in the year of sheep are melancholy and sentimental by nature. They always look upon the world passively. Besides, they are used to counting on others to cheer them up. it is easy for them to get lost and to be blue when frustrated, and to make improper choices when going shopping.<br><br>Young women born in the year of sheep like to appear sharp. They have a special interest in clothes with ruffles and ornaments. Every day they spend much time in making themselves up. They always behave in an elegant and orderly way. Besides, they like to decorate their rooms with fresh flowers, which adds to their beauty and vigor. The middle-aged women born in the year of the sheep pay great attention to personal sanitation. They are always neatly and well dressed.<br><br>Young women born in the year of sheep like to express their love for their sweethearts in a front way. They trust the men they love, and they want to stay with them every second. To those pursuers in whom they have no interest, they will pay no attention. When someone happens to hit their fancies, they will shake hands with them without any seductive behavior. When they talk, sometimes they will mean "no" by saying "yes," and "yes" by saying "no."<br><br>People born in the year of sheep are good at covering up their own weakness with petty shrewdness, and in obtaining what they want by clever tricks and hints. They are also talented in the skill of pestering. Their sincere and composed manner and their pitiful looks always prove effective in persuading other people to do them favors.<br><br>They never hurt the feelings of their friends. Sometimes they even give up taking part in social contacts in order to avoid disputes. They are sensitive, and often indulge themselves in sentimental illusions rather than jolly parties. They also like to attract others' attention and flattery regarding their talent. They would be wise to take up professions that enable them to use their strong points. Often doing some down-to-earth job is the best choice for them.<br><br>If they're not born during hours dominated by zodiac animals such as dragon, snake or tiger (every two hours of a day is dominated by a different zodiac animal according to the traditional Chinese timing system), they will not be qualified for jobs requiring a strong sense of responsibility and quick decisions. They may do jobs allowing them to have their own way within the bounds of law.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Sheep</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Sheep/Goat Child</strong><br><br>The gentle Sheep child will be a treasure to his parents. He will love being cuddled, fussed over, petted and thoroughly spoiled. A sensitive artist and lover of beauty, he will appreciate music, poetry, sweet-smelling soap for his bath and all sorts of delicate trimmings that stimulate his fine senses. Ultradependent, he won't like to do anything for himself-- if he can help it. Warm, soft, vulnerable and submissive, he likes being catered to.<br><br>Like little Linus in the Peanuts comic strip, he is most likely to cling to his old woolen blanket or, in case of a girl, her worn-out rag doll. He hates being teased and if strongly criticized or embarrassed in school, he may not want to return for many days. He will seek out more dominant youngsters to take him under their wings. When he is feeling down, he will need loads and loads of sympathy to pep him up. His fertile imagination and morbid fears can actually make him ill. He can be easily influenced or adversely affected and will positively drown you with his sorrows when he is in a melancholy mood.<br><br>When ridiculed or rejected, he can withdraw into a magical world of his own and it will be difficult to lure him out. Food and comfort represent love and security to him. The Sheep will be in no hurry to leave home if he is loved and well cared for. When he does decide to set up housekeeping on his own, you can be sure he will do it with exquisite taste. He loves getting dressed up and has a flair for arranging things. Fickle-minded, inconsistent and trivial at times, he makes up for it by being extremely creative, modest and patient. He is very compassionate about the sorrows of others; when he is fond of someone, his love and generosity know no bounds. It will be rewarding to care for him as he will repay your affections a hundredfold. It will be impossible to be cross with him for long. He may have his flaws, but he is still a jewel of the highest quality.<br><br>Don't be afraid of leading him by the hand or helping him make decisions. He will never get enough reassurance and, as a master of fact, he may seek his parents' advice or approval on everything he does.<br><br>Don't try to wipe the fairy dust off his eyes; or change him, mend him or rearrange him into sterner stuff. It will be useless, as the Sheep will always see life and the world through rose-colored glasses.</div>
