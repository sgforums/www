            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>The Chinese zodiac</strong></span><br><br>The <strong>Chinese animal signs</strong> are a 12-year cycle used for dating the years. They represent a cyclical concept of time, rather than the Western linear concept of time. The Chinese Lunar Calendar is based on the cycles of the moon, and is constructed in a different fashion than the Western solar calendar. In the Chinese calendar, the beginning of the year falls somewhere between late January and early February. The Chinese have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year. Many Chinese calendars will print both the solar dates and the Chinese lunar dates.<br><br>The twelve zodiac animal signs (shengxiao) are, in order, the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep (or goat), monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.<br><br><strong>Legend</strong><br><br>According to Chinese legend, the twelve animals quarreled one day as to who was to head the cycle of years. The gods were asked to decide and they held a contest: whoever was to reach the opposite bank of the river would be first, and the rest of the animals would receive their years according to their finish.<br><br>All the twelve animals gathered at the river bank and jumped in. Unknown to the ox, the rat had jumped upon his back. As the ox was about to jump ashore, the rat jumped off the ox's back, and won the race. The pig, who was very lazy, ended up last. That is why the rat is the first year of the animal cycle, the ox second, and the pig last.</div>

It will be marked by speculation and fluctuations in the prices of commodities and the stock market; the world economy in general will boom.<br><br>Business will be be on the upswing, fortunes can be made and it will be an easy time to accumulate wealth. However, this is also the time to make long-term investment plans as the bonanza the year of the Rat brings will serve to see us through the bleak years that may follow.All ventures begun at this time will be successful if one prepares well. But do not take chances or unnecessary risks: the year of the Rat is still ruled by the cold of winter and darkness of night. Those who speculate indiscriminately and overextend themselves will come to a sad reckoning.<br><br>On the whole, this will be a happier year than most; free from explosive events and wars and with far less catastrophes than, say, the years of the Tiger or the Dragon.<br><br>Nonetheless, it will be spicy. It promises a lot of bickering, bargaining and petty arguments that will do little harm. A congenial time that will find most of us socializing and enjoying ourselves.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rat</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Mouse/Rat Personality</strong><br><br>The mouse is one of the animals that are found all over the world. It has good vitality and gives people the impression that it is smart,nimble and filled with enterprising spirits.<br><br>People born in the year of the mouse share some of the characteristics of a mouse. They are optimistic,cheerful, do not fall into low spirits no matter how hard the circumstances,and will fight for their lives. At the same time, they are sensitive like a mouse, and have good intuition and imagination, but they are not good at logically drawing their own conclusions.<br><br>Viewed from appearances, people born in the year of the mouse are reticent persons, but actually they are not. They are easily worked up, but they can control their spirits. This character allows them to have lots of friends.<br><br>People born in the year of the mouse are usually optimistic, cheerful and easy to get along with. Sometimes you may find a person born in the year of the mouse to be critical, complaining and fault finding. But generally speaking, people born in the year of the mouse are easy to get along with. You can find them in circles of close friends and they are usually very friendly.<br><br>People born in the year of the mouse treasure their relationships with friends and relatives. Sometimes you will find that they connect their lives closely to those of others. This is because once they like somebody, they can't bear to leave them.<br><br>People born in the year of the mouse have a natural instinct for loving money. A boss born in the year of the mouse will care for his employees. He makes sure his employees participate sufficiently in sports and that they maintain a balanced diet. When his employees are sick, he will go to see them. He takes the troubles of employees as his own. But things change as soon as his employees want to talk about raising their wages. Then he becomes a miser. If you want to get money from the person born in the year of the mouse, you will need to bargain with him very hard.<br><br>A woman born in the year of the mouse is usually surprisingly frugal. She buys second-hand goods, splits one meal into several, and cuts down on expenses. Of course, if there is real need for money, she will not be stingy.<br><br>Sometimes, people born in the year of the mouse live in groups. They don't care if there is another mouth to feed. They will let friends or relatives live in their homes, but they can always find something for them to do. They even let lazy-bones and beggars move in and they provide work for them to do in their houses.<br><br>People born in the year of the mouse are able to keep secrets, but they enjoy finding out the secrets of other people. They may use such information as a weapon and are not satisfied until they have achieved someone's destruction. They seek loopholes without feeling shame. In a word, they lose no chances.<br><br>Since such a person tries his best to hide his feelings, when his mood changes he will be confused, and not always know why he is angry or worried. The cause may be just because people born in the year of the mouse are active and diligent. They would be unhappy and angry about other people's laziness and waste.<br><br>The character of people born in the year of the mouse has its positive and negative side. They are too particular about trifles, criticize others too much and bargain too much. They usually buy things that they don't really need. They are often cheated by others. They also keep many mementos in their rooms, and keep distressed memories in their hearts. Maybe this is because of their desire to accumulate. Although they are willing to poke their noses into other people's business, they mean good.<br><br>People born in the year of the mouse have good memories. They like to ask questions and have keen insights. Such a person knows almost everybody and keeps everything around them in mind. Others take it for granted if a person born in the year of the mouse becomes an excellent writer.<br><br>People born in the year of the mouse can succeed in everything because they are as clever as mice. They are able to overcome all kinds of difficulties, and face dangers fearlessly. Because of their cool and quick-witted minds, their keen insight and deep understanding of life, defeats in life sharpen their minds and make them out of ordinary.<br><br>There is no need to worry about the security of the person born in the year of the mouse. Before he will make any deal, he will leave a way out for himself. In times when things out of the ordinary happen he can overcome trouble almost immediately. An instinct for protecting himself takes the most important place in his heart. Usually his plans take little risk. So if you want to avoid trouble, follow the advice of a person born in the year of the mouse.<br>Main stumbling block standing in the way of such persons is their wild ambitions. They want to do too many things at the same time, and so they diffuse their energies. If they are able to develop their strong points and avoid their weak points, they will gain great success. Although people born in the year of the mouse are able to foresee dangers, their fondness for bargaining may cause them to draw wrong judgments, and even fall into traps. If they can overcome their greed and be self-restrained, their lives may become plain sailing. But before they realize that greed will do more harm than good, they may suffer at least one disaster of losing a large sum of money. Yet they will not become penniless because they will extricate themselves from such a difficult position.<br><br>Among the "twelve animals," the mouse is the most sentimental. So he is not only attached to his children but also to the elder members of his family. Children born in the year of the mouse are considerate towards their parents, trust their parents and forgive any mistakes of their parents. A mother born in the year of the mouse is a good house-wife and can help her husband's work a great deal. However she will spoil her children and will pay too much attention to her husband.<br><br>There is an important factor that affects the character of the people born in the year of the mouse. That is the time of day in which they were born. People born in zi shi (from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. the next day) can be pretty and attractive, but are a little bit arrogant. Those born during chou shi (from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.) are slow to action but serious. Those born in yin shi (from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m.) are imperious and bellicose. Those born in mao shi (from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.) are gentle. Those born in the chen shi (from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.) are natural and graceful. Those born in si shi (from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.) do not show their feelings. Those born in wu shi (from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.) are full of energy. Those born in wei shi (from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.) are always sentimental and calculating. Those born in shen shi (from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.) are smart and active. Those born in you shi (from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.) are capable and can overestimate their own strength. Those born in xu shi (from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.) are frank and irritable. Those born in hai shi (from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.) are cheerful and look backward and forward. Generally speaking, people born in the night are more hearty than those born in daylight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rat</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Mouse/Rat Child</strong><br><br>A child born in the year of the Rat will be sweet and loving. he may be shy, but inwardly he is fiercely competitive. Often, he resorts to crying to get more attention and usually clings to one or two people with whom he identifies. Although he has a charming disposition, he is possessive of parents and friends and jealous of attention given to others.<br><br>He will talk early. He likes to eat (mention of his favorite foods always makes him light up) and he takes an early interest in cooking and other household chores. Being affectionate and demonstrative, he will not like being left alone. He will enjoy group play, can concentrate on detailed work and make friends easily. You can depend on him to keep things tidy or at least know where they are.<br><br>The Rat child will start to show his calculating nature very early in life. He will insist that he get the bigger half of the apple, exactly the same number of cookies as his older brother (preferably more, but under no circumstances less). It will be hard to cheat him on anything. He learns fast and never misses a trick. He takes regular stock of his possessions-- so don't try to give away any of his old toys thinking he won't miss it. Then again, if you consult him, be prepared for a struggle as the selfish little Rat won't part with anything easily.<br><br>With younger children, the Rat child will tend to be motherly; at his worst, he will boss them around mercilessly. Give the proper encouragement, he will be ambitious in school. He will be most eager to participate in anything that stimulates his sharp mental powers.<br><br>The vivacious Rat will be an avid reader. He will learn the importance of the written word easily and be able to express himself well. Many of the world's greatest writers and historians were born in the year of the Rat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Rat</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Five Types of Mouse</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">METAL mouse - 1840, 1900, 1960</span><br><br>This type of mouse is most likely to be idealistic in thought, vivid in speech and actions and intensely emotional. He may cover up his feelings by presenting himself as a happy and charming personality. In reality, he is easily moved to jealousy, anger, selfishness and possessiveness.<br>His outlook will be based on what his senses can appreciate. He loves money but will not hoard it and won't mind spending if he can get good value and quality. He knows how to invest wisely. He will not be as romantic as the mouses of the other elements but could be sensual and moralistic at the same time.<br>He likes to impress and his home will be as splendidly decorated as he can afford. He loves drama and pageantry and has classic tastes. He will probably be athletically inclined. If he curbs his domineering tendencies, he will succeed in making himself known and liked by all the right people. Basically, he is a mouse who will advance himself by getting into influential circles.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER mouse - 1852, 1912, 1972</span><br><br>This type of mouse is more concerned with mental exercise, the intricacies of the thinking process. His insight is excellent and he relates well to people of all levels. He will be respected and able to promote his talents because of his accommodating and understanding nature. He is traditional and conservative in his behavior, preferring to swim with the tide rather than fight it. Still, he is calculating and shrewd. A person born under this combination will manifest all the qualities needed to wield influence in areas he deems important. He is aware of other people's likes and dislikes and knows how to please those in a position to help him. However, he may not be too discriminating and tends to speak to anyone who cares to listen. This might get him into trouble.<br>Drawn to the acquisition of knowledge and the written word, and being adept at putting down his thoughts on paper, this mouse will work to further his own education and will never want to stop learning.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WOOD mouse - 1864, 1924, 1984</span><br><br>A progressive, success-oriented and very amicable type of mouse, he will try to explore everything and will find good use for almost anything he comes across. He has a very good comprehension of how the System works, and he can make it work for himself. He is farsighted and always concerned about finding out the whys and the wherefores. Although he is egotistic, he makes himself agreeable and is quite thoughtful of others because he seeks their admiration and approval.<br>He has his principles and knows what he wants. He is strict with priorities, but he can be flexible in order to achieve his aims. He loves security and is always worried about his future, which is one reason why he works so hard.<br>Outwardly, he exudes self-confidence and know-how and is probably very professional about what he does and a good talker. He can promote ideas and projects capably and will have little difficulties in drumming up support for his ventures.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FIRE mouse - 1876, 1936, 1996</span><br><br>This is a chivalrous and dynamic mouse who loves getting involved in all sorts of activities and never tires of embarking on new campaigns for justice and a better deal. He is open and aggressive by nature but could also be a more generous type of mouse.<br>Although he is energetic and idealistic, he lacks a sense of diplomacy and may be too blunt at times to win the support he requires. A not too well-disciplined fellow, he will follow the dictates of his heart more often than his head. As much as he is devoted to his home and family, he may still take off wherever he feels too hemmed in and head for the open country.<br>He is independent and very, very competitive. But since he will not be content to maintain a simple middle-of-the-road existence, his fortunes may change often and sometimes quite drastically if he is too impatient.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EARTH mouse - 1888, 1948, 2008</span><br><br>This type of mouse will mature early; for him happiness and contentment is found in order, discipline and security. He will strive to develop his positive traits and be recognized for his talents. He is a very realistic and not at all given to flashy dreams and expectations.<br>He likes to maintain good relations with everyone and prefers to work in one place or job for a long time where he will have good and loyal friends. He can zero in on one subject at a time and is thorough in his work. On the darker side, he can also be too achievement conscious, self-righteous and intolerant with others, especially if he is in too much of a rush to get things done exactly to his specifications.<br>He cares a great deal for his reputation and public image, but is warm and protective towards those he loves. He has high material standards and is always comparing his degree of success with his contemporaries. This type could become overpractical and stingy with money.<br>He never gambles and rarely takes chances. As a result, this mouse's fortunes will increase slowly but surely. He sticks to proven rules and modes of operation and usually expects those who work with him to do the same.</div>
