            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Ginseng </strong><br>Ginseng is probably the most famous chinese herb. It has been used in Asia for more than 5,000 years. In China, ginseng has been treasured since the dawn of written history. In the Qing Dynasty of ancient China, ginseng was prized more than gold.<br><br>Ginseng is available in literally thousands of tonic formulations and it is featuring the most of the traditional preventative herbal remedies. Many people seeking to improve energy and vitality use ginseng daily.<br><br>Ginseng requires about six years to mature, but it is difficult and expensive to grow. Its value is found in its stained root which contains a complex mixture of carbohydrate compounds, nitrogenous compounds, fat-soluble compounds, vitamins and minerals. The curative powers of ginseng are unique in the way they affect the whole body. Ginseng has also been recognized as a potent immune system tonic by modern researchers.<br><br>There are several types of ginseng available: Asian ginseng, also called panax ginseng, American ginseng, Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus), and Japanese ginseng (Panax japonicum). Panax ginseng, which is grown especially in Korea, China and Japan, is the most widely used. American ginseng grows commonly in wooded areas from Quebec to Minnesota and south to Georgia and Oklahoma. Siberian ginseng grows in forests of Russia, China, Korea, and Japan.<br><br>Only Asian and American ginseng are known for their exceptional curative properties. These two species of ginseng look very similar and have also similar chemical compositions. These days, North American Ginseng is cultivated in British Colombia, Ontario, and Wisconsin, and is a valuable export. North American ginseng is often considered the most valuable and beneficial.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Cordyceps<br>Cordyceps is one of the most rare and treasured herbs, and it has been an important ingredient in Chinese medicine for thousands of years. It can be found on isolated places in southwestern China, especially in the provinces of Tibet, Sichuan, Qinghai, Guise and Yunnan, in locations over 3,500 metres.<br><br>Cordyceps is primarily collected wild, as the grown cordyceps is of lower quality, but the wild cordyceps is usually very expensive and costs up to $1000 for 100 grams. Wild cordyceps from Tibet is supposed to be the best in the world.<br><br>Scientific research has proven that wild cordyceps is richer in certain components, and also that the proportions of its ingredients are different from the cultivated herb, and this might make some differences in the activity. Nevertheless, cultivated Cordyceps is still a premium and valuable tonic herb.<br><br>Cordyceps became famous because of its powerful aphrodisiac effects. Recent studies performed at Beijing Medical University of China and in Japan have shown a 64% success rate among men suffering from impotence, vs. 24% in the placebo group.<br><br>In the ancient China, cordyceps was highly recommended as one of the most effective medicines for all illness. Due to its anti-aging and cure-all properties, it can be compared to ginseng, reishi and deer velvet. In general, cordyceps is a tonic that help the body build strength, improve the organic functioning, strengthen the immune system and bring longevity.<br><br></div>
