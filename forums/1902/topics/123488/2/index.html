Nor am I being calculating or stingy. But I believe in order to make this forum works for a longer time, we all need to cooperate. This forum will only work based on the give-and-take attitude. There is a limitation to the number of songs I can offer, so I do still need help from all of you out there.<br><br>So first, please do make sure that you at least make a sincere effort to share your files. I have seen some of you(I am going to refrain from naming names here) who took the files from this forum and bringing them to another forum as to get more songs from other people. And I have noticed that in a way you are sharing your songs over at another forum, but you can't make an effort to share them over here where we have given you a lot. And mind you, this is not just a few files, this is a request for a huge bulk of files.<br><br>As a mod, I feel compelled to urge you to at least try to share sincerely. Dun do it just because I said this, or because you are looking for more songs to get in return. Do it out of your own willingness okie, dun you think it is fun to share something that you think is good? I have said what I need to say, if there are still people who refuse to at least try to do this, it is very sad but I will have to disappoint you on some of your requests.

And I have noticed that in a way you are sharing your songs over at another forum, but you can't make an effort to share them over here where we have given you a lot. And mind you, this is not just a few files, this is a request for a huge bulk of files.<br><br>As a mod, I feel compelled to urge you to at least try to share sincerely. Dun do it just because I said this, or because you are looking for more songs to get in return. Do it out of your own willingness okie, dun you think it is fun to share something that you think is good? I have said what I need to say, if there are still people who refuse to at least try to do this, it is very sad but I will have to disappoint you on some of your requests. Thanks for reading.<br><br>i.c.y<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>did u mean me in your rules up there,<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>you see, that is the rules in our forum. Both of us have agreed that the forum can only survive if everyone chip in a bit at a time, because even tho we have a large collection of songs, we do still need help and contributions from others.
