              <p><em>Tuesday, June 16, 2009</em><br><br>Same-sex behavior is a nearly universal 
              phenomenon in the animal kingdom, common across species, from worms to frogs to 
              birds, concludes a new review of existing research. <br><br>"It's clear that 
              same-sex sexual behavior extends far beyond the well-known examples that 
              dominate both the scientific and popular literature: for example, bonobos, 
              dolphins, penguins and fruit flies," said Nathan Bailey, the first author of the 
              review paper and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biology at UC 
              Riverside. <br><br>There is a caveat, however. The review also reports that 
              same-sex behaviors are not the same across species, and that researchers may be 
              calling qualitatively different phenomena by the same name. <br><br>"For 
              example, male fruit flies may court other males because they are lacking a gene 
              that enables them to discriminate between the sexes," Bailey said. "But that is 
              very different from male bottlenose dolphins, who engage in same-sex 
              interactions to facilitate group bonding, or female Laysan Albatross that can 
              remain pair-bonded for life and cooperatively rear young." <br><br>Published 
              June 16 in the journal Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution, the review by Bailey 
              and Marlene Zuk, a professor of biology at UCR, also finds that although many 
              studies are performed in the context of understanding the evolutionary origins 
              of same-sex sexual behavior, almost none have considered its evolutionary 
              consequences. <br><br>"Same-sex behaviors—courtship, mounting or parenting—are 
              traits that may have been shaped by natural selection, a basic mechanism of 
              evolution that occurs over successive generations," Bailey said. "But our review 
              of studies also suggests that these same-sex behaviors might act as selective 
              forces in and of themselves." <br><br>A selective force, which is a sudden or 
              gradual stress placed on a population, affects the reproductive success of 
              individuals in the population. <br><br>"When we think of selective forces, we 
              tend to think of things like weather, temperature, or geographic features, but 
              we can think of the social circumstances in a population of animals as a 
              selective force, too," Bailey said. "Same-sex behavior radically changes those 
              social circumstances, for example, by removing some individuals from the pool of 
              animals available for mating." <br><br>Bailey, who works in Zuk's lab, noted 
              that researchers in the field have made significant strides in the past two and 
              a half decades studying the genetic and neural mechanisms that produce same-sex 
              behaviors in individuals, and the ultimate reasons for their existence in 
              populations. <br><br>"But like any other behavior that doesn't lead directly to 
              reproduction—such as aggression or altruism—same-sex behavior can have 
              evolutionary consequences that are just now beginning to be considered," he 
              said. "For example, male-male copulations in locusts can be costly for the 
              mounted male, and this cost may in turn increase selection pressure for males' 
              tendency to release a chemical called panacetylnitrile, which dissuades other 
              males from mounting them." <br><br>The review paper: <br>
              </p><ul>
              <li>Examines work done to 
              test hypotheses about the origins of same-sex behavior in animals. </li>
              <li>Provides 
              a framework for categorizing same-sex behavior, for example, is it adaptive, not 
              adaptive, occurs often, infrequently? </li>
              <li>Discusses what has been discovered 
              about the genetics of same-sex behavior, especially in the model organism, the 
              fruit fly Drosophila, and in human beings. </li>
              <li>Examines connections between 
              human sexual orientation research, and research on non-human animals, and 
              highlights promising avenues of research in non-human systems. </li>
              </ul>
              <br><br>The 
              reviewers expected the research papers they read for their article would give 
              them a better understanding of the degree to which same-sex behaviors are 
              heritable in animals. <br><br>"How important are genes to the expression of 
              these behaviors, compared to environmental factors?" Bailey said. "This is still 
              unknown. Knowing this information would help us better understand how the 
              behaviors evolve, and how they affect the evolution of other traits. It could 
              also help us understand whether they are something that all individuals of a 
              species are capable of, but only some actually express." <br><br>Bailey 
              recommends that fellow evolutionary biologists studying same-sex behavior in 
              animals adopt some of the research approaches that have been successful in human 
              studies. <br><br>"We have estimates, for example, of the heritability of sexual 
              orientation in humans, but none that I know of in other animals," he said. 
              "Scientists have also targeted locations on the human genome that may contribute 
              to sexual orientation, but aside from the fruit fly, we have no such detailed 
              knowledge of the genetic architecture of same-sex behavior in other animals." 
              <br><br>Next in their research, Bailey and Zuk plan to begin experimentally 
              addressing some of the many issues raised in their review. <br><br>Said Bailey, 
              "We want to get at this question: what are the evolutionary consequences of 
              these behaviors? Are they important in the evolution of mating behavior, or do 
              they just add extra 'background noise'? We are pursuing work on the Laysan 
              Albatross, in which females form same-sex pairs and rear young together. 
              Same-sex behavior in this species may not be aberrant, but instead can arise as 
              an alternative reproductive strategy." <br><br>### <br><br>University of
