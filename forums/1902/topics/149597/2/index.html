            <div class='col-md body'>No-sweat husky care<br><br>THE soft hum of the air-conditioner tells Hakan, Argo and Tasha that it's time for bed. Every night, their owner, Mr Hubert Tan, sets the air-conditioner at 17 deg C from 10pm to 6am for his three huskies when they turn in.<br><br>The dogs, aged three to eight, can look forward to another cool session in the afternoon, when the garment businessman leaves the air-conditioner running from 1 to 6pm, the hottest stretch of the day.<br><br>At other times, an industrial fan in his corner terrace house blows constantly to give the dogs respite from the sweltering heat.<br><br>Mr Tan, 49, says: 'They need an airy environment with lots of water. I'm kiasu. I also have two bowls of water for them to drink from. This way, they are kept cool 24 hours a day.'<br><br>When it is time for their walks, which take place only in the mornings or evenings, he takes along a bottle of ice water - but not for himself.<br><br>He sprinkles some of it on his dogs every 15 minutes, and lets them drink from the container.<br><br>'I don't wait for signs or symptoms that they are too hot.'<br><br>And if the weather is too hot, he even has a motorised treadmill for the dogs to use indoors.<br><br>These are not acts of over-indulgence but basic measures needed to care for arctic animals, he says.<br><br>In Mr Tan's case, his huskies are also show dogs which have been winning awards at local dog shows since 1999.<br><br>But their diet is no different from other dogs in that they eat Barf (short for bones and raw food).<br><br>He also uses a skin and coat conditioner to protect his pets from skin diseases, which they are prone to in humid weather.<br><br>Such lavish care naturally chalks up bigger bills, which the father of two declines to reveal. He admits that some items, like the use of the air-conditioner, are a matter of personal preference, but says others, like keeping a fan on, are a must.<br><br>Anyone who intends to keep an arctic breed as a pet should also do ample research and have a good dose of common sense, he says. 'I've seen owners take their huskies out for runs in the afternoon. That's ridiculous. Do you walk around in the sun in a fur coat?'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>COLD COMFORT<br><br>Never shave your husky, malamute or samoyed if the animal is healthy. The fur acts as more than just an insulator, protecting them from insect bites and from when they scratch themselves. Without the protective covering, they are more prone to injury and sunburn.<br><br>Never leave them in a vehicle unattended. Actually, this applies to all pets and also children. The enclosed space of a vehicle traps heat, making the interior far hotter.<br><br>Keep them cool at all times. The best way is to have a fan on constantly so that the dogs can plonk themselves in front of it whenever they feel warm.<br><br>Dry them thoroughly. Just making sure that the fur is dry isn't good enough. The insides of the coats may still contain moisture, which can cause rashes or even parasites to breed. Run your fingers through the fur to feel for wet spots after bathing them.<br><br>Do not leave them out in the sun and avoid taking them for walks on hot days. Instead, take walks early in the morning or in the evenings, and always have water on hand. Huskies are beautiful animals to show off, but is this about you or the dog?<br><br></div>
