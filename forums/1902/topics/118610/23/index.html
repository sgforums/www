            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You may want to take a trip; however, before you do, make sure that your car is serviced properly. Someone you live with may feel totally neglected. Look into making changes to your personal papers and don't neglect those bills that have been piling up.<br>You should be putting your cash into long-term investments like real estate. An older member of your family may have left you with a pressing situation. Emotional relationships will be plentiful if you attend group activities.<br>Money is likely to cause you a bit of a headache today, but if youÂ’re canny and happy to compromise you should be able to have the best of both worlds! Doing something you really enjoy could lead to a chance to boost your cash reserves; just keep your eyes open for the opportunities!</div>

Your emotions have been pulled out of shape and you need to do a little backtracking.
