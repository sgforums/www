            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>You will enjoy the interaction with youngsters and take great pride in the projects you've completed. If you've taken on a lot of work, be sure to leave some time for yourself and family. Pleasure trips will be emotionally favorable.<br>Be discreet with private information. Pleasure trips will promote romance. Be careful not to show your temper when dealing with the boss. This will not be the best day to make changes or renovations to your residence.<br>If there is anything lacking in your life at the moment itÂ’s a sense of fun! YouÂ’ve had a couple of rough and demanding days, so nowÂ’s the time to redress the balance with some activities that you enjoy! A massage will help ease the stress, and an evening of bowling or dancing will benefit you enormously.</div>

Confusion at an emotional level will cause you to make wrong decisions concerning your personal life.<br>Don't get involved in expensive entertainment that involves gambling. Look into alternatives that would better suit both your needs. Don't blame every thing on your mate.<br>The need for some kind of striking change will take over your thoughts today. Maybe you want to give a face-lift to your bedroom or your home; it could be that the idea of a new image attracts you more. Whichever appeals the most make sure that you set a realistic budget for this new design.</div>

Don't volunteer private information about yourself unless you're prepared to be talked about behind your back. You might find that coworkers will support your endeavors.<br>Your diplomatic approach and rather outgoing nature will enhance your reputation and bring you the support you need. Try not to upset others with your plans. Controversial subjects should be avoided at all costs.<br>Like Gemini you are going to need plenty of space today. If possible avoid any team- or group-work in order to maintain that independent streak. Any emotional decisions, especially those involving your love life, should be postponed while the moon remains in your sign!</div>
