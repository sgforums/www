Put your energy into home renovations.<br>Someone close to you may need help. Your need to use emotional blackmail will only cause more conflict. Romance is likely if you participate in unusual forms of entertainment.<br>The negative influence from the moon will shift today, lightening your mood significantly. The only problem is that you will be inclined to take on too much, which could turn out to be overwhelming! Taking baby-steps towards your goal will achieve more, and at a much faster rate!</div>

Compromise may be necessary. Older family members may try to put unreasonable demands on you.<br>With Venus moving into your second house, which is about money, you need to make sure that you donÂ’t get too obsessed with material things.

Your honesty will not only win you points but also respect.<br>You must strive to get the most important projects completed properly, rather than doling everything in a half baked way. You may find that your plans will cost a little more than you had expected. Secret enemies may be holding a grudge that you're not even aware of.<br>You are likely to have a rather frustrating day in terms of romance, but youÂ’ll find that a little patience and understanding can work miracles!

Take time to look at any outdated papers or possible investments. Take a look at the possibilities of starting a small part time business with friends or relatives.<br>Romantic matters will settle down today at long last, which means that youÂ’re likely to feel more at ease. The downside is that money issues arenÂ’t looking quite so good, so err on the side of caution when it comes to spending! Avoiding the malls will help you resist temptation.</div>

This is a great day to start that new health regimen you've been talking about. Do not overspend on entertainment. You could find that children will be a handful.<br>A negative influence between your ruling planet and the moon in Virgo is likely to see you being a little more uptight than normal, but you are likely to find a source of support in the most unlikely person, most probably an earth sign.
