            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Outdoor sports events should entice you. Look into career choices and courses being offered. If you can't get ahead in the company you're with, perhaps it's time to move on.<br>Do not borrow or lend money or belongings to friends or relatives if you wish to avoid any hassles. Opportunities to expand your circle of friends will result in possible new romantic encounters. New friendships will develop through group events.<br>As for Scorpio the transit of Venus is going to have a softening impact on your usually rather cool and aloof nature. However, the minor but negative influence from the moon is likely to cause you a few headaches today; try drinking some chamomile tea to keep the irritation at bay.</div>
