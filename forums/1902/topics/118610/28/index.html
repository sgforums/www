            <div class='col-md body'>Daily Horoscope<br><br>Your charisma will no doubt attract a lot of attention. Someone you work with may be emotional. Find an outlet for any mounting frustration. Consider a creative hobby.<br>Work quietly on your own. You can make changes to your home that will be pleasing to all concerned. Keep busy and let them fume while you're not around.<br>The need to make the most of the day is likely to kick in from the moment you wake up. If the weather allows suggest a bracing outdoor bike-ride to a couple of friends; the perfect location would be the peaceful countryside. Romance is looking favorable too, so if you can spend the day with someone special so much the better!</div>
