Don't let friends convince you that you should contribute to something you don't believe in.<br>Be sure to question any detail that you feel could leave you in a precarious position at a later date. Based on your excitement, serious-minded individuals will be more than interested in backing your ideas. You are best to stick to yourself today.<br>You will find that today will be much more balanced and harmonious than recently. YouÂ’ll have an inner calm which helps you cope sympathetically with a friend in need. But donÂ’t forget yourself: some long overdue relaxation and fun should be scheduled into your busy day too.</div>

You may not get your facts correct today; double-check before making any statements.

Your input into their activities will help bring you closer together. Obstacles may stand in your way where career and success are concerned.<br>A burst of fire and air energy suggests a need to spend the day taking a back seat and letting others have their say today. A tendency to be a little too bossy or assertive could create some minor tensions, but by taking a step back and counting to ten before speaking will make life much sweeter!</div>

You will enjoy travel and getting together with peers.<br>Any miscommunication from yesterday will be smoothed over today, thanks to a couple of minor influences exerting a positive effect. YouÂ’ll also be in the mood for a quiet evening with your mates, so make sure that you stock up on the essentials: potato chips and dips, or ice-cream and chocolate!</div>
