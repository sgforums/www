Secret affairs will come back to haunt you.<br>Don't share your dilemma with those you work with. Only bite off what you can chew. Relax I and enjoy what you've accomplished when you're finished.<br>It seems that you might have a bit of a challenging day today thanks to the negative influence of the moon! You might not be able to sum up the energy to cope with the demands of the day and you might even be feeling a little sorry for yourself, as you think that nothing is going right, but it will pass, and soon!</div>
