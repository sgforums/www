            <div class='col-md body'>True story from a Novell NetWire Sys Op:<br><br>Tech support: Hello, this is Tech Support.<br><br>Caller: Is this tech support?<br><br>Tech support: Yes, it is. How may I help you?<br><br>Caller: The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my warranty period. How do I go about getting<br>that fixed?<br><br>Tech Support: I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?<br><br>Caller: Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer.<br><br>Tech Support: Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped. It's because I am. Did you receive this as part of<br>a promotional, at a trade show? How did you get this cup holder? Does it have any trademark on it?<br><br>Caller: It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a promotional. It just has "4X" on it.<br><br>At this point, the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't stand it. The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key," "Press Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the "Any" key is.<br><br>2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was<br>hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the<br>plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.<br><br>3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining<br>that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old diskettes.<br>After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem,<br>it was found that the customer labeled the diskettes then rolled them into<br>the typewriter to type the labels.<br><br>4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes.<br>A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along with Xeroxed<br>copies of the floppies.<br><br>5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy<br>back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold<br>on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room<br>to close the door to his room.<br><br>6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn't get his computer<br>to fax anything. After 40 minutes of troubleshooting, the technician discovered<br>the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the<br>monitor screen and hitting the "send" key.<br><br>7. Another Dell customer needed help setting up a new program, so a<br>Dell tech suggested he go to the local Egghead. "Yeah, I got me<br>a couple of friends," the customer replied. When told Egghead<br>was a software store, the man said, "Oh, I thought you meant for<br>me to find a couple of geeks."<br><br>8. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no<br>longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water<br>and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing<br>them individually.<br><br>9. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged<br>because his computer had told him he was "bad" and "invalid."<br>The tech explained that the computer's bad and invalid<br>responses shouldn't be taken personally.<br><br>10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get<br>her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged<br>in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button.<br>Her response, "I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing<br>Happens." The "pedal" turned out to be the computer's<br>mouse.<br><br>11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new<br>computer wouldn't work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in,<br>and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked<br>what happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked, "What power switch?"</div>

Can you see that?"<br><br>"Yes, I think so."<br><br>"Great!

Well, can you see if it is?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?"<br><br>"Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle-it's because it's dark."<br><br>"Dark?"<br><br>"Yes-the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window."<br><br>"Well, turn on the office light then."<br><br>"I can't."<br><br>"No? Why not?"<br><br>"Because there's a power outage."<br><br>"A power... A power outage? Aha! Okay, we've got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?"<br><br>"Well, yes, I keep them in the closet."<br><br>"Good! Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from."<br><br>"Really? Is it that bad?"<br><br>"Yes, I'm afraid it is."<br><br>"Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?"<br><br>"Tell them you're too stupid to own a computer."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had been doing Tech Support for Hewlett-Packard's DeskJet division for about a month when I had a customer call with a problem I just couldn't solve. She could not print yellow. All the other colors would print fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. For instance, green is a combination of cyan and yellow, but green printed fine.<br><br>Every color of the rainbow printed fine except for yellow. I had the customer change ink cartridges. I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers. Nothing worked. I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas.<br><br>After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly,<br><br>"Should I try printing on a piece of white paper instead of this "yellow" construction paper?"</div>
