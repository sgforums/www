              <p><em><span style="color: #333399;">Wednesday, June 10, 2009</span></em><span style="color: #003366;"><br><br>Scientists have made the surprising 
              finding that typhoons trigger slow earthquakes, at least in eastern Taiwan. Slow 
              earthquakes are non-violent fault slippage events that take hours or days 
              instead of a few brutal seconds to minutes to release their potent energy. The 
              researchers discuss their data in a study published the June 11, issue of 
              Nature. <br><br>"From 2002 to 2007 we monitored deformation in eastern Taiwan 
              using three highly sensitive borehole strainmeters installed 650 to 870 feet 
              (200-270 meters) deep. These devices detect otherwise imperceptible movements 
              and distortions of rock," explained coauthor Selwyn Sacks of Carnegie's 
              Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. "We also measured atmospheric pressure 
              changes, because they usually produce proportional changes in strain, which we 
              can then remove." <br><br>Taiwan has frequent typhoons in the second half of 
              each year but is typhoon free during the first 4 months. During the five-year 
              study period, the researchers, including lead author Chiching Liu (Academia 
              Sinica, Taiwan), identified 20 slow earthquakes that each lasted from hours to 
              more than a day. The scientists did not detect any slow events during the 
              typhoon-free season. Eleven of the 20 slow earthquakes coincided with typhoons. 
              Those 11 were also stronger and characterized by more complex waveforms than the 
              other slow events. <br><br>"These data are unequivocal in identifying typhoons 
              as triggers of these slow quakes. The probability that they coincide by chance 
              is vanishingly small," remarked coauthor Alan Linde, also of Carnegie. 
              <br><br>How does the low pressure trigger the slow quakes? The typhoon reduces 
              atmospheric pressure on land in this region, but does not affect conditions at 
              the ocean bottom, because water moves into the area and equalizes pressure. The 
              reduction in pressure above one side of an obliquely dipping fault tends to 
              unclamp it. "This fault experiences more or less constant strain and stress 
              buildup," said Linde. "If it's close to failure, the small perturbation due to 
              the low pressure of the typhoon can push it over the failure limit; if there is 
              no typhoon, stress will continue to accumulate until it fails without the need 
              for a trigger." <br><br>"It's surprising that this area of the globe has had no 
              great earthquakes and relatively few large earthquakes," Linde remarked. "By 
              comparison, the Nankai Trough in southwestern Japan, has a plate convergence 
              rate about 4 centimeters per year, and this causes a magnitude 8 earthquake 
              every 100 to 150 years. But the activity in southern Taiwan comes from the 
              convergence of same two plates, and there the Philippine Sea Plate pushes 
              against the Eurasian Plate at a rate twice that for Nankai." <br><br>The 
              researchers speculate that the reason devastating earthquakes are rare in 
              eastern Taiwan is because the slow quakes act as valves, releasing the stress 
              frequently along a small section of the fault, eliminating the situation where a 
              long segment sustains continuous high stresses until it ruptures in a single 
              great earthquake. The group is now expanding their instrumentation and 
              monitoring for this research. <br><br>### <br><br>Carnegie Institution</span></p>
