            <div class='col-md body'>Guinea Pigs - History<br><br>Fossil records of the existence of Guinea Pigs date back to the Miocene period over 18 million years ago. Guinea Pigs (or cavies) are known from ancient times. They originated from South America, where today they still live in the wild. Guinea Pigs inhabit grasslands, rocky areas, and areas near forests. The Incas farmed and selected them for food and as religious icons. Legends hold that Guinea Pigs are mystical beings that can heal the sick and assist the dying. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Currently in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, the roasted Guinea Pig is a typical food</strong>. </span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  Long after the Spanish brought them to Europe in the 16th century, selective breeding of Guinea Pigs began in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century. The origin of the Guinea Pig's name is lost in history.<br><br>Weight: Males are 900-1000 gram; females are 700-900 gram.<br>Length: From 8 to 14 inches.<br>Life Span: 3-6 years.<br><br><img src="http://www.guinea-pigs-guinea-pigs.com/pictures-images-photos/guinea-pigs-04.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guinea Pigs - Personality </strong></span><br><br>Being herbivores, Guinea Pigs don't need the intelligence of scavengers. In the wild they survive through the use of effective herd communication and very rapid reproduction, but are able to establish the safest routes and learn them perfectly. Being the common prey for all predators, Guinea Pigs are always alert and ready to run away. When a herd feeds, one animal assumes the duty of a guard. Guinea Pigs can be trained to perform easy tricks, but only when food is involved and with many repetitions. The potty training of Guinea Pigs is rather easy, because they consider the cage a safe place and will litter in familiar territory<br><br><strong>One Pig or Two? </strong><br><br>Guinea pigs are extremely social, herd animals and thrive in the company of another pig. If you are going to be away for a large part of the day, consider getting a pair of guinea pigs of the same sex. You will end up with a brighter and happier animal.<br><br><strong>Compatibility</strong><br><br>It is a common myth that two male guinea pigs will fight. Compatibility between two guinea pigs is determined by the personalities of the individuals rather than their gender. Some guinea pigs will fight with any pig you try to pair them with but the vast majority thrive on company and delight in having a cage companion. The easiest match is usually between two babies or a baby and an adult guinea pig, but adults can be paired up successfully as well. Introductions should be made in an open area, watching closely for an hour or so. If they seem to be getting along well they can be moved to a freshly cleaned cage (the larger, the better, as it will improve the odds of making a successful pairing). Watch them closely for another hour or so to make sure they continue to get along. Immediately separate fighting guinea pigs with a towel to avoid being bitten.<br><br><strong>Quarantine</strong><br><br>Quarantine any new pig you bring into your home for 2 to 3 weeks behind closed doors. Wash hands and arms well in between handling the new and the resident pig and consider changing your shirt or wearing a removable cover-up when handling the newcomer (or in case of illness, the sick pig). This will help insure the new pig does not introduce any illness or parasites to the one you already have. Consider a visit to the vet for your new cavy<br><br>There exist two main categories of Guinea Pigs: Selfs (one-color short hairs), and Non-selves, which are very numerous (Abyssinian, Abyssinian Satin, Agouti, American, American Satin, Coronet, Dutch, Himalayan, Long Hairs, Peruvian, Peruvian Satin, Silkie, Silkie Satin, Taddy, Teddy Satin, Texel, White Crested, and etc).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guinea Pigs - Housing</strong> </span><br><br>Select a smooth bottomed cage (no wire bottom, ramps or shelves on which they can catch their feet). A small covered house or box inside the cage will provide a sense of protection and a place to sleep. If separation from other household pets is not an issue, an open-topped enclosure may allow you to interact with and pet your cavy more easily<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not Recommended</span>: Aquariums and plastic tubs are much too small and have poor ventilation. This type of housing isolates the guinea pig from it's surroundings by limiting sight, sound and smell.<br><br><strong>LOCATION</strong><br><br>Choose a bright draft-free room with a stable temperature range between 65 and 75 degrees F (18 to 24 degrees C), out of direct sunlight, situated close to household activities.<br><span style="color: red;">WARNING</span>: Never leave a guinea pig unattended in the presence of a dog, cat, ferret or any other predatory animal.<br><br>BEDDING: Cover the cage floor with 1 to 2 inches of Care FRESH or Yesterday's News (paper products) , aspen shavings, or kiln-dried pine. Frequent changing (every 3 or 4 days or less) will prevent odors and promote good health.<br><br>Some pet owners purchase high quality soft grass hay by the bale and cover the absorbent shavings with an inch or two of it. Any hay that is wet should be removed daily. Readily available hay will give them something to chew on. And a pig who is eating is a happy pig.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not Recommended</span> : Cedar and raw pine (not kiln-dried) shavings contain aromatic oils (phenols) which can contribute to respiratory problems. Sawdust (small particles may be inhaled) and cat litter (which a cavy may eat) are also poor choices for bedding<br><br>Keeping Guinea Pigs has many advantages when compared to other pets. They don't need to go out daily and they can be left alone for the whole day unlike dogs. Guinea Pigs eat little and can be handled easily, unlike rabbits. Guinea Pigs don't sleep the whole day, unlike hamsters and other small rodents. Also Guinea Pigs don't need much room, extra heat or light, don't make much noise and are not expensive to buy and keep</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guinea Pigs - Communication </strong></span><br><br>Guinea Pigs communicate with both body language and sounds. If a young or adult Guinea Pig squeals loudly, it's hungry or just needs human contact. Also a loud squeal may be an in danger warning. Squeaks, grunts, and coos are the sounds of contentment and pleasure. The angry chattering is the precursor to a fight or a bite. The low constant rumbling rattle is a sexual behavior. If a Guinea Pig leaps straight up into the air, it's the sign of a healthy and happy animal. Rising up with legs stiffened or showing teeth means threatening. Stretches are the signs of comfort and relaxation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guinea Pigs - Senses </strong></span><br><br>Guinea Pigs possess very acute sense of hearing and hear sounds beyond the human limits. They soon become conditioned to sounds related to feeding. They can even have preferences in music. Guinea Pigs sense of smell is better than humans, but not as well as dogs. They recognize each other by smell. As for the eyesight, Guinea Pigs' eyes are mounted on the sides of the head, giving them a large angle of vision. They cannot see clearly at a distance; they have no depth perception; and their ability to assess distances and heights is limited. But they have color-vision and are able to notice the slightest movement.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guinea Pigs - Diet </strong></span><br><br>Guinea Pigs are vegetarians. In captivity guinea pigs are reasonably easy to feed, remembering two main things.<br><strong>Number one</strong> - Guinea pigs cannot manufacture their own vitamin C and require 10 to 30 mg/kg daily to prevent scurvy. To ensure your cavy gets adequate vitamin C, you can give a quarter of a 100 mg chewable or plain vitamin C tablet, or provide a small amount of liquid vitamin C drops to each cavy. Young, ill, nursing and pregnant animals require extra vitamin C.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do not add vitamin C to the water</span>. </span><br><br>Water is vital to good health but because vitamin C changes the flavor, they may drink less.<br>Ascorbic acid degrades rapidly once added to water.<br>Some cavies drink a lot and some very little, so it is impossible to know how much vitamin C your pet is getting..<br><br><strong>Number two</strong> - they need to be made to work at their food as if they are in the wild, by grinding down roughage in order to get sufficient nourishment. This will also help to keep the front teeth short, preventing further problems.<br><br>Guinea pigs should always have a good daily supply of high quality, grass hay (timothy and orchard grass are popular) should always be available to each and every guinea pig, no matter what age. Grass hay keeps their digestive system moving and helps prevent their teeth from over growing. It is usually placed in a wire rack off the floor for cleanliness. They also need to have guinea pig mix, mash or guinea pig pellets. If they don't eat something in the mix, don't leave it out of their next feed because it is not kind to allow them to develop lazy eating habits.<br><br>Small amounts of fresh vegetables (about a cup a day) are an important additional source of vitamin C and other nutrients. Parsley, romaine lettuce (rather than iceberg, which has less nutritional value and may result in loose stools if given in excess), a small piece of carrot, tomato, green or red pepper, spinach, and cantaloupe are popular choices. And clean, pesticide-free grass, clover, dandelion greens, corn husks and silk, will be appreciated by your pet. Rinse vegetables thoroughly. Do not feed wilted or spoiled food. Vegetables must be introduced slowly, to avoid digestive upsets. Once introduced, you can supply a variety of them to your pet. Variety is the key to maintaining your pigs' health. Be creative<br><br>Guinea pigs generally know what is good for them and also how much is good for them but never give one plants you know are unsuitable and try to stick to plants you can be sure are safe.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: red;"><strong>NOT RECOMMENDED IN DIET</strong>:</span></span><br><br>Mixes or treats with nuts, seeds, dried fruit and dyed pieces. Do not give dairy and meat products (cavies are herbivores) or rabbit pellets (they do not contain Vitamin C and some may even include antibiotics toxic to cavies). Seeds in husks can be a choking hazard. Cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, collards, bok choy, broccoli) may cause gas in your pet and are best offered sparingly and infrequently. Do not use mineral wheels. Never use Tang (which contains dyes, refined sugars, and very little vitamin C) in drinking water. And don't fall for commercial treats marketed for cavies (like yoghurt drops) which can even be detrimental to their health. Consuming these empty calories (many contain fat, sugars and even excess calcium) can result in decreased consumption of the basic foods they really need.<br><br>[<span style="color: darkred;">b]Do not give multivitamins[/b]!</span> Plain vitamin C is fine, but multivitamins are not. Excessive amounts of vitamins like A and D can cause serious problems for your pet<br><br>Always supply fresh, clean water - using a water bottle is generally the easiest method.<br><br></div>

Should my guinea pigs be encouraged to exercise?</strong><br><br>Guinea pigs are not regularly on the move like hamsters and they certainly do not need an exercise wheel. But they will be quite active at some times of the day if they are given interesting things to do. For example, tunnels, or an 'adventure playground' with tunnels, bricks and thing for them to run on and in and out of without them getting hurt. They do like to lie in the sun and soak up the warmth but they are susceptible to sun stoke.<br><br><strong>How long do guinea pigs live?</strong><br><br>The lifespan for guinea pigs is between five and eight years, depending on breed, how well it is look after, exercise etc.<br><br><strong>How often should my guinea pig's claws be clipped?</strong><br><br>Clip the claws as often as necessary. The more frequently a guinea pig can walk/run on a hard surface, the less frequently they will need clipping, as they will wear down themselves. A guinea pig that spends a lot of time on grass or in its hutch will need its claws clipping more often.<br><br><strong>I have seen my guinea pigs eating their own droppings. Should I stop them doing this, if so how?</strong><br><br>It is normal for a guinea pig to eat their own droppings, known as coprophagy. The guinea pig is not capable of digesting the vitamin c in the food it takes in. When the vitamin is released out in the form of droppings, they eat it to get the vitamions it needs. This is important for the animals' health and you should not stop them doing it. It can't transmit disease.<br><br><strong>My guinea pigs have ruined several water bottles by chewing the spouts. What should I do?</strong><br><br>If possible buy a bottle with a metal spout, preferably stainless steel, as aluminum is a soft metal and a guinea pig might be able to chew through it. Whatever type of water bottle you have, you must check it regularly to ensure that the water flows freely and always make sure fresh, clean water is supplied. Have a look at GPW's Pet Products page for suitable water bottles.<br><br><strong>Why does my guinea pig bite me?</strong><br><br>Your guinea pig may bite you for two reasons. Number one is that it might think you are feeding it and nip your finger instead. Or your guinea pig is frightened of you and, biting in self defense - specially new or young pets. You need to try to handle your guinea pig more often and talk to it in a 'soft' tone of voice.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Day In The Lives of The Guinea Pig</strong></span><br>taken from the Guinea Pig Compodium<br><br>It's 6:30 AM, and one of the humans has just awoken from a long night of cavy dreams. As he stumbles into the kitchen, the anxious squeaks of the guinea pigs rise to greet him. It's feeding time. Panda comes over to the side of the cage, demanding his morning veggies. There is no placating the savage beasts, whose fury and temper can only be appeased by fresh greens, pellets and water refills.<br><br>At 6:40 AM, it's feeding time. Parsley and kale for everyone! Fortunately, the food is plentiful and the atmosphere in the cage is one of cooperation and sharing. Shortly after the veggies have been devoured, the feed bowls are filled so that the pigs can satisfy their ravenous appetites with pellets<br><br><img src="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/OurGpigs/DayInTheLife/tugofwar.jpg"><br><br>When 7:30 AM rolls in, it's time for the morning exercise. Having loaded themselves with energy, the guinea pigs enjoy a morning of popcorning, running and perching. Cappuccino starts off the festivities by running in circles, over and over and over and over and over again. Soon after she begins, Panda and Ebony join in the fun, leading to a caviary full of flying guineas, darting and colliding and squeaking with joy. Georgianne, ever mistrustful of flying guinea pigs, eyes the activity cautiously from the safety of a nearby litter bin.<br><br>By 8:15 AM, the humans have vacated the premises. The information that follows was painstakingly pieced together from hours of hidden camera footage<br><br><img src="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/OurGpigs/DayInTheLife/cappy.jpg"><br><br>Having grown weary from an exciting morning performing their guinea pig duties, the herd settles down for a long nap. Cappuccino finds a soft spot in the fresh hay, and reclines. Panda and Ebony opt to sprawl out on the carpet, stretching their legs out behind them. Georgianne, ever mistrustful of sleeping guinea pigs, eyes the inactivity cautiously from the safety of a nearby litter bin before succumbing to her fatigue.<br><br>Nap time lasts until around 10:00 AM, when the guinea pigs slowly awaken, one-by-one. Panda, ever the cavy alarm clock, signals the end of nap time by performing the graceful, awe-inspiring, wagging butt-dance. His ulterior motives aside, he succeeds in disrupting the calm, peaceful air of the caviary, which soon explodes into a flurry of activity.<br><br>10:20 AM. Ebony hops on to the internet, and surfs the Web. Though her humans favor IBM-compatible computers, Ebony prefers her Macintosh, which was smuggled into the home many wheeks ago, and only recently discovered. From her PPP account, she monitors activity on the Guinea Pigs' Daily Digest and the rec.pets USENET newsgroup. She occasionally drops in to alt.guinea.pig.conspiracy to communicate, using a top-secret code, with fellow guinea pig masters around the world. Ivory and Espresso wait patiently for Ebony to finish, so that they, too, may log on and check their email<br><br><img src="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/OurGpigs/DayInTheLife/ebonycmp.jpg"><br><br>At 11:35 AM, the guineas prepare for the possibility that one of the humans may return home for lunch. Ebony stashes the computer under the hay while Ivory and Espresso tidy up the family room. Capuccino assists Panda with doing the dishes. By 12:10 PM, the rooms are as they were when the humans left in the morning, so that suspicions will not be aroused. Georgianne, ever mistrustful of cleaning guinea pigs, eyes the activity cautiously from the safety of a nearby litter bin.<br><br>The sound of approaching footsteps are heard at 12:15 PM. Could the human be returning? Panda takes the position of "lookout", and watches for signs of the human's arrival. When the footsteps reach the front doorstep, he gives the signal: the guinea pigs scramble for their assigned locations, and feign sleep.<br><br><img src="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/OurGpigs/DayInTheLife/pandacg.jpg"><br><br>By 12:55 PM, the human has left again, after preparing a short lunch and tending to piggie duties, such as checking the water bottles and cleaning around the cage. After the car has driven off, the guinea pigs emerge from their hiding places and prepare for their long afternoon.<br><br>It is now 1:15 PM. While Ebony and Ivory make a grocery run for more cranberry juice and some ice, Espresso and Cappuccino check the local TV listings for good afternoon movies. Panda, preferring more intellectual pursuits, heads off to the library to locate some reading material<br><br><img src="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/OurGpigs/DayInTheLife/pandabks.jpg"><br><br>At 2:30 PM, Cappuccino and Espresso give up on afternoon television and instead opt for a laserdisc. Georgianne sets up the home theatre system while Ebony and Ivory finish pouring drinks. Panda returns from the library at 3:15 PM, just in time to catch the last hour of The Secret Garden.<br><br>The time is 4:30 PM, and the guineas must once again clean up in preparation for the humans' return. Espresso and Cappuccino put away the laserdics and clean the family room while Ivory and Ebony tidy up the kitchen. Panda vacuums up poops and loose strands of hay. Georgianne, still mistrustful of cleaning guinea pigs, eyes the activity cautiously from the safety of a nearby litter bin. By 4:55 PM, the house is once again returned to its previous state, just in time for the humans' arrival.<br><br><img src="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/OurGpigs/DayInTheLife/georgie2.jpg"><br><br>The first human comes home at 5:00 PM, and immediately comes to the caviary to snuggle with the pigs. After a long day of hard work, the guineas are overjoyed to share some contact with their human companion. Each cavy waits anxiously for his or her turn to be petted; they are so excited, they can hardly contain themselves.<br><br>The next human arrives at 5:40 PM. This gets the guinea pigs even more excited, since that means feeding time is less than an hour away. In an effort to charm the humans into giving them larger portions of fresh greens and veggies, Cappuccino begins popcorn jumping and Panda does his hypnotic, wagging butt-dance. Ebony and Georgianne squeak an accompaniment, while Ivory remains cool and collected<br><br><img src="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/OurGpigs/DayInTheLife/espresso.jpg"><br><br>Feeding time happens at 6:15 PM, and the cavies are excited by loads of fresh veggies and parsley. As they devour their latest offering, the human refills their feed dishes and changes their water.<br><br>By 7:30 PM, the guinea pigs are ready for bed, having been tired by their long, hard day at work. Shortly after 8:00 PM, the humans change the hay in their home, giving them plenty of insulation for the night, which they munch on contentedly as they slowly fall asleep.<br><br>Yes, being a guinea pig is, indeed, a full-time job  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://www.aracnet.com/~seagull/Guineas/OurGpigs/DayInTheLife/feeding.jpg"></div>
