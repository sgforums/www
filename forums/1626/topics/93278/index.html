He is sympathetic and loyal, he'll listen and try to help, find something for him to help you with. He is sometimes judgmental, jumps to conclusions and does things with out thinking of the consequences, you may have to help him get his tootsies out of the fire with your diplomacy (he'll appreciate it). He is the jealous type, so guard against being overfriendly to the opposite sex. He likes to be in control and arrange things, let him do it. He wants someone he can mould to his liking, so bend like a reed. A few don'ts: Never criticize him in front of others, or he'll become a raging Tasmanian Devil. Don't give him suggestions about the way to do things unless he asks you. Don't act possessive or controlling, remember, he is the controller (use the butter technique to get what you want). Don't play games or be the least bit pompous, he prefers that you be your natural self. Let him have his way and he'll give you anything your little old heart desires.<br><br>He goes best with: Leo, Sagittarius, Taurus, Aquarius<br>He clashes with: Gemini, Scorpio, Cancer, Pisces<br>Neutral: Aries, Virgo, Libra, Capricorn<br></div>

He likes femininity and grace in a woman, so he can demonstrate his caring and thoughtfulness about your well-being. Drop any loud, contentious, or controlling behavior you may have and practice being "her lady ness". He may be up to date on the latest in finance and business, but he is a romantic and wants to treat you with respect the old fashioned way. Give him the reason to do it. Although, he wants you to be feminine, he doesn't want you to be a crushed flower needing constant attention all the time, avoid being an emotional heavy weight.A few don'ts: He may be generous to a fault with you, don't bleed him dry or he may think that you are a gold digger. Don't bring up details about former relationships, keep him from getting jealous or the gifts may stop. Don't try to steal the spotlight away from him when out in public or socializing. When he sets his mind on something, he won't change it, don't bother trying to force the issue, it'll lead to an argument. Remember he enjoys his role of being your guardian and protector.

He is always coming up with something new to do or to talk about, life certainly won't be boring. If you get mad at him, it won't be for long, he'll con you into forgiving him.A few don'ts: Don't try to nail his shoes to the floor to keep him still, it won't work, he fears boredom worse than death. Don't try to out talk him, you can't, and he resents it. He may take a position or view one day and the next day take a completely different stand, don't bother to argue for or against any positions he takes, wait until his view changes to the one you hold, then you'll both be in agreement. Don't get overly affectionate in public, it makes him uneasy, wait until you are alone.<br><br>He goes best with: Libra, Aquarius, Gemini, Pisces<br>He clashes with: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn<br>Neutral: Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scorpio Oct 23 - Nov 22<br><br>If birthday falls before Nov 1 read also Libra - If after Nov 10 read also Sagittarius.<br><br>How to influence him:<br><br>He is magnetic and secretive, holding his thoughts and knowledge in a deep vault, prying won't work you'll have to settle for what he chooses to reveal to you. He has an x- ray ability to look inside you and know what's in your mind, so get used to being an open book. He is passionate about everything that he believes in, including sex, so if you are cold or uninterested, you won't last long.

He has a hypnotic personality and women are naturally attracted to him, try not to show jealousy. He is a dominant male and has an ability to psychically transmit his will to others.

He is sympathetic and considerate of those he cares about, show that you appreciate his attention.

His enthusiasm and need for challenge causes him to jump into half baked schemes and plans that haven't been well thought out; provide him with some of the basic missing details. He is a romantic, but only superficially, you'll have to teach him what it's all about. He is extravagant in most everything he does; you'll have to help him control the spending. His honest and naive nature makes him tactless when it comes to saying the right thing, he's prone to putting his foot in his mouth, re-interpret what he says to you the way he should have said it.

He is conventional, practical and efficient; show him how well you manage your finances and resources. He is big on family and foundation, show him the family tree, bring along your kid brother, and belong to an organization. He is a believer in "actions speak louder than words" regarding love. You may have to coax the love word from him. He likes the pursuit, so be a bit hard to get without over doing it. Some Caps, though very capable, are lacking in self-confidence, be certain that you are a cheerleader. A few don'ts: Don't bother to flatter, it doesn't work. Don't expect a quick run away and get married, he wants to be established in career or business before he takes the plunge. Don't act erratic and unpredictable, demonstrate self control and reserve.

He has no one best friend, because everyone from every level of society is his friend. Be open-minded and gracious when you meet them. He is a highly mystical and spiritual person and needs freedom for analytical exploration. You'll be hearing theories and ideas that are radical and border on the impossible, just smile and be a good audience. Yes, you can ask questions. He keeps his private thoughts and emotions hidden so they won't interfere with his detached exterior. He may even love you but not express it. You need to be a bit forward in this regard. He shrinks from binding emotional ties, so hide the emotions and act like a friend with out demands of exclusivity. When he feels that you can exist like a parallel to him without wanting to own him, he'll feel safe to commit to you. He is an optimist of the highest order, so if you are feeling down, he won't rest until he pulls you up again. He analyzes everything, so don't volunteer information about yourself; let him get it bit by bit. Keep the mystery about you for as long as you can.A few don'ts: Don't be a clinging, sticky emotional burden, he can't deal with it, and he wants you to hold your own ground. Don't try to get into his private thoughts; he'll share them when he wants to. He places a great value in trust which means freedom for you, don't abuse it, or you'll face scrutiny ever after. Don't mock or ridicule his futuristic ideas, or you'll show him that you are un-evolved.<br><br>He goes best with: Gemini, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius<br>He clashes with: Aries, Capricorn, Taurus, Cancer, Virgo<br>Neutral: Leo, Libra, Pisces</div>

Bring up these subjects and you'll be able to talk for hours. He is empathic and everyone can lean on him for sympathy regarding their problems. Get some if you need it, but don't over do it. He's a great dreamer of things but sometimes doesn't take any action. Light a fire under him to get him going. He's a real romantic and appreciates a candlelight dinner, then sitting cozy in front of the fireplace afterwards. Get some cuddling and romance. He admires beauty of all sorts, from a single flower, to a wilderness landscape, to antiques. Dress beautifully and have beautiful things around you for him to admire.A few don'ts: Don't overburden him with too many of other people's problems; he needs a break from it. Don't deprive him from moments of needed solitude, he's recharging his batteries. He is a great listener, but don't monopolize the conversation, he needs to talk also. He is quite un-prejudiced and open, don't expect him to be judgmental.<br><br>He goes best with: Cancer, Scorpio, Taurus, Gemini, Virgo, Capricorn<br>He clashes with: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Libra<br>Neutral: Aquarius, Pisces<br></div>
