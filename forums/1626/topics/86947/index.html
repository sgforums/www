Bring an extra gun for her to shoot with you. (She is capable of shooting at you, if you rile her anger) Wear tight jeans, a red shirt and look manly.<br><br>Pick her up on your Harley Davidson, but remind her you have a private race car collection. Be Macho! Do not talk about old girlfriends! Aries females must be the only "one". Cooking isn't her goal in life, but adventure will get her attention! Don't be a pushover, she'll lose interest, and look for another challenge. Tell her she is really cool, and the most fun and exciting woman you were ever with. (This will probably not be a lie) She values honesty, don't fabricate!<br><br>Be careful though, if this Aries female really likes you, she'll chase you until she can propose to you. Aries females mean business and are not recommended for timid men!<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Aries Male [March 21-April 20 - Aries]</strong></span></span><br><br>If you are dating an Aries male, allow him to decide where to go and what to do. Let him know that you have never dated a man with such confidence and brains. You can be the dumb blonde with this guy, he'll save you. If you are out with him and you flirt with someone else, be prepared to call a cab to get home.<br><br>Aries males do like skin and cleavage, therefore, you could win him back. It will not work a second time. He can argue with you, and when you think you have won, he will still do it his way. He wants to chase you, so let him do the calling and guesswork. Don't tell him you love him, until he proposes.<br><br>To catch this hot-blooded Aries man, give the Ram his head and follow his head. Everyday is an adventure to an Aries male, marriage also. Rest up!<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

If it is paid for, you may drop that subtlety in your conversation during dinner.<br><br>Taurus females prefer tender hugs and quiet candlelight dinners at home, prepared by you. She'll return the love by cooking for you at her home. When mentioning the house you would like to build, make sure you tell her about the large wooded lot with room for kids and dogs. If you are serious about her, let her know that it wouldn't be complete without a woman's touch. She will interpret your comment and hint about a cute little 20-carat diamond she spotted at the mall.<br><br>Taurus females are warm and loving! (Unless you make her mad or jealous. Don't tell her you spent your rent money to buy drugs) Taurus Females are security minded, and will stick by you!<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Taurus Male [April 21-May 21 - Taurus]</strong></span></span><br><br>If you are dating a Taurus male, be prepared to watch lots of movies at his home.

Ask her if she would like to ride over to the bar, and shoot a game of pool, because a lot of your buddies hang out there and they are fun!<br><br>If that doesn't work, then suggest skating, a coffeehouse, or hanging out at the bookstore. Wear casual clothes and be prepared to talk a lot. Talk about the fascinating people you know, the intellectual types preferably. Tell her about the book that you are going to write. Have some original thoughts and be inventive. Creativity ranks high on your Gemini females list. YouÂ’ll never know what she is thinking. She is full of surprises. You can take her to the neighborhood dive bar, or to the Governor's Ball. She won't embarrass you.<br><br>You can find out what she really thinks of you by locating her journal, where all her secrets are kept. Gemini females are not tidy, so it should be lying around in plain sight. There's lots of time before an engagement ring is necessary. Gemini females have to fall in love with your brain first!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: orange;">Gemini Male [May 22-June 21 - Gemini]</span></strong></span><br><br>If you are dating a Gemini male, you can expect him to stand you up on your first date, but if you are lucky, he will call, say he is running late, and that the plans for the date have changed. Bring an overnight bag, he can get carried away and forget that you need to go home. He will have the cutest twinkling eyes, and you will forgive him. He will slightly ignore you in public, as he always knows everyone, wherever he takes you, and speaks to each one.<br><br>Somehow, you can't picture him in a tuxedo, going down the aisle. Gemini males won't call you everyday. Gemini men are witty, fun, and can play, lay, and play! These men thrive in occupations where they can meet the public, and talk. Gemini males are great as disc jockeys. If you want to catch this guy, don't lean on him, don't get pregnant, or talk marriage. Be a challenge do your own thing and let your Gemini male chase you. It's ok to date others.<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

Be sure to call her mother and check on the kids. She'll think you are really a nice guy. Dress casual, and drive a suburban, or mini-van. It's ok, if you got the kids from your last divorce that won't stop her from dating you. Offer to barbecue at her house and compliment her cooking. (That way you get to come back for more.)<br><br>Bring the family with you, Cancer females can take it. Cancer females are very sensitive about everything near and dear to them. Never say bad things about her family members-ever! They do possess humor.<br><br>Pay attention to all her handmade quilts and home crafts. Cancer women are great homemakers. Let her know you like women with a "little meat" on their bones. (They taste everything they cook...yummy!)

Of course, he will take you out to eat, at least on your first date.<br><br>He is pretty thrifty, so be sure you have a little stash of tip money in your purse. Of course, if you want to pay for your own, that would be fine. Just be yourself around him. Looks aren't that important to Cancer males, but do know some fabulous recipes! Talk about your love of children. Display an interest in his hobbies. Don't go into his garage, it will take the rest of the century to go through all of his bargains and collectibles.<br><br>Your Cancer man will be dating just you, and possibly his ex-wife. He is extremely stable, and loves to eat. If you think you need to diet, he won't. He loves chesty women! You will receive flowers from him, out of his garden, naturally. He will remember all the holidays and treat you well.<br><br>Tell him all your funny stories, he likes to laugh. It's ok, to say you are pro marriage and to openly discuss it. He's there for you. He knows how to treat women, afterall, his best friend is his mother. When you marry a Cancer man, you get them both!<br><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

Getting the picture? She wants to be seen out with you. If men notice her, she will love that.<br><br>If you don't act a little jealous, she will try harder to make you so. She thinks jealousy is a compliment. Bring her flowers, wear your gold chains, and wear something that shows off those muscles you worked so hard to get. That will excite her.<br><br>Don't forget to splash on your Giorgio cologne. Tell her how much you love redheads, and ask her if all that gorgeous hair is hers? (If she isn't a redhead, then switch to blondes, or dark hair, but don't forget this.)<br><br>Compliment her constantly, and drive something sporty to show her off. A convertible would be nice. Leo gals will get you noticed! When she disappears on your dates, she is merely primping in the ladies room. Be willing to fight for your Leo female, but don't take any crap from her. She<br>can start fights over nothing. Be prepared. You had better love her cats too!<br><br>She doesn't care if you are well read or educated, but do be suave, polished and act like you know what you are doing.

You can expect him to put the studley moves on you ASAP, not to worry. Usually it is a game, to see if you are really interested.<br><br>He will impress you with his peacock strut, and the way he puffs out his chest. If he can convince you that he is a great guy, then he will be, otherwise, you will be pounced on by his cat like nature. His favorite past time is being waited on, breakfast in bed, candlelight, movies, concerts, roses and your basic everyday adoration.<br><br>He is capable of a variety of occupations, but he likes to be the boss the most. This includes home. Leo men can have temper tantrums, if things don't go their way. It's ok, if you want to toss a few things back his way, when he starts to roar. Stand up to him. Be able to turn his roar into a purr. Always look good around him. Don't admit you color your hair. Do sleep with your makeup on, and dress sexy and feminine.<br><br>He won't marry you otherwise. Leo males love the chase, so let him! (Leo males will already have told you about all of his other women.)<br></div>

Borrow the car if you have to. Do not pick her up in your unwashed car, with the baby car carrier. She isn't interested in ready-made families. Wear the latest in fashion, and above all, have a manicure.<br><br>Virgo females notice everything! Have a degree, be a professional, know everyone who is anyone. Exude confidence. Stay away from the bar where you were 86'd! Do not have other girlfriends.<br><br>Virgo females are shy and sometimes aloof. That does not mean they don't like you. It takes several dates for them to decide if they want you. They are neat freaks, and don't want to pick up after you. Be toilet trained! If you tell her you are going to do something at 6pm, then do it. Virgo females can drop you for little things like that. Don't quit trying, if you care about her.<br><br>They only love a handful of men, and you won't have any competition. Just be real! Quality is important to female Virgos. Virgo females are usually career minded, but they will marry.<br><br><span style="color: green;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Virgo Male [August 23-September 23 - Virgo]</strong></span></span><br><br>If you are dating a Virgo male, go slowly.

Your Virgo male won't divorce you, once in love, it's for keeps!<br><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>

You can fall in love anytime you want to with her. Your car isn't as important, as how you treat her. Gently please, no conflict! Your Libra female probably won't have children, but she will have her fluffy lap dog, everywhere you go.<br><br>She isn't the type to cheat on you, unless you forget about romance. Your occupation isn't that important. Be sure to earn enough money to support her frequent shopping trips to the mall. She loves to decorate, so step back at home. You can do the outside domestic duties. You get to wash the car and mow the lawn. When you propose to her, present her with your poetic love vows, and promise to hire a maid for her. Libra females love to be married!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: olive;">Libra Male [September 24-October 23 - Libra]</span></strong></span><br><br>If you are dating a Libra male, your first date will be in a romantic restaurant, highlighted with a wonderful wine list. During dinner just smile and be sweet. Libra men don't like vulgarity in any form. Dress tastefully, and do use your flower scented perfume. He loves women who dress up, wear jewelry, use makeup, and are happy being feminine. He is fascinated with fantasy, including sexual fantasy. Don't discuss your recent love life, or ex-husbands. He could care less about your children, or desire to have them.<br><br>Don't be argumentative. Libra males hate conflict. You can discuss your latest painting, the last book you read, or what your plans are for interior decorating. Libra males love cozy fires, and sensuous females near it.<br><br>Fore play is a big high for Libra males. He is not a wimp, by any means, although, he loves to please!

Show up wearing black clothes that fit you well. Arrive in your black car with the dark tinted windows. She likes the dark places, so take her to the bars, a casino would be fab! Don't tell her about the drugs you are on, she won't tell you about hers either.<br><br>There needs to be caution exercised here, because Scorpios are one of two extremes. One the saint, the other the sinner. The first type of Scorpio is very religious, and does not smoke, drink, or do drugs. If you are on a blind date, you will know which version you are dating. Neither type is hung up on what you wear, but more how you wear it. Have sex appeal.<br><br>Be interested in occult matters, be deep. She won't offer you much information about herself, you will have to guess. Scorpio females will pry your whole life story out of you. To keep her interested, be hard to get. You won't know if you are pleasing her, or where you stand.<br><br>A fatal mistake is to anger a Scorpio female. Scorpio women will get you! She has a passionate nature and can have more than one love interest. They are not usually domestic, nor want to be involved with parenthood. She will put all of her intense energy into either partying or getting to the top. Female Scorpios are "all or nothing", even when it comes to marriage.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: cyan;">Scorpio Male [October 24-November 22 - Scorpio]</span></strong></span><br><br>If you are dating a Scorpio male, make sure you love secrets! He loves for you to be sexy and downright sleazy works for him too. He can make love to you, and not be in love with you. His passion can fool women, don't mistake it for love. Oftentimes, they are most in love when they can't possess or own you. Jealousy is a big issue with him. He stays jealous. He does not care what you do for an occupation, nor your financial status.<br><br>Scorpio males want to control you to conform to their ideas of living. So, if you aren't strong in your own identity, then you will lose him. Scorpio males like the challenge of ownership. They love you most when they can't have complete control over you. Only the fearless need apply here. One type of Scorpio will marry you and stay put and dominates the household. Whereas, the other type will just disappear on you without warning or reason. Be true to yourself with Scorpio males, and let your personality stay on top!<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: blue;">Sagittarius Female [November 23-December 21 - Sagittarius]</span></strong></span><br><br>If you are dating a Sagittarius Female, be ready willing and able to go anywhere. She loves sports and to travel. A perfect date would be an overnight excursion to Mount Olympus, and skiing down the slopes for breakfast. Pick her up in your jeep, or pickup truck, she won't mind your dog either. Dress casual, and be able to tell her about an Indian Shaman that you know, who invited you to a tribal ceremony. She'll want to go with you.<br><br>Don't do the same things twice in a row. She won't care who you are dating, because she has plenty of men friends. Sagittarius women can be ready for a date on a momentÂ’s notice. She'll be great at men's activities, like softball, and eating the worm from a Tequila bottle. She will have been everywhere, but darn, Sagittarius females are fun to be around. You can win her heart with variety in your lovemaking.<br><br>She isn't the type to spend time in the kitchen or babysitting. Show her you want to be a companion in all of her zany schemes. When she falls for you, she will ask you to do things with her. Marriage is not on her mind, but she would marry you, if she felt you were compatible enough. Sagittarius women love their freedom!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: blue;">Sagittarius Male [November 23-December 21 - Sagittarius]</span></strong></span><br><br>If you are dating a Sagittarius male, expect anything and everything. He is not very reliable about schedules, dates, or you. Not in the beginning anyway. He likes talkative women and female jocks. He wants a buddy to join him in his pursuits.<br><br>Most Sagittarius males are employed in sales/traveling jobs. They can have a gal in every port. Let him tell you he is serious about you first. Sagittarius males only get married when they have to, and then they can't seem to stay married. They love the thrill and adventure of chasing a woman, similar to their love of hunting, fishing, and sports. You rank in there somewhere. You can get used to being a hunting widow, sports widow, etc., with a Sagittarius male! You should love the same things he does.<br><br>Sagittarius men can be very funny and interesting. He will go to restaurants, but throw out his suit and tie. Sagittarius males like their comfort and the wide open spaces and places, and freedom with their women.<br><br>Make no mistake about it, he does love women, all of them. When your Sagittarian's heart goes out to you, he won't know what to do about it, because he didn't expect to fall in love. If you live with him, he won't find time to go down the aisle. Sagittarius men dread the thought of a tuxedo, and the stares from wedding guests. You will have to drag your Sagittarius male to the altar!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Capricorn Female [December 22-January 20 - Capricorn]</span></strong></span><br><br>If you are dating a Capricorn female, take her to dinner at the best restaurant in town, arrive in a limousine with flowers. Dress in your designer clothes, and be impeccable. Pinstripes and subtle scents arouse her. Be successful at whatever you are undertaking. Let her know about it.<br><br>It's ok, to tell her you made two million last year. Don't be cheap. Tell her you have been saving yourself for the right woman, and that you have been working your buns off, to build your empire. Tell her you need someone to share this big business burden with, and that your thoughts are about expanding your business. Hint that a woman would be perfect as a manager in your new expansion. She will be so intrigued, that she will offer you sound business suggestions. She is SMART! Capricorn females won't compete with you, they'll help climb the ladder. Don't forget about her. She loves expensive presents with thought behind them. Her little "black book" is filled with business appointments, not telephone numbers. Capricorn women are almost always successful in whatever they undertake. They don't take enough time to eat, so take her to lunch, dinner and your next corporate meeting. Business thrills them. She may seem cold emotionally, but don't be fooled. She has those sexual infernos, looking for a release!<br><br>She does not trust men entirely, so don't give her the bums rush, or you will be part of the homeless. She would be a great wife to a success-oriented man.<br><br>She can entertain your clients, and friends. Capricorn females, can be boss in marriage too. Be prepared to be hen-pecked, if you are thinking marriage! You will love to have her.........<br><br>LOVE MATCH:&gt;TAURUS<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Capricorn Male[December 22-January 20 - Capricorn]</span></strong></span><br><br>If you are dating a Capricorn male, plan on doing most of the talking. He will take you to places with class and ambience. He will pick you up in his black, luxury car. You will be treated like a lady. Therefore, you should let him open the doors, etc.<br><br>Dress in style, but be sure you show some cleavage. Still waters run deep with Capricorn males. Your first dates will seem like business meetings, but eventually you will get to know him. He is insecure about his emotions and likes to keep them under control. Of course, he won't make this obvious.<br><br>Compliment him on his achievements and he will open up to you. He would be strict as a parent, and holds very traditional beliefs about relationships. Don't be an airhead or aimless. He appreciates a hard working woman, whom he can consider an equal.<br><br>He does not know how to play, so you will have to lighten him up with your humorous antics and fun loving side. Once your Capricorn man commits, he will not leave you. Divorce is a nasty word in his vocabulary. Capricorn males make good husbands and breadwinners.<br><br>They are extravagant with gifts to those whom they love. Marriage will have to be his idea, not yours!<br></div>

Wear a funky hat and clothes that shouldn't go together, but somehow do.<br><br>Take her to an out of the way coffee house, featuring jazz. Feel free to discuss anything and everything. She is an intelligent listener, and will have some bizarre insight of her own. You'll never truly understand her, so bring a tape recorder for instant replay to sort it out later.<br><br>Aquarius women are unusual, not necessarily hippies, but aware of the entire globe.

Explain your philosophy on combining chemicals to combat radiation.<br><br>Tell her about your thesis which was published in the "International Who Dunnit Magazine".

Then you will see the real Aquarius female.<br><br>There will be many unusual pictures, and books. There is a story connected to all of her belongings. When your Aquarius female commits to you, she will not necessarily be ready for marriage. That is just her way of saying she likes you.

He may stay at your house, never cook or clean, but just be there, when you come home from work. Then one day, without warning, he will be gone.<br><br>If he is employed, he can be quite selfish with his money. He likes his freedom, in every way. Eventually he will call you..... expect the unexpected with Aquarius. When Aquarius males fall in love, it is usually with someone who is intellectual, self-sufficient, and childless. Have a deep purpose or goal in life and he will be attracted to your dreams.<br><br>Aquarius males will marry, but they usually marry the wrong person the first time, and shy away from second marriages. They love their mental freedom. Nagging won't change them. He won't care what race you are, how much you weigh, etc.<br><br>Mind altering drugs can ruin an Aquarian male for marriage completely. If he is more holistic, then he is searching for a soul mate. Love yourself and your Aquarius male will too!<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
