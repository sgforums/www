She needs to know she is the center piece of your thoughts, don't take her for granted. She likes money, but has the foresight to be patient if you have the potential to achieve it. Be sure that you have a future to talk about. When aroused to anger, she can become acidic and raucous, so thicken your skin and turn a deaf ear. She'll probably forget what she said or how angry she was within a half hour. Watch your behavior and be discreet, because she is concerned what others will think or say about her. A few don'ts: Don't show that you are the least bit defeated by anything. Always appear undaunted by even the most trying circumstances. Don't be peevish or vacillating, be happy and positive instead.

Polish up your technique. She's quite frank and outspoken and occasionally forgets to think before speaking, so prepare yourself for a few shockers. She's independent and capable but she still needs a strong man to anchor onto. Show her your strong dependable nature, not weakness. She'll test you to see if you are weak, so don't let her intimidate you, tell her to shut up and ignore the ruse.

A few don'ts: Don't try bossing her around, ask or suggest diplomatically. Don't get affectionate or too showy in public with her. Wait until you are in private to turn up the steam.
