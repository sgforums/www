              <p>Danielle Young, who has two wombs, has revealed her experience of carrying twins. Each baby was in a separate womb. <br><br>The woman from UK was diagnosed with a bicornuate uterus at the age of 18.<br><br>Bicornuate
               uterus, also known as a uterus with two horns, is a condition where the
               womb is completely split in two and the two halves are sealed off from 
              each other, making two separate wombs.<br><br>However, the small size of her wombs would make it difficult to carry a child to full term.<br><br>Diagnosed
               with a host of other reproductive complications as well, Young knew she
               had to face the possibility of never becoming a mother. <br><br>However,
               since she loved children she, together with her 39-year-old husband, 
              requested for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment to increase their 
              chances of conceiving.<br><br>Danielle, who loves children, unexpectedly
               got pregnant before the IVF treatment even began. She gave birth to her
               eldest child, Paige, in February 2007.<br><br>So when it was discovered
               that she was carrying a baby in each womb, a five million to one 
              chance, doctors told her to prepare for the fact that she might lose 
              both babies. <br><br>At six months, Danielle went into premature labour forcing an emergency Caesarean.  <br><br>Doctors successfully delivered Joshua, who weighed in at 1.08kg, and Leah, weighing just 960g.<br><br>The
               twins had to be kept in hospital for a few months before they were 
              discharged. They recently celebrated their fourth birthday and are now 
              the correct height and weight for their age.Â </p>
