            <div class='col-md body'>Last week a 3 year old girl in South Africa was beaten<br>&gt; &gt; and raped. She is still alive. The man responsible<br>&gt; &gt; was released on bail yesterday. He is walking the<br>&gt; &gt; streets. If you are too busy to read this then just<br>&gt; &gt; sign your name and forward this on.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; The Government is planning to close the child<br>&gt; &gt; protection unit and this is a petition against it.<br>&gt; &gt; This is a very important petition. It is an essential<br>&gt; &gt; part of the justice system for children. You may have<br>&gt; &gt; already heard that there's a myth in South Africa<br>&gt; &gt; that having sex with a virgin will cure AIDS. The<br>&gt; &gt; younger the virgin, the more potent the cure. This<br>&gt; &gt; has led to an epidemic of rapes by infected males,<br>&gt; &gt; with the correspondent infection of innocent kids.<br>&gt; &gt; Many have died in these cruel rapes.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Recently in Cape Town , a 9-month-old baby was raped<br>&gt; &gt; by 6 men. Please think about that for a moment. The<br>&gt; &gt; child abuse situation is now reaching catastrophic<br>&gt; &gt; proportions and if we don't do something, then who<br>&gt; &gt; will?<br></div>
