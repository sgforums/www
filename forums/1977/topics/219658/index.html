            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Comprehending Engineers -Take Three</strong><br><br>A pastor, a doctor, and an engineer were waiting one morning for a particularly slow group of golfers. The engineer fumed, "What's with these guys? We must have been waiting for 15 minutes!"<br><br>The doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've never seen such ineptitude".<br><br>The pastor said, "Hey, here comes the greens keeper. Let's have a word with him." "Hi John. Say, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they?"<br><br>The greens keeper replied, "Oh, yes, that's a group of blind firefighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we always let them play for free anytime."<br><br>The group was silent for a moment. Then the pastor said, "That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight." The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them."<br><br>The engineer, after much thought said, "Why can't these guys play at night?"</div>
