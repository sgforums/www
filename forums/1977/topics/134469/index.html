            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Just before the lightsaber battle between Mace Windu and Darth Sidious, we see the lightsaber of Sidious ejected from his sleeve and he grabs it with his finger down the length of it. We then instantly cut to a wide shot and he's suddenly gripping it with all his fingers curled in. Submitted by Christoph Galuschka<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> While Anakin and Palpatine are talking at the performance, in one shot of Anakin we see Palpatine turn his head side on to the camera and drop his chin to his chest. In the very next shot he's holding his head high. Submitted by Jon Sandys<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> On Utapau, when Obi-wan faces off with Grievous, Grievous sends 4 magma droids at Obi-wan. Obi-wan force-pulls something from the ceiling to crush the droids. But in the ensuing fight between Obi-wan and Grievous afterwards, the ceiling thing and crushed droids are gone.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In the Mace Windu/Palpatine fight scene, the glass window is shattered after being hit by a lightsaber. However, while Palpatine is talking to Anakin after the fight, you can still see Anakin's reflection in the space where the glass was.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In the scene where Anakin arrives on Mustafar and tells R2-D2 to stay with the ship, as he pulls the hood of his robe over his head, his mechanical hand is on his left hand and not on his right as it should be.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When Anakin is in the medical centre lying on his back being transformed into Darth Vader, you can see the main part of the mask being lowered into place but Anakin is not wearing the neck section of the mask that it connects to. We then see the main part lowering directly downwards, in the next shot the neck section is in place.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Near the start, as Anakin and the politicians start walking away, Jar-Jar says "excuse me" to a large blue creature next to him. In the next, wider shot, there's now another creature between them. Submitted by Jon Sandys<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> During the scene of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader, there is a close up shot of his face just before his helmet is put in place. All of his face is shown as being badly burned with the exception of his eyelashes, which are still impossibly there. Subjecting one's face to any heat source hot enough to sear one's face will also burn away one's eyelashes as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Anakin has his lightsaber in his hands immediately after having his handcuffs cut off on the bridge of General Grievous' ship. In the next shot, he has to force-retrieve it from Grievous.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When Obi-Wan meets Anakin on the landing bay of the volcanic planet, Obi-Wan comes down the ramp from the ship and removes his cloak. It lays across the end of the ramp. The shot changes, then comes back, and the cloak is now bunched off to one side.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When Anakin has just had the bad dream, Padme comes out wearing the nightdress with rows of beads around her arms. In one shot, the beads on her right arm are twisted, in the next, they're straight again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When Mace Windu and Palpatine are in his office after the lightsaber battle, Palpatine scrabbles into the corner as Windu paces towards him, ending up directly over him with lightsaber pointed at his throat. As Anakin walks in, Palpatine is already backed into the corner and Windu needs a few paces to get to him.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When Samuel L. Jackson says "I don't think the boy can handle it, I don't trust him" his lips don't match his dialogue when he says "I don't trust him".<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> After the crash landing on Coruscant, Anakin, Kenobi, and Palpatine take a shuttle to the Jedi Council. In the first shot as the shuttle is landing, all shadows are parallel with the edge of the landing area. In the next shot when the shuttle doors open, all shadows have shifted 45-degrees clockwise.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> During Obi-Wan's departure scene on Coruscant, when he is telling Anakin how proud he is of him, Obi-Wan's eye color shifts from Ewan McGregor's' natural blue-green eyes to a dark brown.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> During the Anakin/Obi-Wan fight scene Obi Wan switches lightsabers with Anakin. When Anakin is strangling him we can definitely see that Obi-Wan is holding Anakin's lightsaber in his right hand (note the hilt design), but when the shot is reversed Obi-Wan is holding his own lightsaber in that hand.</div>
