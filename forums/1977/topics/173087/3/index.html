The new hostel is going to be there for 20 yrs.  they should calculate returns based on 20 yrs on university grounds, and worse in jurong area.<br><br>i believe most students are of voting age, they should let their votes say on how the ruling gov policy on pay and pay.<br><br>Every thing will increase in multiples as the gov wants people to absorb cost so that they can have huge surplus and boost how good they are at handle nation wealth.  The gov can be very rich if they subsidised less and make people pay and pay even more.  Its called make the people bear the money problem.</div>

Public institutions like NTU receive government funding through our taxes and it is not right to double charge by trying to recoup the full commercial costs of facilities.<br><br>Perhaps this is a preparatory step for the government to completely cut off all government funding and make the Unis run like private institutions. In which case, what is the government doing with the more than $10k of tax I pay each year?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

There was strong resistance, especially from Hall Three residents. The increase for them is the highest as they will be moving into a new seven-storey building complete with "premium" features such as air-conditioners, lifts and electronic card access.<br><br>According to Hall Three's president Lim Joo Tian, 23, a third-year Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering student, some 640 residents were supposed to move over from the old hostel - which was built more than two decades ago - to the new Hall Three by the start of this month.<br><br>But as of Thursday, more than half had not done so, he said.<br><br>Today understands that the students want the university to reduce the proposed fee hike and to stagger it.<br><br>Mr Lim, who has not moved out from the old hostel himself, added: "We sent a proposal to the administration about one or two weeks ago and we are waiting for a reply. Initially, we were given a deadline to move out by Jan 3 ... we expect the situation to be resolved in about three weeks."<br><br>For their old hostel, Hall Three residents paid $160 per month for single rooms and $135 for double rooms. The fees will rise to $350 for single rooms and $240 for double rooms for the new premises.<br><br>However, for the first six months, residents will pay concessionary room rates of $240 and $180 for single and double rooms respectively.<br><br>According to NTU, all hostel fees are already subsidised by up to 50 per cent. Also, an Office of Financial Assistance was set up to help needy students.<br><br>In June last year, the residents were told by the administration that the new rates would fall between $175 and $190.<br><br>Mr Luke How, 24, a final-year Biological Sciences student who was the previous president of Hall Three, told Today that the residents want the raised fees to be nearer to those indicative rates. - TODAY<br><br></div></blockquote>wow my weekly rent alreay costs the same as a month's rent in sg. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>sg so small take bus take train drive car all still complain long? too good life liao is it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
