Anyway, there's not much description about Du Gu Qiu Bai and Xiao Yao Zi..<br>However, the skills from Xiao Yao Bai are really exaggerating and out of this world as compare to the rest in Tian Long Ba Bu. Both Ling Bo Wei Bu and Bei Ming Shen Gong are from Xiao Yao Pai. Both Tian Shan Tong Lao and his Si Jie are also from Xiao Yao Pai. And their ability to regain their youth is simply out of this world. And even the chess game set up by Xiao Yao Zi can drive those highly skilled ppl crazy..<br>As for Dugu, his name already tells everything... He can't be defeated... at least in his lifetime and it's hard to tell if anyone in later generation can defeat him..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like to share with what I know and also my opinion regarding some of JY's novels:<br><br>i)Regarding the "library" monk, it is of my opinion that it's Dharma himself. After all, I seem to recall that the monk said that in order to learn all the skills in the library, one must have a high level of Buddhist enlightenment. The higher of enlightenment, the more skills the person can learn due to the skills themselves having the ability to "pollute" the mind of the learner. Who has the highest enlightenment level in Shaolin. Dharma, of course! Reaching Nirvana is a step, but does that mean the person will go to Heaven? I myself don't think so. Maybe Dharma "yin xing mai ming" stay in library.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>ii)Jiu Yang Shen Gong is more like a skill designed to improve the nei li(internal strength) etc of the person. In typical RPG-talk, it helps to increase his stats but he does not really learn any new attack or magic spell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>iii)Qiao Feng does know how to execute the full Xiang Long 18 Palms. What I read from the Condor Heroes comics is that what Guo Jing attained is being able to effectively mix and control the two skills of Jiu Ying Zhen Jing and Xiang Long 18 Palms. All of them know the full 18 strokes, but Guo Jing is seemingly the only one who, with the foundation of Jiu Ying Zhen Jing, is about to have the internal strength needed to use the 18 strokes masterfully.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>iv)Du Gu 9 Jian, as the name suggests, has 9 strokes. I once saw a Taiwanese Jin Yong game show where every question is based on Jin Yong's novels. One of the final round questions in one of the episodes was "Name all the 9 strokes". I remembered the following:<br><br>Po Jian Si, Po Dao Si, Po Qiang Si, Po Kun Si, Po Bian Si.....basically the 8 common weapons used then. (Paiseh.....  :lol<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I believe these are the 8 strokes Du Gu Jiu Bai initally mastered. The last stroke is called "Po Qi Si", essentially, "breaking the opponent's internal strength" and what I believed to be the 9th stroke. Makes sense, right? To be able to break the opponent's qi, you must have a lot of qi to do that.<br><br>Questions:<br><br>i)Any novel detailing the lives of Huang Shan and Du Gu Jiu Bai? I am still quite mesmerized by these two characters, possibly the strongest in JY novels.<br><br>ii)The "white maiden" who appeared at the end of the Heavenly Sword, Dragon Sabre drama and defeated Zhou Zhiruo.....is she for real? Who is she? I have some idea but would like some confirmation. It is damn zai to suddenly see her appear, defeat Zhou Zhiruo and then recite the Condor Heroes poem(of course, that's the Tony Leung version).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Does she appear in the novel?<br><br>Just my 2 cents.</div>
