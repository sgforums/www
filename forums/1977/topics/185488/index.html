            <div class='col-md body'>i have always wondered... so what if you do not need cca pts to stay hall? so what if activities are reduced in hall? isn't good for everyone. no need to waste time and money on those stupid self serving prom parties, and unnecessary crap.. i just feel that if u have the money to stay in hostel, u should not be obligated to obtain cca pts by participating in those hall activites. if the students themselves want to be active, they should be active, they do not need cca pts to push them to take part in anything. im glad ntu is taking away this pt systems. students now can stay in hall and have the freedom not to take part in those so called hall activities, which are often time consuming, and not exactly very enriching.<br><br>ppl argued that without point system, no one will be willing to take up those 'sai kang' duties which are necessary for events or programmes to be conducted. if no one is willing to do this 'sai kang', then cancel the programme altogether! what's the big deal??!</div>
