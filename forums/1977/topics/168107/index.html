The nation is religiously diverse as well, with Buddhists, Muslims and Christians.<br><br>Paul Masem, principal of Millis Road Elementary in Jamestown, said his visiting principal wanted to learn about his schoolÂ’s character education program Â— and was surprised to learn Millis Road uses a Singapore-designed math curriculum in its Advanced Learner class.<br><br>Â“We exchanged cards and e-mail addresses so we can continue to have dialogue,Â” he said.<br><br>Tony Burks, principal of the Early College at Guilford, said the Singapore principals found far more in common with their Guilford counterparts than they found differences.<br><br>Â“The beauty of it is that some of the concerns they have are the concerns we have,Â” Burks said.<br><br>The exchange program came about because the Center for Creative Leadership opened a Singapore office in 2003.
