Suddenly her husband burst into the kitchen.<br><br>"Careful...CAREFUL! Put in some more butter! Oh my GOD! You're cooking too many at once. Too MANY! Turn them over. Turn them over NOW! We need more butter. Oh my GOD! Where are we going to get more BUTTER!? Great! Now they're going to STICK! Careful...CAREFUL! I said be CAREFUL! You never listen to me when you're cooking! NEVER! Turn them over! Hurry UP! Are you crazy? Have you lost your MIND? Don't forget to salt them. You KNOW you always forget to salt them. Use the salt. The SALT! Use the SALT!"<br><br>His wife just stared at him. "What in the hell is the matter with you? You think I don't know how to fry a couple of eggs?"<br><br>The husband calmly replied, "I wanted to show you what it feels like to have you sitting next to me when I'm driving."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SYSTEM UPGRADE - HELP!!!<br><br>Dear Tech Support (Male Version),<br><br>Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure.<br><br>In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where it monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Card Night 10.3, Boys Night 2.5 and Saturday Football 5.0 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected.<br><br>I cannot seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run some of my other favourite applications, I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but uninstall does not work on this program. Can you help me PLEASE!<br><br>Dear User,<br><br>This is a very common problem that men complain about but it is mostly due to a primary misconception.<br><br>Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a "UTILITIES &amp;  ENTERTAINMENT" program. Wife 1.0 is an "OPERATING SYSTEM" and designed by its creator to run everything.<br><br>It is unlikely you would be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0. Hidden operating files within your system would cause Girlfriend 7.0 to emulate Wife 1.0, so nothing is gained. It is impossible to uninstall, delete or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this. Some have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0, but end up with more problems than the original system. Look in your manual under "Warnings - Alimony/Child Support".<br><br>I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and just deal with the situation. Having Wife 1.0 installed myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding general partner faults (GPF).  You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur, regardless of their cause.<br><br>The best course of action will be to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE. In any case, avoid excessive use of the "ESC" key because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the operating system will return to normal. The system will run smoothly as long as you take the blame for all the GPF's.<br><br>Wife 1.0 is a great program, but very high maintenance. Consider buying additional software to improve the performance of Wife 1.0. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Chocolates 5.0.  DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary with Short Skirt 3.3. This is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and is likely to cause irreversible damage to the operating system.  Oh and one more thing. Avoid borrowing other people's older Girlfriend programmes because some have undetectable viruses in them. These viruses can spread via your hard drive or floppy disk and affect your Wife 1.0 operating system so badly that you may end up having to purchase a completely new computer and operating system.<br><br>Dear Tech Support (Female Version),<br><br>Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed that the new program began making unexpected changes to the accounting modules, limiting access to flower and jewellery applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Hot-sex 1.0 and Romance 9.9 but installed undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.  Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and HouseCleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system.  I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail.<br><br>Desperate Wife.<br><br>Dear Desperate Wife,<br><br>Keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system.<br><br>Try to enter the command: C:/I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and install Tears 6.2. Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications: Guilty 3.0 and Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to GrumpySilence 2.5, Happyhour 7.0 or Beer 6.1.  Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create "Snoring Loudly" wave files.<br><br>DO NOT install MotherInLaw 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend program.  These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.<br><br>In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly.  Consider buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend HotFood 3.0, Lingerie 5.3 and Keep-a-nice-body 10.1<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE RULES OF BEDROOM GOLF:<br><br>1. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play -- normally one club and two balls.<br><br>2. Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole.<br><br>3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep the balls out of the hole.<br><br>4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.<br><br>5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict the length of the club to avoid damage to the hole.<br><br>6. The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the course owner is satisfied that the play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to play the course again.<br><br>7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon arrival at the course. The experienced player will normally take time to admire the entire course, with special attention to well formed bunkers.<br><br>8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have play on or are currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset course owners have been known to damage a player's equipment for this reason.<br><br>9. Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear along, just in case.<br><br>10. Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly scheduled, particularly when a new course is being played on for the first time. Previous players have been known to become irate if they discover someone else playing what they consider to be a private course.<br><br>11. Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. Some players may be embarrassed if they find the course to be temporarily under repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case.<br><br>12. Players are advised to obtain the course owner's permission before attempting to play the back nine.<br><br>13. Slow play is encouraged; however, players should be prepared to proceed at a quicker pace, at least temporarily, at the course owner's request.<br><br>14. It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the same hole several times in one match.<br><br>15. The course owner will be the sole judge of who is the best player.<br><br>** Players are advised to think twice before considering membership at a given course.<br><br>Additional assessments may be levied by the course owner and the rules are subject to change. For this reason, many players prefer to continue to play several different courses.**<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
