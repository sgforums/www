I had it suspended when I got my fifth DUI.<br><br>Officer: May I see the registration for this vehicle?<br>Driver: It's not my car. I stole it.<br><br>Officer: The car is stolen?<br>Driver: That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's card in the glove box when I was putting my gun in there.<br><br>Officer: There's a gun in the glove box?<br>Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the owner and stuffed her in the trunk.<br><br>Officer: There's a body in the trunk?!?<br>Driver: Yes, sir.<br><br>Hearing this, the officer immediately called his captain. The car was quickly surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver to handle the tense situation:<br><br>Captain: Sir, can I see your license?<br>Driver: Sure. Here it is. It is valid.<br><br>Captain: Whose car is this?<br>Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the registration. The driver owned the car.<br><br>Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a gun in it?<br>Driver: Gun? What gun? There's no gun in there.<br><br>Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box.<br><br>Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said there's a body in there.<br>Driver: I said what???<br><br>And of course, there is no body in the trunk.<br><br>Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the glove box, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.<br>Driver: Yeah, and I'll bet he told you I was speeding too!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Good way to avoid the ticket <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BLIND MAN<br><br>There was a blind man who decided to visit Texas.<br><br>When he arrived on the plane, he felt the seats and said, "Wow, these seats are big!" The person next to him answered, "Everything is big in Texas."<br><br>When he finally arrived in Texas, he decided to visit a bar. Upon arriving in the bar, he ordered a beer and got a mug placed between his hands. He exclaimed, "Wow these mugs are big!" The bartender replied, "Everything is big in Texas."<br><br>After a couple of beers, the blind man asked the bartender where the bathroom was located. The bartender replied, "Second door to the right." The blind man headed for the bathroom, but accidentally tripped over and skipped the second door. Instead, he entered the third door, which lead to the swimming pool and fell into the pool by accident. Scared to death, the blind man started shouting, "Don't flush, don't flush!"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Wiping away her tears,he<br>asked her to make love with him. Of course she agreed and they made<br>passionate love.<br><br>Six hours later, Dave went to her again, and said, "Honey, now I only have 18 hours left to live. Maybe we could make love again?"<br><br>Mary agreed and again they made love.Later, Dave was getting into bed<br>when he realized he now had only eight hours of life left.<br><br>He touched Mary's shoulder and said, "Honey? Please?Just one more time<br>before I die." She agreed, then afterward she rolled over and fell asleep.<br>Dave, however, heard the clock ticking in his head, and he tossed and<br>turned until he was down to only four more hours. He tapped his wife on the shoulder to wake her up.eft! Could we...?"<br><br>His wife sat up abruptly, turned to him and said, "Listen Dave, I have to<br>get up in the morning!

Jim picked the number 8, and the gas station<br>owner said, "You were close. The number was 7. Sorry,<br>no sex this time."<br><br>A week later Jim, along with his buddy Bill, pulled<br>into the station. Jim filled his gas tank, and again<br>asked for his free sex. The station owner gave him the<br>same story again, and asked him to guess a<br>number. This time, Jim guessed 2. The station owner<br>said, "Sorry, the correct number was 3. You were<br>close, but no free sex this time."<br><br>As they were driving away from the gasoline station,<br>Jim said to Bill, "I think that game is rigged, and he<br>doesn't really give away free sex."<br><br>Bill replied, "No it ain't rigged Jim.

The King quickly summoned Nick the Dragon Slayer. Horatio the Physician then slipped Nick the Dragon Slayer the antidote for the itching powder which he quickly put into his mouth, and, for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's voluptuous and magnificent boobs.<br><br>The Queen's itching was eventually relieved and Nick the Dragon Slayer<br>left both satisfied and touted as a hero.
