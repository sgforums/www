            <div class='col-md body'>I've seen scam emails which try to capitalise on recent tragedies (e.g. unclaimed funds of victims of recent terrorist attacks, plane crashes, etc). Such asswipe scammers try to capitalise on the misfortune of others to make a quick buck. I wonder how these buggers can sleep soundly at night. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I honestly will not be totally surprised if they soon come up with an email talking about 'unclaimed funds' left behind by 'a victim of the recent Virginia Tech shootings'.
