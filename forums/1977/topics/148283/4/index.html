It's respective de-installer will consolidate all relevant files and trash it once and for all.<br><br>Do the repair of Disk Permission with the following steps:<br>1) Look in the "Applications" folder for a folder called "Utilities."<br><br>2) Double-click on the "Utilities" folder to open it.<br><br>3) Double-click on DISK UTILITY program.<br><br>4) When the Disk Utility program starts, it will display a window. In the left 'pane' of this window, click once on the name of your hard drive (probably "Macintosh HD" unless you've changed it).<br><br>5) In the right 'pane' of this window, click the tab "First Aid."<br><br>6) Click the button marked "Repair Disk Permissions."<br><br>Do not Quit the Disk Utility program until repair is complete (probably no less than 10 minutes).<br><br>You can't log out, shut down or restart while Disk Utility runs, but you can run other programs (e.g. check e-mail etc.).<br><br>7) When Disk Utility is finished, you can Quit the program.<br><br>8 ) Done!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Repeat</span> this procedure every month or so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Apple sued over iPod related hearing loss</strong><br><br>2/2/2006 9:41:36 AM, by Ryan Paul<br><br>John Patterson of Louisana has filed a lawsuit against iPod maker Apple, claiming that the popular portable music players are "inherently defective in design and are not sufficiently adorned with adequate warnings regarding the likelihood of hearing loss." Patterson is asking for cash in unspecified quantity, and iPod upgrades designed to protect users from accidental hearing loss. Although Patterson himself does not claim to have actually suffered hearing loss, the complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in San Jose claims that the capacity of the device to exceed 115 decibels presents a legitimate risk. Patterson has not issued any public statement, but his attorney Steve Berman explained Patterson's reasons for pursuing the case:<br><br><span style="color: red;">    "He's bought a product which is not safe to use as currently sold on the market. He's paying for a product that's defective, and the law is pretty clear that if someone sold you a defective product they have a duty to repair it."</span><br><br>Apple already includes a cautionary notice with the documentation of every iPod, which warns that "permanent hearing loss may occur if earphones or headphones are used at high volume." Patterson considers this warning inadequate, and wants something to be done about it. It is unlikely Apple will readily compromise the glossy iPod aesthetic by adorning the music player with permanent warning messages, but fears of legal liability in an overly litigious society may force the issue. This isn't the first time that iPod-related hearing loss concerns have afflicted the company. Stringent foreign regulations forced Apple to impose a 100 decibel limitation on all the units sold in France. That kind of restriction is not enough for Patterson, who also claims in his legal complaint that the ubiquitous white ear buds shipped with the music player increase the risk of hearing loss because of their proximity to the ear canal.<br><br>Audiologists have been concerned about portable music player induced hearing loss for quite some time now. Apparently, the iPod does not pose a greater threat than any other portable music player, and responsible listening makes the risks entirely controllable. An article from Times Online last month includes some relevant quotations from audiologist Angela King, who explains hearing loss:<br><br><span style="color: red;">    "People with good hearing have tiny hair cells that line the inner ear and transmit signals to the brain, which it interprets as sound," King explains. When repeatedly exposed to uncomfortably loud noises (loud is defined as above 80dB), including music through headphones and at concerts, those hair cells require a rush of blood or oxygen, otherwise "they effectively die". Temporary hearing loss or tinnitus (ringing in the ears) is a sign that hair cells are trying to recover, but "over time recovery becomes impossible and hearing is permanently impaired".</span><br><br>According to the article, audiologists recommend reducing volume and limiting listening time to approximately an hour a day. Manufacturers recommend taking frequent listening breaks in order to give the ears a chance to rest. The article also includes some interesting statistics from the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, which state that 39 percent of listeners between 18 and 24 years of age do not use safe listening habits.<br><br>The risk of hearing loss is clearly real, and some listeners are clearly not taking steps to reduce exposure to detrimental noise. Patterson may have suffered hearing loss from listening to his iPod too loudly, but is a lawsuit really the best solution, and should Apple really be held responsible for the choices made by its users? Lawsuits have a way of drowning out personal responsibility and common sense with the siren song of easy settlement money. One could argue that companies like Apple have a societal responsibility to limit damage that could potentially be caused by their products, but one could also argue that imposing unnecessary limitations reduces the personal freedom of consumers that use products responsibly as well as consumers that are willing to take the risks. If an iPod owner wants to crank up the volume for just a few minutes to enjoy their favorite song, should Apple be required to prevent them from doing so?<br><br>Patterson's claim that the iPod is inherently defective also calls for closer scrutiny. When used incorrectly, many electronic devices pose risk of injury. Widely available medical literature as well as documentation distributed with the device by Apple clearly present the risks of detrimental listening habits, and the user is able to control the volume and use the device in a way that does not negatively affect hearing. Should vehicles be considered defective because they can facilitate unsafe driving? Should file browsing software be considered defective because it enables users to accidentally delete files? Obviously there is a gradient. A file manager incapable of providing optional warnings is certainly deficient if not defective, and the same is true of a vehicle that lacks a speedometer.<br><br>There are also some broader implications here that impact consumers. This kind of litigation costs companies a lot of money, and a company that has to pay out a hefty settlement may be forced to increase the price of their goods in order to make an adequate profit. Worse than that, companies may decide to invest less of their resources in developing innovative new products in order to avoid the risk of litigation in the future, a fear that has been voiced in the wake of the MGM v. Grokster decision. Although civil law provides consumers with a valuable way to protect themselves from exploitation, detrimental litigation can impede progress and make goods less affordable for consumers. Since Patterson has not actually suffered hearing loss, it might be better for him to consider collaborating with Apple to increase awareness of the problem and find a mutually beneficial solution, even if it doesn't involve someone paying someone else a large sum of money.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060202-6100.html" rel="nofollow">http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060202-6100.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is interesting...Win XP on Intel-Macs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Source <a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/03/16/xponmac/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/03/16/xponmac/index.php</a><br><br>Hackers get Windows XP working on Intel Mac<br><br>A contest to see who could get Windows XP working first on an Intel Mac has been won, according to the contestÂ’s coordinator, Colin Nederkoorn. The Windows XP on an Intel Mac page provides a link to a download that includes software and instructions for use.<br><br>Nederkoorn first put the contest together after he ordered an Intel-based MacBook Pro for work.<br><br>Â“I told my boss that this would replace my IBM desktop and I could boot Windows XP on it,Â” he said, and to put his money where his mouth was, he put up $100. He suggested that others with an interest in seeing a dual-boot Macintosh do the same.<br><br>To date, the contest has raised over $13,854 in donations, including significant additions from Digital Express, Delicious Monster and Uneasy Silence. Nederkoorn says that any further donations will go to support an open source project created to maintain the work thatÂ’s already been done.<br><br>News that Windows XP was working natively on an Intel-based iMac first came to light several days ago, when two enterprising users who go by the monikers Â“narf2006Â” and Â“blankaÂ” posted pictures to an account on the Flickr photoblogging service purportedly showing Windows being installed on the system. A video followed, and the solution has since been verified by Nederkoorn and his testers.<br><br>Getting Windows XP to work on the Mac is not a plug and play process. According to the documentation included with the file download provided on NederkoornÂ’s Web site, users must create an install CD themselves using a PC equipped with a CD-R drive, MicrosoftÂ’s Windows XP SP 2 CD-ROM and Nero CD burning software. Step by step instructions for creating the disc are included.<br><br>Users must also reformat and repartition their Intel MacÂ’s hard disk drive to include a separate partition where Windows XP can be installed, then go through a multi-step process to make sure the software is installed properly and the Mac can recognize it.<br><br>Once thatÂ’s done, users will be able to switch between Mac OS X and Windows after rebooting the Mac.<br><br>Nederkoorn notes that with this process in place, all three current Intel-based Mac models can run Windows with the exception of the 20-inch iMac. He also offers a variety of caveats Â— native graphics drivers arenÂ’t in place yet, for example, so there is limited video performance Â— a blow to Mac gamers who had hoped for a solution that would let them play Windows games on their new Mac hardware.<br><br>Â“There is no chance you could play a game using this solution, aside from minesweeper,Â” said Nederkoorn. Â“It looks like a fix for this may be a ways off yet.Â”<br><br>The Apple Remote and the iSight webcam donÂ’t seem to work yet, either.<br><br>Windows XP is already able to work on Intel Macs, but only through the use of machine emulators, which work more slowly than many users would like. The most popular emulator, MicrosoftÂ’s Virtual PC, does not yet support Intel-based Mac hardware, and Microsoft has not yet indicated if or when an Intel version might be released.<br><br>Hope that Macs might support Windows out of the box dwindled last week during the Intel Developers Forum, when a Microsoft rep told attendees that Windows Vista will not support EFI, the boot technology used by Macs, at least until a server version is ready in 2007. And even then, Microsoft said the support will be restricted to machines that use 64-bit processors. AppleÂ’s current crop of Intel Macs use 32-bit processors.<br><br>In order to claim the prize, the winners had to avoid using emulation. They also had to avoid using virtualization software such as VMWare, which allow multiple operating systems to work on a single computer simultaneously.<br><br></div>
