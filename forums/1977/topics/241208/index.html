            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese diaspora: Britain<br><br>As part of the BBC's China Week, Tim Luard looks at the Chinese community in the UK, the first of a series of articles on the Chinese diaspora.<br><br>As China rises in the East, big changes are also taking place in the size, make-up and status of the Chinese community in Britain.<br><br>While the bustling, brightly coloured Chinatowns in the centres of otherwise grey and sedate cities like London and Liverpool may be hard to miss - with their oriental arches and red telephone boxes turned into pagodas - the Chinese themselves are often called Britain's "hidden minority".<br><br>Yet the stereotype image of someone in a street-corner takeaway writing down orders for egg fried rice is almost as out-dated as the picture many Britons still have of a China full of peasants in blue tunics, waving little red books.<br><br>Johnny Hon is chairman of a venture capital company based in one of the most luxurious new tower blocks in London's Canary Wharf district - similar in style to the high-rise temples of finance now to be seen in Shanghai and other Chinese cities.<br><br>In one of his suite of offices, banks of TV screens flash up market figures; in another hangs a picture of Tony Blair with the signed inscription: "To Johnny and all at Global".<br><br>Hon, who is 33 and came to Britain from Hong Kong at the age of 12, is due to meet at least four other prime ministers on a quick business trip he's about to make to the Caribbean.<br><br>He also makes frequent trips to Beijing - and, naturally, he has friends in the government there too.<br><br>"I help British companies go to China and help Chinese ones looking to raise funds or invest in the UK," he explained.<br><br>He believes at least part of the reason for China's dynamic growth is that Chinese are hard workers and good at business - something that also helps explain the rising profile and prosperity of Britain's Chinese community.<br><br>According to the last census, in 2001, there were 250,000 Chinese in Britain - almost 100,000 more than 10 years previously.<br><br>Today they are among the highest-earning groups in Britain - and the most likely of all groups to do well at school.<br><br>British schools and universities now educate more students from China - about 60,000 - than from any other country.<br><br>China's leaders say they are the cream of the country's youth and will get good jobs when they return, even though many choose to stay on in the UK.<br><br>Historical links<br><br>The country's first Chinese immigrants were 19th century sailors who settled in Liverpool and London's Limehouse district - next door to the gleaming skyscrapers of today's Canary Wharf, but at that time a rough area of docks, brothels and opium dens.<br><br>In the 1950s and '60s came a much bigger influx - of farmers from Hong Kong. The collapse of traditional agriculture in the colony's rural New Territories happily coincided with the development of a British taste for foreign food. Soon almost every town boasted its own Chinese restaurant.<br><br>Ethnic Chinese also arrived from all over South East Asia, settling down to make a quiet living in a way that aroused far less attention than has often been the case with other ethnic minorities.<br><br>"We may be from many different countries, but we Chinese all work here together like one family," said Millie Lee, a restaurant worker who came in the early 1980s along with other "boat people" from Vietnam.<br><br>"It's as if we got lost and came together," she said.<br><br>As China opens up, a growing proportion of British Chinese, these days, come from the mainland.<br><br>But even the ones who have never been there still tend to regard China as "home" - if only the home of their ancestors.<br><br>Until recently, many felt sad, or even ashamed, at their mother country's poverty and backwardness. Fong Fu remembers the southern Chinese province of Guangdong as a place of poor villages with no toilets. Reports of its transformation into the workshop of the world have made her feel proud, and perhaps also more confident and assertive.<br><br>"We Chinese do well wherever we are," she said, as she outlined her plans to move on from being a waitress.<br><br>CHINA'S DIASPORA<br><br>First major emigration in 14th-16thC by traders and seafarers<br>Colonial powers used Chinese as labourers in SE Asia and the Americas<br>But also have reputation for business success<br>There are about 30m overseas Chinese in total<br>Indonesia and Thailand have the biggest numbers - 7-9m each (estimates)<br>Singapore has the highest concentration - 3m, or 75% of its population<br><br>"We know how to use our opportunities. We work for others for the first three years. But after that we become the boss."<br><br>New mobility<br><br>The Chinese now coming to Britain - as well as the children of those who arrived earlier - no longer feel the need to find work in catering or other parts of an "ethnic economy", according to Dr Frank Pieke, a specialist on Chinese migration at Oxford University.<br><br>"Chinese, like others, are increasingly adopting a mobile, transnational lifestyle, moving from one job and one country to another as new opportunities present themselves," he said.<br><br>True, there are some, like the cockle-pickers who died at Morecambe Bay last year, who pay large sums to come here and then find themselves in jobs at the lowest end of the social scale.<br><br>But some 50,000 of Britain's Chinese - 20% of the total - now have jobs in law, medicine and other professions. Zhu Yonggen is working as a software engineer in Derby. His lifestyle, food and culture remain Chinese, and he and his family keep a close eye on events at home via the internet and the overseas version of the People's Daily.<br><br>"We also talk about China with our British friends," he said. "The British are becoming much more aware about our country".<br><br>The first Chinese to become a British Lord believes Britain is taking more notice not only of China but also of the Chinese community who live here.<br><br>Lord Chan - honoured for his work in medical science - said it was significant that this year's Chinese New Year celebrations in London had been attended for the first time by the foreign secretary.<br><br>"We used to be seen as newcomers, only here temporarily," he said.<br><br>"Chinese have lived and died here for a long time and will continue to do so. But it's only now that China's new prominence has finally focused attention on us."<br><br><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4304845.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4304845.stm</a></div>
