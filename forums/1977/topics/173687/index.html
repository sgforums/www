Speaking at the company's annual Macworld conference in San Francisco, Jobs also said the company's online iTunes store has sold 850 million songs.<br><br>The strong demand for iPods helped fuel a 63 percent jump in revenue to a record $5.7 billion during the holiday quarter compared with a year earlier, and near the high end of Wall Street forecasts.<br><br>Jobs also told the packed convention center that the company could have sold even more of the portable music players.<br><br>"And it still wasn't enough," Jobs said. "More iPods are on the way."<br>MacBook Pro<br><br>Apple also introduced new computers based on Intel Corp. chips, the first to result from its decision to switch from IBM PowerPC chips it had used for years.<br><br>Jobs said the company's new line of iMac computers would come in the same shape and sizes as the existing G5 line of iMacs, with starting prices at $1,299.<br><br>The new Apple computers are based on Intel Core Duo microchips and are set to begin shipping on Tuesday, with the entire Macintosh line moving to Intel chips this year, the company said. It also introduced a new high-end laptop called the MacBook Pro that will replace its PowerBook series, starting in February at prices beginning at $1,999.<br><br>"The new iMac is two to three times faster than the iMac G5," Jobs said in a speech introducing a range of new products that also included a remote control with FM radio capabilities for its iPod music player.<br><br>The company also updated its iLife photo and media software as a new version of its suite of digital media editing tools for use in organizing and editing music, photos and movies and Web sites. The $79 price of iLife includes the ability to edit high-definition videos. (Watch the demo of easy, breezy Web pages with music --4:43)<br><br>Jobs also unveiled remote control with FM radio capabilities for the iPod.<br><br>The iPod Radio Remote enables users to skip tracks and adjust the volume of their iPod even when it's in a pocket or backpack and listen to FM radio stations while displaying station and song information on their iPod screen.<br><br>While the iPod faithful focused on new products, investors cheered the company's strong holiday quarter.<br>Apple sales<br><br>Wall Street analysts on average were expecting Apple to post revenue for the fiscal first quarter ending in December of $5.04 billion compared with $3.49 billion a year ago, according to Reuters estimates. Forecasts ranged from $4.69 billion to $5.85 billion.<br><br>"Apple blew away revenue and iPod estimates," Soleil-Cross research analyst Shannon Cross said. "And if you extrapolate the numbers, they will likely beat EPS (earnings per share) estimates as well."<br><br>The iPod devices have quickly gained the lion's share of the digital music-machine market and helped send Apple stock up 145 percent since the start of 2005.<br><br>Jupiter Research digital music analyst Michael Gartenberg said the iPod's strong holiday sales provide more evidence that rivals are having a tough time in their bid to unseat Apple as the dominant player in the digital music business.<br><br>"Apple clearly had a runaway fourth quarter --14 million is an incredible number for them to have sold," he said. "It clearly solidifies their position -- not just as the leading player, but the dominant player."<br><br>Apple has also bolstered its lead with several versions of the iPod, such as the lower-priced Nano and Shuffle. It introduced a video iPod last October along with a deal with Walt Disney Co. to sell television shows such as "Desperate Housewives."<br><br>Analysts have credited the popularity of the devices with reversing Apple's fortunes and have also said Apple's re-emergence in personal computers has hurt sales of Dell Inc. Dell itself has acknowledged that the iPod has revived Apple.<br><br>Apple's growth rate in personal computer sales was the highest among the top five vendors in the third quarter, although it still has only about 4 percent of the overall personal computer market.<br><br>Apple said it sold 1.25 million Macintosh computers during the holiday quarter, when sales at its retail stores were about $1 billion.<br><br>Apple shares were up 5.5 percent at $80.27 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.<br><br>URL: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/ptech/01/10/apple.macworld.reut/index.html?section=cnn_topstories" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/ptech/01/10/apple.macworld.reut/index.html?section=cnn_topstories</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YouÂ’ve dreamed about it long enough. Now it has a name: MacBook Pro. Powered by a dual-core Intel engine. Up to four times the speed of the PowerBook G4. Eight times the graphics bandwidth. With built-in iSight for instant video conferencing on the move. And Front Row with Apple Remote to dazzle everyone in the room. Wait no more. MacBook Pro starts at just $1999.<br><br>New engine, same soul<br><br>This is the first Mac notebook built upon the revolutionary new Intel Core Duo Â— which is actually two processors (up to 1.83GHz) engineered onto a single chip. It provides 2MB of Smart Cache, L2 cache that can be shared between both cores as needed. It delivers higher performance in 2D and 3D graphics, video editing, and music encoding. And the new engine is only part of the story. MacBook Pro has a frontside bus and memory that, at 667MHz, runs faster than any previous Mac notebook. ItÂ’s the first Mac notebook with PCI Express, a Serial ATA hard drive and the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 for superfast graphics performance.<br><br>Embedded reporter<br><br>Sit down. Click on someoneÂ’s iChat icon. And video conference from anywhere in the world. Though you can barely see it, thereÂ’s an iSight camera built into the thin bezel just above the display. So now you can conference with associates during the day and chat with the kids at night. iChat AV lets you video chat with up to three other people simultaneously. MacBook Pro also comes with AppleÂ’s new Photo Booth application, a fun program that lets you take warped and Warholesque snapshots. With the new iLife Â’06 (included, of course), you can even record movies with iSight right into iMovie, then use the new iLifeÂ’s newest application, iWeb, to create a video blog entry or podcast in just a few clicks (2).<br><br>Road show<br><br>The first notebook to deliver the Front Row media experience, MacBook Pro makes it easy (and rather spectacular) to showcase your latest creations. Whether youÂ’re at the clientÂ’s office, on location, or back at your hotel room, you just use the Apple Remote to control your videos, music, movies, and more. Front Row lets you quickly navigate through your work and play from anywhere in the room. You can even use the Apple Remote to navigate through Keynote presentations.<br><br>Do something. Say something. Make something.<br><br>MacBook Pro comes with iLife Â’06, a suite of easy-to-use applications that make it easy for anyone to make postcards, calendars, DVDs, websites and podcasts. Even professionals with proficiencies in high-end applications can appreciate the ease of creating initial compositions. Or posting pictures, videos, and commentary of current events almost before they happened. Enjoy the freedom of the press on MacBook Pro.(2).<br><br><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/</a></div>
