            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The racial issue was the most important reason for the separation in 1965. Do you agree? EYA.</strong><br><br>I disagree with the statement that the raical issue was the most important reason for separation. It was an important reason but there were other reasons and the more important reason was the political factor - the 1963 Singapore general Election, the 1964 Federal Election and the MSC.<br><br>The racial issue arose as the UMNO portrayed the PAP's resettlement, public housing and education policies as anti-Malay so as to arouse the dissatisfaction of Singapore Malays. The 1964 race riots between the Malays and Chinese in Singapore resulted in deaths, destruction and a breakdown in law and order.<br><br>Differences in political aproaches (UMNO's communal and PAP's non-communal appraoaches) was the most important reason for separation. In the 1963 Singapore General Election, UMNO through the SA, did not win any seat and this showed that Singapore Malays did not accept communal politics. The PAP won one seat in the 1964 Federal Election, and this alarmed the UMNO. After the race riots, the PAP formed the MSC to ensure a 'Malaysian Malaysia' and equality of all races. UMNO members demanded the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>The third important reason was the economic factor that inclued few pioneer certificates, the failure of the common market, increased contributions and the Bank of China.<br><br>Political differences was the most important reason for separation; each side was afraid that the other would step into each other's political dominance and arena; evident political problems, racial and economic problems might be lessened with negotiations. Finally, in June 65 when concept of a 'Malaysian Malaysia' - the race riots was used as the excuse for separation.<br><br>There can be no isolation of reasos for the seperation as the politcal and racial problems were related. Political problems led to the racial problem and compunded by economic problems whereby the rationale for merger was not met; the so-called 'marriage of conveniece'(merger_ was caled off and separation was inevitable on 9 Aug 65.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Explain the role played by economic factors in the separation of Singapore from Malaysia.</strong><br><br>Malaysia was formed in 1963 but Singapore separated from Malaysia in 1965. There were many causes for separation: the racial issues arising from communal problems, the poltical factors - the 1963 Singapore General Election, the 1964 Federal Electiona dn the MSC, the econimic factors like few pioneer certificates, the failure of the common market, increased contributions and the Bank of China and finally, the formation of the Malaysian Solidarity Convention.<br><br>The economic reasons were such that they led to a clash of economic interests between the two praties. Singapore was unhappy with the few pioneer certificates issued by KL as KL wanted to protect their own industries. The Common Market was not set up by KL and instead, KL placed high taxes on Singaporean goods entering Malaya. To worsen matters, KL proposed that Singapore had to contribute 20% more (from 40% to 60%) in revenue to KL. KL aslo wanted to close the Bank of China.<br><br>KL always wanted to gain the upper hand in economic returns. KL only granted two pioneer certificates so as to ensure that Singapore wound not establish its industrial development in Malaya. Instead of setting up the Common Market, the Federal government tried to attract foreign investors to Malaya so that foreign investors are discouraged from setting up industires in Singapore. Singapore cound not afford to contribute any more of its revenue to the Federal government. The closure of the Bank of China would produce hardships for Singaporeans as many were involved in trade with China.<br><br>All these economic measures would cripple the economy of Singapore considerably. Thus it was obvious that separation would result as the Federal government was always trying to decrease Singapore's economic growth. In fact, according to Dr Goh Keng Swee, 'Singapore was a dangerouys rival to be kept down at all costs'. Singapore then felt that she was not welcomed in Malaysia and so, separation was inevitable due to the other factors.<br><br>There can be no isolation of reasons for the separation as the political, racial and economic problems were related. Political problems led to the racial problem and compounded by economic problems whereby the rationale for merger was not met; so-called 'marriage of convenice'(merger) was called off and separation was inevitable on 9 aug 65.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Why do international conflicts occur among countries</strong><br><br>International conflicts can take many forms and the most destructive of which is war. Conflicts may be verbal war of words, imposition of sanctions and tariffs, reduction in trade, assembly of navies and armies or even acts of terrorism. Ways to resolve conflict such as clashes and war may result, which may even involve more than two countries. Examples of international armed conflict are the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the Korean War.<br><br>The common causes of conflict are: competition over scare natural resources like fish and water, different values and beliefs like the conflict between democracy and communish in the korean war, and over territorial claims like the china-india war in 1962.<br><br>Another serious cause of conflict is the clash over terroritory. There is no clearly defined border around Aksai Chin and the NEFA between India and China in the mountainous Himalayas. In 1958, China built a road in Aksai Chin and tension increased into fighting. War broke out in 1962 but although it ended qucikly, there have been several border incidents as this issue is still not resolved until today.<br><br>Conflicts that arise between countries can be long lasting and are very damaging to lives, the economy and political stability. It also creates further misunderstandings between the two involved parties that cound result in unnecessary tension. Internation armed conflicts should be avoided at all costs; preferably by using diplomacy as well as deterrance. War is often the last resort as innocent lives are lost and properties are damaged. It will take some time before the country affected by war can recover its economic growth again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Explain how differences in political ideology led to the Korean War.</strong><br><br>Countires with different ideologies can come in conflict if they see that their ideologicla beliefs are threatened. A good example is the conflict between communism and democracy. The result was a world divided by communist countries and democratic countires. Another example is the Korean War from 1950 till 1953 between North and South Korea becuase both practise different political ideologies - North Korea is communist whilst South Korea is democratic.<br><br>After WW2, Korea was divided into 2 halves at the 38th parallel. There was an agreement between USSR(N. Korea) &amp; USA (S. Korea) to temporarily 'share' Korea after the Japanese surrendered in 1945. The USSR refused to allow an election called upon by the UN to establish a single Korean Government. North Korea became a comunist country with USSR's support.<br><br>in 1948, South Korea with American support, held elections and South Korea became the Republic of Korea. So there were two separate Koreas.<br><br>In 1950, war broke out when North Korea became the aggressor as invaded South Korea. The USA and her allies &amp; the UN helped South Korea as they did not want the spread of communist influence. UN troops assisted South Korea and defeated North Korea, capturing Inchon and Seoul. But this was not the end of the conflict. The war became even more complex with the participation of China after the US ordered an invasion of North Korea. Chinese troops pushed the UN troops back into South Korea but a UN counter-attack sent the Chinese and North Koreans back to the north behind the 38th parallel.<br><br>Finally in 1953, a demilitarised zone between the two Koreas was created and there was a signing of agreement to stop the fighting by all participating parties. This was the first time in history that a number of countires grouped together to prevent on country from being overtaken.<br><br>Internation conflictict is undesirable as there are many damaging and far-reaching consequences to many countries. Conflict should be avoided by using diplomacy and deterrence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>How iportant is the citizen armed forces in maintaining Singapore's security and defence? EYA</strong><br><br>The citizen armed force is an important facotr in maintainin Singapore's security and defence but there are other important factors too. Military deterrence is a strategy used by SIngapore to prevent or resolve conflicts and maintain our independence.<br><br>The Japanese Occupation, the Indonesian Confrontation and the 64 race riots have taught Singapore that we need to have our own defence force. So in 1967, National Service was introduced and all 18 year old males have to be called up for full-time service whereby thery are trained to defend their country. Upon completion, these men attend refresher courses and undergo training for the next 13 years. This ensures that there is an armed force ready to defend Singapore at any time. Despite our small population, we have an effective SAF, RSAF, RSN.<br><br>The defence industry of Singapore plays a most crucial role in military deterrence. The defence industry was set up to ensure a supply of arms for our soldiers and to build up our own defence technology. So, weapon systems and ammunition are designed and produced. Even fighter bombers are upgraded with new and more powerful engines. The SAF is self-relian in essential defence weapons and equipment.<br><br>The other factors are: Total Defence for our people so that we are prepared and self-reliant in any emergency. Military co-operation through joint military exercises and training with our neighbours in the Asian Pacific region can take place so that we can improve our defance capabilites.<br><br>The defence industry is the most important factor as Singapore needs to be able to manufacture her own weapons and ammunition as this saves costs and we should not be dependent on others for our defence technology. A trained and ready armed force is next in importanance as it is necessary to maintain friendly relations with the armed forces of other countries by taking part in joint military exercises. Finally, Total Defence is also important as the people of Singapore has to be prepared for any crisis.<br><br>Even though the citizen armed force is an important facotr, all factors are related to help maintain Sigapore's security and defence - no one factor can be isolated.</div>
