S$25,000.00. And the perks is the member will be able to stay at the said resort for free..... a number of days per year.<br>They use force selling just as the same in mlm.<br><br>I went to this company in 2003 with my wife after some telemarketer told me that i had won a free gift from this company. The only catch is i got to sit through a presentation of 1/2 an hour.<br>At that time, my wife was pregnant with our first child. But since the telemarketer  said that the presentation will only be 1/2 an hour, we decided to do the presentation first before dinner.<br>After seeing the slide show, recommending the resort, the salesman carry on with his sales talk. He manage to convince my wife, but i'm not willing to part with my S$25,000.00. So, I declined his offer. He brought his manager to convince me that this is a good deal. I turn the manager down.  It was then the manager announced that i do not love my wife to buy her this gift. And said it in front of other customers.<br>Huh??? What the F**K? what has this package got to do with the love for my wife. I didn't  managed to give him a good F**K, as he wriggle his way away.<br><br>And you know what is the gift? It is a lousy F**king calculator after hearing the talk and presentation for more than 4 hours with no dinner. Really regret. But lesson learned.<br><br>Anyway, beware when you received a call and says that you have won a prize. Please proceed to whichever company to claim it.

More and more companies had sprung up because we are gullible.<br>These companies promise that there will be free stay at the resort but when it comes to the holidays, these resorts are often fully booked. So if you want to go on holidays with your family, the best is still go through travel agencies. At least i think, the travel agencies will be able to provide a decent hotel for your stay.<br></div>

S$ 25,000.00 as a membership fee from the new members. In return, the company promises you, as a new member, that you can use any of their authorised resorts for a number of free days per year. They have resorts in australia and a few countries for their members to stay. However, they dun own the resorts. They also rent the rooms in bulk thus got special rates.<br><br>So, for instances, the company got 10,000 members but only got 100 rooms in this particular resort for the whole year. Therefore, it is 1000 member per room for the usage of 1 year.<br><br>Their booking system is first come first serve. Whoever comes first, get the room with their desire dates. If there is another member that wants to use the room for the same dates, he/she will not get it as the room is already booked. That's if say all the rooms get booked at the same time with the same dates for occupany.<br><br>In the event of peak periods, most of the members wants to use their entilitments, therefore only a small group of members will get to stay at their desire resorts and dates.<br><br>However, if the room is unoccupied during a off peak period, the room will be sublet out by the resort management to other tourists. The rental made from the subletting out, will be discounted from the fees paid by the time share company.<br><br>I hope this clear your doubts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Attached from a mail I received. Enjoy reading <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></strong><br><br>LGM - Unethical Sales &amp; Marketing in Singapore<br><br>Unethical sales and marketing is increasing in Singapore; almost every marketing banner you see has a catch but to cheat a customer upfront is rare. Recently, IÂ’ve been through one such cheat case and I want to share it with you. IÂ’ve painstakingly compiled the events so that you can warn others about it.<br><br>HereÂ’s what happenÂ… A few days before my birthday, Jessie of Dynamics Network Marketing invited me for a Â“birthday celebrationÂ”. She said Â“some companyÂ” is surveying on peopleÂ’s preferred birthday celebration style. If I attend a 1 hr celebration at Takashimaya 16th floor with other Â“birthdayeesÂ”, I will receive free gifts like DVD/MP3 players. However, I need to bring my partner along. It sounded like vacation package to meÂ…<br><br>I was skeptical as many vacation time-sharing company entice people with freebies but Jessie assured there is no selling; just a simple celebration survey. She promised that I will receive the freebies with no charge and the moment I register at Takashimaya #16-01 office. Still skeptical, I asked Jessie to send all information in email.<br><br>So, what happen to me on 27th May 2006 at Takashimaya #16-01 ?!<br>On 27th May 2006, my partner and I stepped into #16-01 and registered our particulars at the reception. There are many couples like us and some with kids along. After registration, I deliberately asked the receptionist for my freebies but they said I need to attend to a 1 hr Â“sessionÂ” first. Session? I thought it was a survey birthday celebration?!<br><br>Jessie promised freebies the moment I register at Takashimaya #16-01 office. She specifically mentioned it was a survey too. Â“Very well, IÂ’ll stay for 1 hr and see how they can twist their wordsÂ”, I thought.<br><br>Shortly, a sales guy named FRANK greeted us and led us to 14th floor office where we saw the company name Â– Leisure Group Marketing (LGM). We sat with FRANK over a round table in a room full of couples; FRANK started his vacation package talk. My skepticism on Jessie was proven right! Immediately, I stopped FRANK and told him this is not right!<br><br>FRANK acted blur and denied anyone named Jessie as they outsourced marketing to another company (thus, not responsible for what they say). So, I complained to an Indian manager about being cheated here! His lame answer was the celebration was about offering me a great vacation package! When I asked where is the VIP and birthday gift presentation, FRANK said he or his manager is the VIP loh! Now, this whole thing is ridiculous! Nevertheless, I am determined to stay for just 1 hr and see what I will get. So, I listened to FRANK talked about discounted vacation at EuropeÂ’s castles, discounted tickets, hotel VIP suites etc.<br><br>There is no celebration/presentation/survey. LGM deny/twist all of JessieÂ’s words. One hourÂ’s up, I stopped FRANK and asked him for the promised gifts right away. Knowing he canÂ’t persuade me, he led me to #16-01 for gift collection. Guess What??!! IÂ’m given 2 stupid vouchers for even small items like MP3 player and digital camera.. No wonder it was stated in Birthday Entitlement Requirement that Â“8. Recipient of some gifts, in particular bulky items, will receive the gift in the form of a redemption voucher that may require standard industry courier billing.Â”.<br><br>Referring to the next 2 pages of the vouchersÂ’ terms and conditions, one is required to make cheque payments to a company named EXPO Management Ltd to receive the Â“birthday giftsÂ”. However, thereÂ’s no guarantee what-you-see-is-what-you-get and they will not entertain any phone enquiry.<br><br>How does LGM cheat you and escape?<br><br>1. First, the Marketing, vacation package Sales and Gift Redemption activities are all handled by seemingly unrelated companies. Thus, each side act blur about what they promise to customers. When I complained to Jessie, she said she donÂ’t know it was about vacation package talk; she was just following orders. So, I was misled because she was misled by her boss. What a good excuseÂ… Just imagine what happen if you send your cheque to redeem say an MP3 player?! You may receive a floppy disk and EXPO Management will say they donÂ’t know what LGM promise too.<br><br>2. Sales guy FRANK refused to give me his name-card or promotional brochure when I asked him for them. ItÂ’s one way to prevent people from circulating information about LGMÂ’s fraud-filled brand name.<br>3. If you send cheques to claim the gifts, you may receive a different item or nothing! Since the voucher stated no phone enquiries will be entertained, youÂ’ve to visit EXPO ManagementÂ’s Office to complain. Hey! But read carefully, the postal address is a PO Box! Complain to a mail box then. 􀀯 YouÂ’ve just donated your money to a company no where to be found. Since itÂ’s a free gift, you canÂ’t complain to CASE too.<br>LGM cheated peopleÂ’s money before!<br><br>Just read the following articles about LGM that I found on the internet.<br>http://www.voy.com/161450/71.html<br>http://www.crimeshare.net/63.html<br><br>LGMÂ’s unethical practices were also confirmed by my friend in legitimate vacation business. He said often these unethical holiday time-share companies use discounted hotel vouchers from their partner travel firms, hotels to give their customers a sense of Â“discounted vacationÂ”. If they run out of vouchers, they will say Â“fully bookedÂ”.<br>For those poor souls who sign up for LGMÂ’s package, they may receive gifts like 43Â” TV etc which is already factor into the high price they paid for! ItÂ’s daylight robbery to me..<br><br>In conclusion, IÂ’ve no regret attended the fraud-filled session at LGM because I finally knew how they cheat people into attending their talks and buying their products. I am amazed at how such companies lie so openly and Â“professionallyÂ”. Through this document, I want to EXPOSE them especially LGM and its marketing/distribution partner.<br><br>The next time you receive a call, SMS, email, letter about freebies, surveys, talks, just throw them away. DonÂ’t believe anything they say even if you think you can hold them liable with their Â“official lettersÂ”. Such companies have no business ethic to even trust a single word.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are many such timeshares companies around. You can always do a check with CASE or the internet for a blacklist.<br><br>However, it must be said, not all timeshare companies are bad. It is a legitimate product actually and even Marriot has a timeshare division. Again like MLM, it is not the product but the sales tactics that give them a bad name.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hrmm, should find out the name of the company. When we've got enough info, I'll write to the papers and ask if anybody regulates and monitors ethical selling. Honestly this is also misrepresentation. If only there was a lawyer who would come and take up these cases, he'd be quite famous and popular cos these are pretty high profile stuff.</div>
