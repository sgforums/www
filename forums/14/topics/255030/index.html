            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I am a MlMer as well, I am still young and learning at this level because I just joined this MlM company for only one month+. However, I am very enthusiastic about this MLM industry because I have done much self-researching such that I am convinced of its benefits that it will bring.<br><br>Because I am perhaps still considered inexperience, therefore I welcome any comments to improve my current ideology in this industry. I also wish to know more from experienced MLMers. Please take it as a sharing topic.<br><br>I hope to make my introduction to the company as objective as possible- to avoid as much flaming as possible too. My only purpose is to share with anyone who wish to be involve in this [type of business], not to compete with anyone or any company.<br><br>Actually.. after reading many books to convince myself on MLM, in the process of researching before joining this MLM company, my opinion on Mlm is generally good. In every industry, there are the good and the bad. Pyramid scam is thus introduced due to the bad company empolying this scheme by, taking advantage of the name of MLM. However, I think it is a mistake to stereotype all MLM companies because of a bad experience or due to a partial info.<br><br>Actually, one of the principle of MLm is to promote a fair distribution of wealth through direct selling too. [How it is done so?? &lt;&lt; I can emphasize more on that if u want to know]<br><br>Forever Living [company]:<br>- Registered under DSAS(Direct Selling Assocation of Singapore) - It is important to be registered under DSAS because the aim of DSAS is to promote fair trading. This is why they employ ethics for company to follow. Under DSAS, in order for the company to be legal, they need to follow the ethics. This is one of the way the Singapore government discipline the MLM companies out there. So, those companies that are not under DSAS, it is not wise to be under them.<br><br>- International company, 120+ countries. You can work in any of these 120 countries. Even if u decide to migrate to Japan one day, u can still work from there. 120+ countries also further emphasize the company's stability and popularity<br><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>Forever Living [Product]<br>- 200+ products [4 categories: Daily-Use Products, Skin-Care, Weight-Management, Supplements]<br><br>- Concecutive top sales in Japan [ A quality sensitive country]<br><br>- Recommendation from various sources [ Newspaper, Magazines, Doctors]<br><br>- Cured serious diseases such as cancer, diabeties<br><br>- Average Price of $30 dollars [Making it affordable for the rich,middle &amp; poor income family]<br><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>Forever Living [Plan]<br>- Highest Bonus among SG's mlm industries [Using Retail price for bonus instead of Wholesale price] *[30% basic commission on products sold]<br><br>*non-significant [Significant- personal bonus(p.b) and volume bonus(v.b) which are too complex to be shown here]<br><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>Facts of Mlm<br>- The Mlm industry is growing at a fast rate *[10-20% of SGean in mlm] [40-60% in some countries] [Extimated: 60-70%]<br>*Consists of Customers and Distributors<br><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>Requirements:<br>1. 18 yrs old and above<br>2.
