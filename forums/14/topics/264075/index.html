Not every healthy person responds positively to supplements and CPM. What's more for someone with medical conditions, especially for 1 who has conditions of the kidney or liver.<br><br>Also FYI, most detox supplements aims to detox via the mechanism of passing bowels, which means that large volumes of fibre and water will be purged from the body. If care is not taken, 1 of the results is dehydration, which can cause a multitude of other conditions, such as fainting, fever, confusion etc.</div>

I think most probably is due to other reasons. I asked my upline in LFI regarding this and he told me that it is not possible. Instead, he did show me tons of testimonials showing that many people recovered from illness from tumour, cancer to constipations. This is a very good product and I hink it even work better then medicine.<br><br>Anyone interested to know more about this product can PM me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Although I agree that PDMYB can help in diabetics even to the extend to cure it, but I will not ask people to apply it on the infected area.<br><br>And do you think by writing in to the authorities will help? Just to let you know, we aready aquired 2 licenses in Singapore already. If you want, maybe you can go to LFI and find the relevant personnel to settle this case. No point dragging into other people who don't know about this wonderful product!!! It's just like playing classical music to a bunch of cows!!!</div>
