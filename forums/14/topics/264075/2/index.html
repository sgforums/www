Anyway, we shouldn't treat brothers like this right?<br>Right now we should stay hand in hand to solve this case and to bring SE down. Right?<br><br>And I foresee that what I am writing here is true. LFI really give good Recruitment Marketing Plans and true enough, <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PDMYB really did cure many illness and sickness from the pass till today.</span></span><br><br>I am just telling anyone what I think of the product and the company. Anything wrong with that??? Anyway, you sounds like you are from LFI also, which group are you in? maybe we can meet up and have a chit chat session?<br><br>Actually <span style="color: red;">I personally knows Ryan (The_fallen),</span> you know him too? Are you his upline, downline?<br><br>Well, I am just so happy to be able to see so many spporters of LFI here and I believe we can bring LFI to a higher stage if we stay hand in hand here to warn people about scams.<br><br>But one thing that is true. I don't feel that LFI is a bad company. I think it is the best mlm company in the world and I will follow it to wherever it goes.<br><br>I also want to thank my upline, Lionel from introducing me LFI. Anyway, I just joined for about 2 weeks.<br><br>Cheers ya</div></blockquote>Hey!!<br><br>Do I even KNOW YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE?<br><br>Don't anyhow come and claim that you know me.<br><br>I don't even know YOU!!<br><br>Don't ANYHOW PULL STRINGS!!<br><br>Anyway, your POST are VERY VERY Mis-Leading!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Refer to the words which i <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">highlighted in red and underlined</span></span><br><br>If you know nothing, than don't come here to Mis-Lead people.<br><br>Last but not the least, don't claim something that you have No Black and White to support.<br><br>If you don't have facts, don't Mis-Lead People!!<br><br>Anyway, I'll explain a bit here on both Drugs (prescribed by doctors) and Supplements (found OTC, mlm companies and online)  since it's related to the phase which I underlined.<br><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>Why I say it's misleading is because, while Drugs and Supplements can help to lessen/ reduce the suffering of the body, we can't say it will cure, BECAUSE drugs &amp; supplements will only help to speed up the recovery.<br><br>What is the thing that cure it, is the body itself, the NATURAL HEALING SYSTEM  which all of us have inside our body, it's just that we need some catalyst to speed things up only.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All Drugs will have side effects.<br>Supplements: Some might have drugs inside too Unless it's Organic.</span><br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>Why I say drugs have side effects is because i still remember reading a newspaper article on diabetes patient, the poor patient has being consumer diabetes drugs to control the sugar level in his body.<br><br>As time passes, the dosage increases, and the best part is - Body gets immue to the Drug being used or it's no longer as effective as it's just being introduced to the body, thus everytime patients goes back to doctor, they will either 1) Increase the dosage of the drugs OR 2) Change a new drug.<br><br>It was mentioned in the article that due to long years of taking the drugs, the diabetes condition was under control BUT the liver and the kidneys are getting from BAD to WORSE due to long term taking of Drugs.<br><br>The side effects of DRUGS are accumulated in the body slowly. Thus it's best to stay healthy and don't depend on drugs.<br><br><strong>Example:</strong><br>Another Example: Even when there's a Organ Transplant, the doctor will prescribed some medication (drugs) to both the patients (donor and recipient) for recovery purpose.<br><br>For the case of the recipent, he/she has to take the drugs to prevent the body from rejecting a foriegn object/organ and let the body slowly get used to the new object/organ, and thus he/she will have to carry on taking drugs until their condition are stable. [for this example i can scan the article easily if you all wanna read as it's easier for me to locate this article over the 1st example which i posted above]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh ... I really wonder why a simple thread to ask for solutions or whatsoever always end up into a fighting session in the multi-level marketing threads.<br><br>So many immature one sided views no wonder the industry never manage to prosper well in singapore ... The more I hear the more I feels the industry is damn sick due to the distributors all around.<br><br>Anyway I got the information I need already. Thanks people for helping especially the few LFI consumers who PM me wanting to help solve the problem. I appreciate your help but I am really sick of meeting up with mlm people le cause the more I see and hear the more I feel that one should never rely on health product but on how one take care of their own daily diets. Most I feel I will take is vitamin C apart from what the doctors prescribe.<br><br>As for LFI_YES I think you should really think twice before you message or else you will really get all your so called brothers from LFI into trouble by putting their names here. Some of them did message me and give me their name and contact but at least I am ethical not to disclose their particulars. I have no intention to flame you or your company but I am just asking for some advice.<br><br>I have tried various health products from famous local mlm before this LFI's time (think LFI quite new cause last time when I more into mlm that time no hear b4), nearly tried the B &amp; H capsule until my auntie gets into trouble. So far the health product I tried I dont know whether they are as good as they claim or not as I am still very young to prove that it is really workable or not so I shall not comment too much. But after all the recent reports I guess I will not buy anymore health product by mlm companies without any doctor prescription or advice. So if LFI product really very good I really feel happy for you but just feel that you shouldnt be too one sided and do let others voice out their own feelings too and dont be too defensive. I believe if you give ppl more room to voice out perhaps you can provide better service to them and have more customer rather than piss ppl off with your one sided over protective view.<br><br></div>
