If you're too lazy, I'll be happy to supply you with some rather informative links. Don't forget that when the concept of franchising first came about, most people thought it was a scam as well.<br><br>You don't learn much about history, do you? It always repeats itself because we fail to study it. We look, but do not observe. It's rather irrelevant of you to bring in a military example to support your paragraph. It doesn't make much sense. You would be better off using a business example for verification.<br><br>Instead of waiting for others here to provide you with the relevant information, why don't you look it up yourself and share it here? Afterall, isn't this a thread about finding out why people believe or not believe in network marketing?<br><br>Besides, don't you think your signature is rather ironic in terms of this thread here? I suspect network marketing is somewhere between the being laughed at and listened at phase.<br><br>That said, here are a few references I found on the Net.<br><br>A few websites for reference:<br><br>http://www.network-marketing-works.com/<br>http://www.entrepreneur.com<br>http://www.homeworking.com/library/mlm.htm<br><br>Some articles:<br><br>http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/0,4621,285135,00.html<br>http://www.entrepreneur.com/Your_Business/YB_Node/0,4507,650,00.html<br>http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/0,4621,298535,00.html<br><br>If you would like a good read on network marketing, go for Richard Poe's Wave 4: Network Marketing in the 21st Century.<br><br>Lastly, just want to add that since our learning capability is based on experience, it is flawed. Reason being what happened once, may not happen again, despite the possibility of it repeating itself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got this from the Ministry of Trade and Industries Website<br><br>MTI Enhances Safeguards on MLM Schemes Operating in Singapore<br><br>The Ministry of Trade and Industry has enhanced the safeguards on MLM schemes operating in Singapore, with the aim of protecting Singaporean consumers. The revised Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (MLM) (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order (MLM Exclusion Order for short) will take effect from 01 January 2002.<br><br>The Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) and Pyramid Selling (MLM) (Prohibition) Act (the MLM Act for short) was enacted in 1973 to protect consumers against harmful pyramid schemes. An illegal pyramid scheme will typically require participants to pay hefty upfront charges. In turn, the participants are promised attractive financial rewards for each additional participant recruited, as well as for all new participants brought in by their recruitees. As more salespersons are recruited, participants hope to recover their upfront charges and earn sizeable profits. Consequently, such pyramid-like structures will eventually run out of new recruits and collapse, resulting in those salespersons at the bottom of the pyramid losing all their upfront charges. Illegitimate MLM schemes usually share the following characteristics:<br><br><strong>Promoters hype about how easy it is to earn money, that people can get very rich in a very short time and that the way to earn money is by recruiting others to join the scheme;<br><br>The commodity in question is not something one would normally buy at its price;</strong><br><br><strong>Participants are required to invest money into the scheme, whether in the form of a joining fee or buying inventory. </strong></div>
