            <div class='col-md body'>Me a non believer...<br><br>and just want to share my experience on a recent trip to a MLM company<br><br>A friend called me like 2 months ago, a friend whom I have not heard for about 3 years since I finished NS. It started out as friendly chat - I ask him what he is doing - he saya he is self employed.<br><br>I thought not bad....so we just chatted for a while of old friends, my future plans, like whether I wanted to start a business myself, i told him i got no capital, how to start? So he told me if he has job lobang, he look out for me lor....i thought that was nice of him.<br><br>Next time he called (about a week later), he said he wanted to meet up, since we have not met for quite a while liao. I said sure, y not? but not so soon, i told him i have a lot of school work to settle and that we can prob meet in a month. He said ok.<br><br>Then he called again in 2 weeks, he says he would really like to meet me. I said i am busy with school work, he sez just come out for dinner lor...wun take up too much time lor....so i finally agreed. we then scheduled to meet in about 2 weeks, a few days b4 my exams...aniwae i thought i needed a break also from the school work.<br><br>So I met him...looks the same....had dinner at suntec city tower 2 (guess the MLM company?)....then he asked me if i looking for jobs...yah i said sure, i need more cash for the holidays after the exams....but then i got suspicious already....MLM? a person who i have not met for 3 yrs suddenly recommend me a job? hmmmm....<br><br>so i told him.....i dont like to do sales....he said ok.....and i told him i m not interested in buying any products.....he said no need to buy products.....i asked him what kind of job he is talking about....he finally sez MLM...<br><br>I told him I came out to have a nice dinner and nice chat...told him nicely that i have exams, and i rather spend my time with him chatting to destress, and not to listen to any sales talk. At that time i really wanted to leave liao....was really pissed off....but i didnt show it....gotta give face mah....<br><br>he asked me to go up to the office to have a look...i give face again and said ok..so he brought me up to the office, shoe me the posters and the prople and how much money they were earning.....and all the things that i heard from all the previous MLM companies that i have been through...<br><br>so i really felt pissed, so i told him, lets sit down, i know how MLMs in general work, but i am not keen. He asks why not, i said i dun like to do sales, i have seen how others have dropped out from MLM after failing to recruit more people, and<br>how they have to come out with a substantial amount of capital first, without recuperating their capital....<br><br>then a lady came by, supposedly one of the ladies what has been very successful in the company, came to the table and started chatting with me and my friend.....she asked y i m not keen, and the similar questions again....(read: delaying tactics!) so i just told her (in a light but tactful fashion) that I had no idea why I am doing here today, i said my friend was not very upfront with me, and that i had no interest in the MLM business.<br><br>she asked more questions....delaying tactics again....like what was my friend like during army days....i just gave short answers.....and then i said i had to go...i have exams next week so i needed to study....and so i left...and i 'thanked' my 'friend' for the 'opportunity'. and i have not spoken to him since, even though he send me sms....but i never return the sms....<br><br>just damn suay.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>

Or do you think MLM will cease to flourish?</div></blockquote>The government cannot put a stop to MLM, unlike China, nor will they encourage MLM to flourish, so they will continue to place restrictions until they think that MLM will stablize and somehow under control, like the insurance industry. Likewise, government organizations, charities, political parties, etc, will continue to shun MLM for quite sometime to come, because of its foul reputation.<br><br>Basically, if you want to have a clean and good public image, stay far far away from MLM. MLM will continue to exist, but will not flourish, after all MLM itself is not breaking any laws nor destroying free will and rights technically.</div>
