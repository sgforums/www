              <p>Are you really that dumb? First of all, i already said, there is Gold, star and bazel account. Gold account is $100 USD and Bazel is $1200 = 4900RM</p>
              <p>You can freaking choose to open the gold and not bazel which is a low risk of $100USD.</p>
              <p>And brother, after everything, i always have been supplying proof. I can show website, and links and stuff. What about you? Say only but got nothing. You are in a freaking SG Forum so you better watch your mouth about saying singaporean, who knows, war starts from people like you.</p>
              <p>You said you have been in music industries for 10 years. What a joke, supply evidence.</p>
              <p>You said royal family in malaysia is nothing, well, maybe true, but you are looking down at your own country. And all royal family in the world is rich, they want face and reputation, if a company endorse by the royal family is a scam, that would put a bad reputation to malaysia's royal family and also because they belong to malaysia, that will give your country a bad name no matter the royal family is powerful or not. So will the royal family let a company they endorsed to fall down?</p>
              <p>Please think before you talk, you are totally spouting rubbish.</p>
              <p>Last thing, you said malaysia now is investigating imuone, provide evidence. We are in a generation where we talk proof and evidence, you talk only, just shut up la, you are still living in a less developed world.</p>
              <p>If I talk only then I also can say I'm the malaysia prime minister asking you to shut up.</p>

              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>Great to see people discussing about Imuone.</p>
              <p>I am a new comer in forum. But i personally know many people and members doing network marketing business in different companies and countries...</p>
              <p><em>Every business have risks.. Every Era there is a trend.. When there is no demand, there is no supply!</em></p>
              <p>I have seen many many people that lost hundreds of thousands investing in online money game companies; financial, online casino, online gold trading, hyip etc etc..Those that lost are due to personal greed and actions.</p>
              <p>I have also seen many successful network marketers in the world that creates the millions. There are more than 3000 mlm companies in the world. There are even more that are not registered and disclosed. MLM is not a perfect industry. It has many bad players and company owners that are unethical and hard sellers. BUT mlm is a fantastic platform to gain experience, cash flow management, financial knowledge, mgt of people, mgt of systems, confidence, make change, etc etc with a small capital of hundreds to thousands! It really depends on which leader you join and what system they have.</p>
              <p><em>What is considered a super good industry?</em> As of 2008, banks are facing many negative issues, credit crisis, mortgage issues, bonds issues, and the list goes on... just a Singapore bonds case have caused S$500 million losses to innocent sg bankers?! Bankers have no intention to cheat the innocent people. BUT world changes are drastic... year 2009 will be worse...</p>
              <p>With comparison to Traditional business, starting a fishball noodle stall in singapore will cost $30,000. 2+1 rental, renovation, stainless steel equipment, worker, logo , etc etc. What is the success rate of earning from cooking n working hard 12 hours per day? LOW. Each bowl of noodle only sell at $3 at coffeeshop or $3.50 at food court.</p>
              <p>Malaysians are intelligent and successful business minded people. There are many innovative returns programs started by malaysians that did not last sadly.</p>
              <p>From reading up websites, blogs and research on IMUONE. I personally feel that IMUONE is prepared to go long term.</p>
              <p>Reasons being:</p>
              <p>1. Small and affordable start up capital from 360rm - 4320rm</p>
              <p>2. Tangible Products and services that can be exchanged with points. not like sunshine that allow a person with 50 000 points to change for only a rice cooker for eg?</p>
              <p>3. All companies involved and mentioned have Mr. Kin name in it. major money game companies that are registered with a "fake" person name.</p>
              <p>4. It's card allows members to enjoy discounts and privileges. The card itself is considered a product. Many rich in the world join many clubs just to network.</p>
              <p>There is definitely risks involved if you want to take part in imuone. Everything in life have risks. Working a job in a company for 10 yrs is also risky, risk of losing your precious time, ideas and effort to be retrenched one day. Time can never be bought by money.</p>
              <p>Dear people, in life, Money is not everything. Pls cherish time and values... The world is facing a major drastic change... with the climate changes, global warming, there maybe another tsunami or epidemic upcoming..</p>
              <p>For anyone who have joined imuone or interested to join imuone, a caution note, do not take this network marketing biz as an investment program or money game, the final result will be negative. Take it as a platform to learn and network. It will bring you positive results...</p>
              <p>Furthermore, pls do not comment on individual personal lives..I do not know robert or kin well.. From what i know, They r just young entreprenuers starting up another biz venture. Every biz have risks, as long as they dare to stand up and front the company. Their courage and ethics are respected.</p>

              <p>i'm a pure chinese plz dun relate me to the muslim thing i showed below</p>
              <p>this posting just to let you guys know little bit more bout MLM</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 100%;"><strong>Objective: To educate and prevent people from joining MLM scheme in any form.</strong></span><br><br><strong>Why MLM is a pyramid scheme?</strong><br>-	Emphasize more on signing downlines than selling products.<br>-	The more downline you have, the more commission you get. It’s not based on product.<br>-	You get extra commission if your downlines signed up another downlines, as if you get extra money by not working.<br>-
              Start up capital is so high, whereas the joining fees is higher than
              the inflated product that is COMPULSORY to buy in a package.<br>-	The products are usually sold at an inflated price from its original price.<br><br><strong>Why MLM is a dirty business:</strong><br>-
              You may get rich without selling any product, whereas the MLM companies
              always tells you that it’s not a pyramid scheme because they sells
              product.<br>- You are promised thousands and millions in return with
              minimal or flexible work, but in reality the system will make 80% or
              more of the members lose money.<br>-	You are taught to deceive and lie to lure prospective members with promises which does not make sense.<br>-
              When you joins an MLM, you actually joining a ‘SYSTEM’, not a direct
              selling entity. You’re part of a system that manipulate others for
              personal gain.<br>-	Selling products at a very inflated price from normal market.<br>-	All the hard work is not worth it. Your uplines are getting far more commission from the amount of work you put in.<br>-	‘Marketing Plan’ that is highly debatable from the Syariah perspective.  <br><br><strong>Why MLM has to be banned especially from Muslims:</strong><br>-	The promises and sweet talks that are being said is just gimmick.<br>-	More than 90% of the members who joins any MLM will lose their money, what else gain profit.<br>-	Proven to be a destructive factor among human beings, friends, families, relatives and colleagues.<br>-	You MUST deceive in order to successfully lure any prospect.<br>-	Pyramid Scheme which covers its act using the MLM platform is highly debatable from the Syariah point of view.<br>-
              The return (if any) is not worth all the hard work you made, while your
              uplines are getting more from what you’ve been working on. You will
              only gain profit when you managed to sign downlines, LOTS of downlines.</p>

              <p>2. Always point to rich successful people, like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. As if God makes us all equal or that joining MLM will make you like them.</p>

              <p>You are doing individual. 240 per student for group of 15. Means per hour, he earns $450. Every 2 hours, he earn $900. Do your maths properly.</p>
              <p>And your comparison is again one sided. Pedagogy can be taught in trainings and on the job experience as well. That's what is being done in NIE. Or certain tuition centres train their tutors as well.</p>
              <p>And who told you people aint put off by insurance companies? Look at AIG.</p>

              <p>I got to this website while looking up the goggle for "<span style="color: #000000;">Imuone Diamond Club Pte Ltd". One of my former co-worker in the former MLM company "Alphanet" posted that he is currently a consultant there... So the google results kinda directed here... So... since the topics are still bubbling hot, I though I might as well join in the critics... Pardon my english eagle, I'm not really good at it... =P But I'm super impressed by your killer one or two liners that render the forumers "textless"... =D</span></p>
              <p>Firstly, to qualify, I was from MLM... Erm... I started in Coslab, followed by Alphanet, then to Bel'air... All companies offered good prospects to me but somehow, I guess I just couldn't make the cut...</p>
              <p>After Coslab management got disbanded, as most of you "may" know, went over to Geylang area, (not to do entertainment business), but to start a "not so" new product called the "B&amp;H" (æŽ’æ¯’ç¾Žé¢œå®�)... I was invited to join but refused.</p>
              <p>The management of Alphanet was running the products for Yuan Zhong Xiu, selling fungshui products as well as these niches for the deceased. It was ran by the friend that I was talking about and his brother. Both of them possessed great charisma, and I have to agree that I really really learnt a lot from them...</p>
              <p>Thereafter, I think something went wrong somewhere and they decided to pull the deal off and joined the infamous Sunshine Empire... Woohoo~!!! Really praise God that I've not joined... Not to mention the reasons yeah?</p>
              <p>After the fall, I trust that they finally ended up somewhere working with this Imuone company... An MLM company I trust? MLM works on the power of leverage, on the power of exponential earnings... the more people, the more money.</p>
              <p>Bros and sis' forumers, this is the maths we can try... If one person refers 3 person, and each is to refer 3 more to be your "downlines", we'll see 9 in your group... But when you do this math 2 more times (i.e 4 to the power of 3 = 64, 64 to the power of 3 = 262144)</p>
              <p>By this, where can we find 200 thousand over people who are open to your business, and willing to part with this amount money?</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that MLM dun work again. AMWAY still works because it's dealing with products of a household... Not a very big market in Singapore but in US... Reason? The distant of a provision shop in certain parts of US can be 2 hours drive, so stocking up on household essentials is practical. The AMWAY member, who buys these products at a members' price can sell these items to his/her neighbour at a slightly higher price for a profit. So it works...</p>
              <p>Insurance is a known investment, and is like sort of MLM too. BUT! The papers that we buy really meant value! Not some "who-knows-where or what" diamond certificates or whatever. It is recongnised by the MAS and they need a certain big, I mean BIG! amount of reserve to be deposited with MAS (correct me if I'm wrong)... So what does this, "pre-listed" companies offer? Alphanet and Sunshine Empire are also "pre-listed"... What happened then?</p>
              <p>So... My point of view is this... Investment is a prudent use of money to secure the value and in hope to generate a bit more, that is fighting inflation... Anything other than that (Bill Gates, Donald (not Ronald) Trump and the likes) required superhuman determination... So, if you want to aquire true riches that lasts, seek God, if you want a life that chases the shadow, try joining MLM with the mindset of getting super rich...</p>
              <p>MLM does enhance your personal skills though... It helps me understand people better, understand myself better... At the end, I chose to seek God than worldly riches... If you wanna seek God, PM me... =)</p>
              <p>Now, the last thing about returns... If a company promises you returns of over 50% in less than a year, you can safely say that this company is a fraud. Rebuke me if you want if after 3 years, this company still exsist... Because it won't happen.</p>
              <p>Final finally, it is written in the bible that: "But seek first His (God's) Kingdom and His (God's) Righteousness, and all these things (the worldly riches, happiness and joy) will be given to you as well." (Matthew 6:33)</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading, if you're reading...</p>
              <p>"eagle" bro, looking forward to your critics and comments...</p>

              <p>Not all insurance are good though... In the US, the insurance are so complex.... there's even insurance on your insurer in case your insurer collapse... very chim one...</p>
              <p>But it's something only big and financially strong companies can offer... although the sales method is similar to MLM, the products and companies involved are radically different... It is like buying a safe, a safe for your wealth and health ;)</p>

              <p>Many jobs, especially in the service industry, enhance your personal skills as well :D</p>
              <p>But by choosing God than worldly riches, it seriously doesn't matter where u and what u work as, because u will be working to serve the people, to contribute and share what you have gained from society and God. I'm not a Christian, but I give tuition and created a blog for it because it is my way of contributing back and helping those that really need it to score. At least my aim is to achieve 100% As :D</p>

              <p>This is true. The world's greatest investor can only manage ~24% compounded yearly. Even credit card companies charge 24% p.a. Any promised returns higher than that is definitely suspicious.</p>

              <p>Looks like "eagle" and I have similar views in regards to MLM... Well then, I hope your tuition business trives~</p>
              <p>As for people going for MLM businesses, it is fine to treat it as a part time kind of income... Any higher expectations than that will only generate bitterness in the end... MLM business started off selling products that benefits consumers... Trading of intangible items are not permitted in Singapore no matter how good they look...</p>
              <p>Hope it gives light to some of the readers here...</p>
              <p>Throw more ideas in if there are questions or lingering challenges... Will try my best to give my opinion.</p>
              <p>This is not about forum wars, but more of an exchange of ideas...</p>
