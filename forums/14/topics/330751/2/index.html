              <p>hai i,m from malaysia, just wanna warn singaporean that imuone is another new scam launch recently. Let me brief u guys about the owner of imuone, lead by a loving couple by lo wai kin and robert..( husband n wife) both man anyway, they were with malaysia airlines before before venturing into precious stone business about 10 years ago ... and then they into interior design business ( think didn't work out i think) finally came this greatest newest scam mlm company. for your information mlm license in malaysia is granted for the company to do a multi level marketing business not for investment scheme, so what is an investment scheme, imagine this you pay the company in ringgit malaysia 4900 and then you will get a monthly return of 495 ringgit for the next 16 month, wahh so good ,if this is true why we need bank some-more, to hell with bank ma , now with imuone i can get 10% return of my money for 16 month .guy think rationally </p>
              <p>this is another sunshine empire in the making, for your information also malaysian government never granted a normal company for collecting deposit for an mlm company ... just beware ..peace</p>

              <p>2) are there any banks which are willing to pay rm495 MONTHLY for a mere deposit of rm4900? it works out to be roughly 10% a MONTH. (hmmz, sounds like we really don't need banks anymore.. )</p>

              <p>Yes, Malaysia is one the many countries that allows MLM/Pyramid/Ponzi companies to sprout up everyday.</p>
              <p>The decor, the rah-rah-rah Communism-like rallies and the allure of making fast money is all too obvious in Imuone. By the way, the company's name is cool and initially I thought it markets Immunity products. :p</p>
              <p>They have a market of course. Think of all those tai tais....... But if their diamonds are priced higher than the retail shops like Larry's Jewellery, for example, they'll never be able to compete with the ESTABLISHED shops.</p>
              <p>I am irked that Malaysian MLm companies always target Singapore and Singaporeans. They think our country is wealthy and our people big spenders. Duh *Rolls eyes*</p>

              <p>Hello new friends!</p>
              <p>I've just registered in this SgForums to check how Singaporeans
              feedback about Imuone</p>
              <p>I'm from Malaysia so far I've joined this program for about 2
              months so far so good.</p>
              <p>This program started in Malaysia somewhere on last 5th August 08
              and if you are a networker person so it is a right time to join
              since this program still new and fresh</p>
              <p>You can consider this program as another MLM and the only thing
              differentiate this program from others is this is the only MLM
              program where I can see could give us monthly passive income from
              their monthly rebate or loyalty rebate</p>
              <p>The office in Malaysia is located in Mid Valley, one of South
              East Asia biggest shopping mall. Every Tuesday night I won't miss
              the business preview / talk / discussion at their office in Mid
              Valley.</p>
              <p>No worries cause this company already obtained MLM license from
              our government and can collect money / deposit from public for
              those who interested to join.</p>
              <p>If you got some time, please visit my personal group website
              about this program at http://www.visi-sufi.com/berlian</p>
              <p>the official website is at http://www.imuone.com</p>
              <p>Should you guys need further explaination, please don't hesitate
              to call me at +6017.3367678 or +6019.3355399 or else we can discuss
              online thru YM (my ID is 'visisufi')</p>
              <p>Other than Malaysia and Singapore, Imuone is also available in
              Indonesia and Thailand.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, after reading this topic for awhile, I think I need to speak my part so I created an account. I am not an investor of this group so dont talk to me like I'm a supporter of it, I'm just speaking my views on MLM groups.</p>
              <p>So far, supporters of imuone I've seen are malaysian so I'm a singaporean, so I hope all singaporean will read my part first.</p>
              <p>Firstly, lets compare this with sunshine, for sunshine, we do not even really know who is the boss. Honestly I have very close friends who lost about 40k or even more to sunshine so I truly understand it has spoiled the image of MLM.</p>
              <p>Sunshine does not have good background about the boss and the reason they attracted so many people is because of their promise of high income and stuff like that.</p>
              <p>I've did research on Imuone's boss background. He is Lo Wai Kin,  41 now, and gay...but that does not mean anything. He is rich, he is famous too. In fact, he is the God son of malaysia's royal family's queen mother which means he is the god brother of malaysia's king.</p>
              <p>That certainly means he have a very wide network for MLM business. He is also a born rich kid, he live in a 7 stories house. Only his father, maid and him live in it and he finds it too small. So he is currently building a 5 stories house and a carpark for 30 cars.</p>
              <p>He is in diamond trading business. This is Diamond trading, not diamond retailing. Only about less than 20 families in the world controls diamond trading because Diamond trading is so expensive that even government cant affort or dont dare to touch it.</p>
              <p>His company is currently pre-listing, mainly due to the crisis now so he might think that listing his company now will be losing money.</p>
              <p>According to his webside, he wants to fulfill his promise to his mother for singing, so he set up a recording company himself and produced his own album "Wanna be kin". His songs are.... I cant say its not nice but its not bad, listen for yourself haha, but his rich, so who cares? Kin also appears in many news paper artical.</p>
              <p>This is just a rough summary of his background information. Sounds not bad, at least its better than Sunshine who does not provide any information of its boss or owner.</p>
              <p>I also did more research from friends and stuff that you can invest money into it and gain back a lot. Sounds good, it means we do not need a bank anymore, for that, I still cant figure it out. But I heard that when you put in the money, its in US currency and in the exchange rate of 1.55 but when you take it out, its 1.4, maybe that will get you guys thinking a bit?</p>
              <p>But, as we know, in MLM, we always get to choose the accounts we want. eg, bronze, silver, gold. In Imuone, the cheapest account is only $155 SGD and within 2 years you will get back 200% Every month you will get back 8.3%</p>
              <p>Can anyone tell me which Company will want to Scam $155? Whats more, you get money return every month, so if they were to scam, what do they scam? $100?</p>
              <p>And scaming will definately ruin Kin's reputation, why would he do that?</p>
              <p>This is just my point of view, hope you guys can correct me at any part. As for the blogspot, I've heard it is just for NEWS UPDATES in singapore. Because they have many locations so maybe they find it easier to list updates by blogs?</p>
              <p>by the way, the offical website is <a href="http://www.imuone.com/">www.imuone.com</a> and the Owner of imuone, Kin's personal website can be found here. <a href="http://www.kin.com.my/">http://www.kin.com.my/</a></p>

              <p>when u r a public figure, i dun think it'll b that difficult to dig out stuff abt u, probably even where ur dog/cat buried its bone/catnip.. much less dirty little secrets that u may be hiding.. plus when u have links with the royal family (in m'sia), ur reputation &amp; integrity is possibly worth more than ur life..</p>
              <p>personally, i've seen the marketing plan n honestly speaking, the returns sound really lucrative n unbelievable, but as with any form of investment, it's best that u do ur homework, dun just listen to what others say, but see &amp; find out for urself what it's all abt..</p>
              <p>i havent join the company as yet, but speaking from experience, there's no harm giving this one a try, especially when its start-up capital is so little.. however, word of caution - dun b greedy.</p>

              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/246945">Decifer72</a>, did you even finish school?</p>
              <p>For a pre-listing company, once it is listed, it will usually earn money for the moment. The money he give back to us which is so call 10% is just a peanut compare to what he is going to earn when his company get listed.</p>
              <p>And there is many different accounts from what I know. The cheapest account is only $100 USD which is about $150 SGD.</p>
              <p>If he is not rich and not the god son of mother queen, how did he get the endorsement of the royal family in malaysia?</p>
              <p>This is his lastest Music Video</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36fvXNT_SBM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36fvXNT_SBM</a></p>
              <p>He cant really sing, but honestly I like this video, espcially he is already 41 he still look hot.</p>
              <p> And <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/246945">Decifer72</a>, explain this! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axX7tDUXDuc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axX7tDUXDuc</a></p>
              <p>It is even in the malaysia news. Are you even a malaysian? Or do you stay in kangpong village?</p>
