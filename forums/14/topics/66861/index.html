            <div class='col-md body'>I think that there are many disgruntled ppl here in this forum due to mlm. The fact that they are may be due to being cheated either monetary or trust. From my opinion, MLM is a good business system. Problem lies with the ppl which is what the whole business is based upon.<br><br>I've been in several MLM companies, some whch were set up by ppl who were previously from other MLM cos. I've many friends who join MLM companies yet the only ones I see making money is the boss. Many times we fail to see the thin line separating truth and deceit. We choose to believe in something which we can see but refuse to believe what we actually feel. We see achievers, successful ppl, but fail to see the failures cos it's negative to see them. Where then is the truth?<br><br>Many times these achievers buy their own sales. Money from where we can only assume. I know of a few so called achievers who borrowed money through different means so that they can achieve where they are. But think of the stress they have when they have to pay. So they influence their downlines in whatever way possible to work and do whatever neccesary to get the sales to pay back. In the end only the boss earns. What kind of money is this?<br><br>Pls open your eyes and see the truth.MLM is a good business but our society and population does not allow us to grow MLM. It is not a lifestyle, unlike other countries which are bigger. They have the population to sustain. We Singaporeans have a kind of metality that if you have a good lobang I also want. KS syndrome. So how to do MLM? If you can make money, I also want. But why not I make more? So anyhow whack. In the end downline suffer. Lots of hit n run cases. So many ppl fed up with MLM.<br><br>Everything is a lie here. The management does not have a correct attitude or action. All they want is money. Makes sense for business but look at the social damage it has caused. I hope that we Singaporeans can really look clearly at MLM. There are many ways to make money. Do you want to make money with a good conscience? There are lots of us who knows the truths of some MLM companies but unfortunately not many have opened up. I have made money thru MLM but I have also experienced the stress. You need a proper heart and mind to make it in this business with no major stress. But it'll need lots of work. So think about it. I bought my first car with my 1st job after quitting MLM. I got my 1st gold card in my 2nd yr in the same job too. I also dun have high qualifications but I was willing to see the truth and work hard.<br><br>My wish is that there will be less ppl having problems or feeling cheated becos of MLM. That there will be less MLM companies coming out just to cheat ppl. May there be happiness for all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fully agreed with your comments. Personally, I've joined numerous direct selling companies, mostly out of obligations and just try lah. I have a very negative mindset towards direct selling until one of my supplier practically force me to listen to a presentation. Somehow this company really did opened up my mind. I have learned how to compare the various MLMs, what are the pros and cons, from there I have decide which is best for me. I'm glad I have made the right choice and the company I'm with is now the leading MLM in Singapore. It was announce by the Chairman of DSAS. Really have a look into MLM yourself, understand the difference in each MLM company and decide which is the best for you, then just do it. Of course, with the help of training and coaching provided.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who wan to know more bout wat the hell is Network Marketing, pls give urself some time to view the following URL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> :<br><br>http://www.mlm.ch/<br><br>(copy and paste it in ur link)<br><br>u will find answers to :<br><br>1) How Network Marketing, this biz concept comes about?<br>2) Why Network Marketing products so expensive?<br>3) Why are their products so good?<br>4) Why people mistaken it as pyramid scheme? etc<br><br>Find out more answers from there. Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies. Jus take a look at the newspaper for the past one month, alot of articles is focusing on NETWORK MARKETING, and they also teaches us how to prevent from bad companies. if u wan to know, read the straits times forum on MLM and chinese lianhezhaobao on last sunday 18/01/04.<br><br>Most imptly, its not the money that counts. Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>
