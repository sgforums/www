            <div class='col-md body'>Nowadays people don't accept to edvidences, certificate, newspapers, even suspect professors. Who will suspect a doctor's prescription? But why people suspect and choose not to believe products that were invented by Japanese Professors. Network is People who have strong mentality that can success. Give up before starting, don't even have the standards to give any comments. Give up half way before even success, also don't have the standards to give comments. Only people who success in network qualified to give comments. Remember if everybody is that good and daring, singapore will not have failure like you. All Singaporean should be very successful now, if they do things never give up. If road of success is that smooth and easy, there will not be failure in Singapore. Singaporean usually use their initiative the wrong time. There is a big difference between Network Marketing and MLM/Pyramid. Network Marketing don't need to pay any money or fee to join. If a trade with out basic salary can't make it, then no businessman, insurance and property agents should be in singapore. Networkers work hard and promote their products hard. If products in network or MLM companies are expensive due to alot of layers of commission sharing, you are wrong! Products that we purchase outside retail stores also alot of layers. Factory sell to middleman, export to a distributor, distribution companies pay their salesman basic and give them commission, warehousing, delivery, account, admin, receptionist and alot of staffs that never contribute to sales. Ask yourself seriously, actually in this world everything are the same. Things have their sales cycle. Pls don't jump to conclusion next time before fact find... Network Marketing is not what Native Singaporeans think... If Ministry of Trade and Industry never include network marketing in MLM/ Pyramid Selling, Singaporeans should not condemn this trade just like that.

Who will suspect a doctor's prescription? But why people suspect and choose not to believe products that were invented by Japanese Professors. Network is People who have strong mentality that can success. Give up before starting, don't even have the standards to give any comments. Give up half way before even success, also don't have the standards to give comments. Only people who success in network qualified to give comments. Remember if everybody is that good and daring, singapore will not have failure like you. All Singaporean should be very successful now, if they do things never give up. If road of success is that smooth and easy, there will not be failure in Singapore. Singaporean usually use their initiative the wrong time. There is a big difference between Network Marketing and MLM/Pyramid. Network Marketing don't need to pay any money or fee to join. If a trade with out basic salary can't make it, then no businessman, insurance and property agents should be in singapore. Networkers work hard and promote their products hard. If products in network or MLM companies are expensive due to alot of layers of commission sharing, you are wrong! Products that we purchase outside retail stores also alot of layers. Factory sell to middleman, export to a distributor, distribution companies pay their salesman basic and give them commission, warehousing, delivery, account, admin, receptionist and alot of staffs that never contribute to sales. Ask yourself seriously, actually in this world everything are the same. Things have their sales cycle. Pls don't jump to conclusion next time before fact find... Network Marketing is not what Native Singaporeans think... If Ministry of Trade and Industry never include network marketing in MLM/ Pyramid Selling, Singaporeans should not condemn this trade just like that.

I know more abt MLM and Network Marketing than u, kid. so now, shoo.<br><br>Bye bye.</div>

I heard the ways the company is always stalling refunds to customer and I think it is good to let ppl know how to go about getting thier money back!<br><br>Firstly, don't bother yourself with all the excuses the company gives to delay you of your stock purchases. In fact, a friend of mine told me that one of the reason they give is that "The stocks need to be ordered from Japan and the demand in Japan is too high so that is why the stocks take 1-2mths to arrive in Singapore" Okie... THAT IS A LOAD OF CRAP!!!! The fact is there is another company in Spore known as DW something one that actually has ready stocks from Japan Life, in fact, they stock up their stocks! Their customers get their products "Cash-on-Delivery". So why the difference? Simple.... most prob the company either do not want OR they do not have the funds to get the stock! Its takes only 1-2 days to air freight the stocks over. (Don't believe? Check it out with forwarding company!)<br><br>Hence, consumer has to right to DEMAND for their stock purchased. Otherwise.... GET A REFUND! Don't be so silly to pay up first for the stock and wait 2-3 mths for it! U are just like a sucker that loan $$$ to the company and not even charge a cent of interest!<br><br>To get a refund back, don't bother to go thru' the company. They will give you one hundred and one reason to convince you to give them time to pay you the refund (If the stock wasn't ordered, where did your money go to? Missing...) If you refuse to give in, they will basically do it the holigan way... using the "take it or leave it", attitude to force you to give in(esp the guy doing all the refund cases now, called Jack) Most ppl will give in, fearing that they cannot get their money back... Well, a friend of mine faced this problem. Let me tell you a proper way to get your "jamed" money back(I'm not surprised if the company has the money but do not want to pay back)<br><br><span style="color: red;">[b]1) Go to Small Claims Tribunal(SCT) at Apollo Centre, 5th floor (Chinatown area). They will be able to get you a refund within 1 week or so the moment you file a complain. Bring your invoice or any proof of purchase to the stock and say that the company have not delivered the stock to you. Just let them know that the company have not delivered the stocks to you after so long and keeps delaying. However, the claimant must be there to do the claim him/herself. With a min fee ($10 or so), this is one of the fastest way to get your money back and they have NO CHOICE BUT TO PAY YOU! However, TRY TO DO YOUR CLAIM IN LESS THAN A YEAR! Else, SCT might not want to take up the complain. </span></strong><br><br>2) Another way is to go CASE. But they will take very long if the company takes a long time to reply and keeps giving reasons to drag the issue. Take note that CASE is just a mediator, they are not from the legal side. Moreover, U must be a member of CASE before they are going to take the complain up for you.<br><br>3) Well, another way is to get the lawyer to send a letter of demand to them.(this method is one of the most costly, one letter can cost u $30 - $60) And basically, if they do not respond to the letter, there is nothing much you can do initially. Till a court date is set. But then, just before that happens, they will settle the refund and get away scot free(so if they tell you they got no money to pay up, don't worry, money will APPEAR just before the crucial date. And they will definitely not wait to go to court with you cos' they know very well that if they do that, they might have to end up settling the legal fees!). So, more dragging.....<br><br>So whoever have better ideas to help victims such as my friend, do feel free to add to the replies and let's help to stop dishonest companies such as ASAYO(Sometimes I wonder.... why are companies like these still existing and not get into trouble with Commercial Affairs Dept)!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To my dear friend: I hope this topic can help ppl who are stranded like you.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span><br><br>Regards....[/b]</blockquote></div>
