What i condemn is ur <strong>approached</strong> in here!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> I know u got some result from ur network marketing and now u feeling very "ON" and "HOT" in about doing ur trade. U will somehow dont feel happy if someone comments a bad remark in ur trade... Its normal.. coz i m in ur shoe before.<br><br>As wat i have said in my earlier post, there is nothing wrong with network marketing or mlm and in fact I was in this trade back in jan 1996 with NOP. But for wat i see in this forum and if u do a search of similar topics, u will find many ppl are cursing and swearing about it, and yet u impersonate as 2 different person trying attract other with $$. Someone had already poured kerosene to the burning flame in here and yet u added petroleum some more.<br><br><strong>Originally posted by Magstorm:<br>Magnetic only enhance blood circulation.

U should be the one to prove to others that the mattress actually did help to improve blood circulation. Many uncles and aunties said tat they feel pain in their body when they started using itÂ…. But now the mattress is in the storeroom becoz they donÂ’t feel the effect anymore. HahaÂ…. Some of these ppl will start telling other tat the mattress is effective for a while only and there goes the spreadingÂ…Â…<br><br>1.These ppl will tell other not to waste money to invest $1000+ on a slim piece of mattress.

Products were introduced later with much less details in it.<br><br>5.Network failure: down line missing. Y??<br><br>Before I join this trade. My friend A actually presented the marketing plan to me and even shows me how much he earned. Well my thinking at tat time was that Â‘u r a good salesman.Â’ Sorry I canÂ’t be a salesmanÂ…and its not my interest in doing selling. Well he made his first mistake by telling me how much I can earn through this marketing plan by selling their products. He never mention about the products also.<br><br>Half year later, I was approached by another friend B. Well he was the direct down line of A. This time he talks about the product Â‘Soken BÂ’ from NOP. He was approached by A,  few months back and he bought the Soken B (a product which produce strong magnetic fieldÂ… more for treatment) which cost $1600. Friend B has a father who suffered from stroke few yrs back and was lying on the bed since then. He was presented with this product at NOP by A. He knows tat the product may or may not help in his dadÂ’s condition but he insist of buying it. I was shocked after hearing this!!! Â‘Why spend so much on a product which may not help?Â’ He told me he is buying a hope. Hoping that this product can help his dadÂ’s condition.<br><br>After using the product for Â½ yr, his father indeed can walk slightly, something which is quite unbelievable. At least now he can walk slowly in the houseÂ…. to the toiletÂ…..This incident attracts me to join NOP and we use this real life incident to boost our sales.<br><br>A lot of people donÂ’t know what's the theory behind these mattresses and how it can help them. Nowadays people suffering from stroke are increasing compared to the 70s. Why is it so?? Did everyone bothers to explain our living environment, why and how these mattresses help?? I think u should know rite??<br><br><strong>Originally posted by Magstorm:<br>Only strong mentality people can success in network.

People with the right mentality then can successÂ….<br>Why I say right mentality? If u have a Â‘strong mentalityÂ’ in making $$...., u will never success. A lot people joined have strong mentality in making $$. (Why is it so?? See point 3 and 4) and this will cause network failure. People join becoz of $$, left becoz did not make $$.  These people will start to spread that the marketing plan sucksÂ…..<br><br>Whether u need to buy a product or not to join the marketing plan doesnÂ’t make any difference as long as the products are really that good.

It has nothing to do with using initiative at the wrong time!!! Y care so much or bother so much about this?? The more u explain, the more mad they get coz their concept between these are already imprint in their mind. They will only realized it when they r in ur shoe. If u wanna blame, blamed it on those agents who spoil the plan.<br><br>People are will to spend $$$ on something that are good.
