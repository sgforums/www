Empiredreams has step into the Â“ Land of Gold Â“. A unified Thai Kingdom was established in the mid 14th century. Thailand, or Siam as it was called until 1939, has never been colonised by a foreign power, unlike its South and Southeast Asian neighbours.

Serious ground work is be done to set up a representative office in Manila as soon as possible. Effort is been made even at this moment to tie up Empiredreams with another local company that can offer Empiredreams merchants an immediate exposure to thousands of anchor merchants, insurance and telecommunication service provider.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Hi,<br><br>I am a Malaysian and was recently (actually 3 weeks ago) introduced to Sunshine but havenÂ’t joined as a member yet. What stopped me was the negative press that I have been reading ever since I decided to do some research on Sunshine before I make up my decision.<br><br>When I came across this blog, I must admit I have even greater doubts now though I will still harbour the hope that all these negativity will be over once the SG CAD clears Sunshine. Why I harbour this hope is because the person who introduced Sunshine to me really earned a lot of money and I love to have that too!<br><br>This I address to post #89Â… Mr Jimmy, is it possible that the Â“letterÂ” is actually the speech given by the Chief Minister during the ground breaking ceremony? I did saw some pictures of the said Minister at SunshineÂ’s ground breaking event. However what I dont understand is thisÂ… if it is the speech then why is it dated 1st Nov instead of 11th Sep which is the ground breaking date?<br><br><span style="color: red;">This I address to anyone who may have answersÂ… I contacted some friends in Indonesia since apparently Sunshine is very active there and ask whether they heard about Sunshine or not. What I got from my friends are quite startling. They told me that back in 2002 to 2004 there was a company in Indonesia called Probest which apparently have similar business model like Sunshine. At their height, Probest was taking in millions of USD a day! Somehow, the Indonesia government found them to be illegal and a lot of members lost money. The boss apparently was charged but somehow managed to elude authorities and is in hiding now. The most startling fact was this.. my friends told me that this Indonesian named Borhan something was actually a partner of James Phang in NOP, one of the earlier reincarnation of Sunshine. Can anyone confirm or refute this?</span></blockquote>Look at the time frame 2002-2004 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In the end........................<br><a href="http://www.firstmillionchallenge.com/sunshine-empire-too-good-to-be-true/" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstmillionchallenge.com/sunshine-empire-too-good-to-be-true/</a></div>
