            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Hi, this is my first ever attempt in an online discussion.  I'm a full time networker &amp; I found this forum by accident because I was searching the Internet to know how our society is perceiving MLM after it had been legalised for 5 years.<br><br>From the discussion in the forum, I found some meaningful feedback but there are also too much bickering.  However, I would still like to share my experience to all who are interested in this business model.<br><br>Before we decide on what company, product or COM plan to market, I think we've to understand the MLM concept more.  MLM is not about selling because I've met a top sales person who join the company for 1 day, close a total of 8 sales with 8 new distributors in that first day but disappeared in a month. (This person is only 1 of top sales people I met in the industry).  MLM is not about recruiting 10, 100, 1000 .... downlines into your organisation in order to be successful.<br><br>MLM is about sharing products that the distributor have used and at the sametime showing the business plan to the prospect.  To win in this business, the distributor must be able to duplicate all he had learnt from his team to his downlines.  Selling (sharing &amp; making the sales) &amp; recruiting is relatively easy if the products are of value to the people.  However, the most time consuming and most important task is to Duplicate.  From my uplines and senior experience, it will normally take a person 3 to 5 years to duplicate.  In short, it takes as much effort for a person to be successful in MLM as in other businesses.  This is the reason why there is high dropout in any MLM company, a true blue MLM company can never have overnight success story.<br><br>Back to selecting a MLM company, my suggestion is to first ask yourself why do you want to do the business at all? The reason being that if you think it is easy (because of low investment) then you will disappoint yourself for the time and money invested.  Most of all your reputation will tarnish among those friends that you have sponsored and spoken to.<br><br>If you think you have a good and compelling reason for you to succeed in this industry, I have a few suggestion in the selection of a company:<br><br>1) Company: at least 7 years of MLM experience, no. of countries that it had penetrated, track record in handling disputes in these countries, preferred public listed to verify their earning and payout, and their vision.<br><br>2) Product: There are 1/3 of the successful MLMers whom started the business because they love their product so much that they can share it with great passion.  Preferred product that are highly consumables for repeat sales, affortable (very subjective, a product can be expensive but valuable to certain group of consumer), user friendly to people of all ages, result from usage can be quantify so comsumer can easily refer others to you, R&amp;D must be strong with top scientist and not some university fresh grads, multiple Patents and multiple product types and range to cater to all daily needs.<br><br>3) COM Plan: There are front heavy plan such as binary or back heavy plan such as stair-step breakaway.  2 other plans are unilevel and matrix, many companies may say that they have a revolutionalise plan but mostly they are just a variant or hybrid of the 4 basic plans.  If you are looking for suplementary income, binary plan is suitable because you can earn little profit right from the start.  However, if you dream of becoming millionaires in MLM, go for stair-step breakaway.  76% of the world top MLM company uses stair-step breakaway plan.<br><br>4) Team: Do the team you join has the right training system to guide you? how many successful leaders are there in the team as compared to other teams? what are the training material available and are they reasonably price?  What is the vision of the team?<br><br>5) Leader: who did you join? can he help you or when he is not around who can support you? is he only interested to train you to be his sales rep or he want to invest time on you to make you a leader?<br><br>Sorry for the long message, hope it helps.  Thanks<br><br></div>

However, I look upon it as a monthly sales quota to fulfil.  Even if i run a hawker stall, I'll still need to have a min sales everyday to continue operating my business so it is necessary for maintaining sales.  Those companies that promise no maintenance also means that there is no payout for those months.  No company will pay for no sales.  Thanks</blockquote></div>

COM plan is only 1 factor to look at; but if we emphasis too much on it, we may be lead by our greed like many people who see MLM as a get rich quick scheme.  A company may have top COM plan but I would question the company on how many has been paid the top dollars and how many more only made a little. Check on the average earning when possible rather than looking at the fantastic payout that the company claimed.</div>

COM plan is only 1 factor to look at; but if we emphasis too much on it, we may be lead by our greed like many people who see MLM as a get rich quick scheme.  A company may have top COM plan but I would question the company on how many has been paid the top dollars and how many more only made a little. Check on the average earning when possible rather than looking at the fantastic payout that the company claimed.</div></blockquote>Study USANA more and talk to those people on the TOP, meaning those been listed a TOP procuder. From ther, you will know how much each new distributor can earn, and when they truely follow the system, their income is wonderful. I mention this because as for their products, it had proven. They have their own group of scentices...<br><br>Lastly, I need to stress that I"m not with them. But just that this company worth getting into.</div>

After using it and achieving some result, you can share your testimony passionately with your prospects.<br><br>Another important point for having a min maintenance is to help serious MLM business builder to see who are the more commited downlines &amp; how much time he should allocate in helping that downlines.  Bear in mind that most people only want to 'TRY' the business, you just can't go around helping all your downlines, especially when you are doing it part-time.  In short, the min maintenance is a test of commitment.</div>

We decide how much we want to earn &amp; we put in the hours.  Nobody will continue the business for long if they don't make money.  The biggest reason for the high dropout is because they never discipline themselves enough to do the sales every month.  Some choose to buy up the stock to fulfil the min requirement and thus kill themselves in a few short months.  Both are not desirable.<br><br>Like I said in my earlier posting, MLM should be treated like any other business.  If you start a hawker store today, do you have the option of not making min sales to pay for rental/raw material/time and also bring income to your family? If you choose only to do some sales whenever you feel like, how do you achieve financial stability or income after retirement (or whatever goals you set)?<br><br>The maintenance should not be viewed as 'worries' but rather as the 'commitment' to the business.<br><br>Thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that monthly maintenance is a must tho<br><br>Firstly, its the target quota. Psychologically, it gives a tangible number a MLMer can work towards. True we work at our own pace, but there need to be some sort of goal we can work too. Really, human arent perfect, only few people can achieve much without the need to set goals, but not the rest, The company is also looking after 'the rest'<br><br>Secondly, dangers of lull period. Quota reduce chances that the distributors may be underperforming, making the company in the red for that month or so.<br><br>Actually, most of the time, existence of monthly maintenance is never the issue.  Its how much the quota is.<br><br>Many are dissed because of ever increasing quota as they climb up the ladder, the need to renew tha high quota just to stay in that position, else demotion...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup, i agree with your point <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>However, i also feel that for a person, if he is serious in doing the business, with or without monthly maintenance, he will do it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If he is not that serious, there is a chance that one day he finds it hard to keep up the monthly maintenance and then drop out.<br><br>Also different pple have different needs of the products in the company, thus the maintenance is different. Most companies just ask from each distributor about $100 per month, which i believe it is fair, but to some people may be too much.<br><br>I agree that one may lax without  monthly maintenance...but if he wants to lax..with or without it will be the same. Thus i prefer to have it at my own pace as i know that i am serious, and those who are serious will do the same <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
