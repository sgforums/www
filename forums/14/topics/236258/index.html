            <div class='col-md body'>I've been approach by this 2 company's distributor .<br><br>Network 21 And Enyouth<br><br>I decided to join network 21 and try . since its a more establish company .Its under Amway as well . One of the Biggest Network Marketing on earth . theres alot of doctors and lawyers , retired teachers there. For me , I am gaining experiences in it , not dreaming to get rich by jus doing that . I am thinking of doing it and learn on the way , maybe by earning abit of extra cash since its freelance , but the most important thing its the experiences u gain . Compared to Enyouth , Theres not much of a VERY experience pplpe to learn from , i mean not only marketing exp, but life experience as well . of cos i will continue my day time job .<br><br>-heard of the story of the vegetable and durian?<br>-for me , i will grow vege and durians the same time.<br><br>For Enyouth , Sry to say its like some kinda cult ,everyone is extraordinary motivated. and the " DUI " thingy and the calling of names . " AH BENG HAO ! " it seems like the boss is using the power of money to brainwash the pple inside , and the approach is so insincere and i felt so cheated . the pplpe there seems frenly but hey ! once again , u join , u buy ,u earn , they earn more . even the tissue auntie will smile to u when u buy tissues from them . as for the car incentive part i am clear , believe it anot , i know quite abit of their inside story and some of my frens knew the ex SDMs And Dms . Not that enyouth is not making money .jus that the product is harder to sell . and the worst part its enyouth is putting our frenship with frens and relationship with relatives on the line .and everyone seems so moltivated . and once again , i got the product in hand . i will find pplpe to compare the one selling on EBAY and this from enyouth . NOT BY comparing the outlook and quality , some of my frens are in there.. its quite sad . for the car incentive part . if u noe . some are actually second hand . its true . i not flaming EY . but thats the fact . to be fair to enyouth . U can earn in enyouth , but not for long . cos their products so limited and pplpe can only buy once .<br><br>thats my choice . of cos i need some comments . And one last thing for Enyouth distributors ..<br>If i were u , I would leave and join more establish companies . Do it in a honest and smart way . theres no shortcut to success . hard work pays but not in Enyouth .<br>- Plant ur seeds in a BIGGER field And u will have Larger Returns<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to enyouth distributors .<br><br>take an early step to join the company thats worth joining ...<br><br>enyouth is no way better thand amway ... face the fact dudes... if u wanna succeed in NM , join amway .. wider variety of products ... more practical product and a much respectable company ...<br><br>i am flaming that enyouth is bad or whatsoever ... their background and system really is giving pplpe question marks ... if u say that raymond lim is that power , u are comparing raymond lim and the millionaires of amway in us ... i think jus by wealth , theres ALOT of amway distributors in the US that are ACTUALLY millionaires...<br><br>and one more thing ... experiences is the most important thing.. i heard that EY is trying to be public listed .. which is not easy ... and plan wise.. amway's cash earning plan is not as fast earning than enyouth .. but remember ... theres no free lunch in this world ... imagine such a gd system .. then EVERYONE in EY will be car achiever... EVERYONE's income monthly will be over 10 k. .. then ur boss eat wat ?<br><br>there mus be something wrong why the pioneers left for other company .. i dunno why they leave , maybe the pay better in other company ... they have to start from scratch u noe ? u think they wan ? but why they wan?<br>enyouth is giving me too much question marks ...<br>and i dont feel confident in their systems , plans , company and the boss as well ...<br>i am not formally in amway yet ...<br>but i believe thats a better company than enyouth ...its proven.... as for those cars ... pplpe say its second hand car .. but the problem is .. is that goin to be long ? are u sure u can get the SAME amount of passive income through the yrs ... if EY is giving that much passive income ... will pplpe leave ?<br>AND BE IT the EY boss is bad tempered or LJ kia ... those SDMs IF THEY got paid so much .. u think they wont endure ? make senses?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha. An enyouth distributor would say:<br>"Amway?!! their company is so big, if you join them now, you'll still be a small fry 10 years time, so what's the point? Example amway have 50,000 people, if you join, you will be the 50,001th person.  However if you join enyouth, we are a small company still in a pioneering stage. There are now 100 people, you will be the 101th. 10 years later you will be the 101th person in a 50,000 people company, what does that make you??"<br><br>Think they had been using this very same script every year for the past 7 years, but now still only a handful of people.
