Many companis claimed to be established in several countries with more then how many how many distributors, but upon checking, they may only have a mama shop size floor in a country carrying their products. So they're not technically wrong in saying their product/company is in that country.<br><br>If singapore health board bans something, is it a worldwide ban? Nope. It's up to individual country. Having said that, one must also understand how products are package and marketed, and how products are categorised. Hence tests in different countries are different.</div>
