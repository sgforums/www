            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has alot of highly educated ppl who are finding hard to find jobs. imagine a fresh grad with a not so good degree able to get $1800/mth is very good already. plus there are many uncle aunties out there not doing very well...<br>1 product in these mlm companies cost around $1500, try asking these ppl to buy, who would part with this kind of money which is almost 1 month of their salaries. Only those stupid kids, still in school, not making a living yet would join MLM, who are they going to sell to? They can only get the money from their parents to buy the product themselves, get into a higher commission and then try recruit friends, hoping they can sell. So much recruiting and so little selling how the company gonna earn? U ask ppl buy also not alot of ppl want to buy.</div>

Nothing to compare as Nuskin had been around for many years, they have a system that proven successful if you follow. And for working this system, you don't need hugh money to start, just less than $300. Wheather they are doing well anoth depends did they follow what their uplines shares. I know most people in Nuskin are doing a front loading, so, they tend not to do so well.</span><br><br>Singapore has alot of highly educated ppl who are finding hard to find jobs. imagine a fresh grad with a not so good degree able to get $1800/mth is very good already. plus there are many uncle aunties out there not doing very well...<br>1 product in these mlm companies cost around $1500, try asking these ppl to buy, who would part with this kind of money which is almost 1 month of their salaries.
