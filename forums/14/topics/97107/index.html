Disclose the locations and capacities of our call servers and switches around the world and of course we had to demonstrate and show the IDA just how our services work within our Virtual Private Network (our Global Community).<br><br>The process was completed this week and approval granted and we are now a licensed Telco which is another important step forward for us all. We trust this will demonstrate to you, our Valued Member just how serious we are about you and your business.
