            <div class='col-md body'>Hello People,<br>I used to work for Asayo group Pte Ltd. I used to be one of the SM with Japanlife badge recognition. I have been to Japan and Korea to learn about the products and attended JapanLife convention as well. I know the management staff during my period there well enough. So I can say that I know very well about the products and the company.<br><br>Therefore below are my comments:<br><br>1. Japanlife product is a good product and I have a good testimonials from some of my customers.<br><br>2. It doen't work for every illness. I do have costomers who use the product and did not see any improvement to their health.<br><br>3. The company is legal and does not practice pyramid or MLM system.<br><br>4. During my stay in the company, I received late commission payment very frequently. Late by 2 months was a norm.<br><br>5. At that time, the company had stock problem. My customers frequently received their products late.<br><br>6. I have cases where till now my customers have not received their products. How long it has been? Well..... over 3 years!!!<br><br>7. My customers have been requesting (verbally and written) for a refund for more that 1 year after waiting for the product for 2 years but again Asayo Group is delaying the matter.<br><br>8. With the situations explained in no. 5-7, I concluded that the company is either financially weak or out to 'play' with customers.<br><br>9. I am seriously thinking of getting a lawyer to sue the company on my customers behalf if the company maintain her 'arrogant' attitude.<br><br>10. If any one out there have the same problem, email me and we can legally sue the company.<br><br>11. Latest info is that Asayo is moving to another location. Downsizing? I don't know, but doing well is a stern NO!<br><br>12. Anyone not happy or have doubt over my comments, too bad! But I do have supporting documents for all my claims.<br><br>13. Lastly, the reason I left the company was due to disagreement with the management on their method of marketing the products and their ways of handling customers/staff.<br><br>Regards<br><br>KoolBruder<br>10 April 2002<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya, it really took them long to deliver my order.  I ordered and paid for 2 pillows before CNY and after almost 2 month, then got them.<br><br>But they were fantastic (not the salesman, it's the pillows).  I never knew what normal life is until I tried the pillows.</div>
