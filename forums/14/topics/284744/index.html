I suggest you try to give him reason not to meet him up in their office, and make him meet u at some other places like kopitam or what. WHen he ask if you read or listen to his book, just tell him you didnt read and got no time. For me, i clearly understand amway biz is not my cup of tea, so im very direct after I know he is from amway. If you dun like the idea, just be direct to reject him in face else he will keep calling you every few months. LOL...<br><br>He is those kind that very into it n very long winded + always avoiding direct question kind of network marketeer. Many time I ask him, are you promoting some MLM thing, he tell me, huh! what is network marketing? And tat stupid book actually talks abt MLM. I totally pissed with this kind of ppl. They dun even dare to admit they are doing a MLM biz. When I told him, Im okie to even discuss with you if you are promoting MLM biz, so just be frank to me, den he will say after I read up his book n CDs den we talk... i was like ... kao! Wondering if he is so inflexible to change his sale preaching, how he going to make it in MLM biz...<br><br></div>
