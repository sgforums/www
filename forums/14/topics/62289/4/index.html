            <div class='col-md body'>To me, those into health products are taught to sell on the benefits of the products. I find unreasonable for someone to tell me, hey, this product will help you improve this and that lah, cure this and that lah. It's like you don't take it, you will fall sick and regret it. I get the feeling of being coerce into buying.<br><br>They keep saying we have the best in the market and it is patented. I always ask a few questions, what assurance can you give me that I will not meet someone in the future that will say the same thing, better than yours? What would happen to the business if some other companies have better and cheaper products compare with yours? So far none could convince me that the business is sustainable.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ben<br><br></div>

I took herbalife for the last 2 weeks and I lost 5KG liao BUT then I still do not subscribe to it as a viable long term business, though I would introduce it to my frens but AT NO PROFIT...So, i think can try the product lor but i guess as a business, it would take more consideration...unless you are DAMN DISSATISFIED with ur current work or pay, then think abt it bah....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi laurence82<br><br>Sorry to say I am very much disagree witrh ur nutritionist at this point<br><br><blockquote><br>!. Firstly, for a product to sell well, it must be free of blemish, like lawsuits, mishaps and stuff. I did came across few websites, which were on lawsuits on Herbalife before. Now guys, I must ask for your pardon. I lost track of that websites, but if you diligently type Herbalife on yahoo, you will come across these websites.<br></blockquote>I believe she/he is using Microsoft Windows, isnt it selling very well.  But who dare to say Microsoft is free of blemish?  If we look closely, there are many companies who products sell well yet they are not free of blemish.  Theerfore I disagree to use "free of blemish" to pin point whether a product sell well or not.<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Question<br>Does drinking coffee at the same time as taking a calcium supplement hinder the absorption of calcium? What are the guidelines/restrictions in taking calcium supplements with coffee?<br><br>Answer<br>It is well established that intake of caffeine causes calcium to be excreted. For every cup of coffee (equivalent to 150 mg of caffeine), approximately 5 mg of calcium is excreted in the urine. The research on the effects of caffeine on calcium absorption, however, is less conclusive at this time. When that is the case, we tend to err on the side of safety and advise avoiding the use of caffeine with calcium supplements. You may drink coffee at least half hour before or after you have taken your supplement. Don't forget that caffeine is also found in many foods other than coffee such as cola drinks, tea, chocolate, and some cold medication.<br><br>What effect does caffeine consumption have on the absorption of vitamins and minerals?<br><br>Answer<br>Caffeine can increase the amount of calcium lost in the urine &amp; feces. You can make up for the calcium lost by adding milk to your coffee or tea. Don't forget that caffeine can also be found in cola drinks, chocolate, cocoa, and some cold &amp; pain relief medication. Caffeine may reduce the absorption of some minerals, such as manganese, zinc, &amp; copper, as well as vitamins such as vitamin A &amp; B complex.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you should consult your doctor, that's the best and saftest way. I don't why your distributor told you that you should stop anti biotics. We distributors always understand that we're not professionals in medicine, so if there're anythings in doubt, u must consult the doctor, you should not stop ur anti biotics like that, what if sth happen to ur health? Yes it's safe to use herbalife, but it may not be safe if u stop taking ur pill, gosh</div>
