            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br>urm I made some mistakes in my earlier posting. If you want to look at the lawsuits, look at the articles in my 3rd link. This is the link to rickross.com, and the institute is Ross Institute. Guys familiar with USA should be familiar with this institute. It also contains other info on Herbalife and Mark Hughes himself. Well, I dont think such a famous institute would make defamatory remarks on Herbalife. Plus it has excerpts from court reading and stuff. Btw, the lawsuits I think is already over.<br><br>As for the remarks that Herbalife wouldnt dare to put drugs in its products, the Purdue University (again another famous public institution) compile info from the National Council for Responsible Health Information for the Slim Chance Awards.This is in my first link. I think it is an award given for lousy products on the market. It mentioned ephedrine-laced diet pills like Herbalife. Can I ask something? What the heck is ephedrine? Me no expert on food science.<br><br>Second link on the Herbalife products and biz refers to an article by Wemos Foundation, Netherland. Urm guys, someone also can explain what is the Wemos Foundation. Think it is also an important institution too.<br><br>Well the lawsuits were on the impropriety on the part of the company. Well, I believe if you must convince the general public on the goodness of Herbalife products and biz, they have the power of internet on hand. They can find out all these and in the end, you as a distributor find it hard to explain.<br><br>As to why despite of all these problems, Mark Hughes is able to make millions, look again at the articles by Ross Institute.<br><br>Here again, happy reading. Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey guys<br>dont go flaming Herbalife the way we have done to Astral Mag and other companies. I hope to make this forum a peaceful discussion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Ok, ok.Few weeks ago, I approached a nutritionist whose slimming centre is in Changi Road.She has also appeared on newspaper before. I asked her about Herbalife since I have joined it. She talked about Herbalife products wise, and here a few pointers for you guys to think over.<br><br>!. Firstly, for a product to sell well, it must be free of blemish, like lawsuits, mishaps and stuff. I did came across few websites, which were on lawsuits on Herbalife before. Now guys, I must ask for your pardon. I lost track of that websites, but if you diligently type Herbalife on yahoo, you will come across these websites.<br><br>2. Herbalife is safe, since it has come through Health and Science Authority Singapore, but as to its effectiveness and long term safety, best if you do look through few articles such as the ones I posted. Such as the one that says and I quote " that Formula 2 is nothing more than high doses of multivitamins" .Well this was given to me by the nutritionist.<br><br>3. This is the best kick. It came from my mother. She ask me why Formula 3 contains Danggui (Cordiceps) and why am I taking it. She says cordeceps are for women, for loss of blood during pregnancy and menstruation. It is also specially for women because they have poorer composition than man. Well if Herbalife really follow Chinese medicine as they told me so, then you should ask your mother or people well versed on cordeceps or Chinese medicine for their opinions.<br><br>4. The articles never mention drugs. If you look carefully at the articles, they were reffering to certain herbs and stuff. Serious, I dont think Herbalife really dare to put drugs inside.<br><br>5.If you guys need more info, I can ask the nutritionist for more references. Well, I believe as she is an expert on this area, she should know. She also did mentioned Herbalife being worst 10 nutrition company in a ranking of 700 nutrition  companies once.<br><br>6.If you guys want to talk about Herbalife marketing plan, training and stuff, I am reluctant to discuss because of what happen to other  companies. But truthfully there are other ways to find out. One is through working in Herbalife and find out for yourself, or discuss with other World Team Leaders and Supervisors. I can link you guys to the nutritionist about this. I can only advise so far as I can because, for those senior forumers, you guys know this discussion is 'mei wan mei liao'<br><br>Thats about it. Anyway, I am out of Herbalife, and I wish those guys inside and outside the best of luck. Haha, I mean seriously.<br><br>PS - Those also interested, please find out what is Very Low Calorie Diet VLCD and Moderately Low Calorie Diet MLCD. Should help you guys! Cheers.</div></blockquote>Hi, just want to clarify, isn't cordyceps Dong Chong Chao instead of Danggui?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...herbalife does not contain the chinese medication named ephedrine and it is because people abused this chinese medication so when u abused it and overused it of course it will get u some undesireable side effects and moreover a little of everything is good but not too much jus like vit c.taking to much of it will get u liver stones but on the other hand when u combined certain kind of vitamins together jus like combining chinese medication together u need to have a 'yao yin' to catalyst the effects or to cancel the side effects of the other chinese medication when u brew them together. it works the same. u can't hv too much of anything but a bit of everything will do u good<br><br>if anyone wants to hv a good talk about this and to know more about the products of herbalife we can arrange a time to meet and talk about this.  don worry...no obligation. i jus wan to let u know what is this about.<br>anyways this is about network marketing. not mlm. its a total different thing<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
