            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">3. This is the best kick. It came from my mother. She ask me why Formula 3 contains Danggui (Cordiceps) and why am I taking it. She says cordeceps are for women, for loss of blood during pregnancy and menstruation. It is also specially for women because they have poorer composition than man. Well if Herbalife really follow Chinese medicine as they told me so, then you should ask your mother or people well versed on cordeceps or Chinese medicine for their opinions.<br></div></blockquote>In the ancient China, cordyceps was highly recommended as one of the most effective medicines for all illness. Due to its anti-aging and cure-all properties, it can be compared to ginseng, reishi and deer velvet. In general, cordyceps is a tonic that help the body build strength, improve the organic functioning, strengthen the immune system and bring longevity.<br><br>- not just used for pregnancy or women.<br><br>http://www.chinese-herbs.org/cordyceps/<br><br>I'm a bit sceptical as well, but see how.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I do not think Herbalife is bad or contain any harmful herbs or whatsoever. This is because even toddles can have it!! It is true and I heard it from a testimony.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Besides, since it can be approved into 59 countries, been around for 25 years, the doubts shouldn't be much. If it were to be harmful, almost the whole world would know since MILLIONS of people or BILLIONS used it. There are so many testimonials from people around us who got better using Herbalife. Even my friend's gf, a doctor, is using it. Doctors came for the Herbalife training and joined. Nobel prize winner as the researcher. What more can you say?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Herbalife were to be sued. It's usually the famous and good reputation getting sued. A very good example is MacDonald.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Lauren.. no offence.. but i think you are trying to get more attention or kicking up a fuss? I feel that you are just trying to pinpoint at Herbalife whenever you can. Like the dang gui and all tt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Besides that, 1000 calories isn't less. Do you know that a new report from last year in Tibet says that, the best amount of calories taken in daily is around 700 to 800? You can live longer like as healthy person. (I heard it from someone. Any one can clarify this?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>look.. I'm not trying to cushion to U! I'm not in the least interested in earning ur money o wad! 1st.. u r saying that Herbalife is unethical! U are saying that u are scammed of ur money!<br><br>There could only be 3 reasons why u are saying so:<br>1) It is true so there is a black sheep among the company. We will find out the black sheep!<br>2) You've once been a Herbalife distributor and you've failed. Hence, you take it to heart!<br>3) You are from another company and trying to make tales of Herbalife which is really unethical and despicable. (hope u r NOT!)<br><br>So which of it do u belongs to? You are always escaping my questions which directs to why you've failed to get results from the products. It shows to me that you are trying to hide something. Stop giving those lame excuses if you want your money worth!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Alex Wong:</div><div class="quote_body">dont have to cushion me... i already sick of herbalife.</div></blockquote></div>
