But I didnt work that day so I dont know what happened. I should have, it was on 10th August 2007.<br><br>Everything you want to know about Bel'Air or Avita is inside, because this belongs to a Bel'Air, Avita member or whatever..<br><br>And he/she whatever has openly criticised you guys in criticising them. (:<br><br>CHEERS.</div></blockquote>You ppl see, Avita is trying to hide the truth of FGN of their evil deeds. By claiming that blogger from sgforum cry after failing biz only show that Avita is still dishonest. Only because we succeed to a certain position, we then know a lot of truth on FGN on their evil did. How can one who have not succeed in Bel'air able to know their secrets deeply. Many of us do succeed in the biz but opt out due to our conscious, not because we fail. Some of us here are even marquis(Bel'air shareholder), which proven our success in the biz previously.<br><br>About transistion fee for converting from Bel'air to Avita, its too expensive you only got little stocks left. Not worth converting. For those who cut 1+5, i think its better to convert if still have more than 1 full invoice of stocks left.<br><br>For scental, it better for them not to speak up for FGN, or it only shows that they are as notorious as FGN. We would'nt hold anything against them only if them don't interfere. Scental should have known of the evil did of FGN. Trying to shield FGN would'nt help them. FGN should openly apologise to their victims thru any tv media of their evil deeds if they want to revamp. Also they must allow public to view their biz &amp; marketing plan without hiding anything(show that they no longer scam ppl).  Last but not list, FGN must compensate their victims what they scam from them(not a single cent less than what they scam). This is the only way FGN can be revamp else they will do to their worst.</div>

The biz can't be done. Even you can get ppl inyo your biz, they surely force you to invest more $, so as to keep you in the biz. If not they are not able to sustain their biz.<br><br></div></blockquote>It is 9000PV if you buy up straight from Franchisee (VIP in Avita). 12000 if you accumulate slowly all the way there. It is cheaper than Bel Air Count, but still I don't think anyone should go that way, unless you have a really solid plan to sell off those goods, which most people wouldn't have.<br><br>Totally agree that this is not the way to do this business. Hope Mr 666 from Myanmar will wisen up and leave that group he is in before it is too late.<br><br>However, I have to say that there are really proper ways of doing this business, but it takes plenty of hard work and certainly no quick bucks to earn in the short run, definitely cannot be described as an easier path than doing a job as an employee in any company/organisation.<br><br>For those people whom Rachel described, complain about how hard it is to work for other people, complain that traditional business is too difficult to do, ... these people probably will never succeed in doing anything at all in their lives, unless they change their mindsets and really improve themselves. They can hide behind a "business" to cheat other people's money, manipulate other people's emotions, but like most criminals they can't hide for long. This world isn't exactly a fair place unfortunately, so some may still get away with it for the rest of their lives.<br><br>This business is not for everyone, just like certain professions or certain traditional businesses are just not suitable for anyone. I totally agree with Rachel that some of us will earn very good money, and most important of all be much happier, just being a successful employee. Same goes for successful traditional businesses.<br><br>Rachel, have you already crossed over to Avita? You do sound like you have been through a hell lot in Bel Air.</div>

MLM goods will be lot more difficult to sell as they are already excessively over price. You can go to search for much cheaper &amp; better stuff to sell on yahoo auction. I think it is better to leave the group as they might try hard to dig your pocket of $$$. Best to return goods if you have already invest. It is very much easiler to earn extra income elsewhere.</div>

Those who already convert their goods can sell Avita goods instead of Bel'Air's. Avita goods are cheaper &amp; easiler to sell. Thus, easiler to clear stock.

Plus I got this gut feel that it may be extended by a bit ...<br><br>Anyway, that's for Singapore. Distributors from other countries have longer deadlines, so your info still valuable.<br><br>BTW, you can't convert your Bel Air goods to Avita goods from the company, only can exchange with other distributors who are willing to do so. Unless you know of any other ways, which will be very useful to share with the rest of us.</div>

In singapore mlm law, no matter how long you join, you can still return goods.Before returning goods, you can go to CASE web page to print out mlm laws. There are alredy many ppl whose stocks are more than 1 years, still can return goods. Of course you can only get back 30% return of the value of the goods.<br><br>For ppl who are in Avita, go return your goods as soon as possible before its too late. Don't think that you can earn $$$ in Avita. Quit Avita as soon as possible. PPL doing Avita are mostly in debt. Get out of AVita &amp; Bel'Air, you can slowly get out of debt.</div>
