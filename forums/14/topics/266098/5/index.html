              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I read through the whole avita forum but not the belair forum. </p>
              <p>I was from FGN. Left few months ago. </p>
              <p>Concerning sueing FGN ah. It will be very difficult. First thing first. Lee and Lee law firm is representing AVITA not FGN. If you were to sue FGN, you have to sue the correct company and get the company registration number. Since Falcon Global Network is a Pte Ltd it is a legal entity - which means you sue the company and not the person. The director of the company is most probably the brothers. If you have the money to sue them and say if you win, since FGN is a legal entity the most it will be shut down and the brothers can easily set up a new legal entity for example Falcon Global Pte Ltd. Anyway, the real business name for FGN is </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px;  ">FALCON GLOBAL NETWORK 88 PTE. LTD.</span></p>
              <p>You can go a check of your company profile by going to www.acra.gov.sg and click serach business name and enter your search. If you pay 5 dollars you will get to know how much they they make and how much tax you pay.</p>
              <p>They have already changed their name once. So sueing is not the way to go unless you have a lot of money money money to waste. Registering for a company is very easy. So really really no point sueing them. </p>
              <p>As a ex-FGN...the tactics they use is really shit!! no doubt about it. REALLY SHIT! Anyway...all FGN people....when we join FGN, are we joining to become a business owner ourselves? or are we joining a family business? Brothers and auntie...Now they will have one more demale dp who is incharge of FGN's account. Sounds like a family business to me leh!!</p>

              <p>TO: Keeponmylife,</p>
              <p>Hey bro! i read your post in another forum. Really dont sue them. Dont waste your money! will not work! </p>
              <p>The most you can do is to get people to give out pamplets to those walking in pairs into E-center. One with shirt and pants the other more casual. You konw the drill right? Wednesday, saturday cashflow workshop. Friday Trends, Monday booksharing. You konw the drill. Flyers distributors only 5 dollars an hrs. So much cheaper than sueing.</p>
              <p>You see...by giveing flyers brothers cannot pay the rent. No one goes to workshop....no cutting of GA or SA. No cutting no commission. No commission no money. No money then how to finance the black 2-door car, how to pay installment for the new E-center, no money how to finance the REAL-LIFE CASHFLOW GAME?? When they no commission then how? </p>
              <p>My personal Meeting after Meeting with myself after i left FGN is 'When emotions and logic are fighting each other, Emotion always win." So take one step back. Cool down, talk a deep breath, and if you really really wan revenge, get people to give flyers at the walk way of E-center. You did survey along the streets, in NLB and also in shopping centers. Now use what you learn...and sweep them off their feet. Remember, public area equals everyone's playground. We used it for survey before, you can use it for flyers too. </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents. </p>

              <p>I met someone at Vivo, near the entrance to the MRT station, about 1-2 months ago.</p>
              <p>Ya she claimed that they had a lot of NUS/NTU alumni and were doing this Cashflow boardgame. She did a survey and asked me if I was interested in joining the game. She said it would cost $10. She also gave me a book to read.</p>
              <p>I agreed and went to E-Centre in Bukit Merah on a Saturday. She said the place was shared by a few entrepreneurs who "agreed" to let them hold this session regularly.</p>
              <p>The session was attended mostly by young people. We watched videos of Robert Kiyosaki giving a speech at some Chinese Uni before it began. An entrepreneur gave a short speech and explained how the boardgame works. Then after the game, the girl who introduced me to this place, discussed with me about what I wanted in life, the book I read and so on.</p>
              <p>At the end of the session, she asked me for a $15 fee. (Notice it is different from what she told me earlier on. I thought this time that I had heard the figure wrongly earlier. After reading through this thread and the one at stomp, I realised it was $10 after all.)</p>
              <p>I went for a book sharing session on a Mon and to another boardgame session on a Wed. Then after that she asked me what I learnt from the game and book sharing sessions so far and whether I was interested to do business. I told her I was willing to come for more sessions but I would wait a few years to decide what business to do.</p>
              <p>Strangely after that, she did not call me to go for any sessions at all. I found it very strange as I understood the group to be some sort of entrpreneural group to share their experiences and mentor each other. Although it now seems to me that she looked as if she spent a lot of her time there. Maybe if I had shown the slightest interest, then she would try to convince me to be her downline.</p>
              <p>Concidentally, a few years back, a friend from my army unit asked me to go to his company (Bel'Air) to listen to a talk. It was near Commonwealth MRT then, the signboard (visible from MRT) has since been changed to AVITA ! During that time, it seems that they weren't so creative. The talk just talked about how doing business can let you become rich. No boardgame whatsoever. I wasn't interested and my friend did not really convince me much to join him.</p>

              <p>think the girl who introduced you was not so skillful, i used to go for the board game and after playing about 6 times then they asked if i see an opportunity there, that was really subtle and i nearly got sucked in, lucky my mom knew that FGN was a company that was investigated by a government body and i stopped going immediately, and anyway i don't think they will get rich as they have been working like grinders for so long and when they reach the good ranks they earn $4-5k and $10k at those achieved ranks like platinum director and diamond director respectively after 2-4years, if someone who put in that amount of effort in some other company then will most likely be earning at least $30k and above.</p>

              <p>it is not the 1st time i read this thread. my heart is painful
              everytime i read it. I feel the pain of others as well.i did not try to
              pen down and tried to avoid thinking about this..but it has been
              painful everyday..especially when the MRT passing by Commenwealth
              station..</p>
              <p>It has been almost 8 months after i left Avita. I was from FGN
              and I left after joining for 5 months.Recalling back, it was like 1
              year ago, when i was in my final year in the Uni, feeling lost and
              looking for opportunity, to do something different for myself and loved
              ones.</p>
              <p>it was a long story and alot of conincidences had
              eventually drew me to join this team. To be frank, they are kind and
              helpful all the while, esepcially when they understand my financial
              situation and my busy schedule. I did enjoy the fighting team spirit
              and those motivational moments, especially during the company training.</p>
              <p>I must be fair to myself to say that i ve learned quite alot of things about life, mindset and attitude in that process.</p>
              <p>Yet,
              i struggle of being told that everything is about mindset mindset and
              mindset..i mean everyone is different, our personality and environment
              influence our behaviors and mindset, it is not solely following the
              leader without questioning.</p>
              <p>I remember I had a very caring
              upline. Yet sorry to say that he is really not capable enough to lead
              me, in the end I have more doubts about this business, especially when
              some new friends went for workshops and ask some questions that they
              couldnt really answer beautifully, which sounded fishy to me.</p>
              <p>I
              was very tired in the process, i gave up my last semester, sacrificing
              my health and time with friends , just to pursue this never ending RAT
              RACE, where i would go to the centre everyday, doing routine things,
              try to be motivated, try to stay positive...it repeated for 5
              months...I was really sick of those life..sick of being a rat
              underground (never tell people you are doing MLM)..sick of their cliche
              and activities...all sounded self deceiving to me..and i feel pity for
              them..especially i saw some ex-associates in the shopping mall, we
              smiled to each other from far wthout saying hi, as i had developed the
              phobia towards the people as well..i guess..eventho they were once good
              friends...i dont wanna spoilt the memory and impression on them by
              trying to discuss with them, as i suppose most of them have either the
              same thoughts as me yet/or deeply psycho-ed/dare not to face themselves
              to against those anti-MLMers like me</p>
              <p>I had a coursemate who joined under me as a VIP, thank God she
              is a skeptic. She dropped out as she found the routine bored. I once
              thought she is dragging my process of succeeding, as i was brained
              washed by my uplines..Eventually this friend still appreciate me as a
              good friend who share and taught alot of things to make her more
              mature...glad that we still have good relationship even after we left
              it.</p>
              <p>I felt bad everytime i thought of it, mainly due to the money
              i owed my friends to be a GA. I found myself was really stupid. i had
              financial difficulty and been living depressed by this since i left the
              place (although i really felt i have my life back) .Now I have left 1/3
              of the debts, but i still feel sorry to those that had helped me yet i
              had told a lie to them.I am a foreigner and i suffer more from the
              money problem, and i also never told my parents about the debt tho they
              knew im no longer doing that thing. Shameful whenever i recalled my
              claims to them i will get rich soon. I was like a kid.</p>
              <p>I had invited a few friends down and they knew it is MLM
              afterall, one of them respected me as a senior, and now i just felt
              myself abit shameful to talk to him again.</p>
              <p>It is not something i
              like, nor agree with. I try to be rational, appreciate those educationa
              and experience they gave me. I also wanna thank Thomas who helped me to
              clear my stocks to pay off some debts tho not much. i ve learned things
              only in the 1st 3 months..after that..things are just going into
              motions. learn nothing about proper business and entreprenuership,
              learn nothing about technical knowledge, learn nothing about investment
              and real estate etc...but learned helplessness and lost</p>
              <p>I had started to earn money online since i left the place, and
              since recently i have seen some results. Persistence may be the key,
              but doing the right thing ( in one's principle) is really the core
              value and motivation to be success. I do hope some of us here can share
              about more alternatives and solutions to cope with the debts we taking.</p>
              <p>All the best to all of us here</p>

              <p>We all were once so strongly brainwashed by the FGN people. Was once convience that i can fullfill all the dreams in a short amount of time. Was convience of a 5 figure income. Trusted my friend so much to believe it can all be done. After i get in then i realised all the techniques that they used to lure people in. Must 'open up the heart', 'build trust', 'leading conversation', 'C-info'. I find the most unmoral thing to do in FGN is to write all about what you know about your friend and also the key points about close friend into the c-info. Infomation that close friend only share to someone they trust onto a piece a paper and be read by upline to be used as discussion for the next step to lure them in. I didn't expect my friend who lure me in could have done that until i went in. To them, it makes business sense. It do make sense in terms of business world, but close friends are not to be used as a tool to earn money. That's what i feel. </p>
              <p>I'd bump into some FGN people doing survey on the street. I would still consider a very small number of them friends, most of them i dont give a damn. Some of them really has got a good and kind soul just that they decide to continue doing what they are told. Most of them are just shit. I know more shit inside then in my workplace. Some of them are just too brainwashed to realised what they are doing. Anyway, in FGN, they want smart people that will simply 100% believe and 100% follow. If you are smart but will question a lot then you will not be accepted. They only want smart dogs to do the tricks and be loyal. Nothing else.</p>

              <p>oh wow... sorry for my ignorance..</p>
              <p>but dunno that Bel'Air and Avita create so much distrust..</p>
