There are alredy many ppl whose stocks are more than 1 years, still can return goods. Of course you can only get back 30% return of the value of the goods.<br><br>For ppl who are in Avita, go return your goods as soon as possible before its too late. Don't think that you can earn $$$ in Avita. Quit Avita as soon as possible. PPL doing Avita are mostly in debt.

Their lawyers always side them. Unless you have your own lawyer, that will be expensive. Earning thru higher salary or invest in funds can also help you recoup your losses in  less than 2 years. Even you return goods, you can only get not more than $4k per count plate. Even do part-time, you can easily earn that small amount of $$$.<br><br>For ppl who cut count less than 90 days, its better to return goods for refund.<br>Do anyone think that such crap goods sold by Avita or Bel'air has any demand in market. Alternatives of Essential oil &amp; cleaning agent of much higher quality &amp; cheaper price are many times better. Do you think still easy to cheat ppl into such scam?</div>

Doesn't this sound very strangely familiar to many of the regulars here or the Bel Air thread??<br><br>From what you described, your friend is being mislead into the dark side, definitely not the right way to do the business. If anyone tell you MLM business is so easy to earn quick bucks, better stay away from those people.<br><br>If she is really a good friend of yours, you should do her a big favour. If she is in debt, convince her to get out quickly. She definitely can refund, because Avita is less than 90 days old technically. There's no need to curse your friend, think about how you can help her!<br><br>If you go dig around for more information and get a more complete picture, Avita is certainly NOT Bel Air. However, if those people continue to operate in the same mode as they did in Bel Air and get really successful at it, Avita might end up in the same sorry state as Bel Air.</div>

All mlmer have the right to return goods to quit mlm. Who you think the %**k %*u are to discourage ppl from returning goods. Many victims thought returning goods made them lost more $$$, but in the end some of them can't even get back a sinle cent by not returning goods. I think you shuld be the one staying away from this topic!!!<br>So you are so free to come here to defend Avita? Don't your upline ask you not to come here? Should I discipline you for your upline? If you have no courge to find job outside or start a real biz, then don come here to pollute sgforums with your pro-mlm shit words!!!!!!!!!!!!! Same for all mlmers!!!!!!<br><br>Return goods before 3 mths, you can get 30% from company, the rest from you uplines. Total around 90%. If any upline tell you all the shit that you get very little by returning goods, that bullshit. They are either too afraid to pay you when you return goods, or they dont have the $$$ to pay you back. Only if you return after 3 mths, you can get only 30% . It is not right to make ppl lost $$$ by calling them not to return goods!!!!!!<br><br>Even can't return goods, can still sell your Avita products online instead of recruiting victims into Avita. It is much easlier selling online than recruiting ppl as doing recruitment is doing pyramid scam which whole singapore is aware of it. Anyone you can find is already super resistance to pyramid scam. The most improfessional thing for mlmer is to claim that network marketing is different from pyramid scam! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Marques george Lim &amp; Marques Xiong Yu Ting left FGN. Heard that Marques Wei Xiang wanted to leave the network but being force to stay.<br><br>If MLM is so good, why still ppl who succeed in the biz left?<br>The truth is Bel'Air &amp; Avita is not a decent biz which providing sufficient income.<br>You can count numbers of "successful" ppl leaving the biz. PPl leave the so call "biz" is not they failed in the biz. They leave because they have the courage to step out mlm to earn decent living! Not to hide away from reality of the society.---- not like some ppl(losers) hiding themselves in MLM .<br><br>( Only ppl with courage to face competition in the working society Or real biz world with succeed).<br><br>Most of us leaving Bel'air or Avita as realising the "biz" could harm many others just for the benefit of expand the network. For ppl who still want to continue the "biz",think twice.<br><br>Having a big network does not mean earning money. Look at Marques Balwin Tan. He left the network when have a number of downlines yet in debt due to buying his RX8. Look cool, think twice!<br><br>Ong kai Yang who had a network of around 20 downlines only left fewer than 3 downines.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the ways of surviving in the Bel'Air biz back then most likely the same now in Avita.<br><br>All the dukes back then after coming back from Taiwan and crazy about going up to Arch Duke. They started to force their downlines to move faster to the next level. If those who don't follow, the will be out casted by their dukes.<br><br>The thinking of the dukes cause everyone in biz to think of low down ways to survive. When all of us got into the biz, we were thinking of how to recoup the initial amount back and also thinking of helping people. Then in turn out the dukes are cheating everyone.<br><br>That period was when everybody is desperate to do something for themselve.<br><br>Coming up here is to shared if all what the uplines were doing. Sometimes, when we start to post here, we really get pissed off by the actions of the dukes. How they try to get rid of those people who they think are harming their network.<br><br>To all the Dukes or now DP!!! It is yourself, your low down thinkings and your lack of capabilities that caused everythings.<br><br></div>

But there was a time when uplines tried to help their c.dukes to go up to dukes, all unethical means were used. Many of us experience our uplines pressuring us from cutting 1+5. XueYing was not the only one. Methods such as  threaten to cut of leveraging were used. If is not true, do you think we are so irrespossible to bad mouth our own uplines.<br><br>Secondly,you are just a loyal friend of those uplines who has also been taken in by their words. Do you know unethical methods used on our side line actually leak out aciddentially to their own down lines thru their own mouth.<br>Those uplines don't even notice themselves being eavedropped by sidelines during their private meeting. When uplines felt finacially pressured, they accidentially shown signs of financial difficultly.<br><br>If you are not in the business, how you know that ppl are not force to cut 1+5. Don't be used by anyone easily by taken in by upline's one-side story.<br>You need to hear from us too.<br><br>Thirdly, by coming to this forums, we are preventing victims from suffering what many has gone thru before. I don't blame you as you are the type of person easily taken in by other ppl's words. We over heard many things even from our uplines accidentially, that why we know the true story.<br><br>To uplines such as Ong Kai Yang, WenHui &amp; Don Lim, do you know how much secrets leak from your own mouth?   That was how careless you are!<br><br>Lastly, thinking that all of us here aims to vent anger or cry failures in mlm is a wrong mindset. None of us mourn , but taking the courage to face compettion in both working society &amp; biz world. Most of us here reveal the truth of the biz , stopping more victims from victimise by such scams. Reason of us to quit is not due to failure in the "biz" but due to self-conscious. Potcallingthekettleblack, since you metion that your last post , don't let us see you again!!!</strong></div>
