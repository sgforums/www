            <div class='col-md body'>I think what Rachel posted is very true about the Avita compensation plan.<br><br>However, Rachel may not be 100% correct in terms of Avita's product range. Avita does have some new stuff that wasn't in Bel Air before, but currently, Avita still doesn't have the diffusion aromatherapy stuff.<br><br>Another important point to note is that cross over is not entirely free for Counts and above. You'll need to purchase about $500 worth of stuff to complete the transition. Baron and Franchisee only need to pay $60 registration.<br><br>You can't directly change your Bel Air vouchers/products for Avita products at Avita stock centre, but that can be done through private arrangements, especially with those of us who have plenty of existing Bel Air consumers. Avita products include some family care products that are lower price and I personally find them much easier to sell than diffusion oil. A good strategy for clearing off your Count/Marquis/(Duke??) stock.<br><br>Anyone who wants more information or need any help, please feel free to PM me.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by RachelX:</div><div class="quote_body">All Bel Air members, distributors and consumers alike, are offered the opportunity to transit directly to AVITA membership with the privilege of retaining their ranks.
