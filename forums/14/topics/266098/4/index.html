COOL!<br><br>Wish a heart to help my downlines. I quitted my job to give my full commitment.

A team i spend years to build but gone overnight.<br>People start blaming each other.<br>Pple in belair blame outside. Exhuoban blame inside pple. whahhaha .<br><br>Are belairians all devils? Are Ex huobans all Angels.?<br><br>U answer yourself.<br><br>Oh finally why i mention "SO funny"?<br><br>Cos it been more than a year.

They dun feel sad?they are for u to scold?jus that they are 'lucky' to be marquis they are bad people?<br><br>ok ok enuff of my rubbish.<br><br>welcome to flame me. cos i was once a marquis LOL<br><br>My point.<br><br>Two words. LET GO<br><br>which is worth 2 cents<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">It is a good choice for you to quit.<br><br>Firstly, you have admitted most ppl do the biz go into debts. It's good to admitted. By quiting, you have stopped victim cycle from repeating. The more ppl being bring in, the more ppl suffer cos it is more like a pyramid scam then a biz. Now you have admitted ppl doing the biz don't earn $$$ but are mostly in heavy debt instead.<br><br>Secondly, we only pointed some marquis &amp; dukes are really bad by using unethical means of achieveing their goals. But there are few who are not as bad(we did not say all are bad). As for what you mention that how much you sacrificed your $$$, only you knows. Maybe true or not, only you knows. I not against you.<br><br>Thirdly, i advise those who are still doing to do pure selling &amp; refrain from recruitment. I am not against selling but recruiting count or whatever you call in Avita will only continue the cycle of victims. It is not that many of us hatred those Dukes or marquis so much, but they had not change. Still doing pure recruitment. You ppl had aware that ppl you brought in go into debts, so why still bringing more ppl?<br><br>Lastly, mlm has long being branded as a scam. Most of them are pyramid scams in disguise(i did not say all). Most ppl are also aware of such scams.<br>Everyone regardless of exhuoban or those still in the biz really needs to solve the debt issue together. I already debt free &amp; start build up little wealth since i left, but there are still exhuoban or Belairians still in debt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Do rethink when doing such pyramid scams, you might have harm more ppl. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>[i]</span>[/i]</div>

All exsiting huobans should stop recruiting victims into a pyramid scam. If they are still trying to continue recruiting ppl, they are becoming worse. They don't have to fake responsibility if no courage to leave.

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with what warrior21 said.<br><br><blockquote><br>My point.<br><br>Two words. LET GO<br><br>which is worth 2 cents<br></blockquote>myself a CM and i quit using the disappearing act.... Up to date I still owe 20k to a friend...<br><br>For us those who have been in it and quit... is a painful experience for us...<br>GREED !!!! thats human nature... who doesnt love money when the money seems easy to make especially those starting to work and want to get this get that or those who love cars and want to own our own cars....<br><br>Having all those big dreams.... I was hoping to quickly recover back the money and believe that we are helping others to earn too....<br>Im one of the jiang that they considered... but after awhile of unable to meet the target of having people coming in... they will say you are not following the system... give 1st chance... 2nd chance and then consider as trash...<br><br>Burning mid-nite oil to plan to discuss... saying that our day job is secondary compare to the business.... If I didnt have a day job.... I wouldnt even have money to go hawker for a decent meal.... My health deteriorated when im in the business... I get small sickness easily like flu cough due to insufficient rest for the body and mind and it doesnt cure very fast... now that Im out... I have not taken MC for my current job for half a year and I have time to go for run, gym, cycling to keep fit.. They will say use the products to cure... Yar the products can help to a certain extend but the products are not shen yao... In the business I heard an upline get so sick and having fever till cant get out of bed... Did this upline use the product ?? If have shouldnt have fall till that sick... Body &amp; Mind need to rest.. not max it out till like no tmw... They will say that I didnt ask you to stay till that late.... who dare to leave so early... IF leave early then will indirectly tell the uplines that the mindset is like working cos come late go off early thus wouldnt get any help... So if you are in the associate shoe will you leave early to rest as the day job drain you out??<br><br>I have no hard feelings for them nor I support MLM....<br>Just want to let go of this painful experience cos I dont know where to put my face if I even get to face those friends I approach and especially to my parents when I freshly join the biz telling them im able to let them go on a gd holiday till now I havent done so..<br><br>Read the whole forum on Bel'Air and Avita.... Im from FGN... From what I know Don bought a merc CLK and Shiyun is the 1 driving.... The Lim brothers bought a bungalow which they invited M &amp; above for hse seeing...  I dont know whats the method on how they bought the car and hse so I have no comment.. just for the info for those who flame them.</div>

              <p>I agree with k2wanviet that the recruitment strategies used by Bel'Air (or AAA in particular), are unethical according to my own beliefs and perceptions on ethics. And I accept that not everyone shares the same views as I do, boh bian, just have to accept.</p>

              <p>And in response to Phaze's reply to SoFunny, my view is that the statement "to enter and leave at the right time" is objective, unprejudiced. Ultimately, the choice to join or decline the offer, to join and to stay, to join and to leave is dependent on each and every individual's judgement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since I made the decision to AAA with whatever that was presented to me that I deemed favourable, I should be fully (or at least, partly) responsible for my own decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that I'm in, wah, so this is how AAA work.</p>

              <p>You seem to have completely missed the point.  :)</p>
              <p>Or perhaps I just don't understand what your point is.</p>
              <p>Before I continue, I would like to clarify something. From this point on, when I use the word "you" or "your", I don't mean you JiangBenXiao. I mean "you" in the general sense.</p>
              <p>The choice to join or decline the offer, to join or to stay, is every individual's decision. Each person makes his decisions as best he can.</p>
              <p>But when a person is lied to, you rob him of his ability to make a decision. You are manipulating information to influence his decision making process for your own benefit.</p>
              <p>The person is not able to determine what the right time to enter or leave is, because you have misrepresented the status of the company.</p>
              <p>That makes you unethical. That makes you scum.</p>
              <p>And like I said before, I can understand if you were lied to and conned. Maybe you didn't realise it was a pyramid scheme. Maybe you truly believed what you were told. You trusted your friend, or your family member to not do you harm and you thought you really could help others, and in turn help yourself. So you go out and recruit wholeheartedly with the fervour of a true believer.</p>
              <p>I can accept that.</p>
              <p>But once you find out the truth, you have to stop. So what if you have to help your existing downlines. That doesn't give you the right to pull even more people into the scheme. You cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.</p>

              <p>So much things to say but it better to keep in the heart.</p>
              <p>Else it going to be another ugly debate again. You mentioned pple might missed your point, have u wondered whether u did missed other pple's point too.</p>
              <p>Flame others only when u read properly. Put urself into other pple shoes first before u call pple names.</p>
              <p>PS: I not against anyone. Neither am i looking for any flaming. Just my views.</p>
