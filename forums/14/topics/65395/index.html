Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies.

Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>

Coz lousy products selling at high price, ineffective or unscrupulous management etc etc  are rampant through out the corporate world. All companies, no matter what form, their goals are profit making in the end, so we shouldnt be assumming different level of business ethics for different industries, well, anyway, there are mountains of assumptions and myths in every facet of our life already.<br><br>Urm, regarding FL and Unicity, dont wanna comment, except heard their Aloe Vera Juice is good, but I was thinking ,and these are my thoughts...<br><br>a) Would the difference in price due to several crucial factors, like different potency in ingredients used, quality manufacturing practices, absorption rate guaranteed etc etc, its like abalone, different grade produce distinctive price levels. I agreed with someone once said to me, some of the best products are in direct selling companies, you just gotta find them....<br><br>b) Hmm, how to dicern unscrupulous and quality biz management team. Like in this forum, some are based on hearsays, rumours, close contacts with the management etc, how to sift out rumours from the hard truth. Some were like reputation and things one had done, like what James Phang did in Malaysia, how about the rest??<br><br>Urm *headache,headache* arghhh<br><br>Cheers!</div>
