              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT FIRST.</strong></span></p>
              <p>From what I know directly from my friends in I<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>nsurance and Financial area, they (sales agents) have NO BASIC PAY.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The
                  only sales employment which I know got basic is Car Sales Agent with a
                  monthly basic of $500 sufficient for their own transportation only.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Personalty of Poster:</span></strong></p>
              <p>Kan-Chong spider, wants to get facts right in his own point of view without finding out the the basic information, from the frequent posts of his, you can see that he display a sense of <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>LACK OF PATIENCE.</strong></span></p>
              <p>His inability to understand the basics even before starting to question makes him prone to more mis-understandings in future.</p>
              <p>He is someone whom spreads gossips and false information if given the chance to do so, wanting to flame the thread-starter only. (This isn't the first time you do this, after few months, you're still doing the same thing, no change in personality.)</p>
              <p>He is staying in his own comfort zone, having an reluctance to even find out/ learn more. A Frog In The Well.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT
              FIRST.</strong></span></p>
              <p>From what I know directly from my friends in I<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>nsurance and Financial area, they (sales
              agents) have NO BASIC PAY.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The only sales employment which I know got basic is Car Sales
              Agent with a monthly basic of $500 sufficient for their own
              transportation only.</p>

              <p>Kan-Chong spider, wants to get facts right in his own point of
              view without finding out the the basic information, from the
              frequent posts of his, you can see that he display a sense of
              <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>LACK OF
              PATIENCE.</strong></span></p>
              <p>His inability to understand the basics even before starting to
              question makes him prone to more mis-understandings in future.</p>
              <p>He is someone whom spreads gossips and false information if
              given the chance to do so, wanting to flame the thread-starter
              only. (This isn't the first time you do this, after few months,
              you're still doing the same thing, no change in personality.)</p>
              <p>He is staying in his own comfort zone, having an reluctance to
              even find out/ learn more. A Frog In The Well.</p>

              <p>Since this is my thread, I will end off nicely with your post despite your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">childish, spoilt brat behavior in the forum</span></strong></span>.</p>
              <p><strong>Sarcasm</strong> will lead you nowhere in business and instead it tells your business partners you lack substance to expand businesses.</p>
              <p>To make matter worse, you claim to have a own company perhaps it's just a store but don't you know general business operations?</p>
              <p>There's this common term: Example if you're <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">selling a food as main business,</span></strong> do you <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">tell your competitors or strangers your winning food recipe</span></strong>? <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No right</span></strong>. Use your common sense la.</p>
              <p>You
                  don't pay me any money in return for my knowledge so I am not obliged
                  to reply back something that's classified within any business. Unless
                  you're telling a lie or something, I'm wondering how you do your
                  business, unless you're the kind that use pour in more money to make
                  money vs intelligent strategic money advertisment planning to increase
                  any business profits.</p>
              <p>I'm sure you're the former instead of the latter which I learnt via paying school fees directly from mentors in private courses.</p>
              <p>I'm
                  not sure if it's me who have improved my enlish or you took a turn for
                  the worse. Because my english is only a C5 for your information - to be
                  be sarcastic but rather based on my experience handling negative
                  clients/prospects over the few years whom I've met in mlm, it equipped
                  me with more knowledge than anyone would learn from setting up their
                  own business without any proper mentor as guidance to say what's right
                  and wrong thus business always compete against one another without
                  thinking of other alternatives.</p>
              <p>The way top management of any
                  company also selectively reply back to queries, because like I've said
                  lots of times over the years in sgforums mlm threads - The more you say
                  and defend, the more clients think you lack knowledge, proper business
                  handling skills isn't learn by just being a boss, but rather learning
                  from other people's mistakes and making their error to your advantage
                  like what I'm doing now isn't it?</p>
              <p>This skill will help you save thousands of dollars in future if you know how to correctly put in into application.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Previously you posted</strong></span> this question:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px;">property/insurence
                                          agents take money when being hired and get a basic pay as well</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now you posted</strong></span> this question</p>
              <p>yes certain insurance/property companies in singapore do not
                  provide a basic salary. BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO DO PROVIDE A BASIC
                  SALARY. <br> can you tell me <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">any mlms </span></strong>where they give their sales people a basic
                  salary?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My response previously</strong></span></p>
              <p>The only sales employment which I know got basic is Car Sales
                                          Agent with a monthly basic of $500 sufficient for their own
                                          transportation only.</p>
              <p>Have I not answered your questions or was it you who fail to read between the lines?</p>
              <p><em><strong>Observation 1</strong></em>: You read only the text which I highlighted only</p>
              <p>The answer is obvious.</p>
              <p><em><strong>O</strong></em><em><strong>bservation 2</strong></em>:
                  is that you keep changing your statement/question. When you're losing
                  your stance already you quickly jump to the other ship, hoping the
                  compeitor never notice.</p>
              <p><strong>Observation 3:</strong></p>
              <p>You posted:</p>

                  salary?</p>
              <p>My intial Starting Post said:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Try to refrain from
                                      posting the mlm company's name</span></strong></p>
              <p>Remark: You're just trying to twist and turn the rules to your own personal advantage only. Always breaking rules and upsetting the flow.</p>
              <p>If you're doing a business, I can only say you will end up betraying your partners whom you worked with in face of difficulties.</p>
              <p>This
                  trick is so commonly used by MLM/Insurance/Financial Agents that I know
                  the tricks by simply looking and reading.. I'm not bragging here but
                  these are real skills which I've learnt to equipped myself despite my
                  lost of SGD$5000+ in it but it's a lesson well learn.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Solution</span></strong></p>
              <p>Instead
                  of cutting each other's throat here, why don't you take your time to
                  learn more, get a mentor or perhaps we can discuss and clear doubts in
                  another thread but on condition you behave yourself to position
                  yourself as a genuine business owner instead of a spoilt brat demanding
                  for milk when you're all grown up to even feed milk to babies.</p>
              <p>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">reason you lost to me</span> not once, not twice, not thrice as of yesterday but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">FOUR TIMES</span></span> is because of your lack of business experiences in handling people and
                  of course other factors which you failed to observed. Yes you may be
                  rich enough to start your own business, but without the BASICs, all you
                  are is just an empty vessel which makes the most noise.</p>
              <p>I've given more than enough of response to your reply. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Kindly let me focus on others to solve their problems instead okay? </strong></span></p>
              <p>You
                  need to be friendly and willing to share good things with others in
                  business for many reasons, but those are again business strategies
                  which I can't reveal without any money benefits in return.</p>

              <p>All I can say about products is that different companies' products serve a different market and they each have their unique selling point.</p>
              <p>For instance:</p>
              <p>Marie France Body Line</p>
              <p>Slim Fit</p>
              <p>Bottom Slim</p>
              <p>New York (Facial)</p>
              <p>and many other beauty centers, they all target ladies and perhaps some guys who wants to look good, but look closely, they target different parts and needs of their clients which is why none collaspe but only to keep on increasing in retail outlets.</p>
              <p>The same goes to mlm or any other business.</p>
              <p>I will be using real-life examples as reference to reply back because from the post replies to date is that people still have very much negative impression about mlm, so i will just post similar examples, if anybody can't get the link between the examples, than kindly clarify, but please, don't keep on focus on mlm and link them to negative sales agents..</p>
              <p>Focus on business, like I did, and that's why even Donald Trump and Robert Kiyosaki also know about it and perhaps lots more information than me, but they rather not reveal much about it for business and personal reseasons.</p>
              <p>If you or anyone focus on negative stuffs, you will end up always negative, so why not try to think positive and everything will turn out positive like what I did.</p>
              <p>It's all about Law Of Attraction.</p>
              <p><strong>Deino:</strong> if you're wondering what a new mlm agent learn, than look at me, what am i doing here with my knowledge, how much did I learn VS the other mlm agents. I focus on learning but they (majority) focus on profits thus the huge gap in differences.</p>
              <p>It's not about how much you can learn, but rather DO ANYONE even want to learn about those informative knowledge and skills in the first place?</p>
              <p>I learn all these because skills and knowledge are more important than money or profits which is why I'm still surviving and kicking after 5years despite little to no money earn, but I've gain quality knowledge not taught in schools which many paid school fees, time and effort to learn but fail to understand it.</p>
              <p>Just ask more questions: I'll share if it's not under my classified section of business secrets.  (",)</p>

              <p>For instance:</p>
              <p>Marie France Body Line</p>
              <p>Slim Fit</p>
              <p>Bottom Slim</p>
              <p>New York (Facial)</p>
              <p>and many other beauty centers, they all target ladies and
                      perhaps some guys who wants to look good, but look closely, they
                      target different parts and needs of their clients which is why none
                      collaspe but only to keep on increasing in retail outlets.</p>
              <p>The same goes to mlm or any other business.</p>
              <p>I will be using real-life examples as reference to reply back
                      because from the post replies to date is that people still have
                      very much negative impression about mlm, so i will just post
                      similar examples, if anybody can't get the link between the
                      examples, than kindly clarify, but please, don't keep on focus on
                      mlm and link them to negative sales agents..</p>
              <p>Focus on business, like I did, and that's why even Donald Trump
                      and Robert Kiyosaki also know about it and perhaps lots more
                      information than me, but they rather not reveal much about it for
                      business and personal reseasons.</p>
              <p>If you or anyone focus on negative stuffs, you will end up
                      always negative, so why not try to think positive and everything
                      will turn out positive like what I did.</p>
              <p>It's all about Law Of Attraction.</p>
              <p><strong>Deino:</strong> if you're wondering what a new mlm agent
                      learn, than look at me, what am i doing here with my knowledge, how
                      much did I learn VS the other mlm agents. I focus on learning but
                      they (majority) focus on profits thus the huge gap in
                      differences.</p>
              <p>It's not about how much you can learn, but rather DO ANYONE even
                      want to learn about those informative knowledge and skills in the
                      first place?</p>
              <p>I learn all these because skills and knowledge are more
                      important than money or profits which is why I'm still surviving
                      and kicking after 5years despite little to no money earn, but I've
                      gain quality knowledge not taught in schools which many paid school
                      fees, time and effort to learn but fail to understand it.</p>
              <p>Just ask more questions: I'll share if it's not under my
                      classified section of business secrets.  (",)</p>

              <p>i agree that each company has their own market</p>
              <p>but to me the negativity of mlm comes as a whole...their main products eg. magnetic therapy products...these stuff are based on nothing more than lies...</p>
              <p>i can bet you that if magnetic therapy isn't psudeoscience, larger and more recognised companies could've dominated such industries thus bringing mlm companies based on that down...</p>
              <p>thats one of the many reasons why i view mlm as something negative...its becoz most of their products aren't really that great...its just that they use beautiful deceptive words to sell their products if they know their product sucks...</p>
              <p> i had a sort of talk with one of my friends who is an mlm agent about the product..</p>
              <p>and told em that if the product was really that great, it could've been more recognised..all that he has to tell me was that the product was expensive and if the company were to advertise their product bla bla bla they'd have to increase the price of the product...wot i think is that thats bullshit...coz if a product is good and demand is high, mass production would definitely make it possible to end up with an affordable product...</p>

              <p>Since this is my thread, I will end off nicely with your post
              despite your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">childish, spoilt brat behavior in the
              forum</span></strong></span>.</p>
              <p><strong>Sarcasm</strong> will lead you nowhere in business and
              instead it tells your business partners you lack substance to
              expand businesses.</p>
              <p>To make matter worse, you claim to have a own company perhaps
              it's just a store but don't you know general business
              operations?</p>
              <p>There's this common term: Example if you're <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">selling a food as main business,</span></strong> do you <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">tell your competitors
              or strangers your winning food recipe</span></strong>?
              <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">No right</span></strong>. Use
              your common sense la.</p>
              <p>You don't pay me any money in return for my knowledge so I am
              not obliged to reply back something that's classified within any
              business. Unless you're telling a lie or something, I'm wondering
              how you do your business, unless you're the kind that use pour in
              more money to make money vs intelligent strategic money
              advertisment planning to increase any business profits.</p>
              <p>I'm sure you're the former instead of the latter which I learnt
              via paying school fees directly from mentors in private
              courses.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if it's me who have improved my enlish or you took
              a turn for the worse. Because my english is only a C5 for your
              information - to be be sarcastic but rather based on my experience
              handling negative clients/prospects over the few years whom I've
              met in mlm, it equipped me with more knowledge than anyone would
              learn from setting up their own business without any proper mentor
              as guidance to say what's right and wrong thus business always
              compete against one another without thinking of other
              alternatives.</p>
              <p>The way top management of any company also selectively reply
              back to queries, because like I've said lots of times over the
              years in sgforums mlm threads - The more you say and defend, the
              more clients think you lack knowledge, proper business handling
              skills isn't learn by just being a boss, but rather learning from
              other people's mistakes and making their error to your advantage
              like what I'm doing now isn't it?</p>
              <p>This skill will help you save thousands of dollars in future if
              you know how to correctly put in into application.</p>

              <p>Let's look at your post replies to date:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Previously you
              posted</strong></span> this question:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px;">property/insurence
              agents take money when being hired and get a basic pay as
              well</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now you
              posted</strong></span> this question</p>
              <p>yes certain insurance/property companies in singapore do not
              provide a basic salary. BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO DO PROVIDE A BASIC
              SALARY. <br> can you tell me any mlms where they give their sales people a basic
              salary?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My response
              previously</strong></span></p>
              <p>The only sales employment which I know got basic is Car Sales
              Agent with a monthly basic of $500 sufficient for their own
              transportation only.</p>
              <p>Have I not answered your questions or was it you who fail to
              read between the lines?</p>
              <p><em><strong>Observation 1</strong></em>: You read only the text
              which I highlighted only</p>
              <p>The answer is obvious.</p>
              <p><em><strong>O</strong></em><em><strong>bservation
              2</strong></em>: is that you keep changing your statement/question.
              When you're losing your stance already you quickly jump to the
              other ship, hoping the compeitor never notice.</p>
              <p>If you're doing a business, I can only say you will end up
              betraying your partners whom you worked with in face of
              difficulties.</p>
              <p>This trick is so commonly used by MLM/Insurance/Financial Agents
              that I know the tricks by simply looking and reading.. I'm not
              bragging here but these are real skills which I've learnt to
              equipped myself despite my lost of SGD$5000+ in it but it's a
              lesson well learn.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Solution</span></strong></p>
              <p>Instead of cutting each other's throat here, why don't you take
              your time to learn more, get a mentor or perhaps we can discuss and
              clear doubts in another thread but on condition you behave yourself
              to position yourself as a genuine business owner instead of a
              spoilt brat demanding for milk when you're all grown up to even
              feed milk to babies.</p>
              <p>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">reason you lost to me</span> not once, not twice, not thrice as of yesterday but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">FOUR
              TIMES</span></span> is because of your lack of business experiences
              in handling people and of course other factors which you failed to
              observed. Yes you may be rich enough to start your own business,
              but without the BASICs, all you are is just an empty vessel which
              makes the most noise.</p>
              <p>I've given more than enough of response to your reply.
              <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Kindly let me focus on others
              to solve their problems instead okay? </strong></span></p>
              <p>You need to be friendly and willing to share good things with
              others in business for many reasons, but those are again business
              strategies which I can't reveal without any money benefits in
              return.</p>

              <p>If you have any complaints / doubts be it in MLM or traditional
              business, I'll try my best to help by answering questions provided

              <p>ok u said that all do not have basic pay right? and in my knowledge to two particular insurance companies, they do provide basic pay, so i compromised.</p>
              <p>Instead of answering the question, you misled every one with your nonsence and bashing then stopped answering the question justifying your self with your own reasons making you feel good.</p>
              <p>such as this. <span style="line-height: 16px; color: #333333; font-size: 14px;">There's this common term: Example if you're <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">selling a food as main business,</span></strong> do you<strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">tell your competitors or strangers your winning food recipe</span></strong>? <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">No right</span></strong>.

              <p>No doubt magnetic therapy has always being within the debating hot topics when it comes to products, and one of the 3 mlm companies which i've being to previously even mentioning about a public hosptial using it with photos.. LOL</p>
              <p>but over time as I continue to watch and get updates, I can and will agree to your thinking to a certain level perhaps 50/50.</p>
              <p>With this in view:</p>
              <p>Let's look at the issues from different point of views.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">1) Advertiser</span></strong></p>
              <p>To cut cost, getting mlm agents and company to sell it is the most low-cost way that the current market know of, BUT i've learn a even lower cost marketing strategy plus it's also word of mouth but without any MLM practices..will keep it as my business secret for now until I've made some decent revenue to proof the efficiency of it first before I decide to share with anyone.</p>
              <p>when a new product comes into a market, one of the possible reason why they choose mlm is primary because it's low cost. Backend reason which I presume only might because the advertiser/supplier of the new innovative product has already spent a huge chunk of capital to invest in the R&amp;D segment to come up with the finished product than with low cash flow, they have little marketing/advertising choices left ma.</p>

              <p>They get to be the contracted SOLE Agent representing the advertiser/supllier of the product, so once the advertiser signs it, it's as good as losing control rights over the product at least until the amount of years stated in the contract.</p>
              <p>This benefits the company but not to the advertiser/product supplier if he/she aren't well informed in making an informed and wise decision to choose which mlm company to help market their products.</p>

              <p>when given the right to sell a new product, they should be happy, but due to heavy competition among the same company agents, it's not recommended for a complete newbie to enter into the ring of competition.</p>
              <p>so depending on how the agent is taught and decisions made, be it the success or failure of the mlm agent in the journey of mlm, it all boils down to the decision he/she makes when she decides to help the company market the product using whatever methods they are taught if they are just mere sellers and not product consumers.</p>
              <p>it's true that many are taught to be great sellers and not as a consumer point because they themselves are hard up for cash thus that's the main reason why people <strong>OVERSELL/OVERPROMISE</strong> the advantages of the products because they themselves the agents aren't using it.

              <p>from this point as a client, <strong>COST</strong> is the most important factor, and for us to get good products at a much lower cost would mean that the product that you want to buy already has a <strong>HUGE DEMAND</strong> without any advertising locally in new country (market) this way they can afford to <strong>MASS PRODUCE</strong>.</p>
              <p>Since it's about magnetic therapy, the concept nonetheless is still new so <strong>demand</strong> is still considered <strong>LOW</strong>, thus they can't MASS PRODUCE it just to bring cost low.

              <p>No doubt magnetic therapy has always being within the debating
                  hot topics when it comes to products, and one of the 3 mlm
                  companies which i've being to previously even mentioning about a
                  public hosptial using it with photos.. LOL</p>
              <p>but over time as I continue to watch and get updates, I can and
                  will agree to your thinking to a certain level perhaps 50/50.</p>
              <p>With this in view:</p>
              <p>Let's look at the issues from different point of views.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">1)
                  Advertiser</span></strong></p>
              <p>To cut cost, getting mlm agents and company to sell it is the
                  most low-cost way that the current market know of, BUT i've learn a
                  even lower cost marketing strategy plus it's also word of mouth but
                  without any MLM practices..will keep it as my business secret for
                  now until I've made some decent revenue to proof the efficiency of
                  it first before I decide to share with anyone.</p>
              <p>when a new product comes into a market, one of the possible
                  reason why they choose mlm is primary because it's low cost.
                  Backend reason which I presume only might because the
                  advertiser/supplier of the new innovative product has already spent
                  a huge chunk of capital to invest in the R&amp;D segment to come up
                  with the finished product than with low cash flow, they have little
                  marketing/advertising choices left ma.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) MLM
                  Company</span></strong></p>
              <p>They get to be the contracted SOLE Agent representing the
                  advertiser/supllier of the product, so once the advertiser signs
                  it, it's as good as losing control rights over the product at least
                  until the amount of years stated in the contract.</p>
              <p>This benefits the company but not to the advertiser/product
                  supplier if he/she aren't well informed in making an informed and
                  wise decision to choose which mlm company to help market their
                  products.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">3) MLM
                  Agents/Distributors</span></strong></p>
              <p>when given the right to sell a new product, they should be
                  happy, but due to heavy competition among the same company agents,
                  it's not recommended for a complete newbie to enter into the ring
                  of competition.</p>
              <p>so depending on how the agent is taught and decisions made, be
                  it the success or failure of the mlm agent in the journey of mlm,
                  it all boils down to the decision he/she makes when she decides to
                  help the company market the product using whatever methods they are
                  taught if they are just mere sellers and not product consumers.</p>
              <p>it's true that many are taught to be great sellers and not as a
                  consumer point because they themselves are hard up for cash thus
                  that's the main reason why people
                  <strong>OVERSELL/OVERPROMISE</strong> the advantages of the
                  products because they themselves the agents aren't using it. I
                  myself was once such an agent but only for a short period of 1-2
                  weeks before I see the super negative impact on my reputation thus
                  causing me to re-think and reposition myself to what I am
                  today.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) Customer point of
                  view</span></strong></p>
              <p>from this point as a client, <strong>COST</strong> is the most
                  important factor, and for us to get good products at a much lower
                  cost would mean that the product that you want to buy already has a
                  <strong>HUGE DEMAND</strong> without any advertising locally in new
                  country (market) this way they can afford to <strong>MASS
                  PRODUCE</strong>.</p>
              <p>Since it's about magnetic therapy, the concept nonetheless is
                  still new so <strong>demand</strong> is still considered
                  <strong>LOW</strong>, thus they can't MASS PRODUCE it just to bring
                  cost low. Just think of this from another view, if they have
                  <strong>no ready buyers</strong> to buy the Mass Produced Products,
                  they end up paying more on products space rental, storage, which
                  will gradually increase over time thus it makes no buisness sense
                  to mass produce without a ready market with results in <strong>huge
                  losses</strong> instead</p>

                  balanced response which you're satisfied with. :)</p>

              <p>do you mean the most show off car achiever video in youtube before the company was declared a money laundering company last year perhaps?</p>
              <p>if that's what you're refering to, i've already watched it, although it's crappy, but nonetheless there's a saying which goes around like this:</p>
              <p>ä¸�ç®¡æ˜¯é»‘çŒ«è¿˜æ˜¯ç™½çŒ«ï¼Œå�ªè¦�æ˜¯èƒ½æ�‰åˆ°è€�é¼ çš„çŒ«å°±æ˜¯å¥½çŒ«ã€‚</p>
              <p>don't you guys agree?</p>
              <p>since you both only focus on the end result without processing the process thus I believe the above quote should be more relevant to you both and also to most of the people who only want results but ignore the process be it cheat, steal or lie etc.</p>

              <p>Since you mention about being the boss.</p>
              <p>Let's look at the 7Eleven Franchise as an below:</p>
              <p><a title="7Eleven Franchise" href="http://www.7-eleven.com.sg/franchise">7Eleven</a></p>
              <p>Kindly go to the link above to read up the terms and conditions.</p>
              <p>MLM = Business = Franchise Business.</p>
              <p>Whatever applies to those as per above also applies similarly but with more grey areas in the MLM model.</p>
              <p>When
              you start a new network, you're already doing your own franchise, but
              difference is, MLM don't train you even before you pay for the products
              etc as compared to 7Eleven Franchise.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Grey Areas:</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Less Control, More responsibility, No Self Branding for your MLM Franchise.</p>
              <p>You cannot duplicate the exact system 100% downwards because people's personalities varies.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Differences:</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Benefits of MLM Franchise     :   Benefits of 7Eleven Franchise</p>
              <p>Poor Man Business Franchise. : Rich Man Proven &amp; Recognized Business Franchise</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Limitations of Franchise Business Across ALL Businesses:</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Inability
              to control another fellow competitor/franchise owner from
              opening/running a identical franchise business directly in front of
              your business just a few steps away</p>
              <p>Or in layman terms: You
              can't have control the rights to be given exclusive rights to customers
              living or working in a certain radius within your own franchise
              business.</p>
              <p>Look at the EXPO 7Eleven - 2 franchise business just less than 1 min of walking distances.</p>
              <p>Other
              benefits, limitations and grey areas will be classified as my own
              business secrets until further revision of my own will. (Safe-gurading
              my own knowledge and experitises because MLM has only got one
              successful 100% duplicable system = copy-cats and completely ignore the
              copyright laws of Singapore [interllectual property] thus what I know,
              I reveal selectively only - sorry for any inconvenienced caused)</p>
              <p>As
              for the Boss Earnings - It's common sense the Boss of the Franchise
              earns the most - Just look at it this way, if you're using other
              people's success secrets, branding, reputation, creditability etc,
              there's a price to pay which comes in royalities to the MASTER
              FRANCHISER OWNER to the brand.</p>
              <p>What is different is that perhaps the <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Master Franchise Owner</span></strong> perhaps only get an estimated <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">10-20% royalities</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> from every franchise on a monthly basis</span></strong> while the <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Franchise Owner/Buyer</span></strong> who bought the franchise from the Master Seller gets <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>80-90% of the gross profits.</strong></span></p>
              <p>When
              you're looking at only 1 retail outlet of the Franchise, of course the
              Owner of the Outlet Franchise earns more. But if you look at the whole
              Singapore, the Master Franchise Owner that sells the franchise business
              earns even more, it's just like the masses/volume, when you have more
              people under your network/business, you earn more.</p>
              <p>When you
              control more franchise business carrying your exclusive rights, you
              will earn even more. Which is why the top always earn the most but at
              different angles.</p>
              <p>I hope I've explained it clearly.</p>
              <p><strong>Elementalangel &gt;&gt;</strong> You should learn from Deino who post questions with precision that
              demostrates clear understanding by giving examples by quoting
              references <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>"the recruit or
                                      the owner of the company"</em></span>,
              . You on the other hand just throw out a topic which only You
              understand and not considering other's understanding level. That is a
              weakness of every solo business owner fyi: thus employees only complain
              and complain but not let their bosses know. Learn more about it from
              Top-Down/Bottom-Up approach when it comes to solving problems. (I learn
              this from RP yr 1 Basics)</p>
              <p><strong>I don't need you (Elementalangel) to reply</strong>, but this is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">just
              a friendly advice  to let you see the difference to why both you and
              him ask the same question but I only answer to his and not yours</span></span>.
              You should remove your own barrier to learning. Everybody is learning
              every single moment, like how I am currently learning to understand
              common concerns from those people who don't understand MLM from you
              guys by answering questions. It's a WIN-WIN situation.</p>

              <p>now that I've cleared the questions from the floor, if you have any doubts about mlm from the offensive display of language, why not share your negative experience here instead.</p>
              <p>Rather than avoiding MLM why not face it.</p>
              <p>The more you avoid, the more it will surface around you based on the increasing number of MLMs.</p>
              <p><strong>Like it or hate it, MLM is here to stay</strong>, so why not understand it else risk being scam by those negative sales distributors when I'm here to offer a helping hand to ease the misunderstanding or miscommunication.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you notice, during hard times, more people fall prey to even more fraud/get-quick-rich/cheating schemes especially in crisis period.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Instead of being ignorant, why not learn about it and prevent the same scam from happening to you or your friends and perhaps even your love ones.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Nobody wants to part with their valueable assets (CASH) so I'm here to help, so do feel free to ask, but do use proper english language okay?</p>
