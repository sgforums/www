There is a huge difference between ripened opportunity and greedy opportunist.

              <p>Well, it's all part and parcel of life..Return On Investment. It's nothing but the truth..</p>
              <p>Quote a few real life examples:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Asian parents all expect their children to grow up and support their parents with part of the salary.</li>
              <li>Children requiring financial assistance from parents will than act fillial to achieve their objective of lie, cheat retirement pension from their parents<br></li>
              <li>Majority of ladies key criteria in selecting idea guys for marriage candiate by looking at their financial ability (making money with stable income)</li>
              <li>Businesses sell with intention of profit</li>
              <li>Loan sharks offer loans for profit</li>
              <li>Govt legally make $ from every single tax payer who earns more than $26k per year</li>
              <li>Education isn't free, you still need to pay with no guarantee of ready job and positive return on investment and the years spend on studying</li>
              <li>Property developers, sellers all market and sell property for a profit which govt again tax.</li>
              <li>Everybody looks for a job in return for money/salary/commission &gt;&gt;would you seriously work for free if you can't even support yourself with a shelter over your head and 3 basic meals a day?</li>
              <li>Even non-tax payers are paying for tax in-directly with tax cost plus GST included in our products, food, services etc which business owners pass the fees to us end users..<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>Every thing cost money and Return On Investment is the only possible way to grow money. If you resist the very idea of this, you deserve to be poor all your life.</p>
              <p>Lets just get real, stop living in denial. There's no escape. It is your own negative thinking which you need to get rid of, stop running away from facts.</p>
              <p>Money is deep rooted in every thing in our society locally and globally..face it..or go be a monk if you don't want to live in a materialistic society</p>

              <p>Typical example of a poor if not un-trained sales agent.</p>
              <p>Leeching onto others people's thread, providing unrelated (junk) materials to increase their own publicity at other people's expense instead of creating their own thread.</p>
              <p>Even side-tracking from the topic of the thread. Goes to how desperate this person is whoever and whatever he is attempting to promote/sell/advertise.</p>
              <p>Showing clear signs and indication of him not knowing who and where his customers are. Failing the simplest basic requirement as a sales person for not knowing who are the business's targeted customers.</p>
              <p>That's what happens in scams, when they attempt to blindly sell products/service/investment to gullible individuals who knows nothing.</p>

              <p>To Answer Your Question: It is not okay.</p>
              <p>Start your own thread if you want to share, this way you get to learn if your information is welcomed by the readers and forums users in here.</p>
              <p>Riding on other people's thread will give you poor results, which is not in your best interest. Does that answers your question?</p>
              <p>Anyway, you posted in the wrong thread as usual. Newbies always tend to go for the highest viewership thread for maximal publicity, but never realize it is a double edge sword, what can help you can also kill you. </p>
              <p>Maximal publicity will goes to any post replies, so if its good, you get results, but if its bad, your chances of success drops, percentage of failure increase double-fold, so be careful of what you post in this thread.</p>
              <p>If you want to ask a question, do so in my next thread, <a href="/forums/14/topics/387291">Ask Your MLM Questions Here</a> not in this thread that talks only about complaints.</p>
              <p>I only accept facts, relevant contents about the topic and nothing less.</p>

              <p>2011 is coming to an end in around 50hours by now.</p>

              <p>Since this thread is pretty quiet, and I notice that even Insurance &amp; Financial Sales Agents are getting more desperate for sales in the similar Intense competitive sales line.</p>
              <p>With that I'll open this thread to accept complaints against any sales agents.</p>
              <p>If there's anybody who have similar experiences with desperate sales agents from regardless of big or small companies, just post them all here.</p>
              <p>We'll address the issues one by one and come up with counter-measures to return the favor back to the irresponsible sales agents letting them have a taste of their own ill-trained measures.</p>

              <p>Recently my ex-upline who introduced me into the 1st company contacted me again..and it seems like he is still the same like before..didn't learn from his mistakes..and jump right in without even testing water..</p>
              <p>Which reminds me of the hard-selling tactics..pushy..begging strategies just because of being friends, it's harder to reject out of being polite..</p>
              <p>It's being a few years since this thread was created..i certainly hope this thread has served its purpose of being a useful Myth Buster type of thread for FAQs clarification on why there are many ill-trained distributors..</p>
              <p>However time changes, tatics/methods also change..if you got any new complaints, on new technology being employed/used for recruitment..just post them* here for sharing purpose, so all of the readers here can learn and not repeat the same mistakes again.</p>
              <p>If 1 person's mistake can benefit many, why not? So do feel free to voice out your complaints/frustrations if you want to be heard.</p>
