              <p>the fallen, just a question, can MLM and Traditional Biz done
              together??and oh ya, about the complains, jz curious about the
              part in ur first post which mention showing off wealth to
              long-lost friends very common??  thanks..</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>it traditional biz and mlm can be implemented together, but majority of the business owners are just skeptical towards the idea if not wary against it for the mlm model will ruin the shopping appetite of customers if done the wrong way.</p>
              <p>as for showing off wealth to long-lost friends..it depends..but usually, this happens most of the time whereby in most companies, they need to show off their sudden wealth to give others the false impression that it is extremely easy to make money in a new company or when it is having promotion..thus showing off is one common tactic that lots of companies will use..especially for newbies who have little to zero tricks and tactics up their sheelves..</p>

              <p>other than being skeptical of mlm, is there any other lesson which you may have learn from this experience?</p>
              <p>if you only learn to be skeptical, re-look at your sitaution again, i'm sure you will learn more lessons to a single experience of yours..so far i can sum up 6 points to take away as lesson learnt and it's not inclusive of your negative experience..</p>

              <p>Hi! I am new to all these. I am currently considering about
              joining as LFI business partner something like that. I want to know
              if this company is worthwhile to join, if this company is
              trustworthy as in something like if it is a scam (no offense).</p>
              <p>What I heard from them, so far, is that I have to pay $2000 or
              $856 for a package before I can really start. This package includes
              products that I can use it personally or market it out, it also
              includes some other benefits something like the amount of
              commisions I get to receive from the people under me in the
              network.</p>
              <p>Since I am still schooling, I'd be working as a part-time kind.
              I was told that I'd also need to recruit more people under me,
              recommend people to purchase any products from LFI.</p>
              <p>I hope someone could guide me a through the decision making.</p>
              <p>Thanks =)</p>

              <p>Well for most mlm companies, there is this "Memebership Fee" which is included in the package together with the products.</p>
              <p>Instead of just paying (forced sales) for the products, only agree to pay the membership fee which is around $20-$80 this kind of range which varies accordingly to different companies..some companies have yearly membership renewal fee as well.</p>
              <p>so if that person who ever told/sold you the product cum membership price, that person and their uplines are all in conspiracy to squeeze money out from any newbies in this industry..</p>
              <p>you might want to reconsider your options about joining any company/distributors that is eager to captialize on prospect's lack of knowledge in attempt to make "quick money".</p>
              <p>Fyi Only: By signing up with only membership status, no products, you are only allowed to sell products and not recruitment.</p>
              <p>That's it, hope it answers your question.</p>

              <p>Thanks alot. I still have a uncleared mystery.</p>
              <p>The membership fee includes products that are within that amount of money I pay (as stated earlier). I am also able to recruit people to put under my network, which means I'm the people that I recruit's upline. Do you think it is considered safe to take on? (As in I'd not be scammed if I join)</p>
              <p>As I am new, I am afraid that I would fall into the trap of a scam on my first venture out to business (not those small temporary jobs like flyer-distribution), but I do not want to miss this chance if it is one as it is difficult to find one at my level as I am still schooling.</p>
              <p>Thanks:)</p>

              <p>Most companies DO ALLOW purely membership signup registrations, But only less than 0.01% of the distributors will be willing to share with you on this fact as they (the person who introduce you in and their uplines) do not make a single penny from it.</p>
              <p>Just paying for the minimal will do and it is sufficient to secure your placement, and have any late new members to be place below you. (If they hold true to their promise) as this is one tatic which most distributors use to trick newbies into believing that they will help them but in fact, they don't. Don't be fooled by them.</p>
              <p>Gentle reminder: While you can reserve the spot by buying a position in the rank, it doesn't mean anything even if your friend/upline throw new members below you..as they will learn from their upline/sponsor/the person who bring them in and not you.</p>
              <p>The only benefit you have as a early bird is that if you work hard and have results, you can leverage on the group sales volume for easier promotion. That is the ONE AND ONLY BENEFIT as a early bird.</p>
              <p>Another thing is make sure your membership is a lifetime one, not the type which requires renewal else don't bother signing up.</p>

              <p>The only way to succeed in MLM is to do the right things at the start. What is MLM? Multi-level marketing. Marketing=selling. You must sell not buy. You are there to make money, not throwing in your money.</p>
              <p>The  distribution or commission system is good but only the brain shelter evil thoughts. All that I can say, No companies had yet to prove that they are sharing the right stuff about MLM.
