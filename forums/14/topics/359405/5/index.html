              <p>pardon me for my past misunderstandings about property agents/ insurance agents.</p>
              <p>As for property agents, there are two types.</p>
              <p>The ones who join companies and those who do it by their own. <br>Those who join companies join usually because they do not have a licence and thus have to make use of the companies licence in order to do their transactions, otherwise it would be that they are paid a huge sum of money by the company to lead their team.</p>
              <p>Those who work themselves (not for another property agent company) are those who already have a licence and do not want any companies to take a cut of their comission, thus forsaking their low basic pay(if any)</p>
              <p>The first example do not call themselves bosses. The latter do not usually call themselves bosses/entrepreneurs but instead used the humble name of a property agent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for insurance agents, there are two types as well.</p>
              <p>Those who get a very high basic pay but low comission(those working in large insurance firms/banks) or those that get a low basic pay but obsessively huge ammount of commisions( those working in smaller insurance companies or are usually part time workers)</p>
              <p>Neither do they call themselves bosses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway the definition of an entrepreneur is <span style="font-family: 'times new roman'; line-height: normal; ">someone who organizes a business venture and assumes the risk for it.</span></p>
              <p>There are many similarities and differences between them. However if we look at it this way, many mlms claim to be similar to such firms and yet insurance/property firms are trying their best to distance themselves from mlm. Its quite obvious which is a better choice.</p>

              <p>Okay, perhaps you could better explain it by offering real-life examples which is the best.</p>
              <p>of course since it involves real-life examples, just replace the brand to something similar or highlight any newsarticle so we could know it without attracting skeptics against certain company to flame the threads bringing unwanted posts.</p>
              <p>For example since you mention there's insurance/property agents who recieve basic pay, perhaps you can share the knowledge/info with me, so those jobless ppl will know where to get a job when they need it. (just the closest color or quote which the company might have used in the past so we can have some clues to which you're refering to)</p>
              <p>With regards to who's the black sheep - i can only comment that there are still people in direct sales who practise underhand methods to scam ppl despite working in banks etc..Just look at the previous few months of Straits Time, other than Madoff, there are a couple more US ppl who are caught for doing ponzi schemes and have since being bought to justice thanks to the tight auditing after the arrest and sentencing of Maddoff.</p>
              <p>I still remember reading an article which says that there is at least 1 new Ponzi Scheme popping up in the US market every week lor.</p>
              <p>However it's totally true that once joining a mlm company, that agent/distributor is just considered a franchisee. But they can at anytime buy their way to become a boss by form on investing in a business - example open a Chicken Rice stall etc.</p>
