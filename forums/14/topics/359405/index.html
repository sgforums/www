              <p>Hey guys, do you have any <strong>complaints</strong> which regards to <strong>any tatics or underhand methods used by any mlm companies' distributors in particular which displease you</strong>?</p>
              <p>If there is kindly write it in here.</p>
              <p>Below are some of the tricks which they have used before which I personally experienced.</p>
              <p>1) Using a lunch/dinner meeting to bring/lie prospect into going to the company</p>
              <p>2) Fake a normal job application and get prospect to come over company for job interview</p>
              <p>3) Using sexy lady approach to attract guys into the company</p>
              <p>4) Tele-marketing: Suprise call to strangers saying they have being head-hunted for a job interview</p>
              <p>5) Road-survey asking for contacts along the way using ladies in office attire (usual tatic)</p>
              <p>6) Suddenly catching up over long-lost friends and showing a sudden increase of wealth (showing off to friends) - trying to make them curious etc</p>
              <p>7) Printing brochure/flyer and distributing it along the streets and notice board</p>
              <p>8) Friend intro a "lobang" to friend which end up in a long brain-washing session</p>
              <p>9) Prospect who's being brain-washed for more than 3hrs wanting to get out of the company end up signing/buying a product/contract (kana con)</p>
              <p>10) Close Door - Let Dogs out to bark at prospects - Applies only to weak minded, clueless prospects that can be manipulated by sales distributors - Example: Despite being trapped inside company for hours, prospect didn't sign anything, the friend will always try to introduce new uplines who's even got stronger pay-cheques to try win over the prospect into signing</p>
              <p>11) Get prospect to go for a seminar, and ask them to sign on a list of paper claiming it's a attendance sheet but only to call up after a week saying they have sign an agreement to the conditions in another separate sheet of document which wasn't declared/made known to you during the whole process.</p>
              <p><strong>Objective of this thread :</strong> It's not meant as a complaint session for me to help out but rather letting those newbies know what are the tricks/bullying methods that mlm companies use to force and pressure people into signing on the dotted line to walk the path of "No-Return" - only applies to naive people.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Try to refrain from posting the mlm company's name</span></strong> else this will turn into a individual company bombing discussion rather than a general discussion about the tatics/underhand methods used by various sales distributors.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>You experience will be helpful in helping those newbies who might be reading up more information about MLM in particular.</em></span></span></p>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I'm not trying to fan any negative actions against any mlm company but rather trying to share what I know and help in some healthy discussion.</p>
              <p>If you doubt me, simply go to search older threads and see the depth of my mlm knowledge plus see how I shoot down (penalized) those skeptical mlm people who go around gossiping try to act like a smart alex (when they didn't even went through mlm training) before attempting to even try  æ·»æ²¹åŠ é†‹/ flame negative emotions about any other mlm company .</p>
              <p>My Own Stand: Although I support MLM, but I am super against/ANTI - MLM that support underhand tactics thus I decided to write this list to deter any more nonsense agents who think they can keep using the same old tricks to trick people.</p>
              <p>Meet your DOOM!!</p>

              <p>MLM is flawed system used by people who wants to cheat others of their money...</p>
              <p>Anyone can say about there being black sheeps or white sheeps but to me it is a tool that is inevitably used by men for the sole objective of making money...</p>
              <p>MLM is like a gun...it can be put to good use but either ways good or bad, it still inflicts damage..</p>
              <p>One company i know is their ppl boast about being successful...yea and successful being hanging around a coffee shop...call that successful...</p>
              <p>The company i know insulted my carrer dreams..Making it look as if we are starting our own business..Be your own boss...WOW...</p>
              <p>Shitness la business...</p>
              <p>A true businessman have full control of their product and business..A true businessman doesn't earn 5% commissions...they earn profits...</p>
              <p> Fresh MLM agents are brainwashed with the main idea of being successful..those who know how to think are well saved..those who dunno how to think properly will lose friends</p>

              <p>MLM is a strategy used currently by majority of the middle income people to generate more income from those innocent, naive and clueless people.</p>
              <p>The reason why not many people in corporate businesses are willing to integrate mlm into the business are because they can still generate lots of revenue without mlm itself. Nor do many people know exactly how to untilize thebenefits of mlm to the maximal potential as of yet from what I've exposed to to-date.</p>
              <p>It's very common that companies boast about their success else how can they possibly attract more investors who just wants to make money work for them instead of them working for money right?</p>
              <p>When people you feel insulted, don't worry, just take it into your stride, and move on, just don't let them know where have they done wrong and leave them to rot in the depths of hell and suffer a heavy consequences of declining creditability &amp; reputation. Just wait for time to pass and stay in contact to see their despair.</p>
              <p>The thing is true about doing business, but knowing and doing what you like in your own business is the only way whereby it can succeed. So unless you find your own way of marketing your worth, else you are just as good as nothing - zero because there's no point in keeping your business secrets without generating any revenue from it.</p>
              <p>The point you said about 5% commissions VS profits are true but however when it comes to businesses, you need to take into consideration of over-heads (expenses) the running costs, advertising cost incurred etc, moreover do you mean gross profit, net profit, or after re-consilation with bank statements on other bank charges and cheques etc? When it comes to business, the idea is to truly understand the industry inside out, knowing your commpetitive advantage before going in for the kill - stripping off your business competitors ONE BY ONE!!</p>
              <p>BUSINESS IS WAR!! ROAR!! - LOL</p>
              <p>Fresh MLM agents just need proper guidance but unfortunatly, sad to say: All of the companies are already twisted and Money Focus already. It's even happening in the very company I'm still inside. With that I'll just find my own ways to market myself other than mlm.</p>
              <p>I know what platform I'm gonna market myself, the idea is, for those keen in mlm or at least doing business, do you have any clue as to what to do, whom to look for as genuine business partners, how to determine if they would not sell you out nor betray you etc. Not even to mention if your business partners use your copyrighted materials to sell for their own selfish benefits without your approval. All those above actions will cause a lot of negative impacts but how much do you guys really know about it?</p>
              <p>None of your MLM uplines shed even a single info about all these right - that's because their knowledge is only so sallow - sorry if I may offend anybody in my thread reply, but all these above serve a purpose - to allow many people to make and informed decisions about what you can learn from mlm if you follow the right person.</p>
              <p>It's not about the pay-cheque that they show you, but rather how much can you learn and benefit. And how do you locate such people to learn from.</p>

              <p>MLM is a strategy used currently by majority of the middle
              income people to generate more income from those innocent, naive
              and clueless people.</p>
              <p>The reason why not many people in corporate businesses are
              willing to integrate mlm into the business are because they can
              still generate lots of revenue without mlm itself. Nor do many
              people know exactly how to untilize thebenefits of mlm to the
              maximal potential as of yet from what I've exposed to to-date.</p>
              <p>It's very common that companies boast about their success else
              how can they possibly attract more investors who just wants to make
              money work for them instead of them working for money right?</p>
              <p>When people you feel insulted, don't worry, just take it into
              your stride, and move on, just don't let them know where have they
              done wrong and leave them to rot in the depths of hell and suffer a
              heavy consequences of declining creditability &amp; reputation.
              Just wait for time to pass and stay in contact to see their
              despair.</p>
              <p>The thing is true about doing business, but knowing and doing
              what you like in your own business is the only way whereby it can
              succeed. So unless you find your own way of marketing your worth,
              else you are just as good as nothing - zero because there's no
              point in keeping your business secrets without generating any
              revenue from it.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">The point you said about 5% commissions VS profits are true but
              however when it comes to businesses, you need to take into
              consideration of over-heads (expenses) the running costs,
              advertising cost incurred etc, moreover do you mean gross profit,
              net profit, or after re-consilation with bank statements on other
              bank charges and cheques etc? When it comes to business, the idea
              is to truly understand the industry inside out, knowing your
              commpetitive advantage before going in for the kill - stripping off
              your business competitors ONE BY ONE!!</span></p>
              <p>BUSINESS IS WAR!! ROAR!! - LOL</p>
              <p>Fresh MLM agents just need proper guidance but unfortunatly, sad
              to say: All of the companies are already twisted and Money Focus
              already. It's even happening in the very company I'm still inside.
              With that I'll just find my own ways to market myself other than
              mlm.</p>
              <p>I know what platform I'm gonna market myself, the idea is, for
              those keen in mlm or at least doing business, do you have any clue
              as to what to do, whom to look for as genuine business partners,
              how to determine if they would not sell you out nor betray you etc.
              Not even to mention if your business partners use your copyrighted
              materials to sell for their own selfish benefits without your
              approval. All those above actions will cause a lot of negative
              impacts but how much do you guys really know about it?</p>
              <p>None of your MLM uplines shed even a single info about all these
              right - that's because their knowledge is only so sallow - sorry if
              I may offend anybody in my thread reply, but all these above serve
              a purpose - to allow many people to make and informed decisions
              about what you can learn from mlm if you follow the right
              person.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's not about the pay-cheque that they show you, but rather how
              much can you learn and benefit. And how do you locate such people
              to learn from.</span></p>

              <p>for those with more experience and ability to convince their clients, i'm sure they have no problems bringing them directly into the company to talk about the company and the products.</p>
              <p>as for meeting people around mrt, it's because the way most mlm companies work revolves around poor/just people with stable income only thus they must locate themselves around mrt stations to make the work of the newer distributors easier.</p>

              <p>I would agree with the 5% commission over your new downlines in mlm company.</p>
              <p>but if you want to earn a higher commission over your downlines be it in any mlm company/insurance/financial company/businesses, you need to have a larger based of downlines in your own network first right?</p>
              <p>so you can earn more overriding of commissions. Make sense?</p>
              <p>the company doesn't pay higher commissions to those newly promoted managers or new young leaders without deep network based of downlines.</p>
              <p>the more the upline earns, it will depend on how much they group sales thus higher commission.</p>
              <p>If you want a <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>real-life example</strong></span> - refer to Newspapers and Flyers of <strong>Insurance/Property </strong>Agents.</p>
              <p>Is it the new sales agents who are doing mass recruiting and advertising of their profits or are the Senior Sales Directors who are showing that they can earn more to recruit more agents to join them?</p>

              <p>let me ask you just 1 question:</p>
              <p>look around this sgforum for MLM threads except for this thread; do you see a lot of new mlm distributors complaining about them being cheated by the various mlm companies uplines?</p>
              <p>2nd Quesiton:</p>
              <p>The skeptism of MLM, was it build overnight, and a wide spread DIE DIE MUST AVOID TOPIC AMONG FRIENDS or was it due to lots of SIMILAR Extreme Hard-Core Negative experiences which are common in all discuccsion threads Built over a long period of time?</p>
              <p>I'm sure the answer is way too obvious and it's the same across all MLM companies.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">I would agree with the 5% commission over your new downlines in
              mlm company.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">but if you want to earn a higher commission over your downlines
              be it in any mlm company/insurance/financial company/businesses,
              you need to have a larger based of downlines in your own network
              first right?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">so you can earn more overriding of commissions. Make sense?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">the company doesn't pay higher commissions to those newly
              promoted managers or new young leaders without deep network based
              of downlines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">the more the upline earns, it will depend on how much they group
              sales thus higher commission.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">If you want a </span><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">real-life
              example</span></strong></span><span style="color: #00ff00;"> - refer to Newspapers and Flyers of </span><strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">Insurance/Property</span></strong><span style="color: #00ff00;"> Agents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">Is it the new sales agents who are doing mass recruiting and
              advertising of their profits or are the Senior Sales Directors who
              are showing that they can earn more to recruit more agents to join
              them?</span></p>
              <p>With regards to the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">RED
              PORTION:</span></strong></p>
              <p>let me ask you just 1 question:</p>
              <p>look around this sgforum for MLM threads except for this thread;
              do you see a lot of new mlm distributors complaining about them
              being cheated by the various mlm companies uplines?</p>
              <p>2nd Quesiton:</p>
              <p>The skeptism of MLM, was it build overnight, and a wide spread
              DIE DIE MUST AVOID TOPIC AMONG FRIENDS or was it due to lots of
              SIMILAR Extreme Hard-Core Negative experiences which are common in
              all discuccsion threads Built over a long period of time?</p>
              <p>I'm sure the answer is way too obvious and it's the same across
              all MLM companies.</p>
              </div>

              <p>for the green part. my question is not about the commissions made or what so ever in mlm companies.</p>

              <p>its about the competitivity in this industry. you have totally
                      not answered my question.<br> <strong>mlm vs traditional bussiness.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and like u suggested <span style="color: #333333;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #00ff00;">Insurance/Property</span></strong><span style="color: #00ff00;"> Agents</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">, they are the good examples
                      of companies who do not make you learn at you expense in terms of
                      money unlike mlms.</span></span></span></p>

              <p>perhaps you can rephrase your question again so I can better understand the question which you're trying to ask.</p>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer first:</strong> If the question is a high-level question which I might/will featured in my own paid product for sale in future, I will tell you directly it's my business secret as my own knowledge which I paid for SGD$5000 worth of business experiences in mlm to learn those knowledge after reflection + SGD$8000 worth of private business education courses in marketing etc. So until you or anybody else touch on sensitive business secrets of mine, i'll be happy to give out free information. :)</p>

              <p>Agree to a certain extent only, because there are still a small
              number of negative/despereate insurance/propety agents, just that
              because it's a regulated company and legalized + recognized
              already, thus there's less complaints which makes the
              headlines.</p>
              <p>Example of the latest negative practices of Insurance agents -
              AIG incident. :)</p>

              <p>ok what about the competition part? mlm vs traditional?<br><br>anyway insurance agents and property agents are an example of network marketting however with a license required and no expense in terms of money.</p>
