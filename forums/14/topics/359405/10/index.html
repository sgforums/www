              <p>if you want to avoid such fake job applications in future..just take note of a couple of points when refering to job posts from both online and offline.</p>
              <p>1. Company name</p>
              <p>2. Clear description of job scope, duties and responsbilities</p>
              <p>3. Work experience required if any (usually MLM companies don't have criteria)</p>
              <p>4. Academic qualification - No such filter..(avoid such work posts if they didn't specify)</p>
              <p>If you're culeless on why their job description doesn't match their job posted online..just post them..and you'll learn how they bend the use of words to their advantage..if ever they are even trained in that area..</p>

              <p>Clarification: Any business or any occupation (JOB) can make money. It's just a matter of the key point that is "How much is the DIFFERENCE between the choices you make". </p>
              <p>It's not that companies are trying to scam people, rather it's people who are misleading people for the 1 and only reason - to remain consistent in maintain MONTHLY COMMISSION, thus forcing themselves to consistently mislead people to join.</p>
              <p>Businesses (Company) is doing legitimate business govern by LAW, it's the independpent distributors (regardless of companies) that makes the KEY DIFFERENCE, having said that, it's now all subjected to how we select who to trust, what to look at and compare and how to determine if the "Opportunity" is suitable for each individual, as network marketing isn't suitable for everybody.</p>
              <p>However network marketing is suitable for everybody..hope I'm not confusing you readers.</p>
              <p>If anybody have questions mark, ask and seek clarification of your doubts (if any).</p>

              <p>Any time is always a good time steer clear of it. Subjected to what you want to learn from such business nature and how much can this experiences help you save in future, when it comes to selection of suitable, ethical and honest business partners in future when we grow older.</p>
              <p>My personal opinion: better early than to be late.</p>
              <p>Pay few thosand for tution fee on learning the mistakes to avoid, thus the same mistakes will not be repeated on a more costly decision later in our lives such as going-ahead with starting a business that cost a quater of a million..and average-people can only afford to fail 1 time..</p>
              <p>The only bullet, betting all the success on it..odds of wining without experience = 0.001% success rate after 10 years.</p>
              <p>That's how I look at the naive decisions I made in the past and how I benefited from my past experiences putting them into good use currently.</p>

              <p>now it's MY TURN to complain..haha..</p>
              <p>recently..i was again mislead by somebody to go down to listen to a 'talk' by one of the 'new' network marketing company claiming to be offering pioneer opportunities..</p>
              <p>had it not being for the person who invited me was a long-time friend, i would have left immediately after 2-3 mintues after the MC started talking since he did clarify it is a network marketing opportunity.</p>
              <p>Finally after all these years..this industry to me now is nearly Crystal Clear to me..in terms of how the industry functions in Singapore's context, the training standards of distributors as well as their ethical and moral compass are majority in the wrong direction.</p>
              <p>No wonder after so many years, there's still no progress in the quality of distributors..they are doing 80% duplication, of which all 80% are negative practices, thus leaving out the 20% positive practices.</p>

              <p>Hmm, after reading all the comments here, it seems that i am one of the luckier ones.</p>
              <p>I know of mlm scams as I once had a friend tried to recruit me into some investment company with a startup fee of $300, and he said i will earn $100 per person i recruit. I quickly said no, although 2 years later, i can see that he has achieved quite a high rank in his company.</p>
              <p>I got to truly know mlm when I distributed flyers for mooncakes when i had free time. My upline shared with me about mlm when i collected my pay for the flyers. For my company, joining fee is $25, with $12 discount on first purchase. The sales kit itself has catalogs, price lists, cds and stuff. He gave me samples of their shampoo, conditioners and other products which i liked quite alot. I also did about a week of research before signing up with my $25</p>
              <p>For my company, I can't recruit people till i made about $600 in sales, i guess it is to weed out those potential mass recruiters. My upline gave me quite alot of support, meeting me about once or twice per week, even driving to my house to pass me the products,he also hosts facial trial sessions for his downlines, no matter how far down,  at his own costs. </p>
              <p>To be honest, at their trainings or meetings, there are some obvious forced clapping by the experienced ones, which i don't realy like, plus showing of some scary pictures during product demo training (for health related product).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Close to 3 months in, I can see my income coming in, and i will continue in this business, spending 3 to 4hrs per week. I guess i had a good upline with 9 years of experience to show me the ropes, coupled with the fact that i like the products that I can start this business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TBH, i wouldnt join an mlm if i do not like their products. I would advise others who are looking into mlm to research first, try their products and look for the right person. Selling what you like would be alot easier and it will be more like "sharing the good things" instead of selling.</p>

                      $25, with $12 discount on first purchase. The sales kit itself has
                      catalogs, price lists, cds and stuff. He gave me samples of their
                      shampoo, conditioners and other products which i liked quite alot.
                      I also did about a week of research before signing up with my
                      $25</p>
              <p>For my company, I can't recruit people till i made about $600 in
                      sales, i guess it is to weed out those potential mass recruiters.
                      My upline gave me quite alot of support, meeting me about once or
                      twice per week, even driving to my house to pass me the products,he
                      also hosts facial trial sessions for his downlines, no matter how
                      far down,  at his own costs. </p>
              <p>To be honest, at their trainings or meetings, there are some
                      obvious forced clapping by the experienced ones, which i don't
                      realy like, plus showing of some scary pictures during product demo
                      training (for health related product).</p>
              <p>Close to 3 months in, I can see my income coming in, and i will
                      continue in this business, spending 3 to 4hrs per week. I guess i
                      had a good upline with 9 years of experience to show me the ropes,
                      coupled with the fact that i like the products that I can start
                      this business.</p>
              <p>TBH, i wouldnt join an mlm if i do not like their products. I
                      would advise others who are looking into mlm to research first, try
                      their products and look for the right person. Selling what you like
                      would be alot easier and it will be more like "sharing the good
                      things" instead of selling.</p>

              <p>Well, every company has their own pros and cons regardless of how good they are as no company/individual can achieve perfection.</p>
              <p>The route to succeed falls ultimately on oneself, having a good upline is a bonus, not an entitlement. </p>
              <p>A good upline is like a teacher "who can only lead you in the right way, but cannot help you gain mastery"</p>

              <p>Well, it's being many years since i was first introduced to network marketing..having gone through the process..I now understand why it's difficult to succeed in a network marketing company..</p>
              <p>like any other businesses, it is the timing and the opportunity presented to you that you must analyze if it's the right fit..</p>
              <p>From a Active to Inactive distributor..then to a Skeptic/Anti-MLM before returning to a Netural position before being a consumer..it's being a long process.</p>
              <p>To sum it up real quick..it's all business, and no business is as simple as it seems it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to the topic - the only complaint that I still have is that as companies evolve and grow, local and even global companies are myopic in one way or another..when it comes to <span style="color: #ff0000;">customer servicing and updating their once valuable clients on the direction and updates of the company.</span></p>
              <p>The ability to retain customers is what makes the difference between a successful business to that of a average company. </p>

              <p>hmm..</p>
              <p>recently i heard from my friends that the network marketing activities are picking up again..and lots of people are joining 1-2 companies in particular..</p>
              <p>With activities and participation comes complaints..</p>
              <p>But i didn't read any complaints lately..</p>
              <p>Has they improved the customer servicing or did they give full refund to make the forum a quiet place or are the new distributors simply unaware that the purchases can be refunded within a certain window period?</p>

              <p>Well, as for me..my views still reviews the same towards network marketing..it's a industry that's good for individuals who wants to learn the art of selling..</p>
              <p>My views still remains, to help get rid of black sheeps who overpromise and under-delivers (which misleads people into wasting their hard earned money).</p>
              <p>It's just 1 week ago that my views changed from netural to accepting it (but proceed with caution) type after coming into contact of opportunities where i see good opportunties..from the initial skeptic to netural after having this 2 threads which i monitor.</p>
              <p>I'm surprised myself to see find myself with the possibility to return back to this industry after all these years.</p>

              <p>Hi. I have been reading alot of negative threads about MLM. It seems to me that MLM is bad. I understand it's now called direct sellling or network marketing.</p>
              <p>I have been searching for a good and honest MLM company and i now realise that most MLM company are good. Only that the people who joined and the way they get the downlines are questionable.</p>
              <p>What I believe to join an established MLM company, is to join the right team with good leaders who will guide you in good times and also in bad.</p>
              <p>Don't you think so?</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>Based on my most recent understanding after going to an appointment to find out what's happening out there in network marketing.</p>
              <p>It seems to me that there are still good companies, but with average leaders only.</p>
              <p>There is however an opportunity that I myself is also looking at that caught my eye which has passed my personal criterias (many layers of conditions after being in this industry for more since 2005).</p>
              <p>i'm quite surprised that there is still at least something out there that's worth looking at.</p>

              <p>Hi Michael, it is true that there are many negatives threads about MLM because of illegal pyramid schemes in the past and the manner of how some network marketers do business.  </p>
              <p>However, that doesn't mean a person should give up on the profession if he or she sees the benefits and rewards of being successful in MLM. Just that it will take hard work, preserverance and some time. Most importantly, every network marketer should do their part in educating the masses what is network marketing really about, rather than trying to pitch what they have.</p>
              <p>You're right: find an established company with quality products and a successful team/mentor to guide you.</p>

              <p>Well, nice try using the typical post and edit practice used by lots of forum users to try to bypass the moderator's notification of new post (if they choose to monitor and be updated of new posts).</p>
              <p>However since I am looking after the 2 threads that I started to remain netural..<br>That website link is not really netural.<br><br>If you like to share, do it via PM..<br>Since you post it online publicly, as another trainined Internet Marketer, I'll just give you an immediate feedback.</p>
              <p>The link is giving a POOR USER EXPERIENCE.</p>
              <p>What it means is that even if I were to click on the link to find out more information, the website failed to load, so if you're doing a business and gives a non-operating website reference, you're get no business. It will reflect bad on you as well.</p>
              <p>So much so for trying to "remain netural".</p>
              <p>I'll try to upload the screenshot of the error msg later once I can find a link to upload the image.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway: If you want to share a business opportunity, PLEASE START YOUR OWN THREAD!</p>
              <p>Such behavior is not professional of you to HIJACK a thread that I created with the intention to provide netural views and advice to newbies.</p>
