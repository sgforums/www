              <p>Online gambling is illegal in Singapore and yet this political

              <p>Thank you for your kind intentions of informing us of the inside news of the politician's involvment of that company.</p>
              <p>However I've repeated myself many times not to post any company's name in my thread to avoid flaming thread replies which steer away from my original intention and objective of starting this thread.</p>
              <p>Thanks again for sharing but please exercise discreetion when sharing the piece of information with us - at least by censoring with S**shi*** Empire else just quote a similar example which most of us majority can understand can liao.</p>
              <p>Last but not the least, please start your own thread and post your links back in your own thread, instead of hijacking it.</p>
              <p>Thank You.</p>
              <p><strong>Btw:</strong> Company hasn't fallen because of the project which you mention (please exercise discreet this time) that I've also was informed about this project from the same leader. He has just gone smarter diversifying to lower the risk, increasing difficulty in checking and closing a company in terms of law thanks to the tedious investigation work needed before hand.</p>
              <p>Til they completed cease existence than we can celebrate, til than, we can only sharpen our knowledge and work on our previously strong inner sgforum update sharing power of information which made it so super active in Sgforums.</p>

              <p>As what i was told by those victims.There is no office in singapore.Those who invest are introduce by friends.GIO pay out 4% interest every 10 days to those who invest in them.Clubsirroccoasia investor will get 10% back every month , by the end of 1 year the amount invest will be return.They will bring every investor to combodia grand dragon casino to show the investor where they invest.As i know Gio is now operating it is very popular in hongkong right now as for clubsirroccoasia those who investor had not been receiving their interest since april 09.Those key person in-change i mention on my topic are responsible for all this.Some of the victim had report this to the police since june 09 .The police say they can do nothing as there upline say they themselve are investor only. </p>

              <p>since you mention about this job offer disguise, than perhaps you guys should take a closer look at the classified job ads.</p>
              <p>literally, there at least a few tell-tale signs of mlm advertising who are regularly paying newspapers for prospects.</p>
              <p>i will not share how to look at it, but if you buy newspapers and look for jobs long enough, you will one day pick up how to see such recruitment job ad gimmicks.</p>
              <p>plus overpromising and pulling links is the most often used method which they are using and it works on gullible,innocent, naive and ignorant people.</p>
              <p>first thing first to save yourself from making a waste trip, ask them for company name and website for reference before even making any trip down. Proper business employment companies (non-mlms) should be able to come up front with these details.</p>
              <p>hope this tip helps you and the rest of the readers.</p>
              <p>btw: thanks for your contribution.</p>
