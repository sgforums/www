              <p>All I can say about products is that different companies'
              products serve a different market and they each have their unique
              selling point.</p>
              <p>For instance:</p>
              <p>Marie France Body Line</p>
              <p>Slim Fit</p>
              <p>Bottom Slim</p>
              <p>New York (Facial)</p>
              <p>and many other beauty centers, they all target ladies and
              perhaps some guys who wants to look good, but look closely, <strong>they
              target different parts and needs of their clients which is why none
              collaspe but only to keep on increasing in retail outlets.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The same goes to mlm or any other business.</strong></p>
              <p>I will be using real-life examples as reference to reply back
              because from the post replies to date is that people still have
              very much negative impression about mlm, so i will just post
              similar examples, if anybody can't get the link between the
              examples, than kindly clarify, but please, don't keep on focus on
              mlm and link them to negative sales agents..</p>
              <p>Focus on business, like I did, and that's why even <strong>Donald Trump
              and Robert Kiyosaki </strong>also know about it and perhaps lots more
              information than me, but they rather not reveal much about it for
              business and personal reseasons.</p>
              <p>If you or anyone focus on negative stuffs, you will end up
              always negative, so why not try to think positive and everything
              will turn out positive like what I did.</p>
              <p>It's all about Law Of Attraction.</p>
              <p><strong>Deino:</strong> if you're wondering what a new mlm agent
              learn, than look at me, what am i doing here with my knowledge, how
              much did I learn VS the other mlm agents. I focus on learning but
              they (majority) focus on profits thus the huge gap in
              differences.</p>
              <p>It's not about how much you can learn, but rather DO ANYONE even
              want to learn about those informative knowledge and skills in the
              first place?</p>
              <p>I learn all these because skills and knowledge are more
              important than money or profits which is why I'm still surviving
              and kicking after 5years despite little to no money earn, but I've
              gain quality knowledge not taught in schools which many paid school
              fees, time and effort to learn but fail to understand it.</p>
              <p>Just ask more questions: I'll share if it's not under my
              classified section of business secrets.  (",)</p>

              <p>There are MLM firms whose primary products are absolutely worthless. They have MLM firms selling birds, air, and other rubbish products in the US. Apparently, their version is, the product isn't important. What's important is the system and how fast you recruit people under you. A product can be totally useless, rubbish, but as long as people see the value in the system, any product is fine. In fact, several large MLM firms have many products overlapping each other, overlapping the general retail market and other commerically available over the counter.</p>
              <p>Both Trumph and Kiyosaki did not engaged in MLM business.</p>

              <p>Precisely. It is the "SOP" of several MLM firms. A new agent sells to his own family and relatives to a certain preferably "recruit-able" position, then recruits people, and make them sell to their own family.</p>
              <p>In this way, it's True Network Marketing, where you don't sell to cold market, but via the goodwill of word-of-mouth. However, this particular "goodwill" only sterms if the product is really unique and beneficial to people. Generally, this is not true. Most MLM products are common between firms or general retail, and/or they are almost worthless. And secondly, there is no goodwill in the first place. New MLM agents are usually aggressively influence (read forced) into selling to their family first, under the guise of "testing the product yourself", "front loading", "going into recruiting mode", etc.</p>

              <p>No doubt magnetic therapy has always being within the debating
                  hot topics when it comes to products, and one of the 3 mlm
                  companies which i've being to previously even mentioning about a
                  public hosptial using it with photos.. LOL</p>
              <p>but over time as I continue to watch and get updates, I can and
                  will agree to your thinking to a certain level perhaps 50/50.</p>
              <p>With this in view:</p>
              <p>Let's look at the issues from different point of views.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">1)
                  Advertiser</span></strong></p>
              <p>To cut cost, getting mlm agents and company to sell it is the
                  most low-cost way that the current market know of, BUT i've learn a
                  even lower cost marketing strategy plus it's also word of mouth but
                  without any MLM practices..will keep it as my business secret for
                  now until I've made some decent revenue to proof the efficiency of
                  it first before I decide to share with anyone.</p>
              <p>when a new product comes into a market, one of the possible
                  reason why they choose mlm is primary because it's low cost.
                  Backend reason which I presume only might because the
                  advertiser/supplier of the new innovative product has already spent
                  a huge chunk of capital to invest in the R&amp;D segment to come up
                  with the finished product than with low cash flow, they have little
                  marketing/advertising choices left ma.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">2) MLM
                  Company</span></strong></p>
              <p>They get to be the contracted SOLE Agent representing the
                  advertiser/supllier of the product, so once the advertiser signs
                  it, it's as good as losing control rights over the product at least
                  until the amount of years stated in the contract.</p>
              <p>This benefits the company but not to the advertiser/product
                  supplier if he/she aren't well informed in making an informed and
                  wise decision to choose which mlm company to help market their
                  products.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">3) MLM
                  Agents/Distributors</span></strong></p>
              <p>when given the right to sell a new product, they should be
                  happy, but due to heavy competition among the same company agents,
                  it's not recommended for a complete newbie to enter into the ring
                  of competition.</p>
              <p>so depending on how the agent is taught and decisions made, be
                  it the success or failure of the mlm agent in the journey of mlm,
                  it all boils down to the decision he/she makes when she decides to
                  help the company market the product using whatever methods they are
                  taught if they are just mere sellers and not product consumers.</p>
              <p>it's true that many are taught to be great sellers and not as a
                  consumer point because they themselves are hard up for cash thus
                  that's the main reason why people
                  <strong>OVERSELL/OVERPROMISE</strong> the advantages of the
                  products because they themselves the agents aren't using it. I
                  myself was once such an agent but only for a short period of 1-2
                  weeks before I see the super negative impact on my reputation thus
                  causing me to re-think and reposition myself to what I am
                  today.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">4) Customer point of
                  view</span></strong></p>
              <p>from this point as a client, <strong>COST</strong> is the most
                  important factor, and for us to get good products at a much lower
                  cost would mean that the product that you want to buy already has a
                  <strong>HUGE DEMAND</strong> without any advertising locally in new
                  country (market) this way they can afford to <strong>MASS
                  PRODUCE</strong>.</p>
              <p>Since it's about magnetic therapy, the concept nonetheless is
                  still new so <strong>demand</strong> is still considered
                  <strong>LOW</strong>, thus they can't MASS PRODUCE it just to bring
                  cost low. Just think of this from another view, if they have
                  <strong>no ready buyers</strong> to buy the Mass Produced Products,
                  they end up paying more on products space rental, storage, which
                  will gradually increase over time thus it makes no buisness sense
                  to mass produce without a ready market with results in <strong>huge
                  losses</strong> instead</p>

                  balanced response which you're satisfied with. :)</p>

              <p>1. Advertising. That's what a lot of MLM introductory videos say. However, whether cash that potentially goes to advertising, goes to R&amp;D instead nobody knows. No one but the owner and maybe the top handful of people in the MLM firm knows. It could be just become more profits for the firm.</p>
              <p>2. MLM Company. Do they really get to be the sole agent? Product companies just repackage their product A to become product B and assign another sole agent. This do not benefit the MLM firm at all. In fact the product companies are "playing" the MLM firms. The owner of the MLM firm knows, but to them any product is a good one if it brings in the revenue.</p>
              <p>3. MLM Distributors/Agents. Today be it you're an agent of a particular firm, you compete not only with other agents but also against the retail market. Take for example the Vit C, or the whatever water purifier system that many MLM firms and retail stores sell. Firstly, MLM's products are not distinguish-ly good, secondly, they are not significantly cheaper. In fact, most are more expensive. So how is trying to sell a more expensive, "never heard before brand" of Vit C via MLM better than Guardian's Vit C or Nature Farm's Vit C?</p>
              <p><br>4. Customers' point of view. You got it the wrong way. A product does not have any demand without advertising. Advertising creates the demand, before people buys the product, not the other way round. Will anyone buy colgate before they know colgate helps prevent tooth decay? No. People buy colgate because through advertising, they know that colgate helps maintain better teeth.</p>
              <p>MLM firms can say all they want about the power of word-of-mouth marketing. There are several studies proving this, but there are also studies that are inconclusive.</p>
              <p>However let's use some common sense. Virgin Mobile came into SG ard 10 years ago, I'm sure many would recall their official opening with the CEO Richard Branson adsailing down their office building. That advertisment alone informs more people in a short time more than any word-of-mouth marketing can do.</p>
              <p>Say today you really discover a new powerful product, say a super vit that ensures the product user will no longer fall sick in their lifetime. This SuperVit is so good that it immunises people against cancer, heart diease, all the stupid flu-s, and SuperVit ensures great skin with eternal youth. Would you go by slower word-of-mouth MLM style, or would you launch your product through all the retail lines via big bang advertising? This is a no-brainer ya.</p>

              <p>1) Regulated, Legal &amp; Recognised Company don't appear in Headlines as frequent as those in red zone of negative profits.</p>
              <p>There's the other part about Media Control of certain news - M.S.K's capture was also kept secret until some it was leaked out by unknown sources - Govt also hides some important news too.</p>
              <p>Refer to Video in Youtube - <a title="One Nation Under Lee (Complete Video)" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17qhGIwyGj0">One Nation Under Lee (Complete Video</a>) to watch the link between Media Control of Lee and try to link up the Income they get aginst other Prime Minister inside the Video. They protect their own interest thus some things are left unknown to us.</p>
              <p>Disclaimer:</p>
              <p>The above information are what I tried to link up and interpertation of mine after different input from different people, I will not be held responsible for the creditability or trustworthiness of the above information. However, it can be served as a reference.</p>
              <p>2) Negative practices of AIG Insurance Agents - If you remember the Investment in the mini-bonds, high-risk investment contracts etc which created a frenzy about the negative, misleading practices of sales agents to get more policies sign. It appeared on the News for a few days if not perhaps a week or so.</p>
              <p>The video interview featured in the news got feature a section about the middle-age customers of AIG saying they were mis-led and no proper explaination being told to them clearly etc in one of the Speakers' Corner Park</p>
              <p>All the negative practices are exactly the same negative practices in MLM industry, but why is it that MLM also get the lime-light and more negative impressions imprinted onto everyone.. Because Govt gets to collect more tax from those recognized companies thus media control is practiced to reduce the negative impact on it etc but no such control has being done to MLM.</p>
              <p>Disclaimer:</p>
              <p>The above information again is solely based on my own observations and assumptions plus interpretation without any documentation as proof because it is still in the GREY Areas of Sales Industries to date unknown to many of us. You can disagree with me about the 2 issues above, no problem, it's just a matter of perspectives only thus there's not much we can discuss about it other than to acknowledge it only plus post our own views.</p>

              <p>There are MLM firms whose primary products are absolutely

              <p>The same is true for most MLM companies to date even in Singapore as there are a lot of untrained agents.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the high-cost of living in Singapore, only the super minority will focus on the education aspect as compared to the majority who focus on Fast-Cash-Generation from MLM thus they fall prey to those negative sales distributors.</p>

              <p>Precisely. It is the "SOP" of several MLM firms. A new agent
              sells to his own family and relatives to a certain preferably
              "recruit-able" position, then recruits people, and make them sell
              to their own family.</p>
              <p>In this way, it's True Network Marketing, where you don't sell
              to cold market, but via the goodwill of word-of-mouth. However,
              this particular "goodwill" only sterms if the product is really
              unique and beneficial to people. Generally, this is not true. Most
              MLM products are common between firms or general retail, and/or
              they are almost worthless. And secondly, there is no goodwill in
              the first place. New MLM agents are usually aggressively influence
              (read forced) into selling to their family first, under the guise
              of "testing the product yourself", "front loading", "going into
              recruiting mode", etc.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>True Network Marketing is when individual sales distributors sell products to customers who purchase on their own will but purchase the products solely based on the family ties. Products often sold via this method are only a 1-time sale only as a kind gesture to support them based on the family ties but not on their own will to purchase the product.</p>
              <p>Front Loading, Recruiting Mode are stupid strategies which the company and sales distributors support to have greater chances of generating more sales at the expense of ignorant clients/prospects/customers</p>
              <p>Product Testing is good solution but depending on how the upline tell the downline to buy, than it will become a stupid strategy as well.</p>

              <p>Advertising Cost of MLM Company - While a lot of companies don't advertise, only 3-5 companies in Singapore does advertise frequently or at least once in a while as I got collect their newspaper advertisments (which is a common platform of advertisment)</p>
              <p>MLM Company as the sole agent is true only for those who pay more for the distribution rights in a certain country, if the company wants to secure it for Asia or Global, it will cost even more.</p>
              <p>As for the Product A passing on as Product B, this is what we know in the market as Private Label Rights whereby the just take the product, re-brand, re-package and then sell it. So customers need to probe more about the products or at least know more about the differences of different products found in the market.</p>
              <p>Competition against MLM companies as well as retailers are indeed super competitive, thus lots of companies just highlight the pros of the products but don't reveal the cons of the product in any sales..</p>
              <p>I beg to differ with regards to the advertising of the toothpaste.</p>
              <p>I do however know of a company that doesn't advertise yet the product of the particular mlm company from japan-taiwan-singapore now is so successful but only exclusively to parents knowledge with kids in kindergarten and primary school perhaps because of the benefits of increasing the recovery process of the HFMD as quoted from my friend who introduced me to the company and the products in one of the testimonials in the seminar. I will not post or talk more about this company nor the product because I'm not trying to do any advertising nor do I gain any benenfit from the company nor product.</p>
              <p>Going for the Big-Bang in advertising only applies to entrepreneurs with super deep pockets..Advertising in Prime Time Slots for a period of 3months cost 7 digits.</p>
              <p>So unless the boss is so rich, they can la, else MLM is their alternatives. Look at the ROI as well.</p>

              <p>If they keep using the same tactic means it's a successful black-tactic which any other scam mlm company considering to lie, cheat and steal from others should copy and follow as well.</p>
              <p>Refer to the M1 &amp; Mediacorp advertisment on the 3 chinese guy with 1 caucasian &amp; the pregnant lady commercial with the silly husband trying to teach the baby inside the womb that one. These are advertisments which have found award at least it applies for the M1 advertisment as I'm not sure for the latter commercial.</p>
              <p>Same thing applies, if it works, re-use it. But when it comes to advertising, it's better to be creative rather than copying the same concept which is BORING!!</p>

                          due to the standard of english - if you don't understand it &gt;&gt; your

              <p>Togogal Reply to your quote above with is from previous pages:</p>
              <p><strong>"What do you mean no monetary expenses? Do you know they have to pay
                          to get their licenses?"</strong></p>
              <p>your reply: <strong>"yes they have to pay in order to get their license,

              <p>While trying to read again, I still cannot make any sense out of the above.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">You already agree that Insurance &amp; Property
                          agents are Licensed Sales Agent</span></strong> but what about the text highlighted

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The only understanding which I know after infer and deduce based on my

                          both your quote and replies from both yours and Togogal's one is as follows:</span></p>
              <p>Corrections:</p>
              <p>Licensed Sales Agents DO NOT PAY THE COMPANY BUT they pay the company for
                          the Examination which is set by the company and MAS[Financial Related] and
                          other CASE with regards to the examination questions like sales etc.</p>
              <p>Same like we pay Primary &amp; Secondary Schools for PSLE &amp; 'O' Level
                          Examination Fees.</p>
              <p>They do not pay to get their licenses  <strong>=</strong> direct understanding
                          from this sentence is the same as they buy the license to sell insurance and
                          property without any exams (which serves as filtering system to outcast
                          negative sales agents) required as it's not being mentioned. </p>
              <p>The other thing about not paying the company upon joining is because they
                          sell products which are from the company which I think you mean membership fee
                          BUT do you know that They ARE REQUIRED TO HIT A MONTHLY QUOTA/ Sales Target to
                          remain in the company.</p>
              <p>This Sales Target/Monthly Quota is the hidden monthly membership fees to the
                          licensed companies because based on the calculations, the companies can get
                          some ROI back to OFFSET the membership fee which you mean above.</p>
              <p>This is REAL BUSINESS STRATEGY FYI and how businesses maintain their sales
                          volume - I'm wondering if you really know how to keep your business from going
                          into the red colour zone (negative profits) when you even don't understand such
                          stuffs. Are you the business owner or I'm the one sharing with you how to
                          identify a business offsetting fees method?</p>
              <p><strong>"<span style="color: #ff6600;">even if they are the minority</span>.
                          do you see any mlms give basic pay to their sales people? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grant a personal
                          table and chair to all of their employees?"</span></strong></p>
              <p>the above quote is what you mention and your they which is in orange colour
                          refers to property and insurance agents as shown above. BUT WHY do you suddenly
                          ask about MLM giving basic? Didn't you already agree Insurance &amp; Property
                          Agents are licensed Sales agents of network marketing so why still ask the same
                          questions but this time asking mlm agents? - Does this even make any sense?
                          &gt;&gt; Dotz. . .</p>
              <p>What do you mean by those Underlined Sentence by the way??? I just don't
                          understand the link with the sentence above. Is that a separate topic or are
                          you quoting an example? No Clear indications which tells me anything leh..</p>
              <p>As for me hiding business secrets &gt;&gt; Please la, you don't even
                          understand the Basics of Business Sales &amp; Marketing Tactics Used and how
                          they are being Compenstated Yet you are asking me to reply you ADVANCE
                          QUESTIONS WHICH YOU ASKED!!</p>
              <p>I'm not trying to GET you KILL CONFUSED MORE. Example: I am learning to
                          Drive A CAR with Zero Knowledge. Than 1 day I stupidly go BUY a FERRARI without
                          any license. My result will only be 2 - Result 1 - I dunno how to start even
                          the car engine = waste my money or Result 2 - I step on the accelator to hard
                          without changing the clutch than always stay at first gear which is max 100km/h
                          (correct me if i'm wrong) than don't know how to brake, bang myself the car in
                          a accident  and get injured (touchwood) is this plain stupidity?</p>
              <p>If you want to want to go through the convince, confuse and con method used
                          by MLM Agents, kindly go elsewhere, I will not use this 3 fundemental skills
                          which are even used by business owners in their sales pitch and presentations
                          FYI:</p>

              <p>If you think I'm don't know what I'm talking about, look around those MLM

                          posted, did they continue to get worse with lots of confustion or did the
                          discussion stopped? The answer is the latter because I believe I have cleared
                          their doubts with clear precise examples which they can related to themselves.</p>
              <p>Why no one to date can flame and even win me - is because I know what I'm
                          doing VS those new mlm agents who try to act like they know everything using
                          new registered usernames to show-off their new knowledge etc.. Look around
                          la..Wisen up a bit leh..Remove your typical Tradittional Business Owner Mental

              <p>As for my Donald Trump portion: I only metion it to tell Togogal that Donald
                          Trump himself is engaged in MLM Business since I previously thought he isn't -
                          End of story. Why do you ask or write about the bosses talking bad of their own

              <p>After a few times of reading, i think you are trying to comment about me
                          saying about the loop-holes but didn't i write "nonetheless" which
                          means however shows the statement is not important. So why are you
                          concentrating on Non-important details?</p>

              <p>You don't understand what I mean by Togogal doesn't understand
              your reply due to the standard of english - if you don't understand
              it &gt;&gt; your english has only taken a turn for the worse.</p>
              <p>Looking at the phrase again  you quote from previous

              <p>"anyway <strong>insurance agents and property agents are an
              example of network marketting however with a license required and

              <p>Togogal Reply to your quote above with is from previous
              pages:</p>
              <p><strong>"What do you mean no monetary expenses? Do you know they
              have to pay to get their licenses?"</strong></p>
              <p>your reply: <strong>"yes they have to pay in order to get their
              license, however they do not have to pay when they join a company.
              "</strong></p>
              <p>While trying to read again, I still cannot make any sense out of
              the above.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: blue;">You already agree that
              Insurance &amp; Property agents are Licensed Sales

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The only understanding
              which I know after infer and deduce based on my own understanding
              (also some corrections since it's being bring up again) from both
              your quote and replies from both yours and Togogal's one is as
              follows:</span></p>
              <p>Corrections:</p>
              <p>Licensed Sales Agents DO NOT PAY THE COMPANY BUT they pay the
              company for the Examination which is set by the company and
              MAS[Financial Related] and other CASE with regards to the
              examination questions like sales etc.</p>
              <p>Same like we pay Primary &amp; Secondary Schools for PSLE &amp;
              'O' Level Examination Fees.</p>
              <p>They do not pay to get their licenses  <strong>=</strong> direct understanding from this sentence is the same as they buy the
              license to sell insurance and property without any exams (which
              serves as filtering system to outcast negative sales agents)
              required as it's not being mentioned. </p>
              <p>The other thing about not paying the company upon joining is
              because they sell products which are from the company which I think
              you mean membership fee BUT do you know that They ARE REQUIRED TO
              HIT A MONTHLY QUOTA/ Sales Target to remain in the company.</p>
              <p>This Sales Target/Monthly Quota is the hidden monthly membership
              fees to the licensed companies because based on the calculations,
              the companies can get some ROI back to OFFSET the membership fee
              which you mean above.</p>
              <p>This is REAL BUSINESS STRATEGY FYI and how businesses maintain
              their sales volume - I'm wondering if you really know how to keep

              <p>you're welcome :)</p>
              <p>if you really want to know aobut hidden truth about mlm companies
                      offering basic income &gt;&gt; i can say that all mlm companies selling
                      consumable products like health supplements are able to get a basic
                      income over some time spent on building the business. same idea applies
                      here again. I'll use insurance/financial agents as an example:</p>
              <p>insurance/financial
                      agents they themselves start from ZERO. over time of learning and
                      practice, their skills improves, thus along with their sales volume,
                      when the sales agents regardless of whatever nature of business (be it
                      mlm, insurance, financial planner) they will slowly accumulate their
                      basic income over time ON CONDITION they have a pool of loyal customers
                      who make purchases of products on a monthly basis, with a steady flow
                      of sales, than the commission based income thus slowly stablized which
                      slowly give customers and other interested parties in joining the
                      company the idea that it's possible to get basic income.</p>
              <p>But the
                      truth is - we as sales agents are getting monthly stablized sales
                      volume which then in turn contribute back to our effort as a minimal
                      income based on our previous hardwork. Over time when customers are
                      happy with you, they refer more, you earn more, both sides are also
                      happy.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don't be confused with <strong>basic income in sales job</strong> = there's no such thing as basic income but rather <strong>passive income </strong></span>[which
                      mask itself to others as basic income] once your network of customers
                      are stable enough to be buying on their own will. That is why many
                      people and businesses are finding it a hidden gem to use this model,
                      but not many understand the pros and cons of this business inside out.</p>
              <p>I
                      can't say I'm a pro in mlm knowledge but at least i understand how it
                      works generally and the ideas which are passed on from generations of
                      sales distributors. There's only 2 person whom I got to know from
                      Sgforums who knows maybe the same if not more than me, but lets face it
                      people are selfish and for every single move, they have some reasons
                      behind it. I'm building a business, not a part-time job like majority
                      of the others who join mlm just for try try..</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MLM VS Traditional Business</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MLM</strong></span></span> = a weak Franchise Business = 100% Copy Downwards Business to copy the
                      success model = skill sets and knowledge are passed down, but no
                      guarantee in the interpretation of individual understanding nor are the
                      sales agents binded by law to observe and follow certain rules which is
                      why there's 95-98% of negative untrained sales distributors.</p>
              <p>However,
                      if the exact skill sets are being passed to a person who's really keen
                      in learning the system, they can grow their knowledge and experience
                      over time should they don't look at profits as the main focus point
                      than the end result will be similar to me if not better - solid
                      un-shakable foundation of basic to advance knowledge of business</p>
              <p>Only
                      when you successfully found a willing, humble business partner (sales
                      distributor - i will not say downline because I have plans to do
                      business with them in future) so you can ride on their willingness to
                      learn and depending on how much they absorb la. If they are successful
                      like you and able to operate on their effort to help you spread your
                      business operations - but there's a catch - it's like finding a needle
                      in a ocean. [which is why property/financial/insurance top directors
                      main focus is on recruiting at the top ladder rather than starters who
                      are doing sales earning the Over-riding commission]</p>
              <p>Once you're successful in looking for a couple of like-minded
                      partners - depending on how the compensation plan is, you will be able
                      to completely free yourself from the business and yet get the business
                      running with a solid duplicated partner running the business for you.
                      all you need to do is just to pay a least minimal product to be allowed
                      to get the overiding commission which results in Financial Freedom in
                      MLM.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Traditional Business</span></strong></span> = Selfish Business = No discussion Business = Boss talk, Employee
                      listen and follow = No Rooms for Discussion = Little room for business
                      improvement = Employees hide their true skills inside them just wanting
                      to get the monthly salary so they do the minimal.</p>
              <p>When you happen
                      to get a real talented Employee below you, if they are too smart = will
                      some-day convert and switch from Employee to your Business Competitor
                      who knows exactly your Pros &amp; Cons beating you hands down =
                      Knock-out session like in boxing [which is why food industries will not
                      share secret food recipies to avoid competition]</p>
              <p>Only in major businesses, with an open concept and willingliness
                      to help employees become their business partners than will they have
                      joint business which results in more shared profits among business
                      partners.</p>
              <p>However if you have a secret but have captial to turn
                      it to a franchise, it's still positive to be selfish but able to at
                      least be a millionaire, but not a billionaire in future.</p>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Knowing the above comparison does not mean that anyone of you readers
                      are ready to join mlm company yet because you will still fall for their
