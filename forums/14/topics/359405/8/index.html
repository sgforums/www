              <p>The only way to succeed in MLM is to do the right things at the
              start. What is MLM? Multi-level marketing. Marketing=selling. You
              must sell not buy. You are there to make money, not throwing in
              your money.</p>
              <p>The  distribution or commission system is good but only the
              brain shelter evil thoughts. All that I can say, No companies had
              yet to prove that they are sharing the right stuff about MLM. Quote

              <p>Well, you can have your doubts..i'm okay with it..</p>
              <p>You want to complain me..just go ahead lor..just back it up with evidence if you can find it..</p>
              <p>All along over the years, I've being here just offer free advices..since this forum is filled with nothing but skeptical people with no related knowledge or expertises in this area.</p>
              <p>Since when did I promote any company or upsell any distributors?</p>
              <p>If you have any link to any moderators / the forum owner wants to check..just ask them to use their authority account to check my inbox and outbox lor..</p>
              <p>I have nothing to fear..</p>
              <p>For those who don't like my style of running this thread which I created..all that i'm doing is just to keep it the way I am doing..offering Quality and not Quantity (non-helpful advices) which will only cause more newbies to throw in more money instead of saving their hard-earned money.</p>
              <p>Since this is a gossip based forum to being with since the time i got to know of this thread..i take it up to my own Quality Post and Replies to differentiate myself via giving completely free advices/remarks for those people who are sencerely asking for help and nothing else.</p>
              <p>I know the nature of this forum inside out, thus the TOU is meant to protect my reputation and my quality post and replies for those agressive sour-gape eaters.</p>
              <p>I still remember the older days when I was like on the target board being flamed until it's like 3-5 against 1 (that's me) but i am still standing here..</p>
              <p>Quality, not Quantity is the way I do things..(I'm just offering Free Advices openly with anybody who may be interested).</p>
              <p>If you are not happy with me or my post, as long as you can provide valid, solid comments, helpful feedbacks, with your related knowledge of experience, expertises and even insights to how they operate, I do welcome you on board to help out.. (don't believe, look at page 7 of this very thread, you replied back to add-on to offer more helpful advice to that user..did i quote you/flame you or anything, I did nothing, for the fact is i acknowledge that particular thread reply of yours was helpful so i just let it be.)</p>
              <p>I did mention somewhere in one of my recent thread replies (something like can ask some kind senior forum users for advices etc..) did I not?</p>
              <p>For others who may not like the way I do things, I didn't at once force or spam other people's threads to direct traffic to my threads in the first place..in fact it's others who are trying to hi-jack my thread for their own benefits</p>
              <p>their aggressive actions of spamming my thread is the reason why that forced me to put the TOU &gt;&gt; that is is Disclaimer to tell people who don't listen to the rules</p>
              <p><strong>I'm here to help and not to make enemies for your info.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In case you forgotten..just to refresh your memories..the very reason I know so much in-depth stuffs is due to the fact I was also once a victim, my investments was lost to their scam</span>, so i'm here only to help others by not letting them follow my foot-steps of being tricked by some un-trained agents who overpromised etc..</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>my loophole 1 is alerting you to potential flamers. To me, it's helping you.</p>
              <p>My loophole 2 is alerting you, again, to what's right or wrong about this forum.</p>
              <p>There's no doubts or whatsoever on your behaviour, actions, or character. I'm can't be bothered with that, seriously. You are adult enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, I don't really trade stocks; I'm investing for longer time horizon of years. Instead, I'm spending my extra time creating value for the economy in my own little way, and profitting from creating that value at the same time; that is, education. My life goal is to reduce the stress of students and also reduce the "hatred" of students on the subjects of maths and physics. That is why I help out at homework forum whenever I can spare some time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have to add too that there are indeed singaporeans who achieved a networth 3 times of mine while being 3 yrs younger than me. What I mentioned is for the general friends who don't really give a hoot on financial issues.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading :)</p>

              Dangerboi asks a direct question. 
              
              Interestingly, you avoid answering in direct fashion and still do not give a "clear" answer with your circular logic.
              
              Being "Involved" in MLM takes on many forms. You "appear' quite involved.

              Dear the_fallen . . . .
              
              There are a great multitude of individuals who are like blind mules, anxious enough to kick, but canâ€™t tell where (accredit Josh Billings). 
              
              I would challenge you to go back and re-read exchange or inititation of posts. There was, in no instance, any flame on my part "prior" to your rude, obnoxious, inhospitable and I will add . . . "ignorant" . . . comments. Keep in mind that you, SIR (or madame) are the one who sparked the "flame"! I will also remind you that ignorance consists of making statements of speculation without foundation of fact. You have shown repeatedly that this is your "modus operandi" in an effort to bolster what you perceive to be your own expertise, and you are quick to lash down at people who have perfectly logical intellect and response to forum posts. 
              
              Please feel free to invite me to participate in or challenge me on any topic of competence, intellect or experience. I am sure you will find I am quite the complimenting friend or formidable foe . . . depending on "your" approach. 
              
              You must also be new to the concept of philosophical and intellectual revelation (matters not the topic) . . . you obviously are oblivious to the proven concept that wisdom is often discovered in asking a question with a question in an effort to get to the truth of an answer. Remember the wise lessons of the sages, grasshopper!

              <p>Hi Ken, with regards to your question, perhaps you might want to post your question on the other thread which caters to any questions instead of posting it here which in this thread. </p>
              <p>This thread is meant to help people who may have complaints and problems they want to solve on issues about how to save themselves or their friends from being mis-lead or forced to join due to peer pressure or greed or even counter measures.</p>
              <p>You can post your question in this link <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/14/topics/387291">http://sgforums.com/forums/14/topics/387291</a>  which I've copied for your convenience. I'll not reply in this thread so as not to encourage other users from side-tracking from the main purpose of this thread.</p>
