              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0070c0; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">New York </span></span>- The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is probing Herbalife, the multi-level marketing company that hedge fund manager William Ackman called a pyramid scheme, sources familiar with the investigation said.</p>
              <p>   The news, first reported by the Financial Times last Friday, sparked a sharp sell-off that sent the stock price down nearly 14 per cent that day.</p>
              <p>   The firm has steadfastly denied running a pyramid scheme, where distributors earn more money for recruiting new members into the scheme than they do by selling products to consumers.</p>
              <p>   News of the FBI probe comes about a month after Herbalife confirmed that the Federal Trade Commission had issued a civil investigative demand to the firm to look more closely at how it works.</p>
              <p>   Herbalife, which reported sales of US$4.8 billion (S$6 billion) last year, employs a vast network of independent distributors who sell its nutritional powders and shakes in more than 80 countries, including China, its fastest-growing market.</p>
              <p>   It has an office in Singapore located on Orchard Road. Listed on its Singapore were reasons why interested parties were reasons why interested parties should sign up as independent distributors such as "a generous compensation plan" and "a proven business model".</p>
              <p>   It also features success stories of product users who eventually went on to become distributors.</p>
              <p>   In the United States, it has been a battleground for heavy-hitting investors. Mr Ackman, who runs the US$13 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, first called the firm a fraud in December 2012 when he unveiled a US$1 billion short position against the company.</p>
              <p>   Since then, billionaire investors Carl Icahn, George Soros, Daniel Loeb and William Stiritz have taken the other side of the bet, helping push the stock price up 138 per cent last year.</p>
              <p>   Their involvement has comforted other investors that Herbalife will eventually get a clean bill of health, one investor said.</p>
              <p>   But Mr Ackman is sticking by his forecast that the company's share price will eventually fall to zero after regulators start looking at the company more closely.</p>
              <p>   Pershing Square has published dossiers on Herbalife's distributors, charging that they lure in recruits with videos featuring big houses and expensive cars even though company statistics show that the majority of them never earn income from Herbalife.</p>
              <p>   Mr Michael Araujo, a Massachusetts resident whose family lost roughly US$85,000 on the scheme, said in an interview on the company's sales tactics: "They target people who are desperate."</p>

              <p>You have made the correct assumption.</p>
              <p>Ask any Property/Insurance sales agents, and they also share the same generic sales genology terminoloy as those in network marketing.</p>
              <p>The only difference is that network marketing agents have more leverage for much lesser of work as compared to those top performers who consistently bring in results.</p>
              <p>Networking agents do much lesser efforts yet can bring in similar if not more income due to the leverage element.</p>

              <p>Well, i think i have watched å‰�çº¿è¿½ä¸­mentioned about such Wine investment schemes couple of year back leh..</p>
              <p>That time I watched..they were filming the video of the selling process taking place in the car park lot where the sales lady were showing the client the red wines..</p>
              <p>Just to be cautions..next time if you sense something wrong, dont highlight to the seller..instead request for more informationt o bring back home and read..express interest so they put their guard down..than you call the television hotline and let them follow up lor..</p>
              <p>Just 1 month ago, i also come across a recruitment classified ad of a scam company that the television program cover the story of a Fake Charity Company hiring students to work for them requesting for only $10 per single donation claimining that they are helping ex-convicts..</p>
              <p>Turns out from the post..the employees/students were made to sign a 1 month contract at least..as mentioned in the classifieds..so I'm not if the law will help protect even the employees who are naive in this case..</p>
              <p>Just be careful.</p>
              <p>Government needs time to investigate and monitor the situation, gather solid evidence before they take actions, thus they can't deny the charges..meanwhile it's happening..just be careful lor..it's our hard earned money afterall.</p>

              <p>There are both white and black sheep distributors/agents/employees in any companies.</p>
              <p>As a company evolve and gets popular, the people who have not experienced handling vast amount of wealth in their hands will start to come up with all these patterns which are 'normal criminal' behaviors which any business will face..</p>
              <p>It's just another business lesson that each of us learn.</p>
              <p>Business Dont Fail, People Will Fail <br>Because everything is created and modified by people, so if you hire/follow the wrong person, your sales organisation will suffer the consequences.</p>
              <p>That's where people get fired/retrenched in traditional employments and join Network Marketing because the only person who can fire them in Network Marketing is themselves as such companies depends on sales, thus everybody is precious both as a consumer and salesperson.</p>
