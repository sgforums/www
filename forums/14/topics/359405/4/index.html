              <p>Hey Bro, if you wanna advertise, try elsewhere!!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Don't try to ride on my thread traffic to divert to your thread ;  a dirty cheap tactic; you found the wrong place to place.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Any way, here's my verdict of your thread; since you posted and I'm obliged at least to have reponse to be a responsible thread starter.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Verdict:</span></strong></p>
              <p>Contents of the thread = Bias 1-sided experience with no prior experience in mlm - it's based on my eperience of being actively participated in mlm before thus I deduce that this person - redstone only join the business, refuse to learn and than turn skeptical than cry wolf shortly thereafter [scenerio 1] or redstone is just painly against mlm without being even involved in mlm before; it could be he's family members or relatives which have caused him and his family a lot of problems and troubles before which caused him to be super against MLM [ scenerio 2]</p>
              <p>The numbers and percentages which are in the thread link are <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolutely WRONG</span> = Wrong Data input</strong></span></p>
              <p>The example of the companies he has listed in the thread link is just purely based on his WILD GUESS WHICH IS INCORRECT!!</p>
              <p>His <strong>knowledge of MLM =</strong>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">ZERO</span></span></p>
              <p><strong>Skepticsm of MLM</strong> = <span style="color: #ff0000;">100% Full Marks</span></p>
              <p><strong>Bias against MLM </strong>= <span style="color: #ff0000;">100% Full Marks</span></p>
              <p>Closed Up Sturbon Fellow who refuses to learn/expose himself to accept facts = 85%</p>
              <p><strong>Personality of redstone</strong> [solely based on the above thread link and his action of posting in my thread] =<strong> </strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ostrich</span> - hiding behind the net trying to act like a pro which in fact is a smart-alex - thinking that nobody will discover/know his whereabouts nor objective when his body (evidence of post) is so clearly stated with nothing more than a link clearly indicate his personality.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don't believe a word he says/write with regards to MLM.</span></em></p>
              <p><strong>Classic example</strong> of <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Empty Vessel Makes the Most Noise</span></em></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">This serves as a warning to other forum users as well: If there's anybody who tries to divert or steal the traffic from my thread, I will do the same as per above or even more depending on situation.</span></strong></p>
              <p>For the above, he violated all the rules I've set in my thread so you will not want to consider such a person to be your future business partner or even take into consideration of his advices in future.</p>

              <p>you're welcome :)</p>
              <p>if you really want to know aobut hidden truth about mlm
              companies offering basic income &gt;&gt; i can say that all mlm
              companies selling consumable products like health supplements are
              able to get a basic income over some time spent on building the
              business. same idea applies here again. I'll use
              insurance/financial agents as an example:</p>
              <p>insurance/financial agents they themselves start from ZERO. over
              time of learning and practice, their skills improves, thus along
              with their sales volume, when the sales agents regardless of
              whatever nature of business (be it mlm, insurance, financial
              planner) they will slowly accumulate their basic income over time
              ON CONDITION they have a pool of loyal customers who make purchases
              of products on a monthly basis, with a steady flow of sales, than
              the commission based income thus slowly stablized which slowly give
              customers and other interested parties in joining the company the
              idea that it's possible to get basic income.</p>
              <p>But the truth is - we as sales agents are getting monthly
              stablized sales volume which then in turn contribute back to our
              effort as a minimal income based on our previous hardwork. Over
              time when customers are happy with you, they refer more, you earn
              more, both sides are also happy.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don't be confused with
              <strong>basic income in sales job</strong> = there's no such thing
              as basic income but rather <strong>passive income</strong></span> [which mask itself to others as basic income] once your network of
              customers are stable enough to be buying on their own will. That is
              why many people and businesses are finding it a hidden gem to use
              this model, but not many understand the pros and cons of this
              business inside out.</p>
              <p>I can't say I'm a pro in mlm knowledge but at least i understand
              how it works generally and the ideas which are passed on from
              generations of sales distributors. There's only 2 person whom I got
              to know from Sgforums who knows maybe the same if not more than me,
              but lets face it people are selfish and for every single move, they
              have some reasons behind it. I'm building a business, not a
              part-time job like majority of the others who join mlm just for try
              try..</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MLM VS Traditional
              Business</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MLM</strong></span></span> =
              a weak Franchise Business = 100% Copy Downwards Business to copy
              the success model = skill sets and knowledge are passed down, but
              no guarantee in the interpretation of individual understanding nor
              are the sales agents binded by law to observe and follow certain
              rules which is why there's 95-98% of negative untrained sales
              distributors.</p>
              <p>However, if the exact skill sets are being passed to a person
              who's really keen in learning the system, they can grow their
              knowledge and experience over time should they don't look at
              profits as the main focus point than the end result will be similar
              to me if not better - solid un-shakable foundation of basic to
              advance knowledge of business</p>
              <p>Only when you successfully found a willing, humble business
              partner (sales distributor - i will not say downline because I have
              plans to do business with them in future) so you can ride on their
              willingness to learn and depending on how much they absorb la. If
              they are successful like you and able to operate on their effort to
              help you spread your business operations - but there's a catch -
              it's like finding a needle in a ocean. [which is why
              property/financial/insurance top directors main focus is on
              recruiting at the top ladder rather than starters who are doing
              sales earning the Over-riding commission]</p>
              <p>Once you're successful in looking for a couple of like-minded
              partners - depending on how the compensation plan is, you will be
              able to completely free yourself from the business and yet get the
              business running with a solid duplicated partner running the
              business for you. all you need to do is just to pay a least minimal
              product to be allowed to get the overiding commission which results
              in Financial Freedom in MLM.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Traditional Business</span></strong></span> =
              Selfish Business = No discussion Business = Boss talk, Employee
              listen and follow = No Rooms for Discussion = Little room for
              business improvement = Employees hide their true skills inside them
              just wanting to get the monthly salary so they do the minimal.</p>
              <p>When you happen to get a real talented Employee below you, if
              they are too smart = will some-day convert and switch from Employee
              to your Business Competitor who knows exactly your Pros &amp; Cons
              beating you hands down = Knock-out session like in boxing [which is
              why food industries will not share secret food recipies to avoid
              competition]</p>
              <p>Only in major businesses, with an open concept and willingliness
              to help employees become their business partners than will they
              have joint business which results in more shared profits among
              business partners.</p>

              <p>I agree your stand that once an mlmer is your downline, he is forever your downline whereas for traditional businesses, he could leave you and be your competitor... </p>
              <p>However, you have to also see that once an mlmer joins a company, he can also do the same, set up a new conpany etc etc...</p>
              <p>And the competition still stands.</p>
              <p>Areas where being a boss of a traditional company have competition : <br><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Rival companies. Thats it. ( add in if you wish )<br><br>Areans where being an upline of some downlines in an mlm company :<br><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Rival companies, sidelines, uplines.</p>
              <p>Yes, the type of rivals in the mlm companies seem the same as any other sales profession, however, for the mlm companies, there is no limit to the number of employees and people recruit endlessly. Thus granting other teams ( your sidelines) more employees under them, which would also mean that you have much much much much more rivals than traditional businesses.</p>

              <p>"Write your complaints about mlm agents here", so I did. That's

              <p>It's FOR EXAMPLE ONLY. UNDERSTAND? Ok, fine... maybe you could
                  give me the correct data and I'll correct it. I have no mlm
                  contacts now. Maybe you have insider info.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for my thread, I am merely showing my point of view. I didn't
                  say ALL mlms. I only emphasising on a few, which I encountered
                  before. I was cheated down by them. I'm merely infering from an
                  outsider and a skeptic's point of view why they do such things.</p>
              <p>Note that I did not comment about their product because I had
                  not used them before. My existance in this subforum is to let
                  people know about the unethical tactics and operations of some
                  mlms. If you really note, I only shoot back at the 3 I had bad
                  encounters with, namely VE, EY and SE. If you have the truth about
                  why MLM companies idolise the so called "achievers" and glorify
                  them, do clarify the truth, since you are so good in analysing. You
                  "scolded" me there, so what's your point, I hate wars of words.
                  It's useless. Instead of telling people what is the truth, you
                  shoot people in the face, call them this and that.</p>
              <p>If you disagree on my views and ideas, you can choose to ignore,
                  or state the truth instead of flaming back.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Thanks for the clarification,</p>
              <p>I turn hostile because I'm also against scammers (in mlm) since I personally lost $2,800 in one of the company which you have mention which appeared in newspapers numerous times. having said my point, although I was once one of the people who's silly enough to believe their rubbish nonsense. Having said that, I still don't want to have people listing company names out to avoid even more flaming.</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If only you have said those above directly in this thread instead of posting a link, my reply will be different</span></em>, because I understand your point of view only after you talk about it, not complaining about mlm like in your thread postings. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">State your problems and troubles clearly, I see how I can explain the differences</span></strong> rather than postings of complainst against the company whereby it's the sales distributors whom pull down the reputation</p>
              <p><strong>I'm hostile towards people who have no individual responsibility - pushing the blame of their own mistakes to others</strong> - <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I lost my money too in mlm, but I learnt a lot more in return. I choose to reflect on my own mistakes and learn instead of complain without looking at ourselves. [dwelling on the negative will not help you move forward at all, so why not learn to admit our own mistakes and failures than move on]</span></strong> Thus I'm here hoping to understand why are people are skeptical about mlm when they should be skeptical towards to sales distributors.</p>
              <p>I'm a former skpetic turn neutral towards mlm in general but is <strong>super ANTI- ILL TRAINED SALES DISTRIBUTORS &amp; VICTIMS of MLM SCAMS</strong> who complain without reflecting on thier own mistakes when it's us who sign the document.</p>

              <p>what happened to you is partially your mistake if you understand where i'm coming from.</p>
              <p>don't reset your thinking to zero and forget everything when i've answered abt the mlm vs tradditional biz wor. don't think of acting blur/forgetful like what other sales distributors do in sales.. while you and the rest of the forum users complain, some times, some users also does display usage of underhand tactics used by bad sales distributors too..</p>

              <p>if you compare a viagra spam message in your inbox with a "are you ready to make big money" ads by the mlm agents, you would probably be much more interested in the viagra ads. because you know that is actually REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN, rather than those stupid, dumbass pick up lines by the useless agents.

                          always happens in MLM be it you're doing it online/offline<br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Look at your ego. Your "always right" attitude. Your don't accept failure mindset. Sadly you used them all wrongly... To succeed, you need to acknowledge yourself failed if you had really failed (just like what happened now), and don't try to compensate anything to it, it will just make it become worse. Than, you move on and stop making the same mistakes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Doing MLM is a failure, doing MLM over the forum is a greater failure, trying to close people over the forum is a giganto failure, quarreling with your mentor is a total failure, you are a failure.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sometimes, you don't need evidence to know something is bad. Just like I told you shit taste good. DO YOU EVEN NEED TO TASTE THE SHIT TO TELL ME I  BULLSHIT?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Likewise you are trying to convince me not I trying to convince you. So shouldn't you provide some evidence that MLM is workable?! Let's say, your paycheck? =)</span></strong></p>

              <p>If you are superior in certain areas and nobody can win you in
              that area, sour-grapes always try some childish tactics thinking
              that they can throw off the thread-starters balance by posting
              nonsense postings without any basis nor evidence. &gt;&gt; This
              always happens in MLM be it you're doing it online/offline<br> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Look at your ego. Your
              "always right" attitude. Your don't accept failure mindset. Sadly
              you used them all wrongly... To succeed, you need to acknowledge
              yourself failed if you had really failed (just like what happened
              now), and don't try to compensate anything to it, it will just make
              it become worse. Than, you move on and stop making the same
              mistakes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Doing MLM is a failure,
              doing MLM over the forum is a greater failure, trying to close
              people over the forum is a giganto failure, quarreling with your
              mentor is a total failure, you are a failure.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Sometimes, you don't need
              evidence to know something is bad. Just like I told you shit taste
              good. DO YOU EVEN NEED TO TASTE THE SHIT TO TELL ME I 
              BULLSHIT?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Likewise you are trying to
              convince me not I trying to convince you. So shouldn't you provide
              some evidence that MLM is workable?! Let's say, your paycheck?

              have no issue with Laurance82 because I personally know his style of
              replying and his depth of checking out for Law Related Information
              especially related to MLM stuffs and I acknowledge his generousity and
              kindness of helping out other users to dig out for more information
              with regards to clearing / telling people advices based on Law.I have
              also seen his determination in winning the debate/arguement so with
              regards to that, I admit that he can win me head and shoulders.</p>
              <p>BUT I'm different from him. I'm not as hard-working as him so I choose to reply based on my experiences.</p>
              <p>Me on the other hand would advice and clarify based on my
              experience because I got myself hands dirty in mlm involvement thus I
              know the tricks inside out. I'm not so sure as to who else knows about
              the tricks since so far I didn't read any previous posts which shows
              signs of the user demonstrating CLEAR Understanding of MLM [advanced
              not those basic skills which is learnt in 1-2hrs]</p>
              <p>I welcome
              anyone who possess advance quality knowledge to come and contribute in
              the forums so that we can learn from one another. I'm not saying that I
              can win you guys in terms of MLM knowledge but I just happen to know
              more than you guys in here because I make it an effort to learn the
              methods and coming up with counter methods thus little people can win
              me in terms of knowledge.</p>
              <p>[Note: I however acknowledge that
              there are countless people who are Better than me in terms of MLM
              knowledge but they aren't contributing in this forum only - due to
              their absence thus I stand out only for the time-being. - people who
              are successful can't be bothered to come online into the forums..while
              it's a way to interact but it doesn't make monetary sense in anyway]</p>

              <p>1
              - doing MLM is failure &gt;&gt; Does this means Donald Trump is a
              failure too (refer to previous pages if you don't know what I mean)</p>
              <p>2
              - doing MLM over Forums is greater failure &gt;&gt; In which way did I
              project myself to be marketing MLM products and services? Please show
              me the proof, thank you - without proof, you are just talking
              nonsense/rubbish.</p>
              <p>3 - Closing people over forums to do MLM =
              Again please show proof - Did i sell any products/company name or did I
              share tips and tricks on how to identify bad-ass sales agents in mlm
              &gt;&gt;obviously my thread belongs to the latter.</p>
              <p>4 - Quarreling
              with my mentor - Look - Who's my mentor? I don't have any mentor online
              in this forum, so what made you think I'm quarreling with my mentor?</p>
              <p>5
              - Shit - Visit Japan for their exclusive SEX shopping center (don't ask
              for specific name because I have yet to go see this shopping center in
              person; I only hear this from my elder brother) and you'll be suprised
              that there are people selling Shit for people who have this festish for
              shits belonging to babes and if you like to order from same person, you
              can put up a request too if you like - go Japan and check it out
              yourself - if shit is bad, why are there still people who sell it - Lol.</p>
              <p>Durian - Western people always say durian stinks, why do we
              still eat it. Even taiwanese also don't like it but we singaporeans do
              like it..</p>
              <p>6 - Evidence : If you think evidence isn't important,
              try go accusing LEE Family in govt and see what happens to you in Court
              - look at the Democratic Party of Singapore who was sent to jail if you
              need an example. [I treat both online/offline equally if you didn't
              read my previous pages of this thread - I simply repeat this to let you
              know]</p>
              <p>7 - Cyber Harassment  - Where's the proof? I once again is
              responding to posts by different people. Did I in anyway harass people?
              Answer is clear No what..</p>
              <p>8 - Did I fail or lose to you? No what,
              I on the other hand is showing you your mistakes, if you can show me my
              mistakes (after you have read the reads of my thread from the first
              page to the last page) than come and voice your views. Don't assume
              victory too soon. But if you want a victory, I now surrender and
              declare you're the winner &gt;&gt; how about this? Sounds good to you?</p>
              <p>9 - Threaten = Which word/phrase/sentence and content give you
              the idea of me threatening you? No I didn't? You're just accussing me
              without any basis.</p>

              <p>Deino, I would apreciate it if you simply just write about saying your fren posting in networking sites to promote mlm (E.g: Friendster) instead of exact copying which including the company's name which I want to avoid to prevent flamming.</p>
              <p>Anyway thanks for your input.</p>
              <p>With regards to the above post which you have written..I can only comment that those methods are out-dated tricks already.. Their bulletin post's contents is already killing themselves giving warning to poeple telling them that they are doing MLM.</p>
              <p>Just leave it as it is la, see how they rot lor..It's just a matter of time before they give up since they don't know what are they should do nor are they updated with the new trends of MLM which have changed over the years.</p>
