                      will say I stupid. If I say no then you can say I humji.</p>
              <p>You want to continue believe your cult leader Kim Jong Ill James
                      Phang in your own little North Korea Sunshine Empire please
                      continue to do so.</p>
              <p>I used to be quite high rank there. And owning even 1 GP in SE
                      is now ! GP too many. </p>

              <p> You are not making any sense here,why would ppl say you are stupid when you are going to win my $1, and definitely people will wonder why you say no , when you are so SURE that SG SE will close down in just a few days.</p>
              <p>Do look back into the old sunshine empire to determine whether or not i have anything to do with SE.</p>
              <p>you said, used to be, don tell me you are that guy who owned the server for the   sunshine empire holding website.</p>
              <p>I hoped that people who provide info do have supporting evidence, for ur case, no evidence but all  " you heard" and " used to be".  It will be a good piece of evidence if u accept the challenge ^^</p>
              <p>so my question is, when did you quit SE? definitely last month or last dec, if not there is no way you can overheard  jp and jackie discussion.</p>
              <p>"And owning even 1 GP in SE
                      is now ! GP too many. "</p>
              <p>care to explain wat do you mean here?  my question is, how many Gps you personally have, a simple question..thou</p>
              <p> and one more thing,  it would be great if i can pay a visit to their korea se, but am in japan :) .</p>

              <p>See? That's the problem... all the news are wired news, all the info are from their sources, published in their magazines.</p>
              <p>Let's see they publish in mainstream famous and influencial journals. Let me state a few examples. Wall St Journal, Asia Wall Street Journal, Economist, Business Times, etc. Share with the whole world their great financial plan under a great leader. I'm sure the whole financial field would be shocked by SE's high ROI. :)</p>

              <p>I dare them to publish their "business proposal" and their balance sheet, financial statements (if they even have in the first place) in Wall Street Journal.</p>
              <p>They can't even answer the most basic questions of why does SE has such high ROI or why they can't prove their so called wireless projects in Taichung. They just pwned themselves by saying their income is from selling GPs. That's pyramid scam!</p>
              <p>As for the property project in Melaka, please take a close look at the piling machines, the augers, etc. They are so old, I feel it's just a show. Next thing you know, the whole system caves in and collapses, Ah Wah would pretend that he had lost everything again, and who knows few years later he'll start a new scamming company. Who in their right mind is still trusting Phang Ah Wah James now? It's like.... like trusting a maniac serial killer who had heartlessly killed 50, 000 people singlehandedly as a personal bodyguard.</p>

              <p>Aiya, SE this and SE that.  I think those in SE still trying to protect the business are the ones totally suck in by their leaders.  either they are so 'thin skin' to admit that they are in the trap or they're already 'Brain wash'!</p>
              <p>Are you very convince that SE is going to go on forever? come on!  Singapore government is not corrupted unless you say so... I should say not only in singapore, even in Korea and other countries, you think the authories restrict SE because SE is so "powerful" in their ROI that those governments are so jealous and worry that JamesPhang could win over the throne of their Finance Minister?  LOL.</p>
              <p>Don't care about whether SE will open of close shop during this CNY, just ask yourself whether SE will sustain forever?</p>
              <p>Don't come and keep telling people that SE got nothing to do with MAS because other financial field such as land banking is not regulated under MAS.  PLEASE, government is not blind, unless you say so.  You think that SE got nothing to do with MAS? now look at your freezing accounts, and those investors you have drag into.  Cool your arrogance people, if you don't submit to the law, the law will SCREW you!.</p>
              <p>What do you think if you would to look for job outside and tell the employers out there that your working experience is in SE?  They will be so "impress!"  They must be very "Humble" not to show off</p>
              <p>Go and change job!  You want a BMW? go and work hard yourself and stop depending on all these 'False Promises Appearing Sweet'.</p>
              <p>Those previously from SE and came out of it, like zwei, at least he realised the fact and reacted fast. </p>
              <p>I'm very impress with JP or Jackie Hoo in the fact that they run a "multi million companies" without the bravery to showcase their financial standing in the business times.</p>
              <p>The moral of this topic is 'if you find yourself in a HOLE, STOP digging!"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>lol. i find it pretty amusing as to how people argue over whether or not SE would close down or whatever they call it. cos honestly no matter how much people argue abt it e final decision lies in e hands of CAD. lol. so why not call CAD and debate with them whether or not to shut down SE. lol. &amp; yamchan says spore govt. is nt corrupted therefore SE will close down, so if SE doesn't close down does it imply that spore govt. is corrupted? haha. and for redstone, actually i don't really think many MLM's advertise cos e people are walking advertisements already, don't you think so? lol, save cost  lol. everything's hilarious <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p></div>
