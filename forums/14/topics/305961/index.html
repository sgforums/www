              <p>Now all the so-called leaders are spreading among themselves. I overheard them boasting that CAD cannot do anything to them because they spread to places like hong kong china indonesia and malaysia so if anything happen in singapore then just close singapore office and continue scamming the people in other countries.</p>
              <p>Recently they are still recruiting people and collecting money from them because got loophole. They just make the people in Singapore declare they are from other country but seriously I dont think can last. All the people who put money into SE are definitely in for a hard lesson.</p>
              <p>That guy who boast got 128 GP is also very stupid. It's all because SE took his money and give him all te high returns in E points, so his socalled 6 figure income is all in E-points. End up he have to scam other people in otder to "cash out" his epoints and end up kena scam by the leaders to be greedy and re-invest all his e-points to hope for future payout.</p>
              <p>that guy definitely did not dump more than 1 mil. It's all epoints re-invested</p>

              <p>Kitson, I think a lot of people are in the same predictament. Now SE is pretending to close for CNY, I heard today is "Shou Gong" already.</p>
              <p>I think a lot of people are not going to get their cash out in time for CNY. In fact, I am 80% sure that after CNY SE will be no more. It's just nice timing for them to close shop and run because of the CNY break. That's why these few days VERY crucial. If you have money wirh SE and are trying to get it back, call CAD or go through their webpage <a href="http://www.cad.gov.sg">www.cad.gov.sg</a></p>

              <p>Okay, now I'm going to say that not only are you stupid, you are also more disgusting than a person who pees in the lift. Now I know that sounds offensive, but really it's not. Really. I promise.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I also find it very amusing that some people think they can basically say whatever they want as a personal attack as long as they put "No offence" at the back, or maybe even "With all due respect". lol</p>
              <p>"You mother is Ugly! ...No offence"</p>
              <p>"With all due respect, your sister is a HO! ...No offence"</p>
