              <p>Saying good things about him, pitying on him cos of his "sad past", agreeing to whatever he says, etc</p>

              <p>lol. i never agree on calling him father or anything like that. haha. i just find it amusing on the way you all argue abt these stuff. lol. i don't think he asked anyone to pity him or call him father, i think is the people's personally choice of calling him. haha. Also, how would anyone know if they would succeed in smth or not? We ain't god or anything. We're all humans. From my POV, i would say he is daring &amp; doesn't give up easily. As you said he failed so many times but yet he still doesn't give up. To become successful you have to keep picking yourself up no matter how many times you fail. But from others POV, he seems to be "cheating". But he may be wanting to help others but some how or another wasnt that successful. In any case, it all depends on how we look at it. i mean, everything has a good side and a bad side so why not look on the good side of things instead of looking on the bad side <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> </p>

              To fail in business is not a sin , as long
              the business model is sincer and real.
              
              Examine the setup and registration of SE and its so claim affiliated company. 
              
              it is design and setup in such way that it
              is mean to cheat the layman not in business.
              The company is registered in "Tua Pek Kong "
              name... etc JH.
              
              Any honest businessman will not do that ..

              <p>Sunshine Empire.<br><br>The hottest topic has been going around. I have friends in SE and i can tell you that they are TOTALLY brained washed. From what i read from the newspapers and forums, the information i gather is actually VERY simple.<br><br>I shall not touch on how the scheme MLM(MULTI LEVEL MARKETING) works because google is your best friend.<br><br>1) Folks will put in lets say, $300.<br>2) Out of this $300, about $30 will be given to the person that introduced this MLM company to them<br>3) Then 10% will be taken from $300 to be used as loyalty rebate.<br>4) rest of the $300-$30-10% = $240, will be used to give this very handsome guy, called JAMES PHANG.<br><br>From what i know about James phang, be it from newspaper and whatever, James Phang has been declared BANKRUPT before. He has failed in his previous 3 attempts at MLM in previous years. And now Sunshine Empire is his 4th attempt at it. Not sure if he might perfect it, but i doubt so.<br><br>bankruptcy = + 10 fail points.<br><br>ok, let me declare first, whatever i say here, is based on what i know, what i hear from. Choose to believe it or not, up to you.<br><br>5) You are actually paying/working(recruiting folks) for your own loyalty rebates.<br>6) Sunshine Empire is what, claimed as a funding company, if you may, and wish, an investment company but by which they prefer not to be called, for a company called EMCOM in Taiwan. This company is currently building a wireless broadband connection that covers over 95% of taichung and some other places. Recently they are about to start on Vietnam.<br><br>But look. Read the newspapers recently and the papers will immediately tell you from their sources that SUNSHINE EMPIRE and EMCOM OR the company incharged of the whole broadband project is NOT related at all.SO now, folks are puzzled. So where did the money go to?<br><br>The sunshine folks will say, NAH! DONT BELIEVE THE PAPERS! BULL SHIT! WE HAVE BLACK AND WHITE!<br><br>black and white = - 5 fail points.<br><br>We also have projects like the MAGIC KINGDOM in Malaysia and many projects in Indonesia!<br><br>But wait! Where? Where are the hotels and casinos?<br><br>Sunshine Folks : Its not yet built, we are planning it.<br>Ordinary folks: So means its not built yet?<br><br>People, i can tell you i can plan for this and that. And i will psycho you that we need funds to build it and we guarantee high returns!<br><br>Ordinary folks: WAH QUICK BUY!<br><br>few months later...<br><br>Msian Govt: We have not received any information or request/permission to build anything.<br>Sunshine: But we have the CHIEF MINISTER's letter of approval.<br><br>So is it the Msian govt sucks at inter-communication or could SE be lying? I'm pretty sure these, printed on the papers, must be true. because the papers have a much bigger reputation to uphold then SE. Why would they publish something that isn't true? And with such a big coverage on the topic at that!<br><br>Turns out JAMES PHANG, the so call HEAD of the whole Sunshine Empire, is a share holder of EMCOM in taiwan which oversees the broadband project. From anybody's point of view, its pretty obvious that all the money he get from recruiting people, excluding the 10% and $30, the rest of the money goes into HIS pocket.<br><br>So lets do some basic calculation shall we?<br><br>Lets say he gets $1,000,000 from 1000 people. That is like 1000GPs worth roughly 11k each.<br><br>he uses this $1,000,000 and invests as a shareholder in EMCOM and will reel in high returns. He will then use these returns from the EMCOM project to pay back to the sunshine folks. Lets not even enter the topic into how much he actually gets from it. Its just...<br><br>the sunshine folks are the bank of NOT AMERICA, SINGAPORE or CHINA. the folks are the bank of James Phang. And he is actually sort of paying you interest ON top of paying back the initally "invested" money.<br><br>Greed, greed greed. Wouldn't the folks at sunshine ever discover that this company will DEFINITELY close? Not because of the government, but because of the way it works. Look, Singapore has 4.8 million. Currently SE has about 20,000 people. It will be a LONG LONG LONG time before it reaches the full 4.8million. But of course minusing the babies and stuff, we have a staggering figure of about 4million. minus the dying, and teenages, 2.5million. Its just matter of time before everyone is in this thing. Then how is a MLM company going to survive if everybody is in it and there is no more people to recruit?<br><br>Choice 1: END IT<br>Choice 2: Investment company.<br><br>But look, CAD is investigating the company. Investigating the company on its very investment-like schemes. Which tells us one thing. If this is indeed an investment company, BYE BYE sunshine empire Singapore. So this will DEFINITLY close down.<br><br>MLM companies are only good for the minority, the top few. It will suck for the last few.<br>many also think this is a betray scheme for friends. Its like using your friends for money. But of course,i dare say that you guys are in a "partnership" to find more people and you are actually extending an opportunity to your downline. So abit of twisting of words and suddenly everything is going on.<br><br>So untill Sunshine actually builds anything under its name, This this is totally just a ponzi scam. For the meaning ponzi, google is your best friend. In other words, you are buying for your own PSP/HP or whatever with you loyalty bonus and you are the Bank of James Phang aka {BJP} instead of POSB or DBS. So...go find more info ok?</p>
