Since when did I say that anyone's convincing me to join their companies here? Nobody have asked me too, and neither did I ask for it.<br><br>How are you so sure that those people spend on liabilities because they can afford to? Hello. How much can you earn from MLM if it's based merely on your downlines and commission? It's variable.

This i have to agree, as it's what those un-ethical mlm agents does to keep their trade secrets.<br><br>However, regarding the debts issue, is covered briefly in Part I as per below.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Part I</span><br><br>in the past, present and future, we(applies to all people regardless of nation, religion, or races) have no control over the others on how and who they spend their money on.<br><br>many people just lack financial education, which is why Insuraces Agents AKA Financial Planners these days can earn a lot, but that only applies to the top 1% of the financial planners.<br><br>To be able to stay debt-free or be on a balanced debt and salary ratio, depends on how much the individual is willing to learn and change their spending habits, which is why even the govt knows this problem, but it's human nature to enjoy first than suffer later, thus that's the reason why CPF is a enforced issue to prepare for retirement, medical bills etc, even now can pay for health products and chronic medical bills.<br><br>Govt has aknowledge this problem and can do nothing about it since majority of the people can't be bothered with political affairs and have this 'Mind your own Businesss' attitude which is why they are closed up when it comes to money issue. It's my hard-earned money, you have no say on how i spend it, this the kind of pattern (even i sometimes do this) so it's beyond our control.<br><br>Only those who seek better financial education will do and correct their habits.<br><br>I'm seeking a better future, which is why i bother to look at all different perspective. (cause i want to upgrade myself; if there's anyone here who wants to upgrade or improve themselves, feel free to contact me, just to make friends and chat on general topics - it's better to stay with like minded people than to stay with negative people and end up being infulence into being negative)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part II</span><br>Venture Era's car incentive is no doubt a interdependent car ownership scheme whereby they have to either maintain if not increase their sales volume to enable them to attain their maintainence/upkeep of their cars.<br>Once the Car Achievers leave the company, they will have to fend for their own car payments.<br><br>Venture Era uses this method to hold the car achievers bind them/ have a bonding with the Car Achievers to make sure they earn money.<br><br>(in true fact) they are just making use of one another.<br>(in a much better term) they have this win-win situation on both sides, thus everyone can be happy<br><br>now for the corporate business car ownership scheme.<br>For CEOs, CDF, Top Civil Servents, Private Corporation Bosses and Top Directors, there is this car ownership scheme as well.<br><br>But this is when the CAR is UNDER COMPANY's Property, once they leave or job-hop to another company, they will immediately lose the rights to use the CAR.<br><br>Even in govt departments- SAF - there's a car incentive for those above a certain rank as well. I think should be from 3 crabs and above, they will get a car from the govt, so as to save their FACE. (as in one who holds a high rank should be able to afford a car, and not to use public transport)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part III</span><br><br>Even for Taxi Drivers, they are interdependent on each other. Same goes to Taxi Companies. They have to allow the taxi drivers to drive the taxis home if the driver is booking the taxi for whole day (usual practice is to share taxi among 2 drivers - one day shift, one nite shift respectively) so they can cut cost of renting a taxi. On average it's $90 (to taxi company) per half day shift for each taxi. [anyone can just go hop onto any taxi than chat with them, see what's their reply]<br><br>So the govt by allowing more taxis, they are able to collect more rent from (in the form of income tax from the taxi company).<br><br>So with more taxis, govt are able to earn more money. Due to every single taxi is their money tree - simply put it this way for easier understanding.<br><br>Taxi corporation is also a franchise business. This franchise business is interdependent on One Another. Cannot be unbalanced at all.<br><br>Rachel, did i miss out anything that you still have queries on?<br>I like to solve others' queries, it helps me in keeping my brain active in prime condition. Lol.</div>
