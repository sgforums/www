[this is to let clients have residual icome just be introducing products to their friends] and the agent will help them plan and place the products in a way to enable the clients higher refferal pay-out.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Point No 4 - <span style="color: red;">Pyramid</span></strong></span><br><br>Every Single Pyramid scheme will enforce the clients/prospects to JOIN THE SCHEME INORDER TO TAKE PART!!<br><br>For those people who knows that it's a Pyramid Scheme, but still join just to make quick bucks (often will give their friends a reply once the scheme is declared by NEWS it's a Pyramid/ILLEGAL SCHEME by saying - "Hey, I'm also a VICTIM HERE" [ but deep down, they already pocketd the commission that they earn, and disappear elsewhere already.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>MLM</strong></span></span> - Customers usually can buy the products from the agents, and the agents are more than happy to help their friends (clients) to buy and deliever to them without them signing up with the company, all they do is to buy the product that their friends want and have the Cash On Delivery system.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Point No 5 - <span style="color: red;">Pyramid</span></strong></span><br><br>Usually while in the sharing of the Pyramid/Money Game Scheme, the focus of the whole ideas and information shared with the VICTIM/Prospect will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>focus on TWO FACTORS; 1-FAST EASY NO RISK $_$; 2-YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING, JUST 'INVEST $$ SIT AND WAIT TO COLLECT R.O.I/DIVIDENDS'</strong></span><br><br>Sounds FIRMILAR perhaps?<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">MLM</span></strong></span> - The Agents will be able to promise them a certain percentage of commission pay-out and the pay-out is not very high, as it's the rebate that they get from purchasing the products. (Like NTUC/POPULAR Membership Card - You buy an item, show your Membership Card to the cashier, you get 10% discount [for popular ; products with Net Price are not included]<br><br>But for <strong><span style="color: red;">PYRAMID</span></strong> , they can tell you that you BUY this Item/Promotional Package, you buy 1, we give you 10 if not more when you made a purchase. IS it logical? - You <span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>buy 1 item and get 10</strong></span></span>, such a way to run Business = Sure Collaspe in No time. Take a Look at the Banks, if they can't offer High Interest Rates, than it's logical, as they are not playing our money with HIGH RISK STOCKS which can have HIGH RETURNS BUT ONLY WHEN CLIENTS CAN AFFORD TO LOSE, WHICH IS WHY banks CAN'T GIVE HIGH RETURNS.

I left because it was too stressful for me and the working hrs were ridiculously long.<br><br>As I see MLM from the company's point of view, please pardon me if you feel I am too 'pro' MLM. In a way, I am as I had to make it a point to know what kind of company plus what kind of business I was working for.<br><br>In my previous job, I had to interact with distributors and I met ALL kinds of people. In a way, MLM either brings out the best or the worst of people. Those who are systematically drawing a regular bonus cheque possessed the qualities I listed down in my earlier post. However, those anti-MLM members here have their reasons for being so against MLM. This I can understand as I have met decent people who were hoodwinked into joining a biz they have absolutely no idea what it entailed.<br><br>It is not so much about the MLM being a shady industry but rather, I must say, it's the people, the bad hat distributors who give the industry such a bad name.<br><br>Anyone can get into a MLM company if he/she is above 18 yrs of age. There is no discrimination on sex, race, religion, physical appearance, state of health or even state of mind! Sorry... there are ex patients of IMH who were even lured to join MLM...serious, not joking hor.<br><br>The emphasis of MLM is on equal opportunity for all.<br><br>So, along with the genuine entrepreneurs, we can expect Ah Bengs, Ah Lians, loansharks, drug addicts, the handicapped, gangsters sitting together with U grads, professionals like dentists, teachers, lecturers, etc in opportunity meetings. Unfortunately, it's not just the illiterate or lower class citizens who ignorantly mislead others into the biz. There will always be the odd numbers of professionals who use their intelligence to manipulate people into the biz too. It is the greed, avarice or sheer desparation of this breed of people that create their own MLM rules and most of them are top leaders too.<br><br>Please forgive me if I sound like a snob but I am not talking nonsense.<br><br>There are people who joined MLM because in this industry, recognition and awards are given for those who achieved a higher pin level. Recognition on stage is a very powerful and exhilirating experience for people who have never been appreciated in public before.<br><br>There are people who joined MLM because of the feeling of power. Power of being upline to hundreds of downlines - people who are total strangers but who belonged to his/her group.<br><br>There are also people who joined MLM because they can earn a side income, albeit not much, but suffice for them to pay for their children's tuition fees or pay the household bills.<br><br>Sorry...I am very long-winded.

I left because it was too stressful for me and the working hrs were ridiculously long.<br><br>As I see MLM from the company's point of view, please pardon me if you feel I am too 'pro' MLM. In a way, I am as I had to make it a point to know what kind of company plus what kind of business I was working for.<br><br>In my previous job, I had to interact with distributors and I met ALL kinds of people. In a way, MLM either brings out the best or the worst of people. Those who are systematically drawing a regular bonus cheque possessed the qualities I listed down in my earlier post. However, those anti-MLM members here have their reasons for being so against MLM. This I can understand as I have met decent people who were hoodwinked into joining a biz they have absolutely no idea what it entailed.<br><br>It is not so much about the MLM being a shady industry but rather, I must say, it's the people, the bad hat distributors who give the industry such a bad name.<br><br>Anyone can get into a MLM company if he/she is above 18 yrs of age. There is no discrimination on sex, race, religion, physical appearance, state of health or even state of mind! Sorry... there are ex patients of IMH who were even lured to join MLM...serious, not joking hor.<br><br>The emphasis of MLM is on equal opportunity for all.<br><br>So, along with the genuine entrepreneurs, we can expect Ah Bengs, Ah Lians, loansharks, drug addicts, the handicapped, gangsters sitting together with U grads, professionals like dentists, teachers, lecturers, etc in opportunity meetings. Unfortunately, it's not just the illiterate or lower class citizens who ignorantly mislead others into the biz. There will always be the odd numbers of professionals who use their intelligence to manipulate people into the biz too. It is the greed, avarice or sheer desparation of this breed of people that create their own MLM rules and most of them are top leaders too.<br><br>Please forgive me if I sound like a snob but I am not talking nonsense.<br><br>There are people who joined MLM because in this industry, recognition and awards are given for those who achieved a higher pin level. Recognition on stage is a very powerful and exhilirating experience for people who have never been appreciated in public before.<br><br>There are people who joined MLM because of the feeling of power. Power of being upline to hundreds of downlines - people who are total strangers but who belonged to his/her group.<br><br>There are also people who joined MLM because they can earn a side income, albeit not much, but suffice for them to pay for their children's tuition fees or pay the household bills.<br><br>Sorry...I am very long-winded.
