After 12 years of hardwork I am rewarded with mthly pay of $4.5K. Good pay good job right. Financial security right. <strong>My Axx. </strong>Why? I was ask to leave the company after my exiting contract ends, due to my medical problem.

We get the raw stock at very low price, giving us advantages over everyone in e area.<br><br>Then things start to fall apart, our fish seem to die every other day, in numbers. After investigation, we suspect someone has poison our tanks. Since then we lost a lot of customer, cos when they bought the sick fish home they die.

The biz mordel is simple but its not easy at all. We spent a lot of time on it n we r only manage to get $1-2K per pax per mth.<br>All building start from the ground, we r looking forward to build the biz to a greater height. So for ppl who think tat biz is easy n u dun need money to made money its bull Sxxt. Alot of hard work, n its a gamble of 50-50.<br><br>So how abt MLM?<br>I see ppl success and fail in MLM.

But since you asked, than i'll just give a example.<br><br>To know failure rates of each company, it's can be easily made-know.<br>Just constantly follow up on the updates of each individual company, and goes back to the mlm company (once in a year or twice a year) for updates - of course find different people to bring you there la.<br><br>Failure rates = copy cat.

So with that, he got all correct answers. [possibility of getting even higher marks than both (A) &amp; (B)<br>To be a good copy-cat, POSITION YOURSELF in a GOOD ENVIRONMENT [in class sit with smarter students] so when it comes to classes exams, they are around you.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Copy-cats type 2  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A silly/Dumb copy-cat</span><br>A student who knows nothing, acts like he/she knows every single thing or has the knowledge the size of an universe.<br>Since that student acts like he knows everything, naturally he/she will choose to sit alone, usually at the last corner of the room if not at the very side(near the wall) of the classroom and doing there sitting and TRYING to figure out the answer without asking teachers/lecturers. (Act smart - Smart Alex in other words) so this silly/dumb copy-cat than doesn't mind sitting with students of average if not below average results type of students. (save face - often this happens to guys to the Man's Ego boast during Puberty)<br>Than what happens when it comes to examination period?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> that person/student have no smart classmates/students beside them so even if they want to cheat by copying, they will also copy the wrong answers thus having low/bad marks when the result slips are out.<br><br>Very often you will observed that the rate of people turnover is tremenously high.<br><br>In here, i'm just doing a summary.<br><br>Often the failures/drop-outs in mlm are often those people who Try their own ways without much understanding, and break the rules of school/business.<br><br>MLM is a business school.<br>Business Aspect - You get to learn regarding business tatics and maybe even tatics to con people in, which i did learn in NT* previously.<br><br>You get to learn how to deal with people (with varieties of problematic people) in real short sum-up.<br><br>School - since it's a place whereby we learn and pick up new knowledge, those who refuse or reject the idea and teaching methods of a certain school can choose to drop-out or change schools.<br><br>If a student wants to score A* in their results like example in the O/A , GPA results, they MUST follow the teachers/lecturers/facilitators in that school.<br><br>So if a student doesn't follow and work hard by putting in effort to learn and practise the whole thing over and over again, will that student get good grades? - I doubt the so unless the person is a gifted, which many of us aren't.<br><br>How many of people out of a school can get to the top spot?<br>I'll downsize it to a Class Level. When you're in class, the top student of each class usually starts to revise their homework before the sch term starts already, while many are still playing, they are either hiding/staying in classrooms/libraries to study while others waste their time. (i'm one of those who waste their time in the passed)<br><br>Whether a company/product/upline is good depends on how an individual maximise the potential of the company/product/upline (often leveraging on their practical experience and mistakes learnt in the past)<br><br>So if you want to get the best results and in hope of getting/attaining success, find the right upline, right products right company with correct direction and leaders in it.<br><br>Am i correct to say so?<br>In a Nut-Shell, there's no PERFECT system/company/products/people.<br><br>I hope this is the balanced reply that you're looking for.<br>Any queries just let me know.<br><br>But for questions regarding choosing the right upline/product/company, i choose not to reply<br>Reasons:<br>1) no advertising allowed<br>2) i don't want to tee-down any company unless they really are Scams.<br>3) maintain my professionalism<br><br>BUT if there's anybody who's keen in finding out, i am willing to share, but of course - i will not tee-up the products/uplines/company like it's god, but rather based it on the observations that I felt when I visit the company, and you guys(those interested) can compare with what you see (&amp; observe last time when you visit the same mlm company) than you guys can make a decision if what i'm saying is logical and if it makes any sense or not.<br><br>as for the products - i'll based it on the market potential, the demand and the supply of course another factor to take into consideration is if it's unique or not. (this is the thing that makes money, and if it's useful, effective product, than we will have to take the business point of view to look at the certain product; of course including perspective of consumers and distributors as well to have a balance comparison.)<br><br>as for uplines - I strongly decline to comment, since everybody's method is different, so this is up to individual to decide who they want to follow.<br><br>my style is democratic, let people choose and decide what they want, rather than force-feeding people with what i want to tell them.</div>

Same goes to the boss of a big corporation confirm have a lot of factors to look out for - how are we going to present an idea/proposal to a potential client/partner.<br><br>do we know what they are looking for?<br><br>8-body language - what if a person is plainly not interested in you, but interested in the presentation or proposal of yours. how do you identify it and quickly act accordingly?<br><br>when a person starts to lose focus on the proposal, how to make that person in particular pay more attention to you/whatever that you're presenting (at the same time waking up the others as well) without offending ANYONE in the process?<br><br>9-brain - do we have the element of using our brain and think of ways to improve and upgrade on the products and services of the business and even expand or lead the market of that industry into another newer level?<br><br>10-identity - how do the customers identify the differences between you and your competitors?<br><br>what edge do you have over them?<br>how can you create and bring out the differences to them without offending your competitors (if handled wrongly, it might be settle in court which waste money)<br><br>11- positioning<br>where do you position yourself and your business?<br><br>12-target market<br><br>13-demand and supply<br><br>14-trends<br>is it a dying trend or is it a fade?<br><br>15-adapting or willingness to accept your idea or proposal or even product?<br><br>how are the consumers and partners able to accept your idea and make them buy your idea or products from you?<br><br>16-sales - what tatics do you have when it comes to doing business.<br>is it the same as the others?<br>any slight difference?<br>any major contrasting difference?<br><br>17-the people (your employees and your partners) how well are you able to work with them?<br><br>will they leave you halfway if there's some disputes over some issues?<br><br>some companies do close down over lack of support from the employees [if there's a massive strike from the employees]<br><br>the list just goes on..<br>with so many factors to consider when it comes to doing a business. how is a person able to do a business successfully without taking into consideration of all this.<br><br>i do have more points to look out for.<br>but do i need to?<br><br>those interested in doing their own businesses will find their own ways to go about finding their business partners.<br><br>what I've pointed out above ARE ONLY SOME OF THE SMALL LITTLE THINGS THAT A PERSON WHO WANTS TO DO BUSINESS SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.<br><br>there's a lot of factors to look into, but well..i can't finish the list..as there's new ideas and new things learnt everyday that contributes to the success of the business no matter how small the issue/problem is.<br><br>i'm not advocating that mlm is a must do, but compared to business and mlm, mlm is a very much simplified and easy alternative for the masses to join in and start building and learn the steps (choose and learn from the right company) to doing a business.<br><br>employee as a job is okay only for those people who are easily contented and leads a very simple ordinary lifestyle.</div>
