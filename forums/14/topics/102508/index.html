            <div class='col-md body'>Most important of all when you are looking to join a network marketing company, you got to take a look at the 4Ps: -<br><br>Products - Are the products life changing backed by clinical studies and R&amp;D<br>Potential - How many coutries are they in right now and what's in it for you?<br>Personnel - The vision of the management running the company<br>Plan - Is it a friendly plan and how do you get paid<br><br>My suggestion is not to look at one company and then decide if that is the company you would join but take a look at a few and make the comparison for yourself.  There's a lot of good companies out there, choose one that will work for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi the den,<br><br>there are too many black sheeps in the MLM industry and so be very careful...<br><br>The things to look out for are :<br><br>1) What is the cost to join? It MUST NOT be more than the cost of a starter kit to start your business AND do not need to buy any products in order to join.<br>Some perfume MLM costs like $1000 (they claim to be register fee + some products for you to try) to join, so you should avoid that...<br><br>2) what is the cost to maintain? NuSkin, Bel air i heard need at leat 1000 points to maintain (which is about = to $1000 or so)<br><br>3) the MLM companies should have written in BLACK and WHITE for refund of unused products. Many MLM companies claim to to able to return if you not happy but when u want to return, they find all kind of excuses. So if it is written in BLACK and WHITE, then at least you have a case if they do not honour their claim.<br><br>4) Look at their rewards plan. It is good?<br>a) If it is too good and fast, then something may be wrong...<br>b) can you overtake your upline if you do more sales than him/her? There are some plan that will not allow you to overtake NO MATTER how much sales you do. This is unfair.<br><br>5) Their products.... It is really that good for that price?<br>Also, the product must be bought on a regualary basis such as monthly thing. Why? so that you can keep earning points... for perfume MLM, it cost easily $200 or so, then how often do you need to buy the oil or lamp? It is afforable for most people? If people cant afford, you can earn points!<br><br>6) lastly, talk to as many MLM people as possible b4 you join. Compare their rewards plans and decide for yourself.<br><br>Hope all this infor will help you and do take your time ok?<br><br></div>

Again, like what he mentioned, the most important thing is to look at the company that you want to join and from there then decide what is good for you?  Always be objective and make the comparison yourself.  Although I am in a great company, I always encourage all my prospects to take a look and compare and let them make an informed decision.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi the den,<br><br>If can try to join MLM that do sales, if you wanna try binary that focus on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> network, please consider twice. MLM is a crucial choice! Choosing a good MLM company that will yield good results, like earning good money or learn something never taught in schools.<br><br>These will enable you to become rich, successful or both in the future.<br><br>Trust me, if you do not want to lose friendship or have attitute problem, please do not join NTIparis. They will TOTALLY convert your thinking! (From good to grave) They will, if neccessary, sacrifies your friendship with your friends or trust among them. They will make you control your friends and make them (not willingly) entrusted into you.<br><br>Some of my friends who stayed in this binary company <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> , about a year plus, turned into living dead. From their eyes you can see the differences. They actually devoted to their boss like an evil cult! Really felt so sorry for them. They are not earning money and behaves like clown in the company, but they do not mind. Worse of all, they have the thinking to kill their own parents if the boss want them to do.<br><br>So, den please consider carefully, if you focus on network and think using the power of multiplication(1-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;16--&gt;10millions++(after 30 multiplies). The distributer is more than the consumer. Sell something everyone needs it and you will never run out of comsumer.</div>
