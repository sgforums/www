            <div class='col-md body'>i m sure u will be against it....<br><br>i buy house from my friend... n refer customer to him... so when i deal with him... he is sucking my money... and his boss is sucking his money.... same goes wif my friend who deals wif him.<br><br>well then again when i start a business, i used to do CCTV business and my office dun actually need becos we got security guards dwnstairs... but then i also spent 1K plus install the system... so that my prospect/customer will be convinced...<br><br>i agree that most MLM will need you to buy a startup package.... same la... when i start my CCTV my supplier also ask me to install although not mandatory but i wont even know how the system works if i dun own 1....<br><br>i used to work with Panasonic dealer, the office is using Panasonic system, they cant use toshiba rite coz we as salesman must know the functions of the product.... NOTE: i am saying i am salesman, worker.... the boss must spend money to make money....<br><br>Like i say, when i selling cars.... i got tons of referral some buy some wont so wat as long as the network is there, i will got chance.... i also pay my freinds who refer comm... i am doing MLM??? answer is YES!!!! best part 1st broker refer the car to me its 38500, when i wanna make its 39500, lastly to the last broker its 40800 and finally to the buyer...this is broker style... we buy in car at 40000, selling at 44800, i earn 500 when i sell but referral got 500 car price remain.... simple???<br><br>When u find a PUB got alot of gals and happening, u will share wif your friend, but if u only hear say.... when u share u will be a bit reluctant as u have not seen, tried and never go b4.... so if u ever been there done that u share with enthusiasm and passion... u will convince ppl as u tried... on the opposite, if u go to a PUB that sucks, u will also share and convince ppl not to go....<br><br>I am not saying that MLM will affect ur life but its happening in our life everyday.... its that simple....<br><br>I agree some pdts MLM sell is overpriced... but not all lor.... Pdt sold at $100 cost only $10 rest $90 will be paidout to agents, but some company choose to pay only 30-40% of the profit to agent... but some will rather pay 85-90% to agents left 10% for company as company is looking at volume and not just 1 sale....<br><br>when i do CCTV i also overpriced... supplier to me $100 i sell customer $200 but salesman only get 20% of profit bcos i got overhead to cover like salary and stuffs...bcos he only worker, now this is just to let u know as worker u can never ask for higher comm cos u paid salary... only business owners can get the bullk but again muz bear overhead... think abt it... if no overhead can i say u sure make and wont lose money??? i use to bear 20K overhead last time but business is bad so i wound up after 1 year.... i got business but juz cant make enuff for myself only enuff to settle overhead....<br><br>MLM = Business w/o overheads.... nothing to lose... only lose time.... i agree the startup cost but if its ur own business u also gota dump in at least 30K for a business....some MLM ask u to put 8K/10K/16K its too big a risk as i never believe in stocking up.... i believe in using the product and then share with ppl... and buy as and when necessary... if a company ask to buy up position u gota be careful such company is confirm scam....<br><br>Cheers...</div>

More often than not ... ppl will trust more....<br><br>Some MLM are scams some are not.... its the black sheeps that destroys the mkt not the genuine ones.... like BINARY money game....<br><br>Well in traditional company u get pay increment very true.... but can u decide ur own paycheck??? No way u can get the power of leveragin ....only the boss can leverage on ppl like us salesppl.... 1 person 24Hrs he buys 24 X 10salesppl<br>he gets 240Hrs on his business.... he makes the most.... its not fair also but thats life.... 20%bosssess 80%workers....<br><br>Some MLM i agree ppl on top free then show face.... u also making money for him.... my boss same i seldom see him but i am sure after paying me the salary he still make.... but when i dun make "enuff" for him, i tio screw... MLM is i dun make $$ is my problem... no one can decide my fate i decide myself.... u can buay song ppl make ur money but when u work.... u know wat u sell ur immediate Mgr overides the comm???? well in my MLM company... my head keep planning for me to make money so wat if he makes my money i dun care.... if he make my money and i dun make money then got problem....<br><br>So far i am happy wif parttime MLM.... work as per normal... making $800 in MLM monthly with 3-4Hrs evening 4-5 days a week i find that its ok.... and best part i dun even need to sell as i got real life testimonial..... so ppl want to sign up....<br><br>Nowadays company are getting ppl to refer friends and relatives to join and once the introed person gets confirmed the introducer gets 300-500.... to get confirm for sales is that he made enuff for the boss not sure for admin as the theory of leveraging applies so he gets confirm then the confirm staff also wants 300-500 he will intro ppl in... CISCO is practising... is it MLM??? i do nothing to help the person to confirm and will try to keep him if he thinks of leaving but he will have to slog it out himself and he gets confirmed i gets extra moni....<br><br>Its happening everywhere.... ADT security system has a $50 referral scheme a sign up applicant refer successful deal gets $50 MLM??? Citibank once doing the car re-financing... intro a friend and get $50... MLM???<br><br>The fact is its happening ard us... but seems like no one complains leh.... U wanna say PV system.... well... i earn points by pumping petrol lor and buy stuff with my capitalcard gets cash back... refer a friend and get vouchers.... bring 3 friends to eat at a certain restaurant pay by my card i get free.... Dine 4 free 1.... MLM Network whatever...................<br><br>Cheers</div>
