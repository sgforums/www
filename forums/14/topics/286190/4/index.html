Then he will be taken aback<br><br>and u can continue on... The most important thing is to make sure u answer him in unexpected manners n keep talking so he<br><br>will feel confused n gong gong... once u can get him down to our office, we will surely be able to get him to join..."<br><br>205     "'I'm a legend.
