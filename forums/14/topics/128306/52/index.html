              <p>hehe i tried that on an EY agent, she's so desperate she kept saying dun worry we'll teach you. I tried saying I worked sales and sucke, my personality not suitable for sales... She still say dun worry, can one, they'll train you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best response when I said "are you trying to recruit me?" she said no. -_-</p>
              <p>Their typical tactic is to shoot whatever field you say you're in. They'll say your job is confirmed failure and things very hurtful. Haha.... Or just simply say you're in sales too, when the shoot you say you'll fail, kaykay say you're in another mlm company and yes mlm is a confirmed faliure. Hehehe</p>

              <p>2) when they bring in the topic n say they earning alot, u ask how much u earning..(they will say alot). den u say show me ur bank account or the payslip. they will gif u excuses.</p>
              <p>3) SLM?? not MLM.. i nv heard of SLM, only MLM. if is MLM den i dun wan to do. n SLM means single level marketing. so by this term, it means only one level earns. so y do u claim to be SLM but yet so many level can earn ur money?? isnt this pyramid structure n MLM?</p>
              <p>4) I m not cut out to do this kind. they will say they will teach u. n u reply- but u dun seems to impress me. didnt they teach u. if they didnt, y u will say they will teach me?</p>
              <p>5) I heard the pdts make in china. Cost price only $500. so y r u selling so high. trying to cheat money?</p>
              <p>6) R u sure EY is in DSAS? if not how cum u breach so many rules of DSAS?</p>
              <p>7) My friend in NUS. they say the cert not real.</p>
              <p>8) Is there any bad case or complaints afta using the pdts? they will say dun haf. then u say how u noe?? did u handle al the cases? i heard ppl complain abt the pdts n EY nv do anything abt the complaints. against DSAS rules too.</p>
              <p>9) no bad testimonials? which company will put bad things abt their pdts? so ur testimonial is not reliable.</p>
              <p>10) What r the side effects of the pdts? who can use. who cant. *take note of their ans cos not every1 can use.</p>
              <p>11) i heard there is a refund policy. so y didnt u tell me abt it??</p>
              <p>12) what level r u now?? wait i call n ask my fren first. mayb need do research.</p>
              <p>13) what happen if i take pdts n no effect or not good. R u goin to refund me?(voice record down pls)</p>

              <p>If go by the interest rate of $1 per month, i need to pay additional $100 per yr.</p>

              <p>xlazy,</p>
              <p>think sound like too. but u need know alot to counter them. so these kind of questions will arouse their suspicion but they will be so desperate to close u that they jus anyhow gif u an ans. so from the ans u shld be able to tell from right n wrong n take the next step.</p>
              <p>when alot ppl pressure u, u must be able to stand up n walk away. if they still pester u, dun show face, just shout loudly n tell them to get off ur back, saying loudly not interested in MLM. even if u r interested, will oso not join EY n walk off. =) i m sure afta u walk off, the person who brought u there will call u n betta to gif him a good lashing..</p>

              <p>I had wrote a nice post earlier but I got timed out. Here is the point form of my orginal post.</p>
              <p>-A company change name or close down doesn't mean they can avoid bad debts as replied by forumers. In sg law, even if a company declare bankrupcy, they are still liable for their debts.</p>
              <p>-You should confirm if this loan you had, is this an official AM company loan, or is a an "anyhow fake" loan cooked up by their members. From the posts here, seems like their members will fake whatever certificates, scenarios, etc to recruit to sell products.</p>
              <p>- If it's and official loan agreement, then you should had been notified by then company if there are any changes in registered address, company name, etc, since in the first place you would had provided your particulars. If not, then you are not at fault for not able to fufill the loan.</p>
              <p>-anyway, from what you wrote, it seems to be a fake loan.</p>

              <p>wow..</p>
              <p>QN: what is your pay</p>
              <p>ANS: less than 5 more than 10..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>haha so in the end did u join? did alot ppl come pressure u?? anw from wad u say, it sounds that they dun even noe much abt the product. n the cost price?? $500-$800 in china n they sell $1600 n they claim got quality?? they said that there is a factory in jurong that can verify that the magnets r more than 1000w or wadeva n they claim so too. but in the book it says that the magnets r only 800w nia.. so cant use 10 yrs la.. is only think 6 to 7 yrs if really so. tat time someone ask n they claim oh sorry i was saying the magnetic field is more den 1000w, not the magnets. lame shit. n refund policy?? they did not even wan to tell u.. it means that they r deliberately trying to deprive u of the refund so they can earn.. so unethnical. but u say VE worse?? my fren went to VE n his fren apparently nv try to pressure him unlike EY. his VE experience is so much betta den EY. n guess wad, one of the distributor who is serving NS told me that the refund policy u sign nv read arh but in fact they shld tell us. n when i say according to DSAS rules, u shld tell u. n he reply isit, no one told me n i forget to tell u too. den he claim he is not a distributor, he just under other ppl name n he jus recomment ppl in, nv earn. n he claims that he nv sign the distributor form. so in that case, in wad way he can recruit or recommend ppl? jus a trick to avoid getting caught by mindef n to avoid responsibility. boom his HP 81005247. DM Alvin Kwa. he claims to b able to drive a BMW since last june. but now he cant even pay for the wheel. </p></div>
