            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys, I think the reason why we participate is because many people just want to voice out our opinions. this is a free forum after all. well i think that if things are so easily solved by going to the authorities why are there certain companies still out there in operation? this is a place where they can view the general opinion abt certain companies and judge for themselves. also for people who have doubts abt what they are doing so they can approach people like you for advice what  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I have seen how they crack down on SkyBiz, Gold Coin, etc. First, you really need to report to them, then, they will have their way to get proof. People don't dare to stand out because they think the authorities can't do much. Now, if this company, example A start to have less sale, what they do is always change a name and move to new place, like this, they can always stand in the market for about 3 years.<br><br>I have been in NM for many years - near to 9 years. I have also been burn before, wasted Ten and Ten of thousands of dollars, till the time all my friends and family members nag and say I'm stuipt. I don't have a high formal Edu - only Sec1 and even did not complete it, so, you can see how easy I'm their target. But in my mind, I know NM works. So, beside like just nagging and vex my anger here and there, I started to take action whenever I came across any 'Praymind' company because it is illegal for anyone to get involve with this kind of companines. Also, I learn from Industry expert about true NM.<br><br>Is all the hard work that I have walk, till where I am today. And I'm happy to say that now, even if I join any company, all my friends and family will be more than happy and sign under me and work with me because, I no longer just nag, as this will not solve the problems. And the most important is that I have make some very great friends in this industry who are all very successful and very well-known.<br><br>So, for everyone down here, you think - Do you just want to nag, or will you really want a success in this trade? Do yuo want to be different from others who just nag or the one who take action? In actual fact, NM is about 100 years history, how many actually know it? The choice is all yours, and I'm just here to help, as I really wish to see more successful networker been born in Singapore, not always only in USA, UK, Japan, etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok then. astral amg (aka Enyouth now) became very rich from 2000 onwards due to the massive in take of students. A lot of them were gullible china students from polys. The SDM who started this wave, his name is lee boon keat, ntu student who was one of the early pioneers. though low profile, he was featured in the papers and the distributors made use the newspaper article  to recruit even more students. I mean, even a graduate will join, what about you? his results in school were pretty good too, it all adds to the tee up. Also, another group under kim leng brought in many ah bengs and lians, forming a beng-lian association  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> so they have 2 target groups - one is those who want to make good with little education, one is those who have education but wants success in another way.<br><br>However, it seems like kim leng was about to run off to Nuskin and he conspired to do it secretly. that was what i heard from the top people. funny thing is lee boon keat was the first to leave before him. his group vanished overnight. then of course AM started (da du zhen - firing poison needles at him) to 'bulletproof' the remaining distributors. then was followed by kim leng. last year, kim leng convinced boon hong and his group to join nuskin. ironic thing was boon hong was no. 1 in whacking kim leng and boon keat for leaving AM but he was the final betrayer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>so left max and group and a couple of china girls i believe now. they are apparently still surviving, and many are tricked into thinking that enyouth is a new company <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ahhh many details i left out cos got to sleep. but i think that if AM is so good, why would someone like lee boon keat want to leave? he was one of the top  (and cleverer) SDMs at that time. also same thing for kim leng (though i know he and boon hong were not happy with each other all the time) and he was 001 at that time. the reasons are very logical and i will reveal them in my next post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PonderingSoul:</div><div class="quote_body">For those who work in Enyouth before, Please share your experience with us.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>just a lil background about how i came to know about enyouth...<br><br>I guess i am just one of the fallen "victims". It happened yesterday when i met my friend for a supposedly "catching up" session over dinner. what was painted in mind was a whole lot of ctaching-up to do over dinner at one of the cafes along Clark Q, with the night breeze and all... thats it. Simple as that.<br><br>However, the unexpected happens instead.<br>when i met her, she knows exactly where to eat already.. she was like... hey, let me bring you to a cafe which serves home-cooked food. its really healthy eating and stuffs like that.. so i was thinking.. OK.. why not? so we made our way into a narrow street. Upon entering, i cant help but notice the many expensive and classy cars lined up in proper alignment along the pathways.<br>I'm just too amused by what i saw... those CARs... in these kinda narrow streets?<br><br>Ok..  then nevermind that... she led me into a so called CAfe... and honestly, it didnt appeal to me at all. all i could say was is....  hey... is there a better place than this?...but she was like its healthy eating... so ok... whatever...  and we dined.<br><br>so, everything was okay... till i realise how interconnected the cafe is to people. i was like... cool... people around seem to know one another. How cool... (only to know that the cafe is somewhat owned by enyouth- thats only after i left the cafe, stepped into the enyouth office... Man, i felt cheated...)<br><br>"A" came along and started talking to my friend and i... so i was thinking... such coincidence! so, ok... we all started talking.. but one thing i realise...<br>A tried to catch my area of interest and from there, zoomed in on whats gonna happen next... perhaps that was what A wanted or have to do in order to help recruit more people.<br><br>i tried to ask whats everything about. and all they could give was wait and see. then A continued talking nonstop..<br><br>i felt so intimidated because firstly, i have never been into this kind of situation before. Secondly, he goes on and on and on to talk about something which i have absolutely no clue on what the hell is happening. I felt as if i was a lost sheep. Very lost indeed.<br><br>Seriously, I feel the approach isnt right.<br><br>Right from the beginning, i wasnt even respected. I mean, i have the right to know whats going on. there is no need to beat around the bush.<br>the whole feeling, or rather, the whole situation is utterly despicable and disgusting, Sorry to say. Really... it puts people off.. at least to me, yes, it did.<br><br>then when we reached the office which, doesnt lool like one, A kept talking n talking... and before i knew it, i was shown around, shaking hands with people whom they deemed as respectable, reputable, successful and whatever not.<br><br>then  i was also told sales is only 30% of the entire thing if i were to join them. The rest are mainly focused in helping oneself to gain experience, expand social networks and all....<br>But hey.. think of it, isnt sales is like the main aim in order for one to benefit from all the incentives and whatever not given by the company?<br><br>i am concerned about whats really going on... i dont know much about enyouth, its background or whatsoever... all i know is that the last thing i ever want is my friend or any other individual to be blinded by the fame and wealth these successful personnels that enyouth has groomed. i just dont want history to repeat itself over and over again-tactics used to lure individuals...<br>to me, it isnt right at all, right from the start.<br><br>To put it bluntly, feelings have been toyed. Friendships are put to a test. There is utterly no respect for the person who has been "tricked" into having dinner, and into the company's premises.<br><br>Perhaps my friend has her reasons and perspective into asking me out for dinner. But, i have my own views too. Nonetheless, i value the friendship that stands between us. Though i might feel disgusted about what has happened, i must understand that we are all at a learning stage in enetring the society as adults in a couple of years. So, i bear no grudes against her. Everyone has faults. who does'nt...?<br><br>*sorry for the really long post. im really just concerned about whats going on.<br></div>

I mean, in other "normal" jobs, people also jump ship, complain abt welfare, talk bad abt company, dislike their bosses etc.... so i think we shouldn't read too much into this too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

A lot of them were gullible china students from polys. The SDM who started this wave, his name is lee boon keat, ntu student who was one of the early pioneers. though low profile, he was featured in the papers and the distributors made use the newspaper article  to recruit even more students. I mean, even a graduate will join, what about you? his results in school were pretty good too, it all adds to the tee up. Also, another group under kim leng brought in many ah bengs and lians, forming a beng-lian association  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> so they have 2 target groups - one is those who want to make good with little education, one is those who have education but wants success in another way.<br><br>However, it seems like kim leng was about to run off to Nuskin and he conspired to do it secretly. that was what i heard from the top people. funny thing is lee boon keat was the first to leave before him. his group vanished overnight. then of course AM started (da du zhen - firing poison needles at him) to 'bulletproof' the remaining distributors. then was followed by kim leng. last year, kim leng convinced boon hong and his group to join nuskin. ironic thing was boon hong was no. 1 in whacking kim leng and boon keat for leaving AM but he was the final betrayer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>so left max and group and a couple of china girls i believe now. they are apparently still surviving, and many are tricked into thinking that enyouth is a new company <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ahhh many details i left out cos got to sleep. but i think that if AM is so good, why would someone like lee boon keat want to leave? he was one of the top  (and cleverer) SDMs at that time. also same thing for kim leng (though i know he and boon hong were not happy with each other all the time) and he was 001 at that time. the reasons are very logical and i will reveal them in my next post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div></blockquote>Hi hellodoggy...<br><br>How u know so much ?? u r ex agent from there ..??<br><br>SDM Kevin Kong , Eugene also  early pioneers from AMH . they also leave AMH with boon keat to join NTI ..<br><br>now only left kevin kong 1 of his downline SDM Andrew Tay still in AMH Aka Enyouth .
