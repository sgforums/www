              <p>matress is scary SGD$1.6-1.8 for single size for queen or king better don imagine the price. can scare u off ! near 3k  go e-bay search, their magnet is stronger then EY and price is lower then theirs cos e-bay don need to feed their upline( so call SDM ) and e-bay don't need to buy car for those who sell more</p>

              <p>it their way of making business 40 maybe 40 is bottom line to earn more they go 53 or every wk they have diff price maybe next week is 70 liao ?</p>
              <p>ya i heard of the product is so good, but check on the internet and learn more russie using magnet technology and they do research on that they treat magnet like god .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so this is a good product i would recommend to my family member but i won't sell to them in another way i would go to some website to purchase which is more worth it believe me e-bay is selling below 200 sing dollar</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it a 53 dollar lesson if u r the top the system is alreadi auto pilot le ... if u bottom u have to struggle to become auto pilot, so in another way u work then slack and in the end they drive a car to motivate you</p>
              <p>they will say "keep it up last time i was like tis, i work my way to a car achiever "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so people out there if u willing to work hard and ask yr close relative or close friend to buy a matress PAD for near 2k single size, then go ahead we are not here to discourage people. but to give wise thought consider b4 joining</p>

              <p>Unknownbutme, have you actually approached EY admin to ask for a refund? You have been complaining about EY since your April posts but just as jus_me has asked you, have you actually made any efforts to get your refund? And then in your May post, you suddenly want to ask people to attend EY activity with you? And now you post in June that you and your friend need help??</p>
              <p>I think you are a very confused person. Here at this forum, a few of us have encouraged you to try to ask the EY admin directly instead of going through your upline but instead of posting back what was the response like, you disappear and we never heard from you about your refund case. And then you reappear in a post to ask people to attend EY activity with you. And when asked a direct question about your refund progress, you don't answer the question, even when you reappear</p>
              <p>After asking for forum help, you don't try our suggestion but ask your friend to turn to DSAS and then come back here to sob after a hiatus. And you ask for help again?? It doesn't appear like you have any urgency in your refund application at all.</p>

              <p>how much u spent unknownbutme ? if just a 50 plus just forget it learn from mistake and explore this market how it work learn some skill out of it since u pay the member fee alreadi</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u alreadi brought the matress i tink tat it le, the matress is F***ing expensive who care that it is proven by NTU student or NTU professor ... i rather buy cheap magnetic matress pad since it improve blood circulation only and it not every day have to use ... just like u being exposes to a room of fresh flower and do u have to breath the air every day ? the answer is no ... use it in a rountine and not every day if 1 day u don have the magnetic to support, what will happen u will rely too much on that ... just like computer u don need to use it every day. if u happen to use it daily, what will happen if 1 wk u cant use ... it the same effect</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh by the way DSAS makeing application for EY ? tat good ... they might as well adv on TV for their product then they sell their product will be easier</p>

              <p>Their mattress can be also bought from various on online auction. Usually, mlmers sold their unused product on online auction. Can get alot more cheaper. MLM are not advisable to join since 90% of ppl who join lose $$$.</p>
              <p>For those ppl who already been scam by mlm like Enyouth, you can to auction the products online at lower price to reduce your loses. Forget about asking for refund. They would be too cunning to allow you to refund. You ppl can still go to DSAS for refund. It may not may not help.</p>
              <p>Advise for ppl who still wan to join mlm:</p>
              <p>If mlm "business" so good, why do most mlm centers shrink in size or move for lower rentals? Why do mlm not dare to adv their products online? Do you know MLM products are actually products already sold elsewhere cheap? Most mlm product are something old. Do you know mlm products like magnetic braclets &amp; aromatherapy products can be brought alot cheaper in Europe. These are already old technology.  </p>

              <p>This is my advise to all ppl who are in Enyouth of considering to join Enyouth, this company is useless and no prospect company, it always make false impression that they will make it very big but end of the day nothing happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me cite u an example in 1998 i was once part of them and the ex company was called astral mag located in craig road, I that time was quite naive and fought hard for sales gradually i rose to the 2nd highest position, till then i was not earning much abt less than 1 k per mth. They always say MLM or SLM is the next big thing in market guess what 10 years later its still SAME !! Trash load of bull shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Always claim that you are your own boss no need capital start up to be your own boss, if one day the boss of Enyouth want to reduce the comission of agent you lan lan also have to accept, in their eyes you are just their agent.</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF you want to earn big bucks though education may not gurantee that you can earn alot. but if you are successful in what you do and have good qualification you will soar higher than in enyouth or any other MLM </p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Below is a newspaper article Abt MLM or SLM Scam company is DW group was set up by an ex employee from Astral Mag Holdings now turned into Enyouth . This MLM crap has been a occult wrecking and tearing down young ppl future. Enyouth tactics are definately the same as wat being mention in the papers</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sunday Times 25th Jan 2004<br><br>His teen daughter joins company selling 'biomagnetic' mattresses<br>She starts drinking, smoking and keeping late nights<br>Now, she wants to quit school<br>By Arlina Arshad<br><br>BUSINESSMAN Tan Pin Ho set a curfew for his 16-year-old daughter and made her sign an undertaking that she would not sneak out of school to work as a salesgirl.<br><br>Nothing has worked, laments Mr Tan (above), who has been trying to get daughter Yi Zhen to concentrate on her studies. -- ENRIQUE SORIANO<br>He even threatened to lock Yi Zhen up and paid $800 for professional counselling. But she dropped out after a few sessions, he said.<br><br>Nothing has worked and Mr Tan, 57, says he is at his wit's end.<br><br>Instead, Yi Zhen wants to drop out of school to sell expensive 'biomagnetic' mattress pads and comforters for a direct-marketer called DW Group.<br><br>She was 15 when she joined DW in August last year, on a referral by a schoolmate who is her boyfriend, and she has definitely changed for the worse, said Mr Tan.<br><br>She attends group gatherings and talks that end at midnight or later, wakes up too late to go to school, and once came home drunk, he said. And her grades have nosedived.<br><br>Yi Zhen says she can earn $100 to $200 for every item she sells. She has not sold a thing so far, but gets $300 a month in transport and meal allowances.<br><br>Mr Tan said he has tried to get the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the police and her teachers to help. He has even spoken to DW's bosses. But to no avail.<br><br>MOM said that a child may be employed if he is 12 or older in 'light work suited to his capacity'.<br><br>The Direct Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS) says that direct marketers should not recruit anyone below 18.<br><br>But because DW Group is not registered with DSAS, it is not bound by its rules.<br><br>'Whatever it is, there must be parental consent in writing,' said DSAS chairman Benjamin Tan.<br><br>Mr Tan Pin Ho never consented. He didn't even know Yi Zhen was working with DW till she started bugging him and their relatives to buy its $2,880 mattresses.<br><br>'She said she needed to sell one to get promoted to a 'supervisor',' he said.<br><br>'She used to be obedient but now she doesn't believe anything I say. The company has influenced her and she doesn't realise this.'<br><br>He and his wife got divorced in 2001, and Yi Zhen lives with her mother, a 42-year-old insurance agent who wanted to be known only as Madam Tay.<br><br>Madam Tay said: 'We split but that doesn't mean we don't love her.<br><br>'Her colleagues take her to pubs and she smokes. It's not logical that they're selling a health product and yet they do all this.'<br><br>Yi Zhen told The Sunday Times that she sees a 'future with the company'.<br><br>'I used to be quiet but now I can make my own decisions. I want to quit school after my N levels this year and do this full-time,' she said.<br><br>'I want to prove to my parents that 16-year-olds can make it in this industry.'<br><br>She said she goes to DW's office at Apex Tower in Anson Road at 3pm every day, after school, to set up appointments with clients, and she makes two-hour sales presentations outside until as late as midnight.<br><br>Sometimes, she said, she stays back to attend gatherings with the directors because 'I want to learn more from them'.<br><br>'It's not a must but the directors said I've been specially selected because of my good performance and work attitude. So I go,' she said.<br><br>A 17-year-old said he quit DW after six months because his father cut his pocket money and threatened to disown him.<br><br>He said his superiors would take small groups out to pubs in the Orchard and Tanjong Pagar area for drinking sessions, sometimes as often as three times a week.<br><br>'I'd come home late and fall asleep during lessons,' he said.<br><br>His sister, Miss Liu, 24, an administrative executive, said he spent so much time working and earned only $400 a month.<br><br>She said: 'These are just impressionable kids. They dress smartly and think 'biomagnetism' sounds professional.

Even if you were a graduate, you'd earn only $3,000 to $4,000'.'<br><br>She said she was asked to do a 'market listing' during a two-day training stint. She had to list of the names and telephone numbers of people she knew and specify if they were 'financially stable', 'generous' or 'supportive'.<br><br>Then she was told to make appointments with them, telling them she was doing a health survey. Follow-up action would be taken by her seniors.<br><br>She quit when she found she was spending more than she earned.<br><br>She said: 'I'd spend $200 on cab fare every month, going to meetings with customers.
