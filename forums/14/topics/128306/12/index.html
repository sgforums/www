            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, regarding last evening TV shown on Raymond (Enyouth), my personal view of the them driving CARS are as follow"-<br>1) To show to the people that they can have the car too if they do biz in Enyouth. It can happened if you work hard BUT showing car is not necessary in the program.<br>2)To lure people to join Enyouth......(if you do join, pls prepare to work hard. Its not easy at all)<br><br>I don't know whether Raymond has any affairs with any girls. I think the one who know the truth is him and the involve party.  If anyone of you can prove that he has any affair at all, pls produce photos, video or any type pf proof to prove that it is accurate.  If you can produce, we will believe you. If not,  it will be another hype, scandal etc from those who said it.... The reason why I am saying it is because, such "untruth"can happened to you too, in this case, I will want those who said that to prove too. That will be fair to you.<br><br>MLM is a terrible industry as they are too many people who are doing this biz in a stupid, greedy, show off, unethical, dishonest ways. This are the people that put people off.  Having said that, I would also like to commend those minority who did it rightly.<br><br>I have heard and seen many bad people in mlm.  There are so many complaints to CASE and so on. My question is "why aren't the government stop the industry"?  Why are there so many mlm books in major bookshop? Maybe one day the government and bookshop will realised that it is a stupid industry and they will close it. BUT, what if the industry remain open? So the question is whether the industry will improve or remain detestable to most people. Well, time will show.<br><br>For those who made any comment, pls be careful as your comment is easily track down.  Do not be involve in any trouble as it will not be worth it.<br><br>Take care.</div>

You need to understand one thing - how the Singapore government work and the thinking that goes into their decision making and policies.<br><br>A very good point is the issue of the Integrated Resorts. If you have been reading the newspapers, there are numerous objections to the setup of the casinos, notably the religious organisations. Even Lee Kuan Yew admitted as much he doesnt like it. Imagine the social problems that can be wrought by gambling.<br><br>But there is no choice. Singapore has to pursue economic growth and continued prosperity. Therefore they start to loosen things up - bartop dancing, neon lights, casinos, MLM. Even the issue of MLM is special. It was through intense lobbying by various direct selling companies arisen from the case of s888, not because the government had a sudden realisation MLM is a totally wholesome activity.<br><br>In short, it is deemed a necessary evil, but there is no choice. Whatever brings in the monies, it gets approved. So, its a profitable venture, but individual welfare? Saying that because the government doesnt stop the industry implies what?That the current situation is positive, and people are not really scammed, and all the consumers can go kiss arse?<br><br>Bear in mind majority of Singaporeans are not in MLM. Try to think of ways to convince people, instead of sitting around and saying, yeah in few years time it'll get public approval. It wont work if the MLMers continue to remain smug and self assured. Its a fallacy that things would go in one direction and all someone has to do is to wait for it.<br><br>Last three issues. More books imply what? Doesnt it mean people are jumping on the bandwagon and earning profits from book-writing? Detestability...well, over the past two years, i noted the anti-mlm sentiment has been rising fast...oh well<br><br>Oh, by the way, threatening lawsuits? Telling people they would be tracked down? Hmm, the usual things that fly around here but doesnt work. Really.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
