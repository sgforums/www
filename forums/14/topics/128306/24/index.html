            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by arily:</div><div class="quote_body">Seriously, I'm here typing my first reply. Is not to say whether enyouth is good or not. But more of. Why is everyone looking down at Network marketing.<br><br>Malaysia had been on network marketing for over 50years.<br>Amway had been doing for 70years, and can you tell me what happened in their first 10 years of operation? Can you tell me that all the people worked during that period actually stick to the company.<br><br>In this country. As long as the government didn't say "yes, it can be done" more than 70% of the people in Singapore will always say it's a scam. I really wonder. How people really succeed in the business world with such a mindset? What is wrong with Raymond? If he really is such a sucker. So what? At least he got people who believe in him. And he is earning freaking big bucks. The reason i see that you are flaming these companies is because you THINK and ASSUMED these companies will give you a monthly pay of over 2000 plus without much effort into it.<br><br>To all the people who are really wondering what the fuck is MLM or Network Marketing. It's just like franchising a product of a company. Just that you no longer have to pay for the rental fee of a shop, the advertising of the product. You just have to be a business man who uses the product. Then pass the good words around and people buys from you. Then when you start earning. You knows that this can bring food to your hand. You start bring people in. When they start selling like you do. You just got more food into your house.<br><br>Whats so hard to accept MLM? I strictly do not understand about it. So what they come up with the car incentives? So what with the title. It's just a way to make people who work there feel that there is a goal that they can achive. And not to just keep selling like a farking salesman. When first MLM came to Singapore. All you guys did was to say that it's another salesman job and all went "fuck off". Now that MLM is working for some fellow mates. You start saying that it's a scam. Cause some people earn enough from the business and left.<br><br>Seriously, when they left. i believe they don't "quit" the job. Cause in the end. If they have the mouse running below them. The pay cheque still comes. Why there's people saying that MLM are quick money. Or easy money. Because when you reach a certain level and you have a group of network down your line. The people will eventually start earning and some of the earning goes to you. Thats why they say it's earning easy money.<br><br>But you have any idea the time and money they put in before they reach that high? You think that the transport money, the food, the phone bills are cheap?<br><br>Plus, have you ever thought, why people want to join MLM. Because they know. if they work hard enough to build up a network of their own. They can start to relax alittle.<br><br>You try working for a company. You work like a shit dog and gets a few thousand back home. After 10 years and comapny boss says: " Hey pal, thanks for the support you gave me all these while. But i'm sad to say, you are too old to stay here. Please leave"<br><br>Do you see these MLM companies doing that? No. People who did get the people to support them. Join them. They earn big bucks. They think it's worth it. Then those who can't seems to wait for the ripe fruits to dropped walk away and start telling people that the trees there never drop a single fruits. It's just because you are seeing others picking up the ones that dropped at their side of the tree. IT'S luck for goodness sake. Can't you see? There are chances of earning money and hardwork to make. But what is most important is also the luck of finding the right people to support you in these line of work. There are people who keep having people banging their house door on their face. But they kept working and standing their ground.<br><br>Even they got flame by fuckers like you. They know that if they succeed, they are the winner. No matter how hard the road is. And you here? Hoping to walk in to the "big bucks" on a carpet pavement? No, the bigger the money seems to be. the harder the road is. So whats so "scamming" about these companies? They do not ask you to fork out a big sum to buy some shit. But more of asking you to be a customer. Whether you want to buy or not.<br><br>People like you who got convinced by them. Bought it in a "hot head", realise that you don't need it. Comes over here and start saying they are scam. So, i can say. Lots of girls can start saying that fashion shops are scam. They are cheating girls to buy clothes that doesn't even look good on them. Isn't it?<br><br>I don't even know why am i here typing all these. Maybe because i'm tired of seeing people who are spreading the words around saying that the grapes are sour, when they didn't even really taste it before.<br><br>Love,<br>Arily.<br><br>PS: I might not reply. But i'll try =)</div></blockquote>Good point. But how about companies like Bel'Air when you need to invest some 12k into it and still call themselves NETWORK MARKETING?</div>

In my opinion, MLM = Masses Lose Money.<br><br>I do know that people can make money in an MLM. But the question remains, who remains the winner? You or the founder of the company? If MLM is not a disguised pyramid scheme than what is it? A new marketing channel as claimed?<br><br>The issue here therefore is to question how these profits are generated. Got a great product? Let's sell it through MLM! But are all products really that great? If it is why not sell it in the "real world"? Why use students and retirees to sell your amazing products? Do ask yourself this question.<br><br>I await the day when PCs are sold thru network marketing, but I know that would never happen, because in this age of Internet and mass communication, the original function of network marketing is lost.<br><br>The real reasons that MLM still exist now is the pyramid system. The millions it can make for the founder. The product? Just a cover.<br><br>Regards,<br>BKKboy</div>

After you registered to be a distributor with CNI, you will pay $35.00 and get your distributor card, your business package with a nice CNI file, and a free box of health food which costs $36.00 (Retail price). Items sold are cheap items and daily used items. Cheapest: $6.00, highest: $1000. Eat, use, drink.<br><br>All distributors in CNI are retired teachers, middle aged uncles and aunties with experiences and during the training, there will be a professional  presenting with colourful powerpoint slides, no stupid handshakes like Enyouth and etc... At the end of the lesson, you will find that you have learnt a great deals about the products you are selling. There are recorded videotapes for those who missed those trainings.<br><br>I have friends from CNI whose daughter joined Enyouth and sell a few mattresses and did not receive her pay at all so the mother and father stormed down to Enyouth. My friend said that she is very angry with Enyouth for trying to cheat her daughter by not paying her on time.<br><br>Registration fees for Enyouth is $40 (more than CNI) and got no free gifts at all. Must wait 2 months for distributor card and business package which contained only a few sheets of paper and got no file. Person talking to me is a chinese girl who behaved like an ah lian and she keeps explaining things to me and keep rattling her pen on the table. I asked her questions and she kept telling me no, no not true, enyouth is the best on earth. Our boss care about us (if that's real, shit can be eaten, pigs will start flying and i will become an angel!!!) My stupid friend who recommended me into the tiger den always sit beside me and keep muttering yes yes when the ah lian talks.<br><br>At any part of the day, try to go to those coffeshops located behind, across the road and see for yourself how they behave. Hairs in outrageous colours, smoking, sit and shake their legs (girls also), talk and use vulguar language all the time, talk very loudly. My friend who has recommended me to join CNI is there to witness the whole senario and she has got this to conclude: bad organisation and no discipline in themselves, not professional and etc...  The friend who pushed me to join Enyouth resigned 3 months later because he did not get his pay on time and did not get the required attention when he needs help.<br><br>Those SDM, DM or whatever tua bai ranks they have always say they have got no time and are very busy with things and we need to call them and book a time slot to meet them. But i can see them sitting at the coffeeshops doing their tua bai business (eating, talk loudly, shake legs and smoking). &lt;--this one is their busy schedule???<br><br>They said they have a car's parade and drive together and can stretch for kilometres. No matter what, they still have got not enough cars to compete with CNI car's parade which can stretch twice than them and a lot of those top achievers in CNI got houses (condo and etc...)  , cars and overseas trainings.<br><br>*I will post more after i have recalled more about those incidents happening in Enyouth* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

Sorry, but you dont fit the bill as being credible. If you want to make yr point about yr company having a better work environment and inexpensive products, leave it for others to judge rather den badmouthing others.<br><br>It shows only yr lack of discipline and business ethics. WAS interested in yr low-cost health products, but not the corporate image, shud say that it was all thanks to you..
