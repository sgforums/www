Do something you like.<br>I've seen bankers quit their 5 figure salary to work as a chef. Ultimately what's the motivation at your line of work? Passion? Pride that someone appreciates your work? Excellence in service? Money?<br><br>Want to recruit people, at least target those who have interest rather than blindly pulling people who you barely know on the context of a makan session or a chat session.<br><br>Not only it irritates people and makes people hate you, it also portrays a very bad image about you, the company and ultimately the industry. That MLMs are very desperate and will use hard, underhand, unethical methods to recruit or sell products.<br><br>Like the guy who told an elderly man that Spirulina can be used to cleanse wounds, and caused the man's leg to be amputated (reported in news). These actions and such agents who lie, use deliberate misinterpretation and half truths deserve to be condemned, especially with sick people desperate for help.<br><br>F la, PLS WAKE UP! At least do something with a basic pay! Isn't it logic that at least a GUARANTEED income brings you more FINANCIAL FREEDOM? Retail sales (direct cust. contact) you get a basic pay plus commission. Somethings 1K or 2K guaranteed. It's ok to mlm part time, but don't do it full time. The rate of success is low. It would kill you. DON'T TELL HALF TRUTHS. Don't use hard sell, don't drag ppl against their will or by giving an excuse. Just tell straight in my face that you're gonna bring me to MLM office. Don't brainwash.</div>
