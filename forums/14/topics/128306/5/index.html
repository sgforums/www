            <div class='col-md body'>First of all , i would like to say is , believe and you will achieve. if enyouth cannot make it , how was it able to produce so many sdm and dm ? second , since those sdm and dm left , you guys won my respect but on thing i have to ask.. Did you guys regret leaving ? One other thing .. tho raymond lim sounds like an ass in this forum , he truely is someone worth learning from. He did make millions out of these years right ? Ask yourself again .. why did you join the company for those who leave and after leaving  , what have you learnt. isn't those experience worth much more then your so called 5 figure income ? Think again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">Very interesting! Too many post, and I never get the time to go through everything but I'll share what I know. First, A.Mag had been around for age...or I should say many years. In the past, Actor Kenway, a Singaoprean was also a Distributor in there.<br><br>I was not a Distributor there, but I know that this company had some inter-link connection with NOP - Number 1 Products.</span><br><br>Here some of the point:<br><br>GrimR<br>Senior Member<br><br>Send Message  22 April 2005 Â· 11:41 PM<br>Juz another MLM company that claims its magnetic beds cure you of this symptom and that illness. And even offer pills/medicine that cures acne. Apparently, most of it people are rather young, probably most of them in their early twenties. They even showed me a presentation of their so and so achievements together with ISO cert and they also say NUS got back it up somemore.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">You must understand more on the ISO stuff. Nowadays is 'quite' easy to get ISO for any company. Next, if someone claims that they products can cure, move on, and never take another look. Next, check with NUS, and see if they did allow this company to use their name for making any claims.</span><br><br>dranoel<br>Junior Member<br><br>for those who are flaming "RUN" pls answer the following qns<br>Have u been working in EnYouth before?<br>If not, how can u defind them as scammers? Is it becoz ur fren say so? Den did ur fren work in ENY before? Or they fren told dem?<br><br>If u did work in ENY, wat position did you held? How many days have you been to company? How did the company scam people? They didnt pay you? They receive money but never give goods to customer?<br><br>The products are certified by NUS report to be true. The system accquired ISO 9001: 2000. The company is protected by DSAS, Direct Selling Association of Singapore (awarded by government). How is this scam?<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Any company can be a member of the above you mention association. Next, believe Singapore will not award any company. Better take a careful look, or, maybe, careful with what you put out to people.</span><br><br>If you guys think mlm (and btw if u include ENY in mlm, tat means you don even understand how things work as ENY is a SLM, single- level marketing company) is immoral, have u guys realised that all of us are doing mlm everyday? You watch a movie, tell ur frenz its nice, ask them go watch, izit tat network marketing? In ENY, you try a product (which is 100% optional), and if its good, u tell ur relatives and frenz its good, buy or not is another matter.<br><br>If you discredit the questionablity of the product, may i ask are you a certified doctor or a scientist? Wat makes you so sure that the product is fake or out to con others? You used it? isit from ENY or other companies? If not, pls mind your words and stop acting like Mr-Know-Everything to discredit others<br><br>Flaming is easy on the net, you don't have to be responsible for your words but as i believe people here are educated and responsible, i wish to express my plead for the stop on these unfounded discrediting.<br><br>Any futhers queries can be addressed to me, will be willing to help out.<br><br>Last but not least, in everythin we do, there are people who make it, there are people who don't. In exams, people get A's and people get Fails. If you wan to get a A, you would obviously ask those people who got A's and how did they did it? Would an idiot go ask a failure? Same case there, no doubts there are people who don't make it, they failed only because they either give up or didnt put in efforts. Thus, they began enjoying defaming the company for scamming and such. Lets face it, man always put the blame on surrounding and never reflect on what they did. No efforts = no gain, isn't that right?<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Agree</span><br><br>Stop feeling skeptical and negative about ENY or networking as even the government is promoting it now. The world still turns without you. u can stand there 20years not turning with the world, come out of it to realise it changed alot without ur knowing. Anyway, juz giving an advice as defamation is against the law of tort in singapore. Your future is urs, nothin to do with me ^^<br><br>GL HF!<br>[This message was edited by dranoel on 2005-05-01 14:20:45.]</div>
