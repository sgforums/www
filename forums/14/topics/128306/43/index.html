Moreover, in most NETWORK MARKETING, only those people on top earn, for eg, a manager incharge of several downlines. Im sure the manager himself knows that only he will be able to earn much more, however he still encourages his downlines to recruit more people and to give them false hope/drive. Perhaps MLM is legalised, but what they are doing is unethical!<br><br>and in fact i think u are SUGARCOATING MLM. Alryte even if the products ARE good, think about the methods being used to sell this products. Hey and i have experienced these managers telling me 1 thing and the next when the truth is exposed, they deny it? surely this is very ethical uh? the way u are toking bout mlm reminds me of a certain dm who tried to make ppl tink lk u are now. bleah smooth talkers.<br><br>and also u are stereotyping ppl who say mlm are no good. Perhaps u learnt this line from ur manager who taught u that ppl who say mlm no good have never succeed/ppl who hear from ppl. The truth will always be the truth, no point SUGARCOATING.<br><br>lastly, how can u say fren jioing a fren down for coffee isnt cheating? Hes gonna get hes fren to be subjected to peer pressure from those smooth talkers, maybe u can say tts not cheating but tts a way of breaching trust.</div>

If you must I can answer your question. All religious texts say so.

            <div class='col-md body'>You say MLM can make you $20 000  a month, can early retirement. So I say you buy Toto, can strike $15 million overnight, just place your bet when the betting period starts.<br><br>So you can have immediate retirement if you strike 15M. You believe? But what are the chances of striking $15M? What are the chances of making it bing MLMing? The managers are earning all the money. You say MLM sure succeed if you follow. Toto, you follow sure will strike. One day. Probability of making it big?<br><br>You say probability big difference between Toto and mlm. So I say a stable professional career has a greater probability of long term success than a mlm employee. Companies can fire you or collapse, yes.

            <div class='col-md body'>Even a simple "you can make 10K a month" or similiar thingy would cause the seniors to erupt in hysterical clapping. Saying "you must be lively", all the 'motivation' thingy. They only motivate you so you sell more, so they can squeeze more money out of you. Tapping on the circle of friends and even some people having to put on an act, a false facade for a few months just to drag people in.<br><br>Forcing people to stay for a 'presentation' and a 'business proposal' with the Bodoh Manager who's only a year older than me and not even confident of convincing me. HA!!! Priding themselves with "we can afford rent at Shenton Way" crap. Typical also, LOTS of excuses i can think a million ways to shoot down.<br><br>Using old tactics. "You'll know when you get there" Bla bla bla... introducing "business associates" rather then "friends". I ask what business, everyone tries to knock the topic away or give vague answers like "you'll know later". So I sms-ed my friend and asked her to help me do a background check on the company. When I asked the 'Managers' they have this stunned look on their faces for few seconds. One agent Miss Hong XY said wanted to introduce someone to me (HUH?!) and I ended up sitting at some bloody seminar with hysterical people screaming, clapping at everytime the seniors say something good. How? I slipped away! Just sneaked off suddenly. Don't even bother paying for the seminar. Wtf? Earn 20K a month? When I asked Hong how much she earns, she said "forgot, never check". Hong gang ah! Dunno how much you earn? Or too paiseh to say? Or never earned anything?<br><br>Out to recruit me? Never.<br><br>"If mlm is not successful why am I still inside?"<br>If mlm is so suceessful where are there so many peple not into mlm?<br><br>"Start your own business"<br>So let me get this straight... I join you, a company, as an agent (yes you pay me by commission) to 'start my own biz'?<br><br>I know you can earn 10K a month. But who can? Only the uplines. Or either you're so capable of selling everything by yourself. Some of my relatives are in mlm and they're struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>There's an exclassmate of mine. He told us his friend told him to go MLM. He said he can make $10K a month, more than uni grad. So he quitted school, say school useless. Why study when you can make money. Can early retire. That's what he said. That's what MLMers always say.<br><br>Turn the clock forward a few months. He had left school to do MLM full time. He mad no money or less than $100 a month. And he's still inside thinking the can make 10K one day. He left school, now doesn't have a proper paper qualification... So much for financial freedom when you don't have the basic pay. And it depends on how much you sell. A monthly paying job offers me greater financial security.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>redstone, totally agree with ur posts. Most of us have nothing against the concept of the MLM system, majority of us have nothing against the products sold as well.<br><br>It's how Singaporean MLMers execute their recruitment and sales tactics which makes us concerned. Most recruits are young punks, brain washed by the seminars, getting psychoed that they can make it big without a proper educational certificate, when they're unwittingly getting used by their uplines to clinch sales to line their pockets. Which I believe makes up the majority of the MLMers in this forums.<br><br>It all boils down to one friggin' word to sum it all for this MLM phenomenon in Singapore. <strong>G.R.E.E.D</strong>. Never study, want to make it big ah. U guys think what? Ur grandfather's time when there's plenty of undiscovered innovations and vast opportunities?<br><br>Pls la, while MLM business plan is relatively new in Singapore, their products are not. What magnetic therapy sh!t. Unless u come up with some totally new innovation, like say, some high tech robot vehicle like the Transformers or whatever la, I doubt u guys can sustain ur sales for long. Dun say sustain until 60 yr old retirement la. Sustain until 30 to get ur 'BMW' also quite hard lor.<br><br>I also have friends who suffered after being in MLM before, as well as being duped TWICE to listen to their drivel, ONCE by a so-called 'friend'! Seriously, u guys, at least those who intend to do more recruitment than sales, spare a thought for ur family and friends la. Ppl who know me, know that I have no interest whatsoever in business, and yet that so-called 'friend' preyed on me. What's this? <strong>Greed and desperation</strong>.<br><br>And also spare a thought for urself la. U guys seriously think u would one day get to the '10k' salary mark with a BMW or 2? When u're giving vast amounts of the profits from ur sales to ur uplines? U guys always quote the dumb example of how ppl can't climb to the top of the corporate ladder in a normal business unless the present CEO dies, while MLM gives u the opportunity to thrive to be ur own 'manager'. I tell ya, it's the same in MLM, and I promise u the top managers and pioneers now WILL deter u from getting to the same position as them. Pls la, be realistic, which office doesn't have politics one. Everyone happy happy earn money together? Sheesh, wake up leh.<br><br>But whatever I say also no use la, judging from the few mths I've been in this months, u guys are totally into this dumb thing called MLM already. Whatever u do with ur life, I just got one advice lor. Trust ur instincts, know how to discern carefully and never betray ur conscience.<br><br></div>
