            <div class='col-md body'>@My SIM comment:<br><br>Sorry if I've offended anyone. But let's face the facts tt ppl wif not-so-ideal grades go to private unis such as SIM. Of cos' if u haf gd grades in poly or jc, and choose not to go NUS/NTU or even oversea top unis such as Harvard and Oxford, but rather SIM, it confuses me.<br><br>In no way am I suaning SIM ppl. It's u guys who tried too hard reading between the lines. Heck, my mum's ex-boss is juz a mere O-Lvl graduate, so I've alrdy learnt not to look down on anyone, since long ago. My big burly fren is in SIM as well, and if I offend him, I'll get manhandled.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>But speaking from a neutral, academic pt of view, wad do u tink of a foreigner who can only manage to enrol into SIM? Not tt gd right? As compared to a top China scholar aceing every subject in NUS to get a first-class honours?<br><br>As I say again, it's up to u guys to continue to hate me or not. If u take even such comments seriously, u'll probably blow up from an anger problem sooner or later. Then again, let's focus our attention back to the MLMers, shall we?<br><br>@Enyouth:<br>Haha $1000 note... Yea tt shld do the trick betta... And flashy cars...

            <div class='col-md body'>Where is it in my initial post, tt I discussed abt education institutes? I commented on it. And not even a direct one, at tt. It was an indirect comment on the credibility of foreigners seeking education in our country, and u guys were trying too hard to read between the lines fer some hidden meaning. 'Comment' and 'discussion' are very 2 different things.<br><br>Wad generalising view did I mention? Is it my opinion tt SIM ppl usually haf lower grades frm their JC/Poly than their NUS/NTU counterparts? Again, speaking frm an academic and neutral pt of view, isn't tt true? Then again, I mentioned, fer wadever reasons and exceptions, tt a high scoring person is hellbent on gg to SIM fer his uni of choice, tt confuses me. So tt's y I would like ppl to enlighten me on tis. Perhaps u're one of these few exceptions?<br><br>Dun get me wrong, as I said, I'm not looking down on SIM ppl. I'm juz stating facts. Of cos' it dun apply to the whole SIM population. Every community has its few exceptions. Even in NUS, there's a few ppl struggling in their schwork and not giving a damn abt it.<br><br>I typed my above post to clear the misunderstandings. In no way am I trying to put down SIM ppl, so I hope to appease those ppl frm SIM after my explanations. If u wish to carry the misunderstanding further, I can't do anything abt it.<br><br>I want ppl to focus back on Enyouth cos' tis topic is abt Enyouth and as u said, not abt education institutes, isn't it? I tink u're misunderstanding my intentions, yet again. I'm not trying to evade the issue. In fact, u wanna debate wif me abt the issue of tertiary education, I'm game fer it. Be it on this topic itself (but I tink not, cos' it's irrelevant, as u said), or PM.<br><br>If u find my post puzzling, I would oso find ur post puzzling. Cos' it's ironic tt u're a stoic believer tt forum posts shld be on topic, and u're diverting the topic back to the issue on universities. I've alrdy said my piece as above, and if u still feel unsatisfied wif my explanations, feel free to PM me.<br><br>I oso would like to bring tis issue to a closure. If I can get a little help frm u.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I said, it's only a mistake in ur eyes. I dun see any mistake in my statements. I'm not retracting anything I've said, cos' I tink I did no wrong. Perhaps the phrasing was abit off cos' I joked abt it casually, but it's not my intention to suan SIM ppl.<br><br>Errr hello? Tis topic is abt Enyouth and since we've alrdy digressed frm the original topic, naturally I would want to lead ppl back to the original discussion. Isn't tt wad u want as well?<br><br>Cover my original mistake? As I blardy said, I'm game if u want to debate wif me over tis issue. I hate covering up fer mistakes, esp. one tt I'm not even guilty of.<br><br>Feel free to post a topic in the relevant forums and 'invite' me there, and anybody else buay song wif my comments can settle there oso.<br><br>I luv writing long thesis posts. Forums are fer ppl to express their views freely. I wun force u if u dun feel like reading.<br><br>And yes, I'd haf enuff if u quit getting on my nerves too. It's so convenient to act the victim of my so-called 'long thesis posts' when u're the one fanning the flames.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree tt my original comment abt SIM was abit out of the line. It shlda been a little more specific to my original intentions. I would haf attributed it to being a quick post late in the nite after a hard day at sch. But then again, u'll accuse me of making up excuses to cover up my so-called 'mistake' again.<br><br>I shall say it for the last time. I.am.not.trying.to.lap.it.over. I said many times. U wanna debate wif me over tis issue, feel free to do so. I juz felt tt since tis topic is abt Enyouth, it's ptless fer us both to quarrel over trivial things and mislead the ppl in the discussion flow.<br><br>And pls dun link me wif those MLMers. It's an insult. Unless I mention any form of business strategy and display similar traits of misled and fake enthusiasm, personal character traits (or wadever u derived frm my posts) cannot be attributed to any certain grp of ppl. It's like saying a generalizing statement such as fat ppl likes to eat alot, when it could be due to genetic problems.<br><br>I've been engaging in such debates over the yrs eversince I've learnt how to use the Internet. And I'd always feel vexed when I get outedged by someone. Until I saw a slogan tt depicts a retarded child in the Special Olympics wif the slogan "Even if u win in a Special Olympics, u're still retarded".<br><br>I'm not saying u've outedged me in any way. I juz felt tt the forums is fer the ppl, and not both of us. So, fer the greater good, I'm apologizing to u and the other SIM ppl affected, on the basis tt I mentioned abt sensitive issues pertaining to SIM without making my intentions clearer.<br><br>If u want to take it further, I can't stop u. Juz rmb the slogan I've mentioned.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How do u define integrity? And fer those indirect sarcastic remarks targeted at me? Tt's ur kind of integrity? U harmed my integrity, I harmed urs. No net harm done. It's really not up to u to decide if my posts have integrity or not, since our judgment would be clouded as we're loggerheads at ea other now. It's best to ask a 3rd party. To quote ya "alas sad world".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I agreed I lack objectivity in my initial post abt SIM. But in the subsequent posts, I'm damn sure of my objectives. 1) Explain my intentions for my vague statement 2) Taking in ur sarcastic remarks and spitting it back at ya. Not focused enuff? Wad else would u like me to add?<br><br>Huh? 'Getting on my nerves' is a personal atk? Did I say u're ignorant, stupid, fat or ugly? No? Then where did tt come frm? If I feel u're getting on my nerves, then tt's tt. I mean... If I hate Coke, and a person keeps raving to me abt how nice Coke is, I'd feel tt he's getting on my nerves. But is tt a personal atk? No. As far as I'm concerned, I din say anything particular abt yo momma, or yo poppa... Ok u get the idea...<br><br>Now tt's a real personal atk. Saying tt my analogy of the Special Olympics is done in a bad taste. It seems u're not practising wad u preach.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thank you very much fer ur compliment. But it would seem tt way to u, cos' of the way u treat me. Honestly, I sincerely offer apologies to those SIM bystanders in tis topic if I offended them. As fer u, I'm not too sure now, after seeing how cleverly sarcastic u are in ur posts. I've offended u, and u've offended me, so who's right, who's wrong?<br><br>U can spend ur time at tis forums, trying to prove u're some god of debate or wadever. I shan't bother no further. As I said, it's up to the bystanders to judge us. And as u continue to digress the topic further, I dunno wad credibility is left fer u. It shlda been stopped right where I've offered my explanation. And if u're not selfish, u'd bring it to the PMs to settle any other differences u haf wif me.<br><br>I noe u feel tt my analogy of the Special Olympics is done in a bad taste. But yea, juz do rmb the slogan well and hard.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Edit: Totally agree wif redstone. Tt's the one and only issue I'm trying to drive it into his thick skull. I made a stupid comment. Ok fine, I admit. I've offered my explanation. Fine, keep it at tt. Anything else buay song, come to the PMs.<br><br>Juz as simple as tt, and he made winding theories of me trying to siam the flames, or 'justifying' wadever shiet tt I did 'wrong'. It's like... duh la... Trying to prove u're someone not to be trifled wif izzit? Before u judge someone else, try examining urself first lor.<br><br>Tis would be my last post abt tis issue anymore. Wadever outcome u tink it'll be, let it be. U happy jiu hao. Ciao dude!~</div>
