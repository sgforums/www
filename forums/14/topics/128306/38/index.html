            <div class='col-md body'>b]Dear jus-me,<br><br>Thank you for expressing your point of view against my post. Like what I have mentioned earlier, I may not be correct but I am simply just like the others, sharing our thoughts and feelings over here.<br><br>If me and my group of frens were not being 'invited' to hear abt Enyouth, I think I will not be bothered to post anything in this thread.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Jus- be :<br>COMMENT 1: Hmmm..

If you are so great, [color=red]you can create a team of your own that doesn't anyhow hurl vulgarities and conduct their business in an honest way</span>. (Does this means that ENYOUTH is not operating honestly? Hmm...)<span style="color: blue;">Show people that you can do it this way too, unlike some young punks.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">COMMENT 3: The people in the Company decides a Company's futures. Not the Company. Cause Company means boss, leaders means only a few. The rest are all distributors. Its the distributors themselves who make a difference, the Company can only enforce certain rules, but cannot go by force.[/</span>color]<br><br><span style="color: red;">Past Tense : </span>I appeal to be likewise. I understand that Astralmag changed its branding to Enyouth because there is a change in direction of the products that they are marketing. But again, what do you mean by setting up a new image? Or otherwise, if the company's reputation is good and is well-established, why do they have to demolish the name ASTRALMAG? I believe that the companies that I have mentioned in my earlier posts DO have new products coming, but why aren't they doing any RE-BRANDING AT ALL? Does it means that these companies are stagnant and are not improving in any of their launces of new products?<br><br>Also, <span style="color: red;">for any networker, a company with a CLEAR vision is very important</span>. If one company has experience in changing ownership or having new directors, how can one be ensure that the committment and time that he/she has put in will be returned? What happens if the company decides to have a change in the direction in doing the business? <span style="color: green;">The company and its leaders ARE the Souls and the examples for their distributors. </span>If you think the company is really that unimportant, then you are very wrong. All the distributors come in with no or little experience in networking and if the company and the leaders do not guide them carefully, do you think they will be able to operate the business by oneself and make all their way up? Networking is about GOOD teamwork. If the company and the leaders themselves are not setting good examples, how to help their assocates? All these have to be incorporated as ONE in order to make a difference. Anyway, the company itself is headed by living things. Which will still return to the importance of having a good company with quality leaders.<br><br>And yes, there are no perfect people around. I myself do make mistakes and blunders as well. But for your information, people are first misled by the advantages of an environment that a company can bring. Like what you have wrote, 'you can start the change from yourself'. In order to create an efficient and healthy environment, the people's mind must first be healthy. The company and their leaders will need to take up the responsibility in coaching their associates WELL. The relationship among the associates in a networking company <span style="color: green;">SHOULD BE </span>very different from the relationship we have with our colleagues at work. That is one of the main reasons why in the first place many are attracted to the environment that the network company can give them, isn't it?  Likewise, if even a few people that DO NOT operate their business honestly and behave in such attitude, the environment will get easily polluted. In that case, how will one's family and loved ones feel abt the whole business if their child was to get involved? That is why I STILL FEEL THAT having good leaders is as important as having a good company.<br><br>As for me, I have politely refused my friend for the invitation. Not because I do not want to give myself any chance in earning a residual income but the fact that he was not able to give me any reply for my request.<br><br>He has claimed that he is having a good extra income from Enyouth and having a huge savings of about $20k plus from the business. I just told him that he will have to show me his bank account(though its confidential) to make me convinced. But he answered me confidently that he will after I have joined. To me, joining him or not is just a matter of trust, I can trust him verbally that he is, indeed doing very well. But once I make up my mind and  decide to go full force into the business by setting my career aside, only then did I realise that you have been cheating on me...........<br>By then, do you think it will be TOO LATE to point your fingers around?<br><br>He kept quiet.<br><br>One word of advice. You do not have to lie to your friends or come up with any excuses. You will have to just express your sincerity and tell your friend how much you wish to go into the business together, hand in hand, and make sure you keep your words.<br><span style="color: red;">Lying will not get you anywhere. You will need to make up another thousand lies to cover up the first lie that you have made. </span>Likewise, when you are honest with your friends and family, at least you still have your <span style="color: blue;">integrity</span>.[/b]</div>

Thus the president/md of the company knows if they have the right people to lead by example.<br><br>With regards to branding, (no offence) but just a suggestions - you might want to learn more..<br><br>You have mixed up the difference between business/shop name and the meaning of branding.<br><br>Business/Shop name or Brand (example:Nike, Addidas) can be change as on when they like, but the branding is something that's more of like a goodwill (intangiable asset) built over the years, it's a recognition of quality service. (Example the slogan of different brands: Nike - Just Do it; Tag Huerer: What are you made of, Energizer-Never say die!) something like that.<br><br>A change in slogans often means a change in their style of operation, for example: Macdonalds, they usually change their slogans once every few years. Previously it's Good Time, Good Taste, currently it's I'm Loving It.<br><br>When slogans change, their style or theme of the business changes too, thus that's how they re-brand themselves to give their customers a fresh new image and to improve on their service as well.<br><br>You need to learn more and read more business related books, hint: newspapers is the fastest method to learn more if you know which newspapers and which section you need to read.<br><br>Reputation of the company doesn't solely depends on the leaders, it depends on every single person in the business/office/company. In tis case, it's an mlm company. A good reputation built over the years could be tarnish overnight due to a few black sheeps in the company, thus it's the leaders and the management duty to give the proper training and supervise them.<br><br>As for the younger distributors, it depends on their willingness to learn. If they aren't willing to learn, then it's only right that the leaders let the distributor know their reasons why some things are best done their way and not to let new distributors try and innovate their own creative ways which might tarnish the reputation of the company. It's mutual learning.<br><br>As for your last highlighted phase :"Who you follow is what you will become"<br><br>I don't agree. Unless you willingly allow people to give you orders, if you are, than you are not suitable to be in the mlm industry.<br>You only choose to accept those knowledge which will help you, and ignore junk knowledge imparted to you from either your frens or your colleagues.<br><br>If what you say is true than the whole world will be in a mess.<br>Coz everyone is pointing fingers to another person for their fault and pushing the blame to others.<br><br>If you want to improve and learn, you should not solely depend on your upline. You should learn on your own. Success doesn't means copying. But it means smart copying and to learn on how to leverage on one another.<br><br>I dont find their compensation plan attractive at all.<br>(my own opinion - subjective)</div>

You are right! I think their $40/ $70 is for their business kit. A pre-requisite to joining. A business kit containing the company's collaterals, policies, company profile etc.... BUT it is not a registration for DSAS!!!! As far as I know, DSAS never imposes any such requirement on members of their member companies. Only the company who is a DSAS member or anyone who wishes to be a member of DSAS needs to apply and maybe pay some fees but not this way. You can check their website for more details.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why your 'friend' is saying "yes yes yes" when somebody is talking is because he is:<br><br>1) Giving social proof<br><span style="font-style: italic;">if one or more ppl say 'yes', then it must be right, <strong>right</strong>?</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2) It appears to be a discussion when ppl are jamming your sense of hearing with 'information'.<br><br>3) Appealing to your subconscious mind.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">the human mind is very weak, in varying degrees, but still weak. the "dui dui dui" the fella says goes straight to it sooner or later, because the "filter" is bombarded by his 'friend' who is talking to u on a logical level (NUS grad vs dropout etc). kinda like, if u use enough ICBMs to entertain all the Patriot missile interceptors, the rest will hit their mark.</span><br><br>however, the above mentioned will not work, or will take a much longer time to work if<br><br>1) u r aware of this technique...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">personally, i like to act like i've been suckered just to see their reaction. i'd tell u how i spent one of my nights off (since my unit nights off every night) but thats another long story... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> oh, btw, dun luff, i ORD already.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2) u arent really listening <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>________________________________________________<br><br>i find that this company in question be more convincing if:<br><br>1) they dun have the same script to play<br><span style="font-style: italic;">everyone, <strong>regardless of rank</strong>, will say the <strong>same story</strong>. i find that this takes away credibility because it is too scripted.<br><br>kinda like regurgitating watever is in the textbook mindlessly pointlessly. the point is to share, from your own experience to cause people to join. if everyone shares the same analogy, says the same thing, everything looks suspiciously scripted.<br><br>sure, not all actors are created the same, few play the script well, some with more passion, others just needs more prac.<br><br>the first time watching the show, it was good, the second time OK... then it starts to look like everyone is a one trick pony.<br><br>but i like to act like i've been suckered so...</span><br><br>2) recruitment done in a proper cafe (Starbucks) instead of a coffee shop.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">no one earning 5 figure wants to go to such a place with <strong>so many flies</strong>, no aircon, dusty, sunny. which, btw is the only thing i absolutely HATE in SG. frigging weather sux to the core.<br><br>businessmen/women should know that their image is very important, that of the company even more so. getting recruits from a run down kopi tiam looks bad, and that is an understatement. how can anyone talk business there is still a mystery to me.<br><br>in fact, a company that is doing well, or looking for leaders, should place its advertisements on the papers, like conventional companies. or do their own headhunting.<br><br>NOT calling up their own friends under the guise of wanting to "catch up" with them for "old times' sake". subterfuge is a frigging big turn off.</span><br><br>3) if office is doing renovation, then find a better place to operate other than a run down kopi tiam.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">btw, even the SAF has enough common sense to break down the renovation of a building into smaller parts so operations will not be disrupted.<br><br>first, this level's department.. next here, then there so on and so forth.</span><br><br>4) enuff talk, show recruits the numbers<br><span style="font-style: italic;">from the profits this venture is getting... to paychecks... even your own updated bank account book. personally, i wont argue and join immediately if i see everyone's bank account increases over time to 5 digits. while spending money normally like a human being.<br><br>im not even interested in your car(s), it can be like wat the recruiter said, paid by parents, shared by spouses and the like.<br><br>bank book coz they can pool money and just dump everything in, later get it back. this way, there can be no doubts since the money is only coming IN and doesnt flow out suddenly.</span><br><br>5) selling better products<br><span style="font-style: italic;">how come u wanna sell some magnets in a bed i dunno. is there even a way to prove that the magnets are 1000 gauss each?<br><br>this company claims that the ideal biomagnet should have 550 gauss, this is nearly 2 times! will there be side effects? documented proof from reliable and established sources only, please.<br><br>i'd think that a direct sales company would want to sell products <strong>from established companies</strong> that everyone knows about to make quick n big bucks. not some unknown (pardon me for my ignorance) brands of magnetic beds. i mean, did ANYONE buy magnetic beds outside of MLM? i dun see them sold everywhere. even u sell king koil also better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br><br>6) how the company generates its 'hit list'<br><span style="font-style: italic;">answers to this are literally smoke and fumes. i understand that this might be classified "SECRET" (SAF term) to your company, but a rough idea would help. and come on, this isnt the first company to do business.</span><br><br>7) wat kinda company would be run by KIDS?!<br><span style="font-style: italic;">come on lah. do u see a 22 year old being a senior manager in the corporate world in charge of a couple of a dozen men?! i understand that this company is not conventional, by any means, but this seems a little far fetched to me that one can be in charge of so many men in a year or two.</span><br><br>8 ) proper rank structure presentation<br><span style="font-style: italic;">why stop at SDM? who is next? if CEO say CEO lah. even in SAF they also say General this n that wat, but not everyone can be General right?</span><br><br>9) shhhhh, dun tell.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">not once, not twice, but many many many times.<br><br>this is f-ing irritating. ppl like to keep their own counsel about things, thank you very much.</span><br><br>10) anti baterial, mites blah blah blah layer in the pillow/mattress...<br><span style="font-style: italic;"> best part... get ready.<br><br>pee on it already still no smell or colour! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>live demo please. i volunteer my piss.</span><br><br>admittedly, i think that it is quite bad of me to put some things on this forum that somebody i know personally, said. but wtf lah! one day, we'll sit around, talk crap together and luff about this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
