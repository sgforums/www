            <div class='col-md body'>My this is indeed an unfortunate incident and i give my heart felt condolences to the families involved.<br><br>Well, back to topic, I myself have been through the Enyouth recruitment process as many of you here have exprienced or read about in this thread, and I would like to give my 2 cents about it.<br><br>Basically, I have no qualms with any MLM/SLM companies, how they want to run the management of the company is entirely up to the top people.<br><br>But the main issue at hand is about ethics.<br><br>In business there is no right or wrong but it is all about ethics.<br><br>Is it ethical to "innocently" bring one's friend down to have a meal, when one's motive is not to catch up but rather to get the friend to participate in a supposedly good scheme ?<br><br>Is it ethical to tell first time distributors to get "selling" exprienced, by using persuasive means to sell a.k.a share of joy of the product to one's close relations ?<br><br>The above are just 2 examples which are are legally correct but just unethical in my personal opinion.<br><br>Also, I would like to add this as extra information for anyone who is below the age of 21 and was under certain influcences made to sign a contract.<br><br>I cannot exactly remember which statute this is in, bad memory on my part, but if you are below the age of 21, any contract that you sign is void if you can prove that the contract is not beneficial to you.<br><br>But, i guess most companies would not bother with the hassle of bringing a person to court, plus imagine the media attention it would attract it a case like this happens, way too much bad publicity in my personal opinion.<br><br>So, even if they pressure you to make payments, you can choose not to and they basically cannot do anything about it, if they go to the police it would most likely be brought to court (also cannot remember which court it is), and any sensible judge will question the need of a person below the age of 21 needing to buy an item ridiculously in my opinion priced at over $1,500. Anyway, the judge would also consider the atmosphere of when you signed the contract.<br><br>Anyway, just some food for thought might have gotten a little carried away, sorry for the long post, and for anyone that wants to join any MLM/SLM companies, good luck to you all, because like any companies around the world, there can only be so many high flyers, do you make the cut ? Are you street smart enough ?<br></div>

HOWEVER getting the money back from the voided contract will indeed be tricky unless you go hire a lawyer to persue the case, in which the cost does not justify it since the lawyer's fees might add up to the same amount unless you have a large group of people or are just out to get back at the company.</div>

The buisness practices are generally unethical and that the posts here serve as a warning as to potential pitfalls of the company.<br><br>Listing the price from Ebay as a comparison to what Enyouth sells shows the price disparity for a product. You have an innate bias for items sold on Ebay but most people don't. If the product is identical, Enyouth will have a hard time proving why the price difference is so large. Shipping costs are the same so I don't know why a commercial company can rake up costs higher than that of someone selling on Ebay. I am sure the Ebay seller profits too so attributing the difference in price due to profit is ridiculous. As for warrantee, who can prove whether the mattress is "not working" since I don't think the mattress works as claimed in the first place?<br><br>If you think there is no point in discussing the company, then you are depriving people of the chance to see both sides of the coin. What we have here is a system to balance all the one sided views presented by the company. And your assumption that the company is stating facts is simply out of line as I hardly see any solid facts being presented by the company after reading the forums for such a long time. The product was brought over from Astral Mag and if they are using the same "facts" I am sure these "facts" do not stand upon scrutiny.<br><br>If you attribute hard selling and mindless pushing of a product as a company's "attitude" and "tradition" and it "represents" the company, I'd like to inform you that it is a bad attitude, lousy tradition and bad representation.<br><br>Whatever is said here is open to debate and criticism can be both constructive and destructive, depending on the contributors. Given all the facts regarding MLM available from many studies, I can say MLM is almost always a sure lose thing for a large majority of people. Such an experience can be better learnt vicariously by reading all the stories of people being cheated and having failed at this "business venture".<br><br>How long have your joined the company? Perhaps you'd like to read this whole topic through to see the problems it has brought to the many people here before making statements like those you have just made.</div>

Without proper controlled clinical double-blind studies, there is no way to acertain whether the product works. Testimonials don't count.<br><br>The thing about some MLMs is that they insist that the people wanted to join but the problem is that they wanted to join because people did not tell them the whole truth when they joined. They made the decision to join based on what little information they had obtained from the person recruiting them.<br><br>I know certain people who have made lots of money from MLM. However, their conscience would never let them carry on as deep down inside, after seeing so many other people fail and him making money off their friendship, they quit too. And by the way I said it was unethical, not ILLEGAL so how do you sue someone if its unethical. You MLM people "dong4 bu2 dong4" also want to sue here and there.<br><br>About the price of the product, an MLM company is supposed to sell the product to his distributors at COST Price as stated under MLM law. It is hard to believe that the cost price is the same price that you are retailing the mattress for. DSAS is a group of MLM companies forming an alliance, not a governing body. Its like telling people to go to CASE to complain -- pointless.<br><br>Notes:<br>The only bio-magnets I know work are those used in MRI.<br>Don't assume your friend is richer than us.<br>Its UNethical, not INethical.<br>Comprehend is one thing, understanding is another.<br>I love stupid analogies. Firstly, some Ebay sellers provide warrantees. And for the price of 1 "normal" TV I can buy 6 "Ebay" TVs. If I trust the seller, why not? I dun buy things with warrenty, I buy stuff with warranty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"></span>Fuck.. today i had been duped from a friend of mine to go enyouth. why they never change thier method... stupid of me also.. haha but anyway, being a so called Ex distributor, knowing their method, i just play along.. guess it was fun. I met him at safra town club at the cafe. we were suppose to go for a show however he say he need to attend a morning grouping and asking me to meet him at 3pm at clarke quay mrt. when i heard this arrangement, i was skeptical. To cut short everything, we met at safra for a drink and he was askin me wad is my dream, talk abt doin business...etc.. i just knew it wad is goin on.. when he went to foot the bill at the counter, i saw a hp on the counter.. without him noticing i took the hp and place it inside his bag. after that we left, soon after i gave an excuse to him say last min got something on to do.. need to rush off.. he agreed.. while i "rush off", i quietly u turn back and hid at a corner. I saw him goin in to summer tarven and the next moment, saw the staffs of the cafe goin to enyouth. wow..they are damn fierce.. haha..after a while, saw that friend of mine proceedin to the cafe with the hp on his hand and he met the group of staff after returning the hp. Best part.. i saw he is being punched by an indian guy the moment they came closed. i was thinking.. great.. that punch is on behalf from me for cheating me down. saw him explainig to them and finally everything ended. Since no more show liao..  i went back home smiling to myself.. wad a day it is... hahhahaha</div>

If only you knew. You don't dictate when debate closes as it will never end.<br><br>Hold your horses. Just because I said that I din say its illegal doesn't mean that it isn't. $$ is more important? Hahaha that really shows you the mindset of MLMers. Its really sad to see such people expouse their immaturely misdirected materialistic ideas here.<br><br>I have ethical parents, thank you. We believe in honest money and a good day's work. I think you should go back to school and find a decent job to fund your MLM hobby.</div>
