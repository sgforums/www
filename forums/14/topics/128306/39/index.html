IS mlm causing u to be like that or IS ur own personal character that has the problem?<br><br>paycheck huh? so u expect me to give excuses not to show huh?? that a lame way to counter me. i have the guts to say what i have earn so far is equal to what i have invest. that means my product stocks reducing. which means i have no cheque btw but real cash back to my bank. so i breaking balance on what i invest.  put in $2000, ate $500 of product (family usage) and sell out $1500 within 3 months. so true.. i earning  what i paid including what is eaten of values. that is one of the most important part for MLMers . pay check  are only bonuses. ranging from 20 bucks to 400 bucks for 5 months. money too little on sales is just cuz my network is small..i only 5months into it and i a slow performer. it is tough but i like the toughness and the growing process.<br><br>is there anything to hide? no for me. by the fact is that It is tough.. i noe it  b4  i join mlm. TALKING TO PEOPLE IS THE HARDEST PART!! why it is tough? cuz i just lack of experience and knowledge, other then whining, i more then willing to grow on it. ..  IS There other stuff that is not TOUGH??? No such thing as get Rich Fast. THERE Is SUCH thing  as u are paid  in regards to what u are worth for etc  efforts, knowledge, results.. it a reality every where u work for.<br><br>kru, try to provide us with something we can learn from.. not your whines and protest.</div>

ON MY OWN ACCORD I JOIN IT .  FOR those of u that so weak and so afraid to be brain wash will always be weak and will be brain wash easily. like i said...  lol this show how lack of confident u have inside u, how much trust do u have with ur friends that they won't harm u..<br><br>LOl challenging me lol. ok i challenge u back.. want to come down and ask my downlines whether anot i tell them is it MLM  when i make appointment and they willingly come down themself? or do u need me  to even intro them to u? in my appointments i told them i doing mlm and ask them whether they are interested anot. of course 100 calls i got rejected 98 of them.. in my opinion, i don't need to hide what i doing or do some good talks onto them to make them believe.  they noe its mlm and come down to listen to the presentation. that why up to now my group is small and sincere people who enjoy the events and product and the system. people with open mind will see and judge themself. i really wonder how much really education in singapore taught u to become? kiasu, kiasee or even worse.. forever doubting.<br><br>u know.. u assume some truth about mlm and doings BUT NOT EVERY SINGLE ONE not everyone doing the same as others!! .. i don't do things out of my integrity including cheating  them to come down. no intend to do so. I still want to keep my friends. they didn't aviod and still willing to come out with me after i call them.  so what they reject me ? if because of that they break out with me.. that so thin of the relationship and i won't even trust them to help me if i got trouble next time.<br><br>For those of u being  con or cheated b4 . i feel sad for u.. really.. cuz that how thin ur friends think about the friendship between u  and him.. i trust all my friends and their own judgementations. they are adults and is their choice to join or not.<br>U can don't believe or not. u want proof , i can prove it to u..<br><br></div>

THE pple who can achieve something and make a difference.. DO THEY GET BRAINWASH By THE People around them cuz  PPLE kept TELLING THEM THEY CAN"T MAKE IT?<br><br>funny thing is.. pple easily let the bad stuff influence them like "cuz all my friend smoke so i was brainwashed to smoke as well. " " Oh everyone fail the subject so therefore i HAVE the Reason to fail (self brainwash)" or "I CAN't GeT A GIRLFRIEND because of 1. i ugly, 2. i not clever 3. poor etc ( lol omg.. those freaking self brainwash techniques)<br><br>YES i admit i being Conn.. I being Conn Into believing I can't get what i want, i can't earn what i want. i can't get the dreams i want?  i can't get the LIFE i want huh? So who tell those THIngs to me? Losers Who can't achieve any thing they want in their life. seriously WHY PPLE STRONGLY BELIEVE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM CUZ ITS PROVEN IN THE WORLD THAT ITS GIVE THEM A SALARY AND ALLOW THEM TO SURVIVE IN THE WORLD... goal? YEAH WORK UP THE CORPORATE LADDERS TO BECOME A DIRECTOR.  IN reality, one of u sit on that position, u know u kick someone out of that position. someone have to leave to give u that position. LOL<br><br>Those who are Achievers, will THEY TELL U THAT U CAN't ACHieve it?.. IT matter of Decision of your own to make it happen..<br><br><span style="color: red;">At this context, i tell u all above on what i got is not FROM MLM. IT  is the wisdom of  pple Who are Sucessful In their own accord, millionaires and professionals and THEIR MINDSET. I got the chance to hang around with them and learn from them. YOU can't LEARN THEM IN any FREAKING Books out There. </span><br><br>THERE both side of a coin. consequence is up for u to decide whether to take it up anot on either sides.  don't freaking blame on others  of what u are today cuz Basically U are the freaking one making all the decisions yourself, U DON"T LIKE IT, DO Something about YourSelf. until one day u don't own your Life(control your own enviroment, your own decision, your own failures). your not GOing TO GROW UP.<br><br>another thing. i have plenty of  opportunities to work outside like in MNC and oversea organisation . lack of money? lol not at all, and i don't lack of chances. i do this because the friend is my buddy and his trust in me to work with him. My team are also all my best friends. NOT every ONE Do MLM cuz OF GREED and WANT to earn fast bucks.  I like the feeling of doing things with good friends. how many things out there allow u to do that. Too BAD for u.. u probably won't be able to get this.<br></div>

If you went to his seminars, or read up on what he wrote (some of which are available on the internet), then why haven't you learnt anything, or made any changes to yourself yet?<br><br>By the way, it would help if you have a dictionary. You can call me an English Nazi, or whatever. However, reading posts full of grammatical errors and/or use of wrong words is very distracting, and as a businessman, you should know that image is very important. I mean, why else would people want to wear long sleeved shirts and shiny leather shoes in a hot and run down coffee shop right? Image.<br><br>I would think that it would be prudent for a businessman like yourself to brush up on your English, lest you be mocked by your clients in the near future.<br><br>If your proficiency in the English language is well below par, please allow me to suggest that you use <span style="font-style: italic;">Microsoft Word</span> to aid you. There is this function called <span style="font-style: italic;">Spelling and Grammar Check</span> bound to the key <span style="font-style: italic;">F7</span>.<br><br>I'd like to add that such sloppiness in language is unbecoming of a businessman. Other than the obvious reason of not being able to communicate your ideas coherently with people who are your potential clients, it does not reflect very well on your educational level either. This would in turn, cause them to ask themselves what kinds of, forgive me, rubbish your company are hiring should unforseen circumstances cause you to leave your current Network Marketing company in the future.<br><br>In addition, you would really look like a, pardon me again, bloody fool in front of businessmen and women in a business networking session where you would want to socialise with professionals of much higher calibre than yourself.<br><br>Among other minor mistakes, KrU used the word <span style="font-style: italic;">rebuke</span> not <span style="font-style: italic;">rebate</span>. Personally, I can't believe that you made such a glaring error that opens you to much mockery later on. If you are not sure of the meaning of a word, there is always Dictionary.com, or you can always use a Thesaurus should you find yourself unable to comprehend the meaning after reading long explanations.<br><br>If Eric Feng is your personal good friend, like what you claimed in another thread, please ask the Toastmaster to coach you in his free time. I would think that reading his material, and going for his seminars, would be a great waste of your time and money if you do not improve. I'm sure you can afford the money as it is extremely cheap; $20 only. I mean, personally, I tithe more than that. Therefore, paying that meagre sum of money would not be a problem for a Network Marketer such as yourself.<br><br>But the time could be better used to close a multi-million deal, right?</div>
