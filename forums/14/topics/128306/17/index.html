            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by <strong>Larelle</strong>:<br>For crying out loud...why would anione or rather any company wanna bother sueing an ikan bilis like you when they have so many people to care for and guide...if you wanna do then do...don't wanna do then just leave...that is what network marketing companies are about... </blockquote><span style="color: violet;">About "sueing the ikan bilis" part, I assume that you are refering to me. Firstly, I would advise you, Larelle, <strong>not to look down on others </strong>and be <strong>so rude as to call them ikan bilis</strong>. Anyway, yes I agree that Enyouth would most probably not be bothered to file a lawsuit for just a $1575 purchase. In the first place, it wouldn't want so much trouble and to attract attention because it is <strong>not exactly doing everything according to the law</strong>. What's with the shoppers form? So that it will not be caught hiring NSmen holding green ICs and underaged students to sell their products?</span><br><blockquote>Originally posted by <strong>Larelle</strong>:<br>with regards to wensoccerhonky07...you seem like you actually went to enyouth with a motive and that is to find fault and flame them....hmm...are you sure you are as professional as you sound? or you so called sacrificing yourself so that you can so called protect others....you remind mi of sumone i saw at enyouth that day...he was short, not exactly good looking at all...and apparently he was a beautician...are you that person? cos it was kinda weird if you are...i mean if you are are beautician...i would expect more out of you than walking around with your hands in front of you and bringing around a luggage?? my advice...i would not trust you if you told mi you were a beautician...i mean...where is the image? no style nuthin...i was like watching you from head to toe man...and please...no one carries a soft toy dice ard...if it is a lucky charm...hide it...looks kinda stupid and childish not mentioning retarded...no image whatsoeva....seriously...try to keep up with the trend...dress better...business people have to have an image too...people do judge on dressing and not how well you stand...acting like a goodie two shoes will not get you aniwhere... </blockquote><span style="color: violet;">You sound like you are from Enyouth. So what if he is really going down to Enyouth with the motive of finding faults? <strong>Are you guys afraid</strong>? <strong>If Enyouth is really as good </strong>as how you guys described it to be in your seminars and talks, then please work on it until there is <strong>no faults for others to catch</strong>. If not, please just <strong>accept your imperfections and try harder</strong>, alright?<br><br><strong>Who are you to judge</strong> others' appearances? No doubt there are many pretty girls in Enyouth, but are you one of them? Do you dare to put up your pic for all of us to judge? ok so let's just assume that the guy you are talking about is a beautician. Beauticians are people who help others to enhance their physical appearances, it is a profession, but whoever has put down a rule saying that they themselves must be good looking? Is it your business that the guy happens to like soft toy dices? Maybe that is a gift from someone special? What has that got to do with you? You do not think the person is not good looking doesn't necessary mean that other people don't know how to appreciate him like you, alright? Talking about business, whether his potential clients like his image or not, whether they want to hire his service or not, absolutely <strong>doesn't require your concern</strong>.<br><br>About my matter, the DM has stopped calling me so I should think it has been put to an end. Just a personal comment, there is a very flirtatious DM in Enyouth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I don't care is the person you are describing is wensoccerhonky07. Please stop acting like a bad child and commenting on others unnecessarily, simply because <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are in no position</span></strong> to do so. Grow up.</span></div>
