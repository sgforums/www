Who is the final guy to judge? I believe Singapore has something called the legal system.<br><br>Meaning only the courts can tell you, and the last buck stops there, what is legal, what is not, what is breaking the law.<br><br>By using the media, which are all profit making entities aim at get viewership rating and getting themselves distanced from any legal problems, as a some sort of a gauge of truth and lies, we are falling into a deep trap here. You are relying on people whose primary purpose is to keep the public entertained as a secondary legal system. This is dangerous. Its not their profession at all, even with legal advisors to tell you what is right what is wrong. And in the very first place, those solicitors are there to keep them in tandem with the laws and to deal with the company's legal issues. Its to keep them out of trouble.<br><br>Even if they sense something wrong with the company but is unable to produce evidence, and show the company in good light in their show, then your assumptions about them are nothing but a farce.<br><br>Another thing. Look at the great amount of discontent from ex company agents and anti MLMers. Lets now assume the company is not in the wrong. What is more impt now? Being evidently in right and dismiss all the grouses? This is what is wrong with many MLM companies i have seen nowadays. They are bad at community relations. They are so focused at being self assured MLM is the way and that non MLMers will eventually give in to MLM, that they forgot that it will all fail when non MLMers refuse to give up their monies or refuse to back down saying that MLM is evil.<br><br>Another thing. Stats to prove that by reporting cases to media it will readily get solved? And where is the logic, if people dont complain means there is no issue?<br><br>If you have already identify that these are discontent and rumours, you are not even worrying at all? Geez<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, each one has its own view and feeling. We can't say who is right and wrong as we experience different thing.<br><br>mlm is terrible to some, good to some and neutral to some. I do have friends who are not in mlm who feel that mlm is ok, some who are doing mlm (some terrible and some ok) and some who just want to kick mlm.<br><br>anti-mlm people are rising is a normal lah, and the rate of people liking mlm are also rising.  All this result are normal.<br><br>Whatever it is, if you are in mlm and u do it wrongly out of greed by compromising friendship than u r an idiot. But, if you do mlm and do it rightly by taking care of friendship than u will do ok.<br><br>Relationship is more important than anything else lah so is good that some of you here are doing your best to protect your friends.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey everyone. we should stop saying bad about the boss and we are going too far and too much. control about pls. we are here to discuss about MLM but not so much on their boss.(but i don't like MLM its just too stupid.)<br><br>okie firstly i really like what weijian said.one major thing why people thinkk that they are acemmers because, they  targetting the newly member's family member to buy first but they say its for experience.<br>one of my friend was in the other MLM company, they did ask his parents to buy for their first exprience.his parents don't wanna buy and they ask him to do it the second time.isn't this like forcing?<br><br>secondly, they keep saying you do this job don't have to spend any money but your family member buy isn't it the same as you spending money to get the promotion?you are just wacking your own ass.<br><br>Heartzzz said before is also ture lor.<br>"I really hate MLM to the core!! It realli shows the ugly side of humans...Although not all pple doing mlm is bad, but it realli shows how greedy pple r n how they can do everything juz 2 achieve their goals.... "<br><br>forcing people to buy things isn't it the same as robbing? its also force.<br><br>I am not opposing enyouth or any other MLM company but I just really don't like their ways.working in MLM also not a short cut to be rich or be a car achiever. but they make new members think that way.its just like asking people you know to have you invest a car.and even you buy 4D or TOTO you don't always win.10 or maybe 100 out of how many you will win?the won money also not even enough to cover your losses.If not singaporepools will be close by now.and there won't be so many private bookies for the police to catch.<br><br>okie MCS don't really work for free, honestly if not they will also close liao.everyone whould know this.<br>so think about it.maybe enyouth did something? i am only saying maybe.but i think he boss would be so bastard one la.since he so handsome.<br>one more thing. that show that interviewed the boss, they look for successful people during that episode.even what rumous or whatever, it didnt link to their shows topic. and the show didn't tell he is in enyouth even the boss himself also didnt mention anything about his company but just saying is a sales company.their interview also not in the company anyway.<br><br>what is that show's name? man o man. of cuz interview man.then interview successful man.<br><br>they purposely show the car achievers and cars cause of the show's topic, successful.<br><br>but it doesn't mean joing MLM will be successful. I think that should be all MLM bosses are diving those expensive cars to show their members about the car achiever thingy to make your heart itchy.<br><br>if you think that MLM can give you your brigh future, go ahead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share my personal story<br><br>I 1st went to AMH when its was at tanjong pagar at around year 2000. Think that time was just single story shop, not very big. That time they are not selling the beds yet, but some magnetic bedsheet which will improve ur blood circulation. They will 1st ask you to bend down to touch your toes, to see how far you can reach, then stand on top of the bed sheet for awhile. After that when you touch your toes again, you will find that you can reach further. Price of the thing, few hundreds of dollars. I did not buy cos that time I was only a pole student, so no money.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The 2nd time I went there was bcos of a girl (yaya, cos I want to get close to her, so i sort of join in) at around 2002. This time they move to eunos liao. What happened was what other ppl went thru. The coffeeshop beside the buliding become their meeting place. For my case, the group at there was sort of my sec sch grouping. All the ppl there join is friends of friends in my sec sch. The reason my friend told me was bcos they want to make the largest group with all sec sch ppl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I was kept there from around 5 pm to 1 am, all the time was telling me all the crap that you all should know. I joined bcos of the above reason la. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Then they will ask you the 1st thing to do is to make a contact list, whatever number you got, just write down and call them. And they will ask you dun tell them what is happening 1st, ask them out for coffee, then bring them to here.<br><br>The whole point is that they are making use of friendship to make you meet them. I have other sec sch friends who joined and msg me asking me out for a coffee. But I know that she just join AMH, so i refused. Its sad that 10 over yrs of friendship just can be just gone. It is making people hiding from you cos of this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Sorry for the long post here.<br><br>Btw, anyone here went the the movies LOTR: Return of the King, which AMH book the whole cinema at Shaw? I was thinking that time wtf, so rich can book the whole cinema down. Its was like 1000 over seatings hall lor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> So they are trying to make a impression that they are very rich, can afford to do this. So what are they trying to prove?</div>
