            <div class='col-md body'><p>If you are not going to ask the Enyouth Office to apply for a refund, how are you going to apply for one? Although you may think that the admin will "bao to" their sdms, but the reality is that as the employees of the company, they will process your application in due procedure as you make a formal request. As for whether anot the sdm involved is notified of the refund, i suppose he or she will be notified anyway whenever there is a refund application. It should not matter that you see the sdm in the office or not. You are applying to do refund and i suggest that you do it soon. letting the matter rot because you are shy is not exactly a good solution nor excuse. But if you relly prefer to go when there is less people, try going when their office just open, normally their office is quite quiet until evening time.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>So you need to quickly go apply and to present your case like you present to us here. They don't always go by black and white otherwise many refund cases would not be done already. Also, I think you did say that you haven't get products yet right? I think you don't worry too much first., go apply first. :) And I gather you have no receipt. Don't worry. Just tell the admin your whole story. They won't ignore you. But ofcourse they must talk to your sdm about the matter as you have no proof of purchase but they will get the sdm story as well as your story. My past experience with them is that they will investigate all applications and allegations. Good luck.</p></div>

              <p>Unknownbutme i think you should be focus on what you want. If you want to get a refund, why don't you just go ahead. The more time you spend here will only mean you get to file your refund later. Since you are convinced that your friend made a wrong recommendation and in turn cause you to purchase a product that you do not want than why are you afraid of everything except to get your refund back. And you are asking people in the channel to help you get your refund back based on a wrong decision that you yourself made (even if it's people who psycho you, you are still the one who sign on the dotted line and agree. i don't think they forced you with a gun) and for the past few days besides complaining about how afraid you are, you are not acting on your actions.<br>Please expediate and let us know if you are able to get your refund in the end. All the best.</p>

So, we sat down and from then till now, he still have not mentioned anything about job detail. Then, I ask him about the job details. He just say about the company, blah, blah, blah. Now, really 60% mlm feeling. At this moment, I was alrdy feeling uneasy. Finally, walk to the company, and immediately, I saw the word "Enyouth".
