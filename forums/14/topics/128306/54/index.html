              <p>I had wrote a nice post earlier but I got timed out. Here is the
              point form of my orginal post.</p>
              <p>-A company change name or close down doesn't mean they can avoid
              bad debts as replied by forumers. In sg law, even if a company
              declare bankrupcy, they are still liable for their debts.</p>
              <p>-You should confirm if this loan you had, is this an official AM
              company loan, or is a an "anyhow fake" loan cooked up by their
              members. From the posts here, seems like their members will fake
              whatever certificates, scenarios, etc to recruit to sell
              products.</p>
              <p>- If it's and official loan agreement, then you should had been
              notified by then company if there are any changes in registered
              address, company name, etc, since in the first place you would had
              provided your particulars. If not, then you are not at fault for
              not able to fufill the loan.</p>
              <p>-anyway, from what you wrote, it seems to be a fake loan.</p>

              <p>hi john,</p>
              <p>first i would like to tell u that under the DSAS policy, within 7 days u can ask for a refund with the receipt n the pdt is not opened. so in the first place, did the EY member told u abt the refund policy?? if not, they breach the DSAS rules. However, this chance is slim as ur receipt is already 1 mth old. i would suggest that u ask the distributor who ask u take the pdts but most likely no use. ask them for a refund. if they dun gif, report the case to DSAS. they will look into it. tell them tat EY claim they are in DSAS although they are suspended n u would like to haf a refund. they will bring up the case to EY. if not, u can try to bring up the case to CASE. Gif EY a time limit like 7 days to give an explanation.</p>

              <p>They have a refund policy.. but the problem about my case is</p>
              <p>I just put downpayment first without taking the product.. I put 500SGD.. the product is !,600..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They tell me there is no refund for down payment, that is common here in Singapore.. They tell me that any store here in Singapore pracrtice there is no refund for down payment..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They teach me on how can I get my money buy joining them again and sell there product then I can get the money.. Then I tell them I dont want..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They still claim that they are under DSAS few days ago.. but when I tell them I never saw there company name on DSAS, they told me that they are only under supervision....</p>

              <p>They never told me about the refund policy... they just bluff and bluff me.. Wah I also beleive them.. They even give a scheme that can be a Car acheiver in 9 months.. thats why im skeptical already.. but too late I put down 500 already..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They tell me they can give a refund If I pay the full payment.. but because I only pay down payment, there is no refund for that.. He tell me it is standard practice here in Singapore that there is no refund for downpayment..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont know also what to do if I complain to CASE, that's why im looking for someone to help me.. maybe someone also who have been cheated by them, who will file complain together with me..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some more they tell me when i was distributor that time that I will not get caught moonlighting because If they pay the paycheck to the distributor, The paycheck will not be name to the distributor's name but to other people's name.. Is it illegal?</p>

              <p>john,</p>
              <p>i haf filed a complaint to DSAS n they r looking into it. u can try to file a complaint too. btw they told u they r in DSAS but nv say they are SUSPENDED means they intentionally wan to cheat u. even under suspension, they r not supposed to say they r in DSAS unless they told u they r suspended. n since is 1 mth ago n they did not gif u any pdts, u can claim that no purchase has being made. they normally submit their sales at end of mth. so wad u can do is change ur pdts mayb to mp4 watch. can change one. den take the receipt to their counter n refund. 1st of all, if they nv gif u any pdt, means that the sales is not submitted so u can get back money wah. if they gif u prdts means they change ur purchase. ask them to issue u a new receipt n refund lor.. btw who is the person?? mayb i know him?? if u scared, ask all of us to go down. we here all veri justice one.. n u ord already??</p>
