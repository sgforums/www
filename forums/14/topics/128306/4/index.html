            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with MLM ppl is that they are <strong>super defensive</strong> siah, you tell them you dont think MLM works, they come back and bite you saying, <strong>" You never work b4 how you know? In life there are people who excel and fail, those who fail blame the company, blame the system, those who excel of coz say system can work. You cannot excel, dont say others also cannot."</strong> What's more, they speak in broken English.<br><br>Sounds darn familiar? The fact that these MLM ppl get so defensive because they know their system is inferior, if they dont protect it, no one will be doing business with them! If the system is geniunely good, there will be ppl queuing up to invest to the extend you have to start rejecting ppl. I'm sure you all know investment bankers command high salaries, every yr there are tons of top graduates vying for a position in investment banks, not the other way round.<br><br>These MLM ppl lose credibility when they keep insisting they are good. My friend from Enyouth can even tell me 50% of Fortune 500 Companies are MLM....Hahahha!! They will say anything to get you to join them. Oh my god, my grandfather is Warren Buffett!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, alot of the ppl working there have no experience in doing business, even if u join them to expand ur contacts, it's not much use. after u leave, u want to join up with ur ex collegues and do normal business, u still have little or no experience. the only experience is mlm - how to bluff ppl.</div>
