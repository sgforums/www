            <div class='col-md body'>Hohoho... Boar's talk? Now, tt coming from someone who's SOOO against personal atks, ur insult REALLY puzzles me. At least it's direct now. I need not rack my brain to figure out ur sarcasm.<br><br>I believe boars dun even noe how to talk. They grunt. Back to school, dude. Tt further exemplifies my pt tt u're one muddled fellow tt ironically contradicts urself.<br><br>Ummm sry, which argument did I not address? Ur subtle use of sarcasm is messing wif my brain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Perhaps I missed out a pt or 2? Tell me, and I'll gif u a satisfactory answer.<br><br>Escape? Where to? I alrdy explained my intentions and apologized to those affected. If u need further explanations, pls ask of me in a DIRECT manner, not sarcasm, thanks. Haf u even apologized fer digressing tis topic further?<br><br>It's u I'm buay song wif now. It's not even abt universities now. It's u and me.<br><br>Wanna talk, talk properly. U tink ur sarcastic remarks are veri impressive? Dun be one to be so quick to judge, bro. I dun tink u got the right to do so.<br><br>U tink I'm an arsehole, I tink u're one too. Leave it to the ppl around to decide who's the real arsehole.<br><br>Anyway, wad I was referring to was tt, u conveniently ignored my rebuttals of ur warped analogies and remarks.<br><br>1) Why put me into the same boat as MLMers? Is there a certain way an MLMer talks, eat, drink, pee, sh!t? If not, pls dun post such steoreotypical and generalising insults.<br><br>2) As some forum-goers are concerned, why didn't u bring it to the PMs if u realli buay song me, but further provoke me on tis topic? R u plain selfish? Or u're trying to prove u're some big deal tt I shouldn't trifle wif?<br><br>I juz wanna gif u a taste of ur own medicine. One-liner subtle sarcasm stings much worse than a random childish rant frm an enthusiastic MLMer.<br><br>U link me up wif those MLMers, I can do the same fer u, cos' I tink u lack integrity in ur posts as well. (Why u keep harping on tis integrity sentence over and over again? Zzz...)<br><br>Sarcasm and integrity shares a converse relationship. So for u who use heavy sarcasm in ur posts (not juz against me, I've noticed in other threads as well), I wonder how much integrity there is in ur posts. Hereby, contradicting urself again, not practising wad u preach.<br><br>May I say... Hypocritical? Call me a boar wadever. At least wad I say, I mean it.<br><br>Quote of the day: "Kiang jiu ho.
