Which other people that can earn a $80 000 a month will drive a galant? To be frank??? Speak with your heart. Young or not young I am not sure. Lets not say a extrodinary nice car like a 7 series, but at least what justify a biz man like how he protray himself. Comparing their monthly installment, i don't think the difference make it for investment also. Well at least something i can be very certain of would be when he is in Enyouth, he preach about his car too? Maybe i just dun like ppl bad mouthing about his previous "religion."<br><br>Indeed I agree with you that this boss of Enyouth is smart. But it will be better if he can give me one cos I love cars. Haha.<br><br>I totally agree with you that the position does not matter. More imptly would be to earn more. I don't know if SDM would be the highest position. But what i am certain of would be they sure earn more then the lowest position. Cannot be clerk earn more then boss ba??<br><br>Anyway, I like the way you rationalise the issue. I also have my point of view too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   Oh ya on the point of brainwashing. Don't be too hard on that word. Its just equal to understanding from another point of view. If i listen to them I am being brainwashed then if i listen to the forum of view from the other perspective? Am i being brainwashed too? I think just keep it cool la.<br><br>Cheers bro.</div>

For pple in EnYouth, they are not paid anything or basic just like you and yet they still willing to join and do, obviously this is brain washed!!!

There is no basic pay in network marketing in any of the coy. If there is a case where you don't recieve a payout, that would means that you are not competent enough.

            <div class='col-md body'>Whew.. Just finished reading all 34 pages from 11pm..<br><br>My experience is the same as most of you guys. Friend from school called me up, asked to meet up. Thing is, I already heard from fellow friends that that person is into MLM. I have joined Amway, but I really have no interest in sales, and last I heard, my another friend who introed me to Amway didn't really stay long either.<br><br>Anyway, back to topic. I knew what I was in for, but I just played along, having received the same 'brainwashing' before. Met at the coffeeshop (I can't believe I didn't suspect that the coffeeshop is owned by EY..) TCSS for a while, then proceeded to the building. Looked at products, looked at TV, went to another floor, got introed to more ppl. (Btw, heard that some of the CA buang their cars, so they're in the market for some new cars now.. Somehow, I find that extremely funny. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I got a license, and the thought of wreaking a car beyond repair is really heartbreaking to me..)<br><br>Managed to listen to their business plan. Noticed similarities with Amway. Alright, lose a bit more interest liao. Nvm, stay a while longer, see how they try to convince me.<br><br>Later on, another person was intercepted by my friend to stop and chat. Was told not to tell friends or family. Was even told to go online to search about EY, but was also told to discredit such stuff. Well, I can discredit feelings of (ex)EY ppl whether they feel happy or angry abt the company, but I can't discredit facts that was presented over the past 34 pages (especially abt seeking the refund; it was very intriguing to see how it worked out).<br><br>Like I mentioned, personally I think I'm not cut out for sales (cue the managers who will say "try lah, don't try how you know you won't succeed?" or "work hard now, enjoy later" that kind of bull). I'm just going as an end-user, to buy IF the products are what I need. At the moment, that is highly unlikely.<br><br>As for my friend, I do wish him all the best. If he succeeds, I'll be happy for him. One thing's for sure, I won't regret this "missed opportunity" and "once in a lifetime chance to be a pioneer".<br><br><span class="small">Oh, abt the chio bus there.. there were indeed a few *thumbs up*</span></div>
