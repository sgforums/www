            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ristar:</div><div class="quote_body">MOC, I'm not really interested in getting drawn into this flame war, however, Eric Feng, whom you support so much, said that <span style="font-style: italic;">wrong spelling</span> is one of the <span style="font-style: italic;">top seven presentation bloopers</span>. If you went to his seminars, or read up on what he wrote (some of which are available on the internet), then why haven't you learnt anything, or made any changes to yourself yet?<br><br>By the way, it would help if you have a dictionary. You can call me an English Nazi, or whatever. However, reading posts full of grammatical errors and/or use of wrong words is very distracting, and as a businessman, you should know that image is very important. I mean, why else would people want to wear long sleeved shirts and shiny leather shoes in a hot and run down coffee shop right? Image.<br><br>I would think that it would be prudent for a businessman like yourself to brush up on your English, lest you be mocked by your clients in the near future.<br><br>If your proficiency in the English language is well below par, please allow me to suggest that you use <span style="font-style: italic;">Microsoft Word</span> to aid you. There is this function called <span style="font-style: italic;">Spelling and Grammar Check</span> bound to the key <span style="font-style: italic;">F7</span>.<br><br>I'd like to add that such sloppiness in language is unbecoming of a businessman. Other than the obvious reason of not being able to communicate your ideas coherently with people who are your potential clients, it does not reflect very well on your educational level either. This would in turn, cause them to ask themselves what kinds of, forgive me, rubbish your company are hiring should unforseen circumstances cause you to leave your current Network Marketing company in the future.<br><br>In addition, you would really look like a, pardon me again, bloody fool in front of businessmen and women in a business networking session where you would want to socialise with professionals of much higher calibre than yourself.<br><br>Among other minor mistakes, KrU used the word <span style="font-style: italic;">rebuke</span> not <span style="font-style: italic;">rebate</span>. Personally, I can't believe that you made such a glaring error that opens you to much mockery later on. If you are not sure of the meaning of a word, there is always Dictionary.com, or you can always use a Thesaurus should you find yourself unable to comprehend the meaning after reading long explanations.<br><br>If Eric Feng is your personal good friend, like what you claimed in another thread, please ask the Toastmaster to coach you in his free time. I would think that reading his material, and going for his seminars, would be a great waste of your time and money if you do not improve. I'm sure you can afford the money as it is extremely cheap; $20 only. I mean, personally, I tithe more than that. Therefore, paying that meagre sum of money would not be a problem for a Network Marketer such as yourself.<br><br>But the time could be better used to close a multi-million deal, right?</div></blockquote>Cool.. finally something different apart from useless reply. English always at my own weakness in a form of writing. My strenght lies in Mandrain when come to writing and conversating. i still working on it.  I am more then willing to admit what written above by u. Then again.. one can speak and write good english but fail to deliver what they say.. do u  think they deserve a credit on that ? ...I more on a Do person. More actions then words. Which means i do what is promise and deliver an 100% action. i go for chances. i will find eric feng to train on it. that u need not worry. thanks for ur advises.<br></div>

FIND out ( u can always hold your decision at the end of the day).. listen to the good ones and the bad ones, and make a decision of your own whether u want to do it with your friends anot, with the mentality that u are willing to bear the conseqence (money, time, effort, bad comments etc) . And of cuz your friend join the bad one u don't join la.. join the one that the product they respresent and the reputation they have on the market itself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wa so fun ah, got MLMer here to entertain us! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Reply the other Enyouth thread leh. I wrote my experiences over there.<br><br>Omg, it's amazing how I went thru exactly the same shit tt u guys went thru. My stupid army fren whom I've not contacted fer more than a yr, suddenly kept bugging me fer a meal. I was like 'Eh, how come ur interest in me is renewed? Sth wrong mah.' Either he turned gay and desperately seeking a gay partner, or he wants to pull me into his 'business'. The latter turns out to be true.<br><br>We were supposed to have our own 'catch-up session' but halfway thru our meal, 'coincidentally', his other 'long-lost' fren was free, and he invited him to join us too. I still thot nth of it, continued having my meal, and the 3 of us talking abt uni and army stuff.<br><br>Then, I asked my fren's fren the qn 'So wad are u doing now?'. Frm there, they slowly got me into an MLM chat. Boasting that he's doing his own 'business' now, and my fren is his 'business partner'. Then he showed me his MP4 watch, said how cool it is, and the main pt isn't abt the video or audio, it's the strap tt 'detoxifies' ur blood around ur wrist. He showed me an experiment by pouring vinegar into an empty cup and wrapped the watch around it. He asked me to smell the cup after awhile, and asked if the smell had diminished. Wad bullshit, I still smell the vinegar alright.<br><br>They got me trapped for awhile, and tt guy went to ask his manager to speak to me, saying tt he's a 'respectable' high ranking manager, so it's my freaking 'honour' tt he's willing to speak to me. And I found out later that he's juz a freaking SIM year 2 undergrad la, not even NUS or NTU. I tink I dun haf to repeat wad shit they told me, cos' I believe most of u guys kena b4 oso.<br><br>U see, MOC, a big factor why we hate MLM is not cos' of the products. It's cos' MLM relies too much on social relations, most of the time in a negative way.  My fren has somewhat betrayed me, by not being sincere in his motives for meeting me after so long, and that he wasn't honest abt wad would happen. (fren 'coincidentally' free, manager 'coincidentally' free, telling me innocently he juz wants a meal to catch up with me)<br><br>It'll break the very foundations of ur social life. Sure, u gain some like-minded psychoed MLMers 'frenz' but really, they juz want to make use of u to earn more commission off ur sales. 'We help each other to climb up the corporate ladder' notion is bullshit. It's still office politics, juz masked under false friendliness and the MLM system itself which requires u to 'help' others in order to earn pts fer urself.<br><br>As for those frenz u grew up wif and went thru fire wif u in the past? One move u take wrongly, they're gone foreva. I, for one, swear not to meet tt bugger army fren ever again.</div>

"<br><br>however, we were given the freedom of dressing unless it offends the opposite sex, so i did not think too much about it. and last i checked, chicks digg guys wearing long sleeve shirt + tie + shiny leather shoes.<br><br>so we ate. then we talked.<br><br>then he kept talking about making his own bizness. initially, i was quite impressed because i was under the impression that he wanted to set up shop to sell products directly to consumers, and still make a tidy profit.<br><br>however something seemed strange to me. the fact that the price is marked up by everyone is because everyone is also incurring costs (logistics, manpower, rent, etc) while wanting to make a profit. but i reasoned to myself, maybe without the profits in between, u can sell with higher profits at a lower price at the end. and since it costs less than wat is in the market, u will break even faster.<br><br>then he asked me abt my opinion on MLM, and my world came crashing down.<br><br>being nice, ready to learn, and always curious about other peoples' reaction, and truthful at the same time, i told him, "as long as can make money can already".<br><br>then he started his MLM speech abt macdonalds, NUS, A lvls, blah blah blah, u guys know the drill and THEN he showed me his MP4 watch...<br><br>being an internet surfer, i know that theres a 4GB variant already (ENY one is 2GB only), but still, seeing it for the first time live, i was quite impressed with how much technology has advanced. then he made me guess the price...<br><br>i was stumped, im a person who believes that if i want it, im willing to pay a reasonable amount. so, i guessed starting from S$100, up to S$500 with a S$100 increment everytime. he said it costs S$488, but he got it for free because he joined the company.<br><br>then, instead of talking about the MP4, he talked about the FIR strap and how good it is... after that, he intro his DM to me, who basically repeated my friend's very very long script to me again. wtf. wasting my time. but i thought, "hey, this guy is my friend's IC, so i give my friend some face". and listened to the story again.<br><br>then, after this DM finished, he intro me to another 2 people who repeated the same script to me.<br><br>now, i kan cheong already, coz i have to meet my friends at 8pm.. and after these 2 finished reciting their dictation and introducing me to their products from heart (well done, guys, but i think that all are crap except the watch), it was 7pm already. i told my friend, "i have to go, meeting friends at 8". then they took out the forms for me to sign, which i didnt, coz i "needed to think abt it". yeah right.<br><br>then, he intro me to his SDM. wtf. still, being curious at wat their reactions would be, i let the SDM recite the same dictation yet again. but to his credit, he added some spices to his dictation that uses the "cat string theory". because i read up on the human mind a lot, i was quite offended.<br><br>they were using every trick in the bloody books to try to recruit me. if the company were any good in my opinion, i would want to join it. this is more like using heavy social pressure laced with mind tricks to get recruits.<br><br>i hate it.<br><br>throughout the multiple recitations of the same script my friend kept saying, "yes", "right", "agree"... however, i know that they were just trying to use cheap mind tricks on me and was quite pissed because if i were to join them, i'd be doing this to other victims. they said it themselves, if i were to join that day, i wont need to do anything other than say "yes".<br><br>w t f!<br><br>anyway, i looked at my watch and it was 1950hrs already but the SDM was still yakking abt how good the company is, he is drawing 5 figure pay blah blah blah.<br><br>so, i acted like i was psychoed by agreeing with the SDM dude and kept insisting that i needed to think abt it because "im new"... once his verbal diarrhoea ended, i quickly went to the mall to take a cab.<br><br>bloody hell, i was late.<br><br>the next day, i went back to the webby i first saw the MP4 watch and found out that the 2GB variant costs only $53.62, but no currency was stated. assuming it to be pounds, and all 2GB MP4 watches costs the same, it can cost only S$200 at most. bloody hell. the other S$288 for the bloody miracle strap izzit?<br><br>i mean, come on, my pair of Timberland shoes costs only S$250! S$288 for a rubber watch strap claimed to be good for health with no proof watsoever other than the "FIR" sticker pasted on it?!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> dun <strong>dream</strong> of earning my money. i'd rather buy another pair than buy anything from this company.<br><br>btw, they also claimed that each 1000 gauss magnet in the bloody bed/pillow they sell is S$40. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and they dun have any equipment to show that it really IS 1000 gauss.<br><br>assuming that they have an equipment that measures the strength of magnets, they cant show me because their office is doing renovations and all of them have to treat the coffee shop as their office. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>they also said that selling to family members, relatives and friends is just a "warm up". after that, the company will come up with a "market list" so that i have ppl to approach to sell the product. when i asked how the company makes the list up, they gimme smoke + fumes! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong>IMPORTANT EDIT</strong><br><br>i forgot something important...<br><br>if those guys my friend "introduced" to me read the story i wrote above, <strong>NOW</strong> and only <strong>NOW</strong> then u know why i never stand up when i shook hands with u when u were standing and offering your hand for me to shake. just in case u dun find anything amiss. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>the SDM's case is bo bian, coz there were no chairs there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
