              <p>"the moment you say a product or idea is good or bad
                                      to someone, it is considered multi level marketing."</p>
              <p>As other people pointed out, word of mouth advertising, or leveraging on social networks, is not multi-level marketing. Of course, you are free to define multi-level marketing as the equivalent of word of mouth advertising, but that's not how MLMs operate.</p>
              <p>What differentiates an MLM is the compensation plan.</p>
              <p>So to use the movie analogy, an MLM is when you get paid a small commission whenever you recommend someone watches a movie and the person actually watches it. Furthermore, when the person you convinced to watch the movie convinces someone else to watch the movie, you also get a cut. It's the multi-level compensation plan that makes an MLM an MLM.</p>
              <p>The multi-level compensation plan makes your cost of sales very high.</p>
              <p>Why do companies try to leverage on word of mouth advertising or social networks to promote their products? It's because word of mouth advertising is very effective relative to the cost.</p>
              <p>For example, in order to market the Wii, Nintendo decided to specifically target Alpha Moms. Alpha moms, as defined by Nintendo, were community leaders who were influencers in their local communities. Nintendo gave them Wiis and helped them organise parties where the alpha moms invited other moms to experience the Wii. So for a relatively small investment of money, Nintendo was able to reach a much larger audience of mothers. The alpha moms were not compensated for each Wii sold, nor were they compensated for recruiting other moms to promote the Wii.</p>
              <p>Perhaps before you post, you should reflect on whether what you say is a valid analogy.</p>

              <p>whew, finally finish reading 51 pages.</p>
              <p>anyway. i got trick once oso, same setting but my fren help me sneak away lol.</p>
              <p>i guess the problem lies in this.</p>
              <p>u know, actually the person who set the ranking system is quite clever.</p>
              <p>(if someone can share the details about how many points to reach what rank, i can explain better)</p>
              <p>if you buy a mattress for urself("self-test"). u gain pts and u will or might skip from the newbie rank to next rank. often they say they will help u pay 1st.</p>
              <p>higher lvl means more commission or compensation.</p>
              <p>(heard about this too)then they will tell u to try and search for 4 idiots, in your network, and ask them to join, using the same method. telling them that if u buy a matt for urself, u will rank up.</p>
              <p>so when 4 idiots buy matts from u, u rank up higher thus rank up faster,(i tnk a few rank is skipped).</p>
              <p>i tnk they purposely set it this way to attract ppl. telling them how it is easy to rank up. and so this 4 idiots, individually will find another 4 idiots or more to join. while more idiots join the idiots, more money for u. after u rank up so fast, the comission or compensation that u earn from ur relative and frens gets more too.</p>
              <p>mlm have gotten a bad name since long. so if i say "i got a job tat pays very gd. want me to intro? its a mlm company." most of u, ur very 1st thot is "no way, its a scam or a company out to scam ppl."(stereo typing, im one of them too) that is y they dare not tell u wad they are up to til they bring u there.</p>
              <p>when they successfully brought you there. its a half win battle. now only depends on the manager and the acting there to brainwash, pyscho, pressure you into joining them.</p>
              <p>well when i m ther, i feel like punching that guy who is constantly saying "dui dui dui", what a pet *#^&amp;@*#. he is also the one who ask me wad my future business plan are and try shattering it by telling me that his frens did what i wanted to do but failed. actually i also quite offended by wad he say. indirectly telling me i might fail cos his fren fail. i only can say that his fren is weak.</p>
              <p>whatever the manager say, about their plans, are really very attractive, but this attractions are only,i guess, directed obviously those who wan to be rich fast. the only one who is getting filthy rich and fat is the one who is at the very top.</p>
              <p>i dun see that doin mlm is wrong, is the most of the ppl  is doin it wrong out of desperation and greed. how they do it is also very unethical.</p>
              <p>sorry for my long post and my english.</p>

              <p>cool. cant w8 for tat.</p>
              <p>anyway. for the products they sell, magnetic stuff, i will only categorise their products with crystal, tianchu, clover etc. its all abt believing in it nia. magnetic stuff is or might be proven but not suitable for all. if it is proven, why i nver heard of any doctor recommend magnetic therapy to their patient.</p>
              <p>for testimonials, its rather simple. just throw several stones at a bull's eye, u sure to get one or two stones hit the target. u sell 20 matts to 20 different ppl. 3 return good testimonials, of cos u will frame their testimonials and display them. what abt the 10 tat complain and 7 tat felt nothing ?lol</p>
              <p>ppl that will buy this products, such as magnets, crystal, clover etc, would be those that are superstitious, seeking for fortune and very health concerned. mostly auntie, uncle, older age groups which in sg, they are everywher.</p>

              <p>I never understood the claim that all these products work - it's just that western medicine doesn't understand it.</p>
              <p>Big pharma and biotech companies spend billions of dollars researching into new products. Many of them are desperate to find new products to sell. For products that are not patentable, the generic drug industry is constantly looking for new products it can manufacture.</p>
              <p>If any of these cures work, would the medical and pharmacutical industries be falling over themselves to sell these products?</p>
              <p>The difference is that the medical and pharmacutical companies are heavily regulated and cannot make false claims whereas the supplement and psudoscientific industry can make whatever vague claims that they want.</p>

MLM in EY=lose frens,lose kinship,lose money.. now see wad EY ppl has to say b4 i report to DSAS.. i think they may lose their license. this kind of company, no nid to gif face. i think alot victims jus leave it without fighting. that is y EY ppl dare to continue in their ways..n for the pdts, they claim to be very good. when i say f is making things worse, guess wad the DM alvin told me. cant b worse, mayb is ur lifestyle. cos alot ppl use got good effect if not wont haf all the testimonial. den i reply him, which company will put bad testimonial?? now my case is bad, well i dun mind asking ard n putting bad testimonials in. den he shut up n say well if i really want to cheat, i wont cheat u only. n my reply-&gt; ya of cos not only me. u haf cheated alot ppl. if not y i hear so many case of u.. den nothing to say. n he refer me to higher authority which they oso dun dare talk to me.. all cowards. jus trying to avoid topic.. </p></div>
