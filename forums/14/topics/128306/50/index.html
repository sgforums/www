It's like saying. Buy some paints and canvases, go paint and sell your works for millions of dollars.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Brainwashed by greed.<br><br>EY all young ppl, 17+ to like 20+. Rarely see anyone above 40 inside from what I see. Why? Young ppl = more naive, more materialistic, more friends (more downlines!), more energetic, more daring (to cheat ppl). Also at the crossroads when they decide where to study after Os or As, deciding their future career. And here comes EY offering claims of making 6 figure income. Gullible and materialistic ppl cant resist.<br><br>Enyouth deserves to be condemned for their unethical ways.

            <div class='col-md body'>today i was tricked by my "friend" to enyouth. He say want to meet mi for lunch at clarke quay say long time never see mi want to catch up wif mi.<br>Guess wat? after eating at the infamous kopititam, a girl appeared started to talk to mi as if I know her. Next thing I knew is my freind brought mi to their base where their occult was - Enyouth (previously was astromag changed name due to bad reputation even change MLM to wat thing call SLM LOL!!!)<br>After hearing the SOP blah blah blah... what cars la...AUDI, MERCS, RX8 I say if u join work hard enough then the company will give u one of those LOL...<br>*Yawn*<br>say alot of crap also like who and who school dropout can drive mercs actually no need to study so hard. The girl (one of the manager heard from my friend) who "entertained" mi for that day claimed that she was from RJC previously and was SMU grad but chose to work there because she can earn more than what she can get outside. R u sure?<br>She even tried to psycho mi into joining the cult.<br>She asked mi wat I want to do in the future I say I'm going to study in Electrical engineering in PSB. She started to insult mi saying What i study is useless field never heard of PSB dun think its recognise University better go and check the authenticity of the cert they offer say what no future its a lousy University that only takes in plp wif lousy academics.<br>I was very angry and showed her my the other side.<br>I really feel sorry for those idiots at ENYOUTH trying to psycho plp to join them and those IDIOTS who "own" those flashy cars (they always park at the kopitiam"<br>I wanted to laugh at the girl who insulted mi, but my friend was there so I didnt.<br>I wanted to tell those ENYOUTH losers there that I came from a good family background whereby I can buy a ferrari to pawn every single one of them there if I want to LOL<br>I can say that I'm richer than the so called "manager"<br>Only low quality plp mix around with low quality plp. Sorry I am a high class plp so I dun mix around wif plp from MLM companies. I had already said goodbye to my so called "friend"<br>I think if I want to join those companies, I think I will join only if I got a criminal record and if the outside working society wun accept mi.<br>It's just like crminals can only marry prostitutes cos no decent gals will want criminals to be their hubby. so plp think before u join the MLM cult.<br><span style="color: red;"></span><span class="large"></span> ENYOUTH LOSERS R U READING MY POST UR ONLY A BUNCH OF LOSERS JUST LIKE CRIMINALS.</div>

The girl (one of the manager heard from my friend) who "entertained" mi for that day claimed that she was from RJC previously and was SMU grad but chose to work there because she can earn more than what she can get outside. R u sure?<br>She even tried to psycho mi into joining the cult.<br>She asked mi wat I want to do in the future I say I'm going to study in Electrical engineering in PSB.

              <p>I have a friend also being approached EXACTLY the same way what mlmersrlosers said. These people doesn't know what they are doing. They are just following orders. Someone had taught them the wrong things in a right way. MLM is not the only way to become rich. And they insult people's future jobs?? That really is despicable.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>People are fail in MLM business claim they are a scam, but to those who succeed, they are the one earning big bucks in the company. THe ratio of success people to people who fail is 3:7 therefore there isnt a surprise if they are a majority who are being sour and call it a scam and put a bad name to it. If you fail in this type of business, please reflect on why you fail, instead of flaming it. It is a platform for you to succeed, it is not a guranteed way to financial freedom, it depends on whether you have the flair to leverage on the system to make it work. With regards to distributor who lacks the product knowledge and give a bad impression that they only wanted to sell and earn money, these are the people who belong the failure type and thus, leave the business soon and join in the majority who claim it to be a scam as they cant succeed in this line of business. Are you one of them???</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If you are someone smart, you will not do MLM in a full time basis. You can always pursue your dream job and do part time in MLM as you are not required to report for work. It is a freelance job, how much you do, how much you earn. LIke i say, it is an opportunity for u to gain financial freedom. If you can succeed in MLM, then perhaps you can consider to do full time and quit your current job, at least even if you dont succeed, you still got your job, win win situation, it is a chance to try out to see if you can break free from the rat race, if you dont have the talent, at least dont be a sour grape. It is a chance for you to try, dont try liao cannot work then deny people of the chance of making money. Be responsible with your words, if you had succeeded in it, i dont even think u will claim it is a scam. Who would want to break their own rice bowl, in other country, MLM is a career to some people. But it seems that our highly educated singaporean friends here are trying to be too smart, anything not good for them, they will spread it like wildfire ... come to think of it, aint you promoting MLM now ?? telling people how bad it is to join MLM ? isnt it the same ? if you can be so good in scaming it and getting people to believe you, why not instead make it positive and you will be earning big bucks instead complaining here in forum everyday without a penny earn. Be smart, but not in a wrong way.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Just incase you guys are curious, i m not from any MLM company. I m in the casino business but i fully understand how MLM works. In my view, i cannot say it is a sure way of earning money but it is indeed a type of business which gives u an opportunity to earn big money. It is a relatively young business model which have room for potential. The next IMF will be discussion on direct sales about MLM. It is going to be a trend in future in all countries. One word of advice, if you want to be rich, now is the time to try and see if it work out for u, once the pioneer period is gone, your potential income will be diminishing. You live only once, you get opportunity once in a lifetime, dont miss it. Just dont be sourgrapes like majority of the people here when they fail, it just reflect your attitude in life and your work ettiquette. These are the people when they fail, they always want others to fail with them, therefore denying people with potential to succeed, i call them selfish people. They will always be in the lower level tier of whichever job they do. Be generous and unselfish, that is how you can succeed in life. My 2 cents worth of comments.</p></div>

              <p>In my opinion, MLM is a gd way to earn extra income, or even financial freedom. It has been done but the rate is very very low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I disagree that MLM is a scam, it's the UNETHICAL agents methodology is a scam...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those who claim that their were tricked into joining etc. Why did u join if u didnt believe them... All these agents claim scam wen they join were those who used to be on of them...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'MLM destroy family ties, kinship etc' why ar? Isint it becoz they themselves never take care of their own customers, friends, relatives etc. in terms of making sure there's no misunderstanding &amp; making sure that ur related customers r satisfied with ur product or service. It's ur actions that make ur relatives far away from u wat. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/angry.png" alt="angry.png"> Blame the co. wen family relationship turns bad. arent ur families YOUR customers?</p>
