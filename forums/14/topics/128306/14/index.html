ITS A SLM co. runs of the same system as insurance companies. NO IT DOESN CHEAT N THUS IT IS NOT A CON COMPANY. we're iso 9001:2000 certified if tt doesn help, its a cert awarded to companies who'vce achieved a good system whereby their ppl are properly managed. on top of tt, we're also an active member of DSAS. we've been for the past 6years n we still r. reason being WE DO NOT CHEAT!!!</div></blockquote>Haha... long time never post..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> For your info. there's no such thing as SLM lah.. Only Enyouth has it... It's MLM... WAKE UP! Go look around at other MLM companies and you'll be amazed at the similarities in comp plan... Go google for the term SLM and see what you can find lah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> For any commission based company, it's not hard to see a similar system that you find in insurance company... A unit manager overiding the commissions of his subordinates... Very common... it's just a normal payment structure..<br><br>ISO 9001:2000 is only for quality management and documentation lah.. Management only applicable to the admin side... Nothing to do with the distributors aka customers...<br><br>The reason many people complained is because of the way they were treated by the distributors of the company... You may not cheat but can you guarantee for the others? Look carefully and ask your conscious.. Are you entirely convinced of the way some people in your company conduct themselves? Don't be led by the majority, do your own Due Dilligence..<br><br>If all the distributors keep denying the complaints... then the situation will only get worse.. Go reflect and hopefully change the culture in the company. Good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wellz, i have personally joined it, so i suppose i'm "fit" in a way, to comment. lolx.<br><br>Firstly, i do agree that the methods used to bring your friends and potentials is considered cheating.  BUT  the impression of MLM in singapore isn't that positive, and most people will just stay away, even though it may not be that bad. i can say that more than 80% of the people that say mlm is bad don't even KNOW how the mlm work. The people in the mlm industry have 2 different thinking.<br><br>one(most mlm companies): i want to bring as many people to join me. so that i can reach my SDM position.<br>two(EY): i want to bring as many people to join me so that we can all grow rich together.<br>This have led to companies such like V***** Era to call EY the bible company. lolx, funny i know. (my friend is working in VE so i know)<br><br>in the 2nd case, you can't exactly say they are making use of your friends to make money for you. AFterall, its for the best intentions... its like telling your friend to come with you to queue up for free tix to some concert... bad example, i know. lolx...<br><br>Two, the prices of the goods are way way way more than the manufactured price. Hell, think about it. Your handphones. How much do u think it really cost. s$500? think again. it may only cost $5. afterall, its plastic casing. AND the internal chips are ALL mass produced. Check the manufacturer in the casing. Where does it say? CHINA. DUH...arn't we all paying so much more for wat we could have got for less... But i do agree in something. The methods used inside to make u pay and join is really underhanded... This is from a personal encounter.<br><br>Once you signed the form to join, they will persuade you to buy a product. I agree with the part where a person must have product confidence BEFORE you can actually sell it. Hence, you should get one. BUT, if you have decided to get one, or have not. The DM or SDM talking to you may tell you that they have already paid for the goods. NOW you not only have to buy that things for real, you also owe them a favor and money.... this, is really unforgivable.<br><br>Third, the doing. Of course, like someone before have mentioned. When someone scores A and the other score F in a test. We know why. Its just because one was hardworking and the other wasn't. So, its exactly the same in this case. If you work hard, if u sell, you earn money. If you don't you wun get sh*t. lolx<br><br>Also, about the selling to friends and family part. Let me ask u a simple question. When you go out and, say for example, become a salesperson in a boutique. You would ask your family and friends to come and take a look won't you. If you have started your own business, say for example skin care products. You would in your spare time show them to your family and friends won't you? In MLM's case, they just OPENLY tell you to do so. Human brain works in a weird way. When you do it willingly, its fine. When someone SUGGEST/ENFORCE it, its called SCAMMING. lolx.... thats life...<br><br>Forth, someone mentioned abt mlm boasting? .... thats irrelavant. EVERY single advertisement boast. if not, who would buy??? -_-" just use your brains and THINK.... and yes, all mlm members are brainwashed, just like all singaporeans are about PAP. (just a personal point of view, so don't sue me)<br><br>XP<br><br>Fifth, the certs and product.<br>Certs are real, but not exactly supportive of some things. For example, the NUS cert. Do you people even know what cert it is??? For a magnet to be called a biomagnet (which have been scientifically proven to help our health) it has to be above 550 guaz or however you spell it. The cert just proves that the magnet used in th products are ABOVE 550 guaz. YES, thats all.<br>And the cert may be easy to get, but its just an assurance that its LEGAL...<br><br>Product wise.. i've used it. Works quite okie for me. Facial products... BAH... But the pillow pad does wonders for my swollen eyes... lolx... and aiyah... there are bound to be quality rebukes... i mean, look at the nokia N70 (i'm using one). The first generation of N70 have the problem of not following the ringtone that you have set... It will almost always use the default nokia ringtone... irritating. you'd have to send it to nokia service shop for a update in program or something. SO????? i havent heard people screaming about how nokia hps have turned their lives upside down, wasted their money etc... sgreans are much richer than they are willing to admit it... lolx...<br><br>6th, the world IS embracing mlm.<br><br>BUT, my personal point of view is. The top people are using the bottom people to earn  money. Then when the company goes wrong, or at a certain point of time. The boss will just take all the money and just wind up everything. Many look forward to the neverending share that they are supposed to get. But they forget that if the company winds up. Everything is gone. Don't compare that american old woman who earn over US20,000 a month. That is in AMERICA where the market is HUMONGOUS. Unlike singapore.<br><br>7th, incentives.<br><br>The incentives are real. But only if you are willing to put a lot of time and effort into it. During the few months i was in EY, i realized i stayed out late everyday, slp at 4 wake up at 9, go for morning groupings at 12, and start work after that. lolx. if you do that for a year or 2, you will get your car i guess. And well, so far, there are only like 10 odd car achievers.... that says somethings.<br><br>And yes, some left the company, that led me to think about what i mentioned in point  6.  Earn the car, get the incentives, leave before u get "burnt". Makes sense right? After all, business is all about handling and calculating risks...<br><br>I can't be bothered to answer so many of the things covered in this topic... but i'll try to answer the questions posted after this post...</div>

(They make sure u do it right in front of them.) Arent all these pple ur friends and family? U will have to complete looking for ur clients using that list and add on as u make more friends... Yes, they may tell u that u can ask anyone on the streets to help u buy ur products, but do u think anyone on the streets will stop and listen to someone whom they dunt know and buy a $1500+ product? Anyway, they will try ways to make u coax ur friends or family to buy the product first instead of teaching u how to sell the product on the street.... A salesperson is different. Yes, u may selling the products to ur friends and family on a few occasions, but mainly ur customer base is still strangers on the streets. Besides, if they are ur friends and family, u will find all sorts of ways to give they discounted price (eg, staff discount blah blah) and not try to earn too much $$ from them...<br><br>Take sometime to observe their underhand marketing tactics, do u think u really like to sell things this way?</div>

Seen the office,the 'managers' will paste photo copies of their paychecks like $15000,$20000 etc on the walls to convince ppl. For ppl who may want 2 take it on as a p.t job, should be ok.
