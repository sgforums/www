            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever whatever whatever....Like what Rafael Benitez of Liverpool always say:"People are scared of you, jealous of you, think of you, thats why they kept talking about you.". Who isn't sceptical of Albert Einstein when he trys to create light. All sorts of words came down at him at that time.<br><br>Choose to believe and you will see, but unfortunately, people choose to see than to believe first. Lets put it in a direct way, no matter what happen to you in whatever way, happens to me, happens to everyone in EY. I'm 2yrs in there, I'm an ED. Nothing comes easy. Its hard in there. But at least I chose to try. I failed too of course. But I tried again. Because I don't want to let my friend down. He trusted me and he worked all the way until he is now almost a car achiever. He went above me. I got no commission. But I'm happy because I've change his life. Haiya tell you all also wouldn't believe.<br><br>I started when in the army. Didn't got charge. I don't know why someone said his friend got charge. By the way, I don't know why I'm posting this. But I can tell you, no matter what you all say in here, decision still lies with those who want to join. What your say here, isn't it like someone trying to break up with another person in a relationship. All sort of reasons also will work. all sort of research juz 'pop' outta no where. Any proof that the whole company is a scam? I'm not talking about your friend, individually, but the whole company?<br><br>haiya, argue for what right? No matter what you all say, wouldn't affect anyone. If I listen to you as a stranger here, I must be MORE out of my mind. Why? Because, at the end of the day, if I got no money, I bankrupt and my parents need to eat to survive, will you give me money to help me out? Help my parents? Haha. Wouldn't right? Success or your path is decided upon urself.<br><br>Anyone out there, you chose this path, you be responsible for it. Don't be like a sissy and push the blame around. Now listen here, I can't blame your anyway. Humans are born 97% negative. They wouldn't go think something positive out of something first. Come on. Forgive and forget. By the way, if you keep thinking we are "psycho-ing" you, let me tell you..."YES! YES WE ARE!" we are....we are doing it.....we are at least 'psycho-ing' you to earn money...,extra money. not spend money.....not like your rest of your "great" friends pyscho-ing for 5 hrs of LAN gaming or chionging.....spend money...terrible.....<br><br>Anyway, I'm not anyone successful but at least i'm someone who chose to be responsible for what I chose to do. Even at the end of the day I'm not with this company, at least I know I wouldn't regret that I once did try something, or I once did chiong all the way in my life for something call success when I was young. When I was young and full of energy. That is what my 3rd uncle told me. He has a family and he dare not commit because he has a family. He tells me straight in my face that what i did is correct and he envys my age. You think my uncle is stupid. Maybe I am stupid...<br><br>But finally, no offence guys. Its a forum isn't it? Just wanna be like your. Say what your feel. I've said my piece and you will hear me no more. Choose to accept opinion like i've accepted yours. Bye and take care.<br><br>Regards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope...from Donald's. y? Car Achiever Donald. I've seen how he work with me from his ED position until today he is a car achiever. haiya...say sooo much also no use. I also dunnoe y i'm replying you.<br><br>Anyway, don't say until like that lahz.....what "If its soooo good, then everyone in Singapore will quit their job and go into full time?".....den i think, u should take this sentence and brand it on those who keep gambling every monday and thurs for toto and wed, sat and sun for 4D! Isn't it beta this way:"If sure win, then everyone in Singapore should quit their job and gamble full time!"...or why not this way,"If LAN gaming can earn money, then everyone in Singapore should quit their job and play game every day!" etc etc...u see wat i mean? Choose To Be Believe And You Will See, Unfortunately, Often People Choose to See And Then To Believe.<br><br>Do you have religion? You believe in GOD, Buddha etc? Believe? You seen them before? No? Then what makes you believe? Coz its that faith, that trust you have in you, like many of us in EY. Dun think u understand. You will only choose to be negative, sceptical. No religion? Good! Because you believe in yourself, you have that faith in yourself. But you think others believe you? They are negative of you! Why? Not happy of what I say? Because you are pratically doing the same thing to EY? Isn't it?<br><br>Enuff said. More than wat is supposed to be said. Think before you say, think when u say and think again after you've said. Thats maturity and stop the whining just because YOU can never succeed here or YOU don't believe in succeeding here! Finding reasons and excuses.....argh...normal singaporeans which I can't deny the fact I was and I am like this but I chose not to be like this. Take care guys. Bye!<br><br>Regards</div>
