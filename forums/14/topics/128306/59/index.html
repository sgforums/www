              <p>Hi All below is a perfect analysis of why MLM or SLM will ultimately fail and not last long.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Taken from <a href="http://zhukoliang.blog.com/1182725/">http://zhukoliang.blog.com/1182725/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>basically MLM just shift general focus on supply and demand and they create their own market to sell to their members at inflated prices knowing that their products could never be sold over the counter at such exboritant prices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if u manage to climb up to DM level u are still considered a failure as u failed  to understand market forces of supply and demand infact all DM were trained to do force selling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In both cases you will fail so why join in the 1st place?    </p>

              <p>I read the blog. I can sense the writer hate towards mlm, making the whole article very biased. It does not show both sides of the coin and used strong words to stir up our emotion towards mlm (aka emotion blackmail), not a healthy way to look at things. Like it or not, there are people who grow and become more mature because of mlm, although there may be side effects too. Overall, it's not a very objective article and should not be solely taken to help you to detemine or not to do mlm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the writer do bring out some good points too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Market saturation</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mlmers will continue to recruit more people non-stop without taking into suppiles and demand. No mlm company do market analysis to find out all these.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Morality and Ethics</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mlmers may use lies to "con" people to join their business, such as how easy the job is, how much they can earn etc. But we should all know mlm dropout rate is more than 95% and less than 1% of those who joined will earn a 5 digit income as claimed by many of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really want to do big in mlm, you should expand overseas, Singapore's limited population and easy access to information may allow a small number of mlmers to survive but will not help them to really earn the type of income they dream of.</p>

              <p>I only copy the titles, as for the rest, I use my own words to the best as I can from my understanding of the blog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't think mlm is like lottery. In lottery, everyone has a equal chances of winning, there is no need to think, do research or work hard. But in mlm, doing the right things can increase your chance of staying in the industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's just gambling. Most just gamble without thinking and bet on what came to their mind without the necessary homework done. But there are some who did their maths, ask around for information and calculate their chances of winning before putting down any money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And those who win in lottery win by luck while those who win in mlm put in their hard work to achieve that</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe I just don't like the words used by the writer in his blog. A bit too strong and biased.</p>

              <p>Every thing does have good and bad but i dislike the tactics that they use to trick you down for their marketing plan, well if it is really good then need to trick.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly don't you think that MLM products are overpriced and majority of the ppl that buy are the members in some perspective it is some how like paramid but just using a product to cover up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is an example of how MLM works and how they generate enormous profits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eg. I am a Boss selling health products if i were to sell over the counter i would be competing with over the counter products and definately i cannot charge too high if not nobody will take or buy to advertise also will increase my operating costs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is where MLM comes in i price my products quite high knowing its quite hard to be sold over the counter so i will recruit distributors to help me sell my health products in return giving them comission, then also inform them that if u make certain level of sales you can also recruit members to help you sell also, tempting them that they can drive big cars if they keep on recruiting and expanding their own network.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To sell such products  who will the distributors target, their own family members cos which stranger would be your potential customer to buy at such a high price where there is cheaper alternatives? When u exhaust your own personal market you just recruit your friends and the cycle goes on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it based on product or relationship selling even i as a ex MLM member my sales where based on relationship sales and not product sales, and so are my downline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short it is not a product that can stand on its own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you explain what are really the good sides of Enyouth.  </p>

              <p>They are also competing with other mlm companies. If they charge their prices too high, people will buy from other companies instead. They may even lose their people to other companies. Look at the market now, so many health and wellness products mlm companies, selling products that almost have the same effect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I heard this from a manager in Enyouth:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason why relationships are strained when they join mlm is because they use relationship to sell products. Customers buy products from them not because the products is good but because the seller is the customer's friend or someone who is close. These people will use phrase like</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I am your ... if you don't support me, who will"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"come on lah, so long friend already, buy one loh"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I am your ... lah, you still don't believe me?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These mlmers will not go much into the products but instead spending more time to tap into the "potential" of their friendship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The most important thing to remember if you do not want to strain relationship is that when the customer buy the product, make sure the reason he do it is because the product is good and it's worthed the money and not because of the relationship.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keith, the way you are selling is wrong, I think you lose many friends because of that, am I right? And you teach your downlines the wrong things and they continue to do it the wrong way</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good sides of enyouth?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry, I don't really like enyouth a lot, so I cannot comment on this point, maybe what the enyouth manager said is one</p>

              <p>Salary? Oh my, EY actually gives people a SALARY? Aint it purely by commission, MLM company what.</p>
              <p>Enyouth teaches agents how to trick people down, by not telling them what they're going to do, just say "seminar" and stuff. Enyouth teaches agents on sneaky recruitment tactics like telling ppl their future is hopeless, etc.</p>
              <p>Employees? They're employed? Since when? i thought Enyouth always say "start own biz" by joining them? The new Astral Mag, the infamous MLM. A leopard never changes its spots. Operations, tactics still the same. Disgrace to the industry. Why change name from AM to Enyouth huh?</p>

              <p>I say your reply is bullsh*t. I worked in retail sales before, and I've never ever seen a company so unethical like Enyouth. I learnt sales tactics before, u want customer to buy something, say something to set them thinking. But EY uses pressurising. This itself is illegal, and unethical. Some people have zero ethics and conscience.</p>
              <p>I have nothing to comment on the payments, etc, but the lack of ethics really makes me pissed off.</p>

              <p>Dear Enyouth agent.</p>
              <p>1) Sorry for the misunderstanding. Are agents being paid or is it purely by commission?</p>
              <p>2)  Yes I had worked in "very front line" retail before, more than once, at different fields of retail selling different products. I had previously taken a formal retail course. I compared what I learnt in school and from the various companies I've worked with with the tactics of Enyouth. I believe the school provides a more professional and ethical education of retail tactics. Tell me, being an employee o<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">f a regional office: </span></p>
              <p>Is it suitable, ethical for agents NOT to tell potential customers/recruits what the company is doing until the last minute?</p>
              <p>Many if not most agents use another excuse to get people to go down to their office/seminars (without knowing prior it is a seminar/office visit). I believe I am not the only one being tricked down before. Tell me as a regional office, is it suitable, ethical for agents to tell potential recruits that their (the recruits') current field of work is hopeless and have no future? This would amount to using psychological warfare, by demoralising the person.</p>

              Hi guys, let's keep our cool and not retort to insulting lanaguage.
                      
              Anyway, agent are not employee of the company. Being an employee means you are under the protection of MOM for your rights, agents of mlm company are not such cases. Futhermore, I believe that employees have to pay taxes but I don't see any mlmers doing that.
                      
              About the case on Hilter, maybe what I can say is that the defination of good or evil is depended on the moral values of the society we are at. What is the set of moral values that most singaporeans follows? Does Enyouth follow it?
                      
              But one thing I agree with dirtysexymoney is that no matter what, all these are only hearsay, I could be lying, redstone could be lying. So if you want to know the truth, the only way is for you to experience it yourself. But I can tell you that I experienced enyouth myself and what I know is not through hearsay.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>this topic is long, i believe all saying from supporters and non supporters of mlm is rite in their own way. no doubt pple in mlm is doing wrongly but its undeniable tat mlm is one of the way to earn a good amount of money with the correct effort and attitude to do it. i have read books from authors not doing mlm but do support the mlm market.the system of mlm in some companies are really feasible and good but the pple who works with the system must be equally good to bring out the wonders. look at taiwan, usa. they are doing well with all sorts of businesses including mlm. why sg is not? well in order not to accuse or pointing of fingers, we should think it this way. to really understand if mlm is good or bad, u must really be in the system as a neutral , do the system and see if its really good or bad.  i aint a supporter but i did not do in any mlm thus i cant deduce the good or bad and leave this topic as an interesting topic for alll to share and not pushing for mlm or flaming them</p></div>
