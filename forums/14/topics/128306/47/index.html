These are the articles. Apparently, its a very effective anti-bactarial agent when its added in its pure state.<br><br>http://www.cibasc.com/index/ind-index/ind-per_car/ind-pc-ah/ind-pc-triclosan.htm<br><br>http://www.grinningplanet.com/2005/10-04/triclosan-article.htm<br><br>This website talk about side effects when Triclosan is being compounded with another chemical and thus generates several side effects.<br><br>http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-18541-Benzocaine-Triclosan+Topical.aspx?drugid=18541&amp;drugname=Benzocaine-Triclosan+Topical&amp;pagenumber=6<br><br>Guess Alessandro, you really should just concentrate on improving your VE prods rather than putting other people prods down. By doing this, you only show how unethical VE people are. MLMers are already being flamed and yet you all are not united to stand by each other. If you have noticed, the posts in here are all about the EY's unethical ways to recruit people and not on their products. And i personally have been to a few companies, they all used the same methods. Just recently, my friend's cousin was being called up by one of VE's distributors. He ask her to submit her resume and than go for an interview. After the so call interview, than she realise that its another networking company and she is being ask to promote your water distiller or something like that. Since when does MLM need to review resume??? Sigh. As you all can guess, she left the place overwhelmed by disppointment. </span></div>

(hahaha) How is the Networking industry going to succeed with people like this? Sigh.<br><br>Objectively:<br>Majority of Networking companines' products are really not bad and the business model of such companies seems to be really worth researching into. Some corporate companies have already start to intergrate the above business model into their traditional business. 21st century is all about Research, Adapt, Improvise, Implement, Moitor, Improvise and Implement.<br><br>For its pricings, well, the distributor's paycheck have to come from somewhere. Whether or not a product is worth its price, the person selling  and buying it, determines it. (Eg: Whether or not this person is worth me supporting  or whether has the salesperson convinced the customer of the product value...etc) We all have to admit, that all bosses will also love to mark up the price of their products to the optimum so as to allow things like occasional promos and discounts to come along.<br><br>But i do agree that they need to improve on their recruitment tactics. If they really want to conduct their business professionally, they will have to be as honest as possible. </span></div>
