Joining this thread rather late is me, ex-member of EY.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>2. What can I say? The company are full of shallow people and hypocrites, who preach that members should join with the mindset that you're bringing health to the people you sell these things to, and bring success to your downlines. But every single day they pester you with F***ing irritating one-liners like "How much do you want your car? How much do you want to earn back your capital? How much do you want this? How much do you want that? But I don't see you fighting hard enough for that leh! yada yada blah blah blah."<br><br>Bullshit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>3. EY is one orchestrated symphony of excuses and justifications. If you feel bad selling a 3000 bucks mattress to your financially distraught uncle, don't. Because hey! You're helping him get healthy! And don't worry just ask your friend to come down! But before that pls drop by the office to get more bullshitters and liars to stay and help you blind your friend. You can't do it alone man. You need all the DMs and SDMs who're experienced in the misguided company policy to help you talk. Just in case your friend is too smart and manages to retort everything, changing your mind along the way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>As for EY, forget it.</div></blockquote>Ya, heard from friend they teach alot of manipulation techniques. For example a DM will come and "wash" the newbie when newbie not producing, after that another DM will come over to "sayang" newbie saying the first DM had notice his (newbie) potential when he's (newbie) new, and is very concern about him (newbie) hence he (1st DM) said all those things, if other people he (1st DM) also wun care...<br><br>The newbie will then feel honored and have enormous respect for the 1st DM, and will listen to whatever the 1st DM says, and will go all out for sales, by hook or crook.<br><br>But the true agenda is the newbie's upline may not hit whatever target he has to hit (car, promotion, etc).... Heard most of the time the DM (1st DM) dun even know the newbie, it's all pre-arrange by the uplines.<br><br>When the newbie is old enough in the company, he'll know about these methods, and felt cheated. A DM will then come over and sayang more saying the heart is important, by doing all that more people actually get to use the magnetic mattress hence promoting their health etc etc etc.<br><br></div>

Law of Cause &amp; Effect comes from Buddhism.<br><br>Please read this :<br><br>www.magnetictherapyfacts.org  &amp; www.therionresearch.com/learning_center_articles.html<br><br>M.O.H did not endorsed TCM initially till a few years back, but even way before that, the TCM clinics are not lack of patients.<br><br>M.O.H did not endorse OSIM, yet so many people buy.<br><br>Simmons, the bed manufacturer, sell Magnetic Negative Ion fibre bed. M.O.H also never endorse. But they are also selling in big departmental stores.<br><br>If magnetic therapy is fake, than i guess let's sue SPH first. Cause they are the one who publish that magnetic therapy is the next wave in market and have existed way before and its proven to have medical benefits.<br><br>And if magnetic therapy is fake, think you should go Singapore General Hospital to remove the magnetic band aids from their shelves first as they are selling it off the selves in their pharmacy.<br><br>Next, you can also go to Tan Tock Seng to remove the F.I.R guards from their shelves. Those are sold to Geriatric patients who have Arthritis and Rheumatism.<br><br>If Bio-Technology is fake than i guess the Goverment is wrong to invest $1.5 billion in this sector and also to build Biopolis-centres.<br><br>And lastly, Temasek Poly will be making a grave mistake in coming up with electro-magnectic devise to promote better sleeping patterns.<br><br>Please do read up on current affairs. Places where you can find all these are Channel News Asia, The Straits Times &amp; also LianHe Zao Bao &amp; Lianhe Wan Bao.<br><br>So who's the one that never find out. And talking about parent's health. Have you ever had the feeling of your close ones contract cancer and die within 3 months? Your own uncle lost his sight due to chemotherapy? Do you know what's going into their relatives, sons &amp; daughter's head at that point of time? They would give and try anything in exchange for a few more months of their parents life.<br><br>Just because you dislike EY and thus find information to contest the fact of magnectic therapy. Everyone can do a search on the net and see what you can find on magnetic therapy. There are definately good &amp; bad articles. But you neglect the good and only show the bad. This only shows that you are not basing your comments objectively but more of showing personal hatred against the Company. Than it'll be better if you just type (I HATE EY) rather than trying to come up with different theories to mislead people.<br><br>You are also not fair against the people who are reading the thread cause you are destroying their hopes of finding an alternative way to help their loved ones. If you have never send your loved ones into the A &amp; E department before and stand there only to hear doctors say they will try and no guarantee that the medications will help than please don't tell people how they should care for their parents' health.</span><br><br>Originally posted by Rigante:<br><strong><br><br>Your words sound very much of the generic bullshite MLMers give...ying yang issit?

To me that is magnetic therapy not magnetic device. It retails at $35-$40. Can only use once for 24 hrs only. Is it expensive?

There may be dozens of crooks in EY but there may be good ones also. Its a law of nature. If there's hot, there'll be cold. If there's carnivour, there'll be herbivour. But a sad thing is normally people only look at things one sided and fail to see things from people's eyes thus passing one sided judgements. Sometimes, the more knowledgeable you are, you tend to limit your capabilities. Those who are less educated have no choice but to crave out their own career paths. But who are we to judge? I don't believe everyone in this thread is so pure and righteous that gives them the right to keep complaining about others. While you are typing negative comments about others, somewhere somehow, others are typing the same thing about you.

I did not even use a single vulgar word.<br><br>Went through your fact-less reply. Yes fact-less reply. So you're saying there are both black and white sheeps in EY. I can agree but the white sheeps, either they had left, or are going to be black soon. The rest are all black. It's a strong statement, maybe the strongest yet that I've posted against this company.<br><br>The manipulation technique I wrote that your post replied to was taught by SDM 4* LBH to all other SDMs, DMs and senior EDs, before he pop over to nuskin. It part of the company's official technique. It is still being used now.<br><br>The bluffing people out for lunch/dinner/tea technique then getting them to listen to EY's marketing plan, product, etc is also a company official technique. If I'm not wrong, it's taught in EY Recruitment Training.<br><br>The Knee Pray Beg technique (I've never posted this before, neither have I seen this posted here before. Briefly it's about kneeing down, crying and begging the prospect to buy the mattress, be it in prospect house, or in public place, until such that the prospect has no choice but to buy as everyone is staring) is also an official technique use to close sales.<br><br>The T-UP technique (although everywhere uses it to a certain extend) most of the time is based on lies, is also officially taught by the company.<br><br>During EY De-Brief session, even if the De-Briefer is unable to convince the MP (prospect) to join, he will just play around with words which are usually not based on facts. Or if the MP asked too many tough questions the De-briefer will say "Dun ji1 dan3 li3 tiao1 gu2 tou2" meaning dun "pick bones from within an egg". I'm sure you know what that means.<br><br>So if you say every company have black sheep, I agree. But in this case seems like all in EY are black, since the above official techniques are...

So you are saying no one can complain? Because pure and righteous people only exists in a perfect world.<br><br>You also said people tend to look at things one-sided and pass comments.

Typical.Rigante did not say magnetic therapy is fake. He/she says there is no proof EYÂ’s magnetic therapy mattress works. He/she asks EY to get their own lab results rather then cut and copy general articles on magnetic therapy and put it into your sales kit. IÂ’m sure your sales kit have the article on Geneagles hospital using magnets to aid the woman who canÂ’t control her bladder. IÂ’m sure your sales kit have an article about MRI. Right? For the record all the articles of magnetic therapy are a different kind of magnets from what you use. What EY is doing is like saying Â“oil produces energy, and we sell oil, so we produce energy for youÂ” But in reality the are cooking oil, petrol, crude oil, etc and youÂ’ll be in real trouble if you use petrol for cooking.<br><br>And if you really bother to read through everything in your sales kit (those Japanese, Chinese, American, etc), youÂ’ll realise non of them is about the magnets in YOUR magnetic mattress. </span><br><br>So who's the one that never find out. And talking about parent's health. Have you ever had the feeling of your close ones contract cancer and die within 3 months? Your own uncle lost his sight due to chemotherapy? Do you know what's going into their relatives, sons &amp; daughter's head at that point of time? They would give and try anything in exchange for a few more months of their parents life.<br>.<br>[color=blue]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sonic_16: Perhaps itÂ’s a coincident (and IÂ’m really not trying to be insensitive) but I was taught this as part of sales technique closing.</span></span><br>.<br><br>Just because you dislike EY and thus find information to contest the fact of magnectic therapy. Everyone can do a search on the net and see what you can find on magnetic therapy. There are definately good &amp; bad articles. But you neglect the good and only show the bad. This only shows that you are not basing your comments objectively but more of showing personal hatred against the Company. Than it'll be better if you just type (I HATE EY) rather than trying to come up with different theories to mislead people.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sonic_16: So why is EY only showing the good and not the bad articles to people? So EY is not objective too? You said he/she come up with theories to mislead people, isn't EY using even more? Manipulations, Lies, etc etc. </span></span><br><br>You are also not fair against the people who are reading the thread cause you are destroying their hopes of finding an alternative way to help their loved ones. If you have never send your loved ones into the A &amp; E department before and stand there only to hear doctors say they will try and no guarantee that the medications will help than please don't tell people how they should care for their parents' health.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sonic_16: So are u suggesting that magnetic therapy can help the patient after doctors say their medications are no guarantee?</span><br></span>[/color]<br><br>Originally posted by Rigante:<br>[b]<br><br>Your words sound very much of the generic bullshite MLMers give...ying yang issit? FYI it's carnivore and herbivore. The fact is, in EY there are not just dozens of crooks, there are legions of them. The good ones, sadly, are the newbies most of the time before they become influenced. Simple matter of environmental pressure.<br><br>I would say the most important factor is whether that product works at all - if it doesn't, all that talk about helping people is actually cheating. Lab reports? The last thing we need is to cut and paste reports from other companies (typical of biomagnetic companies who copy from those in japan) instead of having a real report certified in Singapore.<br><br>If they are so rich and get ISO and all that and they seem so confident about these bedsheets, it would be simple to get from MOH a genuine report rather than relying on plain talk and generalising magnetic therapy. Even so, many people in this industry never ever bother to find out - instead of helping their family, they might be promoting malignant growths in their bodies while depleting their financial health.  See this<br><br><a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/magnet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/magnet.html</a><br><br>So if these brainwashed distributors really care about their families, shouldn't they conduct independent research and find out more about a dubious therapy rather than happily believing whatever their uplines tell them?

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Dear All,<br><br>i just wish to clarify that i'm not on standing on EY's side. I'm just replying with regards to the healing effects of magnectic therapy. I only wish to bring across what i've read up on magnetic therapy and share it with you all.<br><br>All i can say is that the operations &amp; teachings in networking companies is very similar to the insurance &amp; property industry. Even the people are also the same. If you talk about car salesman, they are even worse when it comes to making false claims. And they are so good that even if you go to CASE, you also have no case.<br><br>As long as its a sales oriented job, i can say its only human nature to look into their own personal interest first.<br><br>Those who have left EY, please remind yourself that you were once one of them. You did what they did too. Don't push the blame to others saying you were taught to do so, cause i believe you are old enough to differentiate between right &amp; wrong and should join or not to join a company. Don't put your mistakes on this word call "brainwashing" or people force you. You might as well say "hypnotism" next time.(eg: you were asked to kill someone and you commit the act. you go to court and say you were brainwashed or forced by the person. guess what's the verdict? the most they change the verdict to manslaughter instead of intended murder) Blame it on your weak determination and i think before you complain about others, please go to those customers that you have closed a sale from and apologise to them. Tell them you have a weak will and you easily believe what people say, thus causing them to buy an overpriced product from you. They buy out of support and trust in you thinking you are serious but you end up quitting.<br><br>Those not from EY, should go and find out more before you make your comments rather than listen to others. Apparently, some of them get the warranty period wrong, get the SDM position wrong, don't even know about their much raved about NUS endorsement, the real healing effects of magnetic therapy (though there are pros &amp; cons), got the wrong defination of their Scientific Advisory Board, forget to mention that F.I.R is included in the mattress and also they didn't mention that SGH is already selling small items like magnetic band aids and before they even check it out, they tried to argue that its a magnetic device not magnetic therapy.<br><br>Regards</span></div>

Of course i hpe my  fren wake up in a way, but i cant be sure if i wld b ther 2 support. I rem when my fren n i use to be very close n always meet up. I din join my fren in EY but i also made sure nt to bad mouth them. I wanted to see whats going on... When my fren's customer changed their mind abt the single mattress, my fren tried desperately to sell it off. I was thinking what so difficult abt telling the company, the customer changed their mind. In the end, i bought it over. Yes, it was silly. Bear in mind, my fren had no time to meet up with me before that but when i offer my help, ta-dah, my fren turned up at my doorstep. Yah, i know very sad right...</div>

First of all, law of cause and effect DID NOT come from Buddhism - it has always been there, my 'knowledgeable smart aleck' friend. Ask any buddhists and they will enlighten you. And the statements you made are not even 'cause and effect', you are talking about opposite sides. Try to make some sense before you retort to your own interpreted nonsense.<br><br>I am not against EY, but I am against companies who sell quackeries as products. An endorsement is not a laboratory controlled certified test, and before you get us to point the finger at other notable instituitions, point it at yourself - dun come shrieking to us pointing out NUS this and that, we want to see black and white proof of your dubious products.<br><br>And sorry, you are very unconvincing as a magentic therapy supporter rather than a EY distributor, because whatever you say is biased on the side of EY. If you don't believe, dun go back and edit your words and everyone will see for themselves.<br><br>The way I see it,  you are trying valiantly to maintain a neutral perspective but failing. Please, if you are positioning yourself as a logical and analytical forummer, then at least say something coherent rather than gibberish sprinkled with unconventional half-truths and inappropriate analogies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Geesh... if everyone thinks just like you, no fraudsters in the world can ever be brought to justice... Perhaps you need to be shot in the foot, just for once, to be able to truly empathize with the victims. Provided you bother to... typical "elitist" remarks.. PUI!<br><br>Since it's out of concern and support, i'm sure the same supporters also wouldn't want the distributors to sink deeper into a scam... It's only wise for a person to realize his mistakes and move on. Showing gratitude to your supporters doesn't restrict one to succeed only in enyouth. Success in life does not equal to success in enyouth. There are many other paths to take..<br><br>[quote]<span style="color: darkred;">Those not from EY, should go and find out more before you make your comments rather than listen to others.

Can't they share their experiences with others? Not all who were not from enyouth wrong, neither are all who're from enyouth right... So stop your "ethical" lecture, leave us "whiners" to bitch about our failures and see how the company thrive...
