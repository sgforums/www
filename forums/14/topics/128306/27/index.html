            <div class='col-md body'>Magnetic therapy in general is a proven alternative.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Hi raitoh2007,<br><br>when i say company, i actually mean in terms of management. Cause majority of the arguements in here are targeted at the company's management and certain people. Thererfore, it may not be an objective view to judge on their prods. Like what i've mention in my previous posts, the products sold in MLM companies are really not bad. But it just that they are being paid in a commission structure that will cause individuals to make silly mistakes and decisions just to hit their quota and raise up to their next position. But it doesnt mean that their prod is not good.<br><br>Rather i agree with the previous forumer who mention that we should complied a list of what all the MLM companies are selling and let people who are keen in getting them decide for themselves where to get them. (EG: If Owell is selling magnetic bracelets at $300 plus, and i can get the same bracelet at a local MLM company for $200 plus, than i might as well get it from the local company.)</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by raitoh2007:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br>Thanks for the info, but i disagree with you when u asked me not to look at the company.

The fact that a person leave a co is becos they cannot give what the distributors want while another co can. If EY SDMs all are earning 50k to 100k mthly then i can strongly said that they wont leave so easily. The fact that even SDMs earn peanuts there is the last straw for them. You dont want to eat, they still want to eat, pay bills, maintain families and houses etc. The fact that they are nothing now is due to the fact that they have not research properly before they step into a new one, this can only blame on their stupidility!<br><br>I am interested in EY becos some of my friends are there before and i want to see how their future unfolds because no other MLM co is as eventful and storyful as them, so many upheavals!

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess what EY is good at is getting brainwashed kids to shell out hard-earned cash given to them by their parents or earned by themselves for some magnetic mattresses that are not proven and extremely marked up. I did a check on google and realise that these guys are selling dubious quality stuff at 5-6 times the market rate.<br><br>I guess they might face a problem if some of their smarter guys start questioning the origin as well as authencity of the products and by doiung independent research.<br><br>The way I see it, the journey for EY is down down down  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even then the cost price is still very much lower. I think EY should have some form of excellent convincing to their distributors about the mark-up, like % is cost price and certain % is PV which totally assures them that it is a low exaggeration.<br><br>Last time my friend jio me join some magnetic co., their bedsheet selling around $1500, and later when he left he disclosed to me that the admin told him the cost was less than $50!!! Let's see...<br><br>Wow....$1500 - $50 = $1450<br><br>Even with PV payout<br><br>$1500 x 2/3 = 1000PV, $500 is confirmed profit.<br><br>Assume 65% of PV is payout, still got $350 is confirmed profit.<br><br>Total profit: $500+350-50=$800 into the company's pocket! How many bedsheets does a magnetic bedsheet company sell a month? 300?<br><br>A cool 240,000 easy - no wonder all these companies' bosses bragging about themselves being millionaires...tsk tsk tsk<br><br>The enlightening moment will come when the get-rick-quick distributors realise their own families and friends are paying for their paycheck, and even more so to those above them<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

But yes they did say andrew own a condo, pauline staying with him. His porsche is very old. He got it then send to a garage for refurnishing, but its still a porsche. I'm just saying that all the $ they used to do such things may not fully be from their earnings in enyouth. So to a newcomer who visits the company may really think that he is doing so well that can buy a condo and car and affording their instalments comfortably.<br><br>Of course they got method to get around moonlighting lah. He's not the first regular moonlighting what. Several in his group also regulars. Other companies also have dozens if not more. There are also foreign students on scholarship, employees of companies whose employment contract say cannot moonlight, people bonded by whatever.... but all moonlighting.<br><br>Not sure as to how they do it, but am sure someone from the company or someone very familar with enyouth, ve, etc can enlighten us.</div>

For example a DM will come and "wash" the newbie when newbie not producing, after that another DM will come over to "sayang" newbie saying the first DM had notice his (newbie) potential when he's (newbie) new, and is very concern about him (newbie) hence he (1st DM) said all those things, if other people he (1st DM) also wun care...<br><br>The newbie will then feel honored and have enormous respect for the 1st DM, and will listen to whatever the 1st DM says, and will go all out for sales, by hook or crook.<br><br>But the true agenda is the newbie's upline may not hit whatever target he has to hit (car, promotion, etc).... Heard most of the time the DM (1st DM) dun even know the newbie, it's all pre-arrange by the uplines.<br><br>When the newbie is old enough in the company, he'll know about these methods, and felt cheated. A DM will then come over and sayang more saying the heart is important, by doing all that more people actually get to use the magnetic mattress hence promoting their health etc etc etc.<br><br></div>
