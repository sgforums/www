            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I have my fair share of MLM a.k.a Pyramid System. I take you all back to 1995-1997 remember No.1 Products. I was quite young at that time and worked part time at a supermarket store earning a few hundred per week.<br><br>One of my idiot friend got me into listern to No.1 product and say about their magnatic bed have improve health functinos and stuff and count myself lucky I bought one thinking it would be good for my mom for health reason. Lucky that was during CNY and they had a rebate lucky draw and I got the $1888 draw and the bed cost was $1280 so lucky me got a bed and $600. (Suckers lost a bed and $600 to me).Being inmuture and easily psychoed I thought I got a good deal. They even gave me a cheapo members card.<br><br>Soon after I got called up for NS and stuff. 2 years down the road when I ORD my officer called me up trying to sell me another bed another company this time round I've got my experience with me and being firm in my decision. No mean No and more over I've one bed already why would I need to buy another one.<br><br>A few months ago I too had another friend that joined BEL AIR and made it... He asked me and brought me to the commonwealth place to listern I find it a baloni and BS. The speaker was a ex-DJ. No doubt his presentation was great but once bitten twice shy. So out of friendship and goodwill i got the cheapest lamp and a liquid... its still full and the lamp is unused.<br><br>Now my brother-in-law is sucked into NTI. Selling women's undergarment (Lu Mi Mi ) which by the way was sold by No.1 Products about a decade ago and where is No.1 product? Gone!!! can't be found anywhere. All these young people have no idea what business is about. Have not even step into working live and want to teach people twice their age about business. My dear brother-in-law... wake up and smell the coffee... have soemone to pay for your university fees go and study and get a good honors grade  don't waste your time at NTI playing know it all and selling undergarment to old women and neglecting your studies. I have to work and pay for my own university studies and study part time so difficult and tired.<br><br>Sorry that was personal... Anyway don't admire the people having office there they are at the top of the food chain. You are at the bottom and always will be. You are working so hard so that these people can fuel their car they drive... sleep on the bed and house they buy.<br><br>Based on their model you need to have at least 20 to 30 generations of downlinks and them to have thier own to be able to have an office there and make those flowery speeches. Think how many people you need to lure into the same boat you sit in and you might not know when the boat may sink<br><br>MLM or Pyramid System companies will always be around. These companies work only on one expect of human nature "GREED" as Money is the root of all evil.<br><br>Think about it, all of these MLM companies be it NTI, No.1 Products, BEL AIR, Amway, always promise a high pay without working just recruit peoplr will do. Nice car. Nice house. Frequent Holidays to the listerners. How many of the people asking you to join have them? Why are they always so eager to "help" you succeed? Cause if you don't join they can't afford their Car...House...Holiday...or their monthly expenses.<br><br>I work in a 8am to 530pm job earning about $3500... I own a car... have platinum cards offer to me by banks but I rejected I only need one for emergencys.<br><br>When I sit down to these people at these talks and psycho session I ask them a few questions<br>1. How long have you been doing this? (some say: 1 year or so)<br>2. Have you achieve a car yet? (Some reply: not yet but I'm getting there)<br>3. I own a car does it mean i'm more successful than you? (Common Replies: Blank Blank try to talk about something else).<br>4. Is your earnings taxable? (Common replies : Blank again)<br>5. If not taxable then in future how I apply for Credit Card? (Replies: Blank Blank again)<br><br>You people that are in MLM Companies and thinking of joining. Listen up: The only way to success is by hard work and a bit of luck. By asking people to invest 14k or 10k or what ever amount pls don't make real investers laugh...<br><br>If you really want to succeed<br>1. Saving 1/10 of your every monthly pay for a year or two.<br>2. Ask people that really succeed to help you invest. ( This is the difficult part so luck play a part to know such people and by saying that I don't mean Jackie "NTI boss" or other MLM boss. I mean those SME bosses you should look at them)<br>3. If not put your savings in bank that money goes in easily and take out very hard.<br>4. Don't be hasty in investing ask for 2nd or 3rd or 4th opinion as many as pos from people in the industry you intend to invest. (E.G. you are not going to as a pork seller if today's fish are fresh and nice right)<br>5. Don't regret if you invest wrongly but you must remember your mistake and learn from it and don't repeat it again.<br>6. But in any case if your investment does come out right make your investment's children(returns) make more childrens and make all these children create more children and make all your children(returns) work for you and in time to come 4-5yrs you will made it.<br><br>Be smart, stay cool you all .<br><br>Cheers<br>IronBandit</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They already eat grass from the 1st day they join. They act all the way by struggling for the BMW. I think have 2k per month also hard???? Come my Ebay store then. Have 5000 , 10000 , 3000 gauss i sell for US100-200 already overpriced. Really pity those youngster who joined. Any MLM structure is doomed to FAIL. The big cheese on the top planned it to make quick bucks and wind up/change programme/product/change name/location. LOL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This company no chance for their downlink to strike it. The products are hard to sell out furthermore only emphasize in recruit. Once join in, they sure ask u to buy so u can 'believe' in the products. I suppose only ask their own distributor to buy then make the $. Dont believe u try, 2 years later show me your bank account then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, my 2 cents worth...<br><br>What do you look at when you join a MLM company ? Money ? Cars? product? System ? In my opinion the most importance is the values of the company and the educational aspect of it. Well I been to many MLM company and they often rush in closing your deals. Thats not very healthy.<br><br>People do things differently it differ from groups to groups so it is not guranteed that every group are doing the right thing. What the company can teach they will try to teach. Which I find enyouth have an excellent educational system.<br><br>Next, not everyone is suitable for this business, and many failed in this business because they failed to believe. Well founder of KFC failed 2009 times before finding sponser for his receipe. Thats why he suceed.  LKY believe in that Singapore will become a global city thats why we suceeded. Well it revolves with this word belief. Those ppl who succeeded in this biz believe.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth. I believe in willingly to join. I will not force my friends in committing in things that they dun believe in else they will be like one of u all here saying that MLM is a scam which is not true at all.<br><br>Well thats all ...Comments are free anyone ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not all mlm is scam, but u will not make money in it. I know enyouth is not scam $$$ but it surely scams your time. When u join and pay the starter kit, the ppl there will press u to buy the mattress so u can believe in it. End up is like, u still have to pay the 1.5k.<br><br>Everyone join MLM is want the car and $ but 99% dun get it. The product definitely have no value to customer. The mattress not in demand and not many will buy a mattress using 1.5k. The plan look attractive and possible but after analysing, u need to like keep selling every hour to earn big $, it will look impossible. In the end work so hard and get so little money. Go macdonalds work more money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And one more thing, dont listen to those 'high ranking ppl' in mlm about his or her car. They eat grass and lease the car in hope to attract more downlink to finish the payment. If cannot attract any sales, they go bust. The big boss in mlm surely tell them to fake successful.</div>
