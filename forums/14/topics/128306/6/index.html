In network marketing, you tent to come across people always wanted to be first in any new born company, and they thought by doing so will make them money. Yes, they did make some money, but not long terms. Remembers, network marketing is to suppose give you passive income.<br><br>I recommend you to stick with someone who had been with the company for age, even he is not the first to join. That what also recommend what network marketing expert like John Bremner, Daren Falter, Sue Seward, etc.<br><br>I can list many names here, and these names are not just name to me, all are my friends which I keep contact with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just sharing my personal experience in that matter. Had a friend who asked to have lunch with him. Throughout the lunch, I asked him what company he works for. He said it's nearby but asked me to go and have a look later. I said alright and asked a few times what the company does. He kept on saying "oh u'll know when u reach there" I asked what products, and got the same reply. Midway thru the lunch, a friend of his popped in and starting telling about his personal experience and how his friends who supposedly are doomed to be poor (This was how he put it), became rich after working for this company. I asked again what the company does, and came the standard reply.<br><br>So out of curiousity and friendship, I went up to the company, and well, it's quite obvious what they do the moment u step in.

Even though you did not join them, you felt cheated by ur friend for betraying your trust and wasting your time.<br><br>I have a reason to believe, the so called coffeeshop set up by enyouth is a ploy for the recruiters to invite their friends there for a meal and then get them to go up their office which is just across the road. I was also cheated by my friend to go there. He said it was opened by his friend and he wants to go there patronise and give him support. When I entered the coffeeshop, it's so bloody small and hardly sell anything, except Morris Philips products (Marlboro), drinks and some F**KED up mixed rice. Totally wasted my money. Spent around $4 plus there for the drinks and lousy food.<br><br>My friend was dressed fashionally neat, I was surprised and asked him where did he go b4 meeting me, he said he was having meetings with his managers, I was like huh? but aren't you serving NS? And he said it was a part time job. So I didn't probe further but I know it's illegal to have part time jobs when u are serving NS Full time. I know coz my other NS friend involved in MLM got charged.<br><br>He went on to tell me how some of his managers earn 10k a month and drives a BMW at the age of 25 and how some of them are millionaires b4 age of 30. Anyway when I asked him what crap he was dealing in, he refused to tell me and said he will let me know in time to come.... when I go up to his office. At that pt of time I realised it must be MLM since every small navie young kid with no business/finance/investment knowledge are involved in MLM.<br><br>I did follow my friend to his office to see if they could manage to brainwash me. However they did not, the details are pretty much as how most mlm recruit ppl. Show you pictures of well dressed executives taking photos in front of their beamers, I was like which idiot would do that. these guys must have never driven a beamer in their lives that they have to preserve this moment forever coz it's the only chance they will ever get. haha!<br><br>One thing im impressed with mLM is that they are somehow with good with psychology, which is why so many ppl are involved and die die die die believe in their companies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They are located around carpenter street. I wasted 2 hrs listening to the guy tok cock. but quite interesting if u have no idea how mlm works. it's good to be positive but sometimes we have to take on a pessimistic view and probe further when things seem too good to be true. Everything has it's pros and cons. You gotta see if you can handle the cons, which for me I can't handle the cons of mlms which is why I'm not supportive of it.</div>
