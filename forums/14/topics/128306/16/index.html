            <div class='col-md body'>i went for their OPP presented to me by this Executive Distributor... i found a few pointers that may be of help...<br><br>1. PV System to calculate bonuses... juz like most MLM companies...<br><br>(unknown) PV = 2/3 X Retail Price<br>eg. 1000PV = 2/3 X $1500<br><br>but the most funny part of the person presenting to me that made me ROFL is that he explained the <strong>remaining 1/3</strong> is used to cover <strong>overheads of the company like RENT</strong>... omfg... it sounds like the company NEEDS US... sounds stupid to explain this... i won't even bother to explain this 1/3 if i'm in the company presenting to new pple... at least they will think that it is to cover company's overall expenses plus profit.. it sounds the company's poor to me...<br><br>2. Car Achievers Incentive<br><br><strong>Only allowed a one-time payment of $15,000. CANNOT REQUALIFY. MUST BUY A CAR!</strong> what if i want a POWER BOAT (that's my dream anyway)? he replied, "our company does not have boat incentive..." *herr herr herr... laughs coldly...*<br><br>3. Why is the company name changed to Enyouth?<br><br>"Oh! we are trying to re-package ourself so that we can go global... like Enyouth Malaysia, Enyouth Singapore... sounds better than <strong>Astral Mag Holdings</strong> Singapore or Malaysia..."<br><br>Not answering my question fully...<br><br>4. The plan gets very MLM-like once the person reaches SDM... can get 5% of every single downline and stops at another SDM group with par ranking... so much for saying it's SLM...<br><br>Therefore i conclude from here that the SDMs are the ones really making money from the whole network.<br><br>5. "No flushing" system, except when the member fights for Car Achiever Incentive<br><br>Honestly, MLM companies with such a system don't really care abt the monthly turnover. Firstly they can't get their own distributors to work. This system only makes the top become richer. just too bad if u r somewhere near the bottom of the spectrum (this is for the new distributors to hear).<br><br>6. No REAL LEADERS<br><br>Even the oldest SDMs with stars is barely 2 years old with the company. no wonder most working adults looking to improve their standard of economy will prefer to go to bigger and more established MLM companies, where the leaders have <strong>at least 10 years of wealth and experience</strong>, than companies such as Enyouth.<br><br>Their plan is alright... but payout wise i think better go for another company...<br><br>1D     $70 membership form, 5% Personal Bonus<br>2D     200PV, 10% PB<br>3D     800PV, 20% PB<br>4D     3000PV, 30% PB<br>5D     12000PV, 35% PB<br>DM     40000PV, 40% PB<br>SDM   breed 3 distinct DM lines in your grp, 45% PB<br><br>Their pool share and car fund is <strong>VERY DEPENDENT</strong> on the company sales... no wonder most DMs and SDMs left after a while. <strong>NO CASHFLOW</strong><br><br>People joining this company BEWARE... they will likely use <strong>5-DIGIT MONTHLY INCOME</strong> and <strong>MULTIPLE SOURCES OF INCOME</strong> and <strong>"WE ARE NOT TRAINING SUPER SALESMEN OR SUPER SALESWOMEN"</strong> to lure you over. Well, loads of companies out there have MLUTIPLE SOURCES OF INCOME as well. What you are earning here is CASH. most items are one-time sales, means u have to look for MANY MANY CUSTOMERS to hit your sales quota. isn't this making you a SUPER SALES PERSON?<br><br>To find out more about EnYouth's com plan, can pm me or msg ur number in this topic/thread.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>hahaz... i still have some queries about the plan... too bad the person who brought me there did not bother to answer my questions...<br><br>anyway here's part 2... after some more brain racking... my memory's still quite vivid by the way...<br><br>7. <strong>No fixed profit percentage</strong> through buying at wholesale price and retail price<br><br>many companies have fixed percentage of retail profit, with the <strong>wholesale price purchase</strong> ranging from <strong>10% to even 30% OFF the RETAIL PRICE</strong>. <strong>it is clearer for both members and customers, and there's a degree of transparency</strong> in terms of the company's payout. for customers especially, since <strong>some companies DO NOT give out their PRODUCT BROCHURES (meant for presentation only)</strong>. {if by chance u happen to think i'm targetting at EnYouth, i'm sorry... maybe i did... in the first place i don't know if EnYouth members give out their product brochures to their customers... =)  }<br><br>i asked the presenter if there was a fixed percentage profit from all sales, he beat around the bush before saying that there is a fixed profit from selling the products, <strong>NO FIXED PERCENTAGE RETAIL PROFIT</strong>. sadz....<br><br>8. Something the presenter told me shocked me a lot! he said, "...of course our company gives u a fixed distributor price and selling price, but there are some people out there jacking up our product prices and selling HIGHER THAN SELLING PRICE..."<br><br>To think this is a DSAS-registered company... and he DARE to say such things to new people who are joining the company! This presenter obviously is still learning "how to handle objections from clients or customers". I nearly died when he said that...<br><br>Oh by the way, <strong>did the company take any action to those members who "JACK UP" the ORIGINAL selling prices?</strong> i reckon not...<br>*point for DSAS to take note?*<br><br>i'm still trying to figure out 2 question marks about the plan... maybe <strong>EnYouth distributors</strong> can answer me?<br><br>1. Total Group PV Accumulation (MLM) VS Single Level PV Accumulation (SLM)?<br><br>This is the <strong>most important point in determining if the company is MLM or SLM</strong>.<br><br>Eg. Person A, Person B, and Person C belongs to one straight line in upline order. Person A did nothing, or 0 PV throughout the business. Say when Person B does <strong>800 PERSONAL PV</strong> (mark my language here... B did it ALONE), does it mean A and B will get promoted together? or will B get promoted ONLY, leaving A to work another distinct line out?<br><br>Then wad if B does 800PV total (assuming he has Person D doing 100PV in other line) but <strong>600PV comes from C</strong>? will A get promoted as well?<br><br>2 outcomes:<br>A. if A gets promoted as well <strong>because of C</strong>, it is MLM. You have all been cheated into believing that this is a SLM company when it's not. Don't live in a lie. Get out of Enyouth NOW.<br>B. if A does not get promoted, it is SLM; however poor A got passed-up (or "overtaken" ) by B and C. sad case...<br><strong>simply saying, A still does not earn anything!</strong> that's sad when the people u find are more powerful than u from the 2nd gen onwards...<br><br>solution for Outcome B: find people weaker than u! (when u are already weak urself with 0PV, it's pointless to find more 0PV people under you: no income)<br><br><strong>Conclusion: This company is NOT FOR NEWBIES of SLM/MLM. very sad outcome.</strong><br><br>2. Personal Bonus (PB) Percentage in terms of which value?<br><br>the presenter only told me 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% PB... <strong>PB of what?</strong> means 5% of PV? (which is very likely the case because companies using PV/BV system calculates bonuses this way) or 5% of Wholesale Price? (do they have a fixed WS price by the way?) or 5% of Retail Price? (which is unlikely because so far i only come across 1 company calculate bonuses using retail price, and it's Forever Living Products)<br><br>just to give you an idea how much u really get in Enyouth...<br><br>5% of PV<br>= 5% of (2/3 of Selling Price aka Retail Price)<br>= 3.333% of Retail Price!!!<br><br>omg! that's so little!<br><br>45% of PV<br>= 45% of (2/3 of Selling Price aka Retail Price)<br>= 30% of Retail Price!!!<br><br>this is EXACTLY the Wholesale Price of some companies out there! i mentioned in point 7 that <strong>"Wholesale Price/Distributor Price is ranging from 10% to even 30% of the RETAIL PRICE"</strong> it's exactly the same as you buy at $100 and sell at $100 and company decides to give u $30 back because u are an SDM!!!! hahaz.....<br><br>You purchase at 70% of retail price and sell it at 100% of retail price (of course! unless u want to cheat by selling higher or giving discounts, BOTH UNETHICAL PRACTICES) <strong>and mind you, overriding bonuses and leadership bonuses are still NOT in the equation!</strong><br><br><strong>NOW i know why so many top DMs and SDMs left the company! =p</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Hi all there...<br><br>Like many others I was brought by my best friend to ENYOUTH just last night using the same meet up at coffeeshop tick as many have experienced like what you all say in the front 15++ pages of this thread...<br><br>And listen to a CMI 26 Years Old Presenter who eating chewing gum and telling people about his life story... Haha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Was laughing my ass off when he was talking... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>It was too hard to believe and everything seem so smooth and beautiful... All has been planned for you by your SDM/DM... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wensoccerhonky07:<br><br>7. <strong>No fixed profit percentage</strong> through buying at wholesale price and retail price<br><br><span style="color: red;">many companies have fixed percentage of retail profit, with the <strong>wholesale price purchase</strong> ranging from <strong>10% to even 30% OFF the RETAIL PRICE</strong>. <strong>it is clearer for both members and customers, and there's a degree of transparency</strong> in terms of the company's payout.</span> for customers especially, since <strong>some companies DO NOT give out their PRODUCT BROCHURES (meant for presentation only)</strong>. {if by chance u happen to think i'm targetting at EnYouth, i'm sorry... maybe i did... in the first place i don't know if EnYouth members give out their product brochures to their customers... =)  }<br><br>i asked the presenter if there was a fixed percentage profit from all sales, he beat around the bush before saying that there is a fixed profit from selling the products, <strong>NO FIXED PERCENTAGE RETAIL PROFIT</strong>. sadz....[/quote]<br><span style="color: red;">Err... I dun seem to understand the No Fixed Profit Percentage part in red...<br>Can anybody put it in a more simple and direct form???</span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by wensoccerhonky07:<br>1. Total Group PV Accumulation (MLM) VS Single Level PV Accumulation (SLM)?<br><br>This is the <strong>most important point in determining if the company is MLM or SLM</strong>.<br><br>Eg. Person A, Person B, and Person C belongs to one straight line in upline order. Person A did nothing, or 0 PV throughout the business. Say when Person B does <strong>800 PERSONAL PV</strong> (mark my language here... B did it ALONE), does it mean A and B will get promoted together? or will B get promoted ONLY, leaving A to work another distinct line out?<br><br>Then wad if B does 800PV total (assuming he has Person D doing 100PV in other line) but <strong>600PV comes from C</strong>? will A get promoted as well?<br><br>2 outcomes:<br>A. if A gets promoted as well <strong>because of C</strong>, it is MLM. You have all been cheated into believing that this is a SLM company when it's not. Don't live in a lie. Get out of Enyouth NOW.<br>B. if A does not get promoted, it is SLM; however poor A got passed-up (or "overtaken" ) by B and C. sad case...</blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">simply saying, A still does not earn anything! that's sad when the people u find are more powerful than u from the 2nd gen onwards...<br><br>solution for Outcome B: find people weaker than u! (when u are already weak urself with 0PV, it's pointless to find more 0PV people under you: no income)<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Conclusion: This company is NOT FOR NEWBIES of SLM/MLM. very sad outcome.</strong></span></div></blockquote><span style="color: red;">Err... Why this is not recommended for Newbies like me??? </span><br><br>[quote]Originally posted by wensoccerhonky07:<br>2. Personal Bonus (PB) Percentage in terms of which value?<br><br>the presenter only told me 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% PB... <strong>PB of what?</strong> means 5% of PV? (which is very likely the case because companies using PV/BV system calculates bonuses this way) or 5% of Wholesale Price? (do they have a fixed WS price by the way?) or 5% of Retail Price? (which is unlikely because so far i only come across 1 company calculate bonuses using retail price, and it's Forever Living Products)<br><br>just to give you an idea how much u really get in Enyouth...<br><br>5% of PV<br>= 5% of (2/3 of Selling Price aka Retail Price)<br>= 3.333% of Retail Price!!!<br><br>omg! that's so little!<br><br>45% of PV<br>= 45% of (2/3 of Selling Price aka Retail Price)<br>= 30% of Retail Price!!!<br><br>this is EXACTLY the Wholesale Price of some companies out there! i mentioned in point 7 that <span style="color: red;"><strong>"Wholesale Price/Distributor Price is ranging from 10% to even 30% of the RETAIL PRICE"</strong> it's exactly the same as you buy at $100 and sell at $100 and company decides to give u $30 back because u are an SDM!!!! hahaz.....</span><br><br>You purchase at 70% of retail price and sell it at 100% of retail price (of course! unless u want to cheat by selling higher or giving discounts, BOTH UNETHICAL PRACTICES) <strong>and mind you, overriding bonuses and leadership bonuses are still NOT in the equation!<span style="color: red;">I also dun understand about the "buy at $100 and sell at $100 and company decides to give u $30 back"??? Hmmm...<br><br>Can anybody answers these questions??? I would like to have a clearer picture before committing to any of these SLM/MLM company... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  </span></strong></div>
