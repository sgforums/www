            <div class='col-md body'>Of the product is so good, why doesn't other retailers carry them and only the MLM? If the product is really popular, the product maker must be crazy to use MLM to sell. Products sell best in retail format, be it congsignment or any form of retail. Unless the product maker is the MLM company of cos. Exclusive distributorship you may say. But this only works when the product is very well known or a household name. Otherwise the merchants are committing suidice, shooting themselves in the foot.<br><br>The MLMs are so cult like, with the senior employees shouting, saying stuff promoting MLM. How people make tens of thousands in just few months, how "you can do it too" "you can have the success". "You never make good money if you work for a boss, work for yourself". Bla bla bla.... Few people can make the money like the most successful people do. The income gap can be very big. They know youths have alot of contacts, so some MLMs target recruit youths. By offering rewards for pulling in more people is highly irritating. One can lose friends and contacts in the process.</div>
