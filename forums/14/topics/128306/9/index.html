I wasted 2 hrs listening to the guy tok cock. but quite interesting if u have no idea how mlm works. it's good to be positive but sometimes we have to take on a pessimistic view and probe further when things seem too good to be true. Everything has it's pros and cons. You gotta see if you can handle the cons, which for me I can't handle the cons of mlms which is why I'm not supportive of it. </div></blockquote>Hey guys (Leddy, Unleashed n lostluv),<br><br>I have no time to read every single msg posted... Unleashed's posting caught my attention then followed by Leddy n lostluv. I were brought down to e company in exactly the same way by a so called good friend of mine in school. Subsequencely, I went through more or less the same stuffs as you guys.<br><br>My friend told me that he wants to bring me to his friends' newly opened cafe... he claimed that he wants to " support them". Then on the way down, he started to ask me lot of funny questions... For e.g. When do you foreseen yourself owning a car? Do you think you can find a job when you graduate even with a good honour? Do you think you can ever afford a condo? Bla bla bla... At that point of time, i still didn't realise the BIG PLOT ahead!!!<br><br>Same like you guys, i went to e coffee shop, went throu the photo viewing ceremonies, went throu the presentation... Lot of questionings, which aimed to SHAKEN MY CONFIDENCE IN EDUCATION N JOB MARKET... were thrown to me. For e.g. Do you think a degree is useful? Do you think you can find a job? Do you think you can earn 2 k/ mth in e next few years?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Heez...<br><br>I don't wish to comment on e way Enyouth is functioning, i guess eventually pp ll see e light. For those pp who are planning to join Enyouth, jus a few friendly thinking questions for you to ponder upon:<br><br>1) IF THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE COMPANY N E WAY IT'S FUNCTIONING, WHY CANT THESE "FRIENDS" OF YOURS WORKING IN E COMPANY TELL YOU DIRECTLY ABOUT E COMPANY?<br><br>2) RIGHT FROM E START, YOUR "SO CALLED FRIEND" IN ENYOUTH PLAN TO ASK YOU TO JOIN E COMPANY OR BUY PRODUCT FROM THEM, WHY THEY WANT TO LIE TT THEY R ASKING U OUT FOR CATCHING UP?<br><br>3) ENYOUTH WILL ASK YOU TO APPROACH YR CLOSEST FRIENDS OR RELATIVES OR EVEN YR OWN PARENTS... EVERY CENTS YOU EARN, YOU EARN IT USING THE TRUST N LOVE THESE PP HAVE FOR YOU, IS IT REALLY A RIGHT WAY TO EARN MONEY?<br><br>4) ASK YOUSELF, ALL THOSE SO CALLED GROUPINGS N SEMINARS N SUCCESFUL MANAGERS WHO APPEARED SO CONCERNED ABOUT YOU N YR FUTURE, WHAT ARE THEIR UTIMATE PLAN OR SUMMARISED SPEECH?<br>(MY ANSWER IS: TO ASK YOU TO SELL MORE SO TT E COMPANY N YR UP LINE WILL BE BETTER OFF!!! HEEZ... OF COURSE, YOU R FREE TO THINK OTHERWISE)<br><br>This is my first post, yet it's so long. Sorry about tt guys... Hope pp who r planning to join Enyouth or just joined (Those not so deeply poisoned) can benefit from my post.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Karo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Did you guys regret leaving ? One other thing .. tho raymond lim sounds like an ass in this forum , he truely is someone worth learning from. He did make millions out of these years right ? Ask yourself again .. why did you join the company for those who leave and after leaving  , what have you learnt. isn't those experience worth much more then your so called 5 figure income ? Think again.</div></blockquote>Like wat jojoma said,<br><br>I can't help it but believe Enyouth really taught you guys a good speech. For those planning to join Enyouth, I really hope you guys can think twice. I seen so many of my friends blinded by the lure of those cars, high income n so called friendship. On top of these, they blinded people by claiming they don't need you to have any cert, qualification... they don't care about your past... As long as you are willing to work hard... Let me re phrase the true meaning for you guys... In short they are saying: We don't need you to have cert or experience, we want you becos we believe you definitely have auntie n uncles n friends out there who care for you n will support you. Here in Enyouth, we do not make use of you cert or expertise, we make use of the love n bond between you n pp around you becos this is the only way our company can sell our products... To be frank, if you put enyouth's products on e shelves in shopping center, e sales will be damn bad. E fact tt they r selling today is becos they r making use of e trust n relationship between humans.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Well, actually i don't wish to comment on Enyouth but i really don't wish to see anyone getting cheated by Enyouth. cos it's not only you who get cheated, you will cause your relatives n friends... all those tt love n trust you to get cheated too. E ultimate winner is definitely not you... I hope all those planning to join Enyouth will think twice.<br><br>Thank you...<br><br>Karo SJ</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jus an opinion, hope its not offensive to anyone.<br><br>I met a young girl (less than 21years old) one day along with her fren or shall i say ex husband??<br>&amp; she was outrighthly rude and arrogant<br>boasting that she is drawing an income of $10k per month at this so call SLM company.. I mean I heard of MLM of cos but never SLM.. and she was elaborating how good their company is.. etc.. of cos I was amazed. I offer for a visit to her company but at another day cos i wasnt free that day.<br><br>Later I learnt that she was blabbering 'big' all the way cos she refuse to bring me over to her company to see cos she cannot produce the evidence.<br>I learnt she came from enyouth<br>and doesnt have much achievement with the exception that she came from a rich family so is using money against people.<br><br>I feel so cheated. If she was not drawing such income, pls dun create such an impression against people and drag your company's name down. I can be your potential client but with such arrogant crap, I doubt I will ever want to step in cos I wonder what breed the company is cultivating. If you want the best fishes, you go to the best pond.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>saw this posting and was very curious about some things happening. Heard that there are few sdms who just left the company recently also and some didnt appear for office for a long time. I even heard from a friend who work inside the company that there is a sdm who din wan to continue in the sales team and wan to jus help out in the support area but recently didnt even see him in office. He was very puzzled since if a sdm is earning so much, why he doesnt want to stay in the sales but he didnt ask his seniors as he dont reli dare to probe in the matter. In the end i went to check out the website about more information about this company and find out there is such a thread. Please tell me more so that if it is really tat, I must get him out of that place or ask him dont dump any money inside anymore although eventualy he will be leaving soon as sdms keep leaving. Didnt know this company got so long thread though others are even longer.<br><br>My friend is a minor position inside i think as from what i can hear from him. He is scared but always being motivated by their seniors. I din know about those who just left recently since he told me that he just joined and didnt know those people. think that person who go help out at support side is kelvin or kif. My friend now is still studying in polytechnic and i would want him to focus on his studies instead. he also dont know anything much about that kelvin or kif .. and he didnt go and ask also but he manage to know from some of his managers that he is one who hold quite high reputation from what he told me and well liked by the distributors and kind of low profile.<br><br>Please help me out on this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u have read my first post over here, I am sure u know of the bad experience that I have been through... Hi shoutcast, if I am not wrong, they must have told u, the director of LAdy Warriors is a 21 year old female, only a ITE graduate and earning $10 + K a month rite? and they say she has earned herself a baby mercs or sth from the company. She know how to act very well infront of her new staff.<br><br>Get this right, that was what they told me last year and up till now, this lady director still hasnt drove her "baby mercs" over... They are just trying to mark up the amount of money they earn.. If they are really earning $10+ K per month, their annual income would be ard $120K a year, meaning they are eligible to apply for a PLATINUM card. A plat card, not a GOLD card. U can ask them to show u, I doubt anyone of them has it...<br><br>and yes, one thing about them is that they drive luxury cars, if I am not wrong, in the garage near New LEaf cafeteria, there is a blue jaguar, several mercs of the same silver design and a Fair LAdy right?? It is just for a show... They have to do this so that they can CONVINCE people how successful they were, so that people will join this.<br><br>IMPORTANT: They will become rich ONLY AFTER u have joined them, not before that. Therefore, they need to fork out money to create a image, a branding. After they have convinced u, they make the money and its your turn to lie to others about how successful u were.<br><br>I only earned $100 plus during my 3 months there. So, I really hope people out there especially those finishing A or O Levels not to get cheated by them.. They aim for this people whom they think are gullible and easy to convince..<br><br>They cheat ur money after u placed the order by not delivering the goods and eventually not giving u ur goods..<br><br>Ya, i agree.. i was there for abt 6 months and i only earn hundred plus..<br><br>they will say that pple like us did not strive hard to do the sales, all CRAP!! Her name is Miss Christin.. and her Lady Warriors are all AH LIANS..<br><br>Those who believe they can earn big bucks are really idiots.. OH MY GOD..<br><br>In DW Group when they make full use of you until dun need you, they will terminal you. An live example is the female JVD promoted just on July 04 from LW Holdings. She contribute a great number of sales to DW last yr and became the top sniper of last yr whole yr some more... But during she was a JVD she nv contribute much sales, so the company terminal her off and came out a Memo and set to all JV holdings abt her. I feel that the company was very bad and i feel no secure if 1 day i became JVD, will i end up like her?? In fact Christine only know how to squeeze your money, when you no longer in use, she will stab you infront of Joey. So you get sack..<br><br>I'm been in dw for 1yr plus .. i had quit the com for bout 1yr plus.. basically i try to clear the doubt of all u guys had..<br>The product is really gd, i know it as i check info bt biomagnetism, it just tat all the managers and directors there are all blood suckers... come let start from the beginning till u quit ..<br>There lots of way they get u in to the company, by friends who is already working at there, thru newspaper articles, by survey etc..<br><br>Actually in line u can really make alot of money ... i am once one of the top salesman in the company but i get in return is all lies and lies.. who say christine teh frm LW earn bt 10k/per mth, pls lor the credit card she holds is juz a sup card from joey tan lah... they had a affair or i should say she is joey tan mistress... Not only tat, her BMW (2nd Hand with numerous of accidents), Bills and Daily Allowance are also from him. i had a friend who once work under astral mag, he is one of the managers there, he told mi tat all the goods they have is true indeed from supplier but guys do u all know how much is the product ? for a product selling @ 1.5k the cost price is only $30 so now dw they sell their product @ ard 2k let guess how much is the cost price.. actually not every joint venture is bad of cause as for now i dunno cause at my time there wasn't so many venture... &amp; to ziggyboy to earn 1.6k/per mth u tink is alot pls wake up lah u still dun understand the system lah..<br>reason y i quit the company or i should say the joint venture is cause i am being betray by the person closest to mi.. he took over all my credit, sales and sales group even my salary , and when i came to know bt it is all my director instruction u all know y ?? is cause i am a person tat cannot be brainwash unlike the one who took over mi he is juz a coward ... i tink i better stop here cause there is really too much to say bt them, and all the bad stuffs ... just wanna tell u all if u guys wanna know anything bt the company just msg mi or post in the forums i will get back to u all and let u all know as much as i had experienced ... thanks<br><br>I also guess that Christine Teh doesn't earn that much, but her affair with Joey Tan is a bit unexpected??? oopz.. I am only interested in the gossips.. as for the ****ed up things of the company, I think it's already overwhelming!!<br><br>Even before I was allowed to leave, they put me through a barrage of talks on successful people don't give up so easily and such things. But heck, I just nodded my head and said I've made up my mind. Anyway, before I left Christine (if I didn't remember wrongly, the ITE girl?) went out with me and she told me not to give up so easily in life.<br><br>With that, she went to the staircase to smoke.<br><br>Strangely, after many months I've left DW KCG, Christine called me and asked me for one referral saying she needs one last sales to meet target and get promotion. I said no and that's the last I've heard of them.<br><br>Christine (if I didn't remember wrongly, she is a bimbo) heard she cannot pay the rental for her own office at level 16 tat's Y she closed down LW at level 16.<br></div>
