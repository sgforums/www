I only said that the management is not about to close the company. And your reasoning is that based on that incident, the company is closing shop... so I am just saying that despite that, they aren't. As for how far and how high, it depends on how much harder the distributors want to work at it.

To discuss and share our experiences about this company. Am sure the SDMs would be viewing this forum with great interest, maybe even join as a member to interact and gain more info. But i think they arent stupid to start defending themselves online... there are thousands of postings here, and more members hitting on them. Of course there are those who are rash EY ppl and start a thread to defend but the higher ones should... note i said should... be smarter and not join in. So, we should not quarrel or argue with each other coz thats wat EY hope and i m sure they are actually laughing at us fighting against each other and sooner or later they would be saying,:' let them fight amongst themselves and sooner or later this thread would be forgotten'. Frankly speaking... EY is jz another company... wat we all do not like is the method and some of the people there. We should focus on what we join this thread. I am jus stating my thots, you can disagree but ultimately we should look at the big picture</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hi everyone,<br><br>I am personally <span style="color: red;">not involved </span>in Enyouth and neither am I interested in this company. But I grew curious abt this company as my friends and I were being 'targeted' by one of the distributors there.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I have no comments about <span style="color: blue;">how</span> the company distributed their products. It is true that network marketing is one of the 'growing' distribution channel in the new century besides franchising. And no doubt of that, many did lose their time and money by committing themselves in any network company. It really depends on how the company is going to ensure their distributors are all going to benefit from the marketing plan and where the company is going to bring them to in the near future.<br>So, <span style="color: blue;">The COMPANY and ITS LEADERS play a very important role in attributing to the success of their associates.</span><br><br>From what I know, ENYOUTH previously was once known as ASTRALMAG (Do correct me if I am wrong). Many may think that the change of branding is for the better and its rather unnecessary to have worries abt it but I myself do feel otherwise.<br><br>Take for instance, how abt if one day 7-11 decided to change its branding to '7-24' (since it is operating 24hrs daily) and Giordano to 'Go-Blue' ?<br>Or how abt Nuskin to 'New skin' and AMWAY to 'TOPWAY'? Will anyone be able to accept the change? <span style="color: red;">The branding of a company is very important as it helps the consumers to recognise their products and services immediately.</span> Needless to say, if the company does not want to, they will have to keep changing their branding. (get what I mean?)<br><br>And also, I was slightly turn off by the attitude of the distributors there.  In fact, I was so surprised to see one of their distributors scolding vulgar language to show his disagreement against someone else's post. I thought its a cool idea to work together in such a vibrant environment  but I guess its so so wrong.<br><br>Although this is not a school but I guess the environment does play a very important role for the people to grow and learn to be mature in terms of their thoughts and verbal language. If I am one of the prospect of this company and their distributors are behaving in this manner, I guess its going to be tough for me to accept that the company is going to be a highly potential established company. As I believe that in any network marketing comapny, you are not only selling the products or company alone, you are ALSO selling YOURSELF. Leaving a good impression on the prospects is very important for every successful networker. Leaders do play a very important role as this is essential to <span style="color: blue;">upkeep the reputation of their company</span>. But through how the younger distributors have expressed themselves, I am starting to have 2nd views on their leaders.<br><br><span style="color: red;">'Who you follow is what you will become.'</span><br><br>Anyway, I must say that their marketing plan is really attractive but like what I have mentioned earlier, only The Company and its leaders can determine the future.</strong></div>
