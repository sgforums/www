            <div class='col-md body'>It is very good that we stay informed regarding the laws and regulations. However, we must try to stay abreast with the latest laws and not inevitably mislead readers when we share only part of the facts.<br><br>The Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order 2000 came into operation on 01 June 2000.<br><br>It states the following:-<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Excluded schemes and arrangements<br>2. -- (1) The definition of "pyramid selling scheme or arrangement" in section 2 of the Act shall be taken not to include any of the following schemes or arrangements:<br><br>(a)any scheme or arrangement comprising insurance business, or any class of insurance business, so long as ........<br><br>(b)any master franschise scheme or arrangement, or any class of such scheme or arrangement......<br><br>(c)any scheme or arrangement, or any class of such schemes or arrangements, which satisfies the following terms and conditions:<br><br>(i) a person shall not be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to participate in the schemes or arrangement, other than the purchase of a sales demonstration equipment or materials....<br><br>(ii) any benefit received -<br>(A) by any promoter of, or participant in, the scheme or arrangement accrues as a result of the sale ....... of a commodity to any other person;<br><br>...... etc etc...<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So basically the Exclusion Order, as it has become to be known as, amended the existing Act to exclude legitimate MLM businesses that follows the governance and in effect "legitimize" the running of acceptable MLM businesses in Singapore. If you look at the Exclusion Order as a whole, you will notice that it also addresses the other schemes such as master franchise and insurance businesses that follow similar models as MLM.<br><br>Due to the existing MLM Act, such revisions to include such schemes as insurance and the franchise as legal were required. At the same time, the issue of legitimizing MLM was also tackled as the govertment put in place proper terms and conditions that businesses MUST adhere to in order to operate the MLM business here.<br><br>You can check out the ACt and Exclsuion Order from the  www.mti.gov.sg under the "Legislation" part. There is even an FAQ to help people understand the difference between illegal pyramids and mlms.<br><br></div>

However, we must try to stay abreast with the latest laws and not inevitably mislead readers when we share only part of the facts.<br><br>The Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order 2000 came into operation on 01 June 2000.<br><br>It states the following:-<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Excluded schemes and arrangements<br>2. -- (1) The definition of "pyramid selling scheme or arrangement" in section 2 of the Act shall be taken not to include any of the following schemes or arrangements:<br><br>(a)any scheme or arrangement comprising insurance business, or any class of insurance business, so long as ........<br><br>(b)any master franschise scheme or arrangement, or any class of such scheme or arrangement......<br><br>(c)any scheme or arrangement, or any class of such schemes or arrangements, which satisfies the following terms and conditions:<br><br>(i) a person shall not be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to participate in the schemes or arrangement, other than the purchase of a sales demonstration equipment or materials....<br><br>(ii) any benefit received -<br>(A) by any promoter of, or participant in, the scheme or arrangement accrues as a result of the sale ....... of a commodity to any other person;<br><br>...... etc etc...<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So basically the Exclusion Order, as it has become to be known as, amended the existing Act to exclude legitimate MLM businesses that follows the governance and in effect "legitimize" the running of acceptable MLM businesses in Singapore. If you look at the Exclusion Order as a whole, you will notice that it also addresses the other schemes such as master franchise and insurance businesses that follow similar models as MLM.<br><br>Due to the existing MLM Act, such revisions to include such schemes as insurance and the franchise as legal were required. At the same time, the issue of legitimizing MLM was also tackled as the govertment put in place proper terms and conditions that businesses MUST adhere to in order to operate the MLM business here.<br><br>You can check out the ACt and Exclsuion Order from the  www.mti.gov.sg under the "Legislation" part. There is even an FAQ to help people understand the difference between illegal pyramids and mlms.<br><br></div></blockquote>Thanks helpdesk. This is what i am trying to refer.

(EG: Macdonalds, 7-11, Sakae Sushi ...etc)<br><br>Franchise is part of MLM too. If you go to BelAir, they will tell you that they way they conduct their business is just like the above. You pay a certain amount of money to purchase their products and *ta da*, you are so call one of their franchisee. (hahahaha)<br>__________________________________________________________<br>Direct marketing - Is a sub-discipline of marketing focused on driving purchases that can be attributed to a specific "call-to-action". Direct marketing's history in Europe can be traced to the 15th century. It is attractive to many marketers, because in many cases its effectiveness can be measured directly.<br><br>Yakult, Vitagen, Walls ice cream, Insurance, Property, Car, Banks...etc, all uses direct marketing. More and more corporate companies will be using the above strategy to gain more attention and solicitate more business as it has proven to be more effective than other sorts.<br>______________________________________________________________<br>Compensation Plan - Its just how you are being reimbursed for your efforts.  </span><br>_____________________________________________________________<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">In short, you join a company, helping them to sell their products. Just like any lucrative sales job (eg: sell car, sell insurance, sell property...etc) you are not entitled to basic pay. You sell a product,  they give you high commission ( in this instance, the comm plan) and you close sales. The more people you recruit, the more people help you to close sales, the more comm you have. Business logic.<br>Hard work = Money</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Of course, in between, how they conduct their business is than up to individuals. Each individual is responsible for how they conduct their business, be it ethical or not.<br><br>That's why we have so many goverment regulating bodies around.<br><br>And lastly, just to add. When it comes to product refund, i think its very normal, that when you try to refund a product, the salesperson will always try to convince you against it. Try doing this to your just bought insurance policy, property, or even OSIM chair. See what response you get. But in the end, these people who bought from EY did got their refund.<br><br>As long as you are in the service industry, its roughly the same everywhere.</span></div>

Actually, even with this amendment to the existing Act, there were quite a number of confused citizens over the matter. So much so that the government eventually released a further amendment in 2001 to clarify the matter. If any of you are really interested in knowing the legality issues of mlm, you could read the FAQ on the MTI website as I mentioned in the previous post.<br><br>Attached is the FAQ on the amendment that came into effect on 01 Jan 2002:-<br><br><strong>What were the amendments made in 2001 to the Exclusion Order?</strong><br><br>The Exclusion Order 2001 continued to maintain that insurance companies and master franchises would be excluded from the MLM Act.<br><br>However, it also introduced the following rules for direct selling companies:<br><br>Safeguards - A participant cannot be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to become a participant in the scheme, other than the purchase of demonstration equipment which is not for resale, at no more than cost price and for which no commission can be given out. A legitimate multi-level marketing scheme would not impose a financial risk on salespersons. For example, salespersons should be entitled to full refunds, under reasonable commercial terms, for any inventories kept or purchased by them which are not sold to end consumers, so long as the inventories are returned within a period of 60 days.<br><br>Behavioural checks - The companies must not misrepresent the scheme as get-rich-quick opportunities, and should not use fraud, coercion, harassment, or unconscionable means to force people to join the scheme. Instead, the companies should focus their efforts on promoting the quality and features of the products. If a company wishes to show potential participants the earning potential, they must keep records of the maximum, minimum, mean, mode and median earnings of their salespeople in the past.<br><br>Sharing of commission - It is all right for a salesperson to share commissions from several layers of salespersons recruited by him. However, such commissions must be generated by sale of the product or service in question, and not through the recruitment of additional participants into the scheme.<br><br>Hope the above throws more light into this on-going discussion about the legalities of mlm companies operating in Singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
