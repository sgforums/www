            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm  enyouth really is not tt gd not all.<br><br>Been to both nti and enyouth be4 le.<br><br>In comparison: Both are seemingly gd opp scams, but enyouth is worse off then nti.<br><br>1) Enyouth presenter, both presenters who present to me are weak!<br>2) they dun even hav basic dress sense - manager do presenation wearing coat, shirt(no tie) and cargo pants- its WTH lor!<br>3)Though products works fine, their payout is low<br>4)Its a nearly 6year company, but still in singapore, so weak sia.....nti told me they nearly 2 years but hav office in indonesia and going into malaysia soon.<br>5)From wad i noe of networking, theirs is 1 of the lousiest plan u can ever come across nowadays le.<br><br>for nti:they not any better<br>1)though grand, they charge super high "tax" to join......pls lor 450+ - 3400+.....WTH. then when sae i no money, he said: "correct becoz u no money den we want u to join to make money" Crap man......den keep saying their famous qoute : moneys not a problem, they r the cheapest things u can get here"<br>2)Dun exactly understand how they going to earn money plan selling plan and not products......their new agents gonna hav a damm hard time to break even<br>3)Their wad em2all is not realli tt fantastic as my fren said. Its like corked up1,<br>u go see clothes or games, they showing nothing - which means they dun hav tt certain products yet - basically its juz an shell tt is half-empty. Coz only like 50% of the products are actually available.<br><br>But then again gd points they still hav(but onli if u hav $$$ to join): their carfund is more then enyouth by i think 2500 if i not wrong. Coz they payout by USD and hav a fixed exchange rate of 1.7 instead of current 1.6+<br>2) they are goldmine, which ENY dun hav, and the plan allows downline to overtake uplines who slacks and do nothing.<br>3)1 obvious 1 would be their dress sense.<br>They are much much better groomed then tt ENY bunch of typical singaporean. Who even sits in the office in army uniform. Dun hav basic  respect 4 their job, so lazy!<br>4)In nti u are able to withdraw out yr money via the net and transaction anytime u want unlike traditional monthly paychecks<br><br>1) however, in ENY u definately earn more in short-term compared to nti, coz selling products definately easier then plan - which means get ppl to join<br></div>

I've seen how he work with me from his ED position until today he is a car achiever. haiya...say sooo much also no use. I also dunnoe y i'm replying you.<br><br>Anyway, don't say until like that lahz.....what "If its soooo good, then everyone in Singapore will quit their job and go into full time?".....den i think, u should take this sentence and brand it on those who keep gambling every monday and thurs for toto and wed, sat and sun for 4D! Isn't it beta this way:"If sure win, then everyone in Singapore should quit their job and gamble full time!"...or why not this way,"If LAN gaming can earn money, then everyone in Singapore should quit their job and play game every day!" etc etc...u see wat i mean? Choose To Be Believe And You Will See, Unfortunately, Often People Choose to See And Then To Believe.<br><br>Do you have religion? You believe in GOD, Buddha etc? Believe? You seen them before? No? Then what makes you believe? Coz its that faith, that trust you have in you, like many of us in EY. Dun think u understand. You will only choose to be negative, sceptical. No religion? Good! Because you believe in yourself, you have that faith in yourself. But you think others believe you? They are negative of you! Why? Not happy of what I say? Because you are pratically doing the same thing to EY? Isn't it?<br><br>Enuff said. More than wat is supposed to be said. Think before you say, think when u say and think again after you've said. Thats maturity and stop the whining just because YOU can never succeed here or YOU don't believe in succeeding here! Finding reasons and excuses.....argh...normal singaporeans which I can't deny the fact I was and I am like this but I chose not to be like this. Take care guys. Bye!<br><br>Regards</div></blockquote>not all people siao in gambling or in gaming...so those who realli gambles alot or gaming everyday is like u lor...wasting time only...haha</div>
