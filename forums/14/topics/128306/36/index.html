            <div class='col-md body'>And to answer the question of why people are so negative about mlm although it is legal..... is really a matter of many angles.<br><br>Generally, I feel that people would not personally hold grudges against an entire profession or industry simply because of "dislike". Very few people are so extreme. One reason I think could be because these people or their friends/ relatives had bad experiences with one or more mlm companies or mlm people.<br><br>Poorly trained mlm distributors are abound and many. As much as each company trains their staff, there will always be complains and negative feedbacks. People are only human and tend to carry emotions at work. On a good day, everyone is patient and really friendly... try meeting a customer service agent who has had their worst day of the week and you'll probably get treatment not expected of the buying customer. MLM, being a generally "more exposed" industry with its many distributors proporganting its opportunity and products will definitely earn their fair share of neativity. And precisely due to its "open nature", it will be prone to much more negative attacks.<br><br>Negativity does not stem alone from the result of badly trained distributors but it is one of the contributing factor.<br><br>MLM will always have its share of distractors. Not everyone enjoys the idea of people "profiting" as a direct result of their contribution. But in reality, in every business, the business owners + shareholders earn more than the clerk, the administrative ,  the sales and marketing people of each and every profit organization. Whenever, there is a need to cut out overly high expenses, profit organizations always have the option of retrenchment and such measures in order to preserve the bottomline for their owners and shareholders. Ofcourse there are instances whereby the bosses themselves take a pay cut to be on the same level as their staff. Genuine cases of such bosses docking their own salaries are few and few in between. And somehow I suspect in some cases, performance bonuses will eventually cover back the "cut".<br><br>I think this is very long post. Going to take a break and post again later.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Precisely because of the many confusion raised by the public who are not savvy or rather not "exposed" to the mlm trade, the government of Singapore stepped in to impose the guidelines for maintaining a legitimate mlm business in singapore.<br><br>Too many times, people have been duped in the past with illegal pyramids operating with a farce. People were cheated and scammed. Many plonked in their life-savings in hopes of making it BIG through the promises of these so-called mlm companies which were actually illegal pyramids in-disguise.<br><br>Therefore, you will see that the amendment - Exclusion Order - actually makes special mention and provision for the safeguards against such schemes.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Exclusion Order 2001  introduced the following rules for direct selling companies:<br><br>Safeguards - A participant cannot be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to become a participant in the scheme, other than the purchase of demonstration equipment which is not for resale, at no more than cost price and for which no commission can be given out. A legitimate multi-level marketing scheme would not impose a financial risk on salespersons. For example, salespersons should be entitled to full refunds, under reasonable commercial terms, for any inventories kept or purchased by them which are not sold to end consumers, so long as the inventories are returned within a period of 60 days.<br><br>Behavioural checks - The companies must not misrepresent the scheme as get-rich-quick opportunities, and should not use fraud, coercion, harassment, or unconscionable means to force people to join the scheme. Instead, the companies should focus their efforts on promoting the quality and features of the products. If a company wishes to show potential participants the earning potential, they must keep records of the maximum, minimum, mean, mode and median earnings of their salespeople in the past.<br><br>Sharing of commission - It is all right for a salesperson to share commissions from several layers of salespersons recruited by him. However, such commissions must be generated by sale of the product or service in question, and not through the recruitment of additional participants into the scheme.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Under "Behavioural Checks", you can read that the law state that "companies must not misrepresent the scheme as get-rich-quick opportunities". Often, people have been told that there is no free lunch in the world and yet people time and again fall for the same trickery.<br><br>In mlm, it is the same, there is simply no substituition for hardwork and perserverance in the scheme. If ever any company promises you easy get-rich-quick scheme, get out. Or listen, if you really want, but evaluate before you action. The final call is still yours to make, as the consumer or potential distributor. There is simply no such thing as guaranteed success and it is even more out-of-this-world to believe guaranteed success WITHOUT effort.<br><br>And if you read point 3 regarding "Sharing of Commission", you will notice that the sharing of commission model as stated in the legislation is really simply the same model of sharing of commission in many other modes of businesses too.<br><br>When "uneducated" or "untrained" distributors share their facts wrongly to their prospects, the ill effects of their poor presentation spiral even after their prospect have left and gone home. The business opportunity sharing had in effect turned into a session for the prospects to remember as a scandalous affair.... Who doesn't love a scandal? And the entire situation spiral deeper and the cooking pot is set to be blown up at some point.<br><br>I think distributors representating their companies should be more mindful of themselves and the professionalism that they should carry on the job. The mlm industry is like any other industry, it needs its people to grow so that the industry grows too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In many threads regarding the mlm industry, people wondered regarding the legal issue of a mlm business operating in singapore. Some thought that a licence of some sort was required to prove that the business can operate here.<br><br>Evidently, other than a business being required to be registered with the RCB, there is no requirement for any other "special" licence.<br><br>From the MTI website, their FAQ answers this particular query:-<br><br><strong>Is there a special license required to conduct those types of businesses listed in the Exemption Order? </strong><br><br>Companies whose business schemes fall under the Exclusion Order are not required to obtain a special licence.<br><br>Hence, the mlm industry is like many others. They operate a business legally. However for some "black sheep" company, they probably contravene the local laws knowingly and hope to make off with some big bucks within a short period of time. I would think that companies who have been in the business for a while would more or less be legal and those that actually have DSAS membership are legal as they do have to send their Compensation Plans to be evaluated by soliciters to ensure that they are in conformance with the relevant laws and regulations.<br><br>As for why I personally feel that companies that have been around for a while tend to be more legitimate? - Well, people grow with time and companies grow too. To stay competitive and survive in this marketplace is no easy feat. Companies incur costs to stay in business too. Therefore companies must make the bottomline. If I were an illegal company, I'd make the money and run away from all that bills!<br><br>The question is really not just that mlm companies attract the negativity but rather poorly trained representatives "misrepresenting" themselves. People are a company's "first line" or "front line" and the image presented to the public by the "black sheep" of the family suffocates the rest of the goodness of the company.<br><br>It is really not easy to evaluate each company and simply easier to pin the blame and flame the company for whatever misgiving we suffered, our friends suffered or runoured to have suffered.</div>
