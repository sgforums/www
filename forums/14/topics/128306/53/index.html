              <p>Well, the thing I hate about Enyouth is the complete utter lack of ethics or conscience by most of the agents. Like... tricking people down to the company, using psychological warfare, insulting your job in an attempt to shatter your morale, etc. Giving false hopes, etc...</p>

              <p>redstone, -&gt; sales no good, boss pressure or boss greedy ? downline too stress so must think of the fastest way to do sales. hence, the faster way = unethical ways ?&lt;- maybe this way is proven to be effective even it is unethical? teach downlines = more recruits = more sales more money?</p>
              <p>i ask abt VE from a fren of mine also. unlike EY, VE doesnt pressure him to buy their product n yet he didnt bought any. he also told me he got 2k/mnth + dunno what rank liaoz. i go ask again... plus his upline only earn 4k.</p>
              <p>VE recruitment is somewhat similar to job interview according to my fren.</p>
              <p>anyway back to EY, i guess they are just desperate or greedy people who always see fren n relative as $_$ face.</p>
              <p>i still remember that time i went down. after the dm talk cock finish, he ask whether i wan to join or not, i refused him,then staright after i went to smoke with my fren ,who brought me down in the EY lair, at the back alley near the toilet(great place to sneak out lol) the DM went rushing to me and try to pyscho me again. lol. i could feel his desperation somehow. he also tell my fren not to bring me out through the alley, instead , he ask him try to use the front door(and my guess - he will be guarding the fren door til i agree to join lol). well, my fren sneak me out of the hell hole anyway.</p>

              <p>They always say... "one satisfied customer will tell 6 people of his experience". BUT someone who had been deliberately tricked as part of the "company tactic" would tell even more people about it. It's paradoxical. They trick people down, they can give lots of excuse for it, and wonder why people hate the company so much. Then they use psychological tactics, to insult and say that your field is useless, sure fail, etc and attempt to shatter your morale.</p>

              <p>This is very unethical... MOST of them do this... I myself disagree with this kind of tactics as it will only spoil the market... I believe that the uplines teach the downlines to do this... However, I am certain NOT all of them do this...</p>
              <p>FIY, I am now in VE, and I do disagree with these unethical tactics(aware that lots of VE ppl use this tactics)...I try to discourage VE ppl to use this technique, but they say I newbie dunno anything yet. So I must climb up using ethical ways then maybe they'll follow...</p>
