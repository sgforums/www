              <p>You can still try to pick the bone out from eggs if you want to since this is just a vicious cycle of the mlm thread in sgforums.</p>

              <p>It's a Yes/No Answer if you want a honest answer.</p>
              <p>If you're from a netural party, I'll be more than happy to share where I learn from, but unforunately, you're not - based on my own accessment of your thread replies.</p>
              <p>I'm not a pro-mlm, I'm more towards the neutral side since it's only a stepping stone for me in actual fact.</p>
              <p>the good news is, I've found a better trade for myself to venture in, and I call the shots myself. It's actually something to do with Anti-MLM Agents..lol.. (You can see from the way I reply/post to determine if what I'm doing at least holds business ethics, values and protecting business rights/information etc..)</p>
              <p>There are lots of things which is learnable and its free if you get in, but ppl are just too 1 sided..</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I've picked up more than what is required for me to learn about sales and marketing from mlm already so I'm now on my way to another direction.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Saying good-bye to MLM and embrace Marketing.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As to what type of marketing, I will not reveal due to reducing competition. (Typical selfish entrepeneur behavior - Lol)</span></p>
              <p>However if you like to know more, I'll be happy to share what I can reveal only if it's relevant yet will not pose as a danger to expose my own desired trade nor business secrets.</p>

              <p>They do survey because they wanna sound you out so to determine which product/(s) to push to you so as to throw u into a washing machine and spin you crazy, when you're knock out by their lengthy speech, rushing wanting to go home, but not without a product, u will be forced to buy. then their objective will be fullfilled.</p>

              <p>Can somebody from EY clarify how much is the production cost of the magnetic bed and how much are they selling to customers?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From what I find out from internal source (Those achieved DM), it cost around $100 +/- to produce and it is sold to customer at a very extreme marked up price of around $1600 +/-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this true?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If this is true, wow, a profit of $1500 per bed sold!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the company sold 1000 beds in a year, they can make $15,00000!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No wonder people from EY can show off their cars. Hey those who foolishly bought their product, u are one of the contributers to their cars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Deep down inside the hearts of EY staffs, do u really think they care about your health? They just want to close as many deals as they possibly can.</p>
