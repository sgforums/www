            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Just here to add my objective view on this subject:<br><br>I guess there are alot of Networking companies out there who uses different techniques for recruitment. There are also bad horses in each company, be it Corporate companies or networking companies. But there's a fact that we cannot deny that majority of the products sold by Networking companies are not bad.<br><br>Eg: Bath Soap from NuSkin smells heavenly on your skin even after a few hours. The dietry fibre from Melaluka proves to be very good to our digestive systems and it helps in detoxicficating our system. The calcium pills from Amway really did help alot of woman in strengthing their bones. And of course the F.I.R mattress from Enyouth also proves great help for our blood circulation.<br><br>People who joined all these Networking company, i believe what you should look at should be the following;<br><br>1) Can you firstly trust the person that brought you to the Company?<br>(long time friend, relatives, brothers..etc)<br><br>2) Why would you want to explore other money generating opportunities in the first place?<br>(need to support family, pay for studies, extra pocket money... etc)<br><br>3) Are you comfortable with the enviroment that you see?<br>(are the people there serious in this business or are they there for fun...etc)<br><br>4) Do you think you can succeed in this enviroment?<br>(Main point is not in what company you join, but what kind of person are you. If personally you are a fighter, you'll excel in any sales job that you find and the boss will be very pleased with you. You will also expect a high flying career. But if you are not, it doesn't matter where you go. You'll also keep on complaining about the company, the system, the people and everything but yourself.)<br><br>Motivational talks in Networking industry is roughly the same as what you will find in financial industries. Their basis is the same. I encourage people who attend these talks to take the seminars as an educational ones, meaning listen to those things that are applicable to you, and dump those information which is not. Only this way, can we improve ourselves. This is applicable to any talk or seminars we sign up for. Sometimes, the speaker may be good. But not all of the content may be suitable for your case. Therefore as adults, we would have to know how to identify and filter information.<br><br>Lastly, i would wish to add, by writing "things" about any Company here will prove to be very foolish of us. Cause while those people that we talked about are still earning big bucks, taking their over ridings, and here we are writing our ass off without being paid a cent. End of the day, the only way to prove them wrong will be to be more successful than them.<br><br>And whether you like it or not, the Networking industy will boom in 2008 when Singapore host the Worldwide Direct Selling Assocaition Congress in Singapore. I believe that a string of marketing campaigns will be held before the actual congress. And the Govt will explain more in detail what this industry is all about and how it can help us. This industry have proven to to be the 3rd most profitable company in the whole world as stated in Fortune 500 magazine. If it can help U.S to improve their econmy &amp; they have been doing it for the past 50 yrs, i'm sure this industry will help spur Singapore and many countries too.<br><br>My conclusion will be, look for a suitable Company that you are comfortable with. And make sure you are at the top before 2008. And you'll reap the profits. Don't be like the bubble tea owners. Monkey see than monkey do, in the end all die together. The person who benefits the most is the pioneers who started the business than sold off to other owners. Don't be sour grapes. Make sure you can be better off than all of those whom you have mention. As for you, your friend brought you to Enyouth. You left the Company. If one day, your friend were to suceed there, and drive you around with his / her BMW, how would you feel? Nothing is more important than having money in your pocket. Face the fact. You and your family need to eat. Your bfs &amp; gfs need presents. You need a trip overseas to relax. All these need money. But earn it without betraying your conscience, that's more important. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Yap. Agree. There's always both sides to a coin. It just depends on which way you want to look at it. For me, i just don't like to regret. If i see an opportunity, and when i dont see myself having anything to lose, i'll tend to go for it.<br><br>This is quite applicable in a sense, when you like someone and even though you can't be sure this person will be your last love, you'll still go ahead and woo her.<br><br>In your sense, if my friend is still struggling to survive, i'll salute him/her for their perseverance. Cause with perseveranvce, you'll tend to go a long way no matter where you go. And the tendency to succeed is higher. Without perseverence in your belief, job, relationship or whatsoever, you'll always end up nowhere but blaming everyone but yourself. And other people's success is always on luck, and you just happen to lack it.</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spycampers:</div><div class="quote_body">hmm... how about look thing in another way..<br>few years down the road.<br>ur friend who bring u down to enyouth..<br>is still struggling to survive..<br>while u have make it big in other business...<br><br>how will u feel?<br></div></blockquote></div>

When you have made one, do not blame others but yourself.<br><br>In this industry, there are definately people who made it, and heaps of people who don't.<br><br>Forgive me for being frank.<strong> For these people who agreed to sign the forms in the first place was tempted by the thought of an additional income</strong>. But in the end, their focus on the topic was not not on how tedious this route is or how much determination and hard work you need to have in order to make this work or how much sales have they done and the Company is owing them commissions. But they are talking about how they was so call cheated to sign the forms.<br><br>If you study this industry's busines model carefully, you will know that this industry only have irresponsible leaders but not leaders who will want to harm you. For a simple reason, they need to have a big group in order for them to get the desired income. What good do they have to "cheat" you up and psycho you to buy one product and have you bad mouth them for the rest of your life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I'm here typing my first reply. Is not to say whether enyouth is good or not. But more of. Why is everyone looking down at Network marketing.<br><br>Malaysia had been on network marketing for over 50years.<br>Amway had been doing for 70years, and can you tell me what happened in their first 10 years of operation? Can you tell me that all the people worked during that period actually stick to the company.<br><br>In this country. As long as the government didn't say "yes, it can be done" more than 70% of the people in Singapore will always say it's a scam. I really wonder. How people really succeed in the business world with such a mindset? What is wrong with Raymond? If he really is such a sucker. So what? At least he got people who believe in him. And he is earning freaking big bucks. The reason i see that you are flaming these companies is because you THINK and ASSUMED these companies will give you a monthly pay of over 2000 plus without much effort into it.<br><br>To all the people who are really wondering what the fuck is MLM or Network Marketing. It's just like franchising a product of a company. Just that you no longer have to pay for the rental fee of a shop, the advertising of the product. You just have to be a business man who uses the product. Then pass the good words around and people buys from you. Then when you start earning. You knows that this can bring food to your hand. You start bring people in. When they start selling like you do. You just got more food into your house.<br><br>Whats so hard to accept MLM? I strictly do not understand about it. So what they come up with the car incentives? So what with the title. It's just a way to make people who work there feel that there is a goal that they can achive. And not to just keep selling like a farking salesman. When first MLM came to Singapore. All you guys did was to say that it's another salesman job and all went "fuck off". Now that MLM is working for some fellow mates. You start saying that it's a scam. Cause some people earn enough from the business and left.<br><br>Seriously, when they left. i believe they don't "quit" the job. Cause in the end. If they have the mouse running below them. The pay cheque still comes. Why there's people saying that MLM are quick money. Or easy money. Because when you reach a certain level and you have a group of network down your line. The people will eventually start earning and some of the earning goes to you. Thats why they say it's earning easy money.<br><br>But you have any idea the time and money they put in before they reach that high? You think that the transport money, the food, the phone bills are cheap?<br><br>Plus, have you ever thought, why people want to join MLM. Because they know. if they work hard enough to build up a network of their own. They can start to relax alittle.<br><br>You try working for a company. You work like a shit dog and gets a few thousand back home. After 10 years and comapny boss says: " Hey pal, thanks for the support you gave me all these while. But i'm sad to say, you are too old to stay here. Please leave"<br><br>Do you see these MLM companies doing that? No. People who did get the people to support them. Join them. They earn big bucks. They think it's worth it. Then those who can't seems to wait for the ripe fruits to dropped walk away and start telling people that the trees there never drop a single fruits. It's just because you are seeing others picking up the ones that dropped at their side of the tree. IT'S luck for goodness sake. Can't you see? There are chances of earning money and hardwork to make. But what is most important is also the luck of finding the right people to support you in these line of work. There are people who keep having people banging their house door on their face. But they kept working and standing their ground.<br><br>Even they got flame by fuckers like you. They know that if they succeed, they are the winner. No matter how hard the road is. And you here? Hoping to walk in to the "big bucks" on a carpet pavement? No, the bigger the money seems to be. the harder the road is. So whats so "scamming" about these companies? They do not ask you to fork out a big sum to buy some shit. But more of asking you to be a customer. Whether you want to buy or not.<br><br>People like you who got convinced by them. Bought it in a "hot head", realise that you don't need it. Comes over here and start saying they are scam. So, i can say. Lots of girls can start saying that fashion shops are scam. They are cheating girls to buy clothes that doesn't even look good on them. Isn't it?<br><br>I don't even know why am i here typing all these. Maybe because i'm tired of seeing people who are spreading the words around saying that the grapes are sour, when they didn't even really taste it before.<br><br>Love,<br>Arily.<br><br>PS: I might not reply. But i'll try =)</div>
