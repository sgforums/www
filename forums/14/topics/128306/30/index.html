            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, my friends keep asking me to join this company. I was quite convienced to come down to pay a visit. But seems like there are a lot of people from the same industry trying kill each other. Cos I went to other thread of other company, its usually the same person trying to kill each other.<br><br>To qualify, the more i read, the more i start to suspect the intention of each individual.<br><br>What if i join, thereafter this industry (in singapore) don't florish as it seems to be in other countries because of people killing each other?<br><br>(I guess: stop the religious war) My personal view only, don't wack me pls...<br></div>
