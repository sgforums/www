            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, i juz recently joined enyouth n certain things they do i do not approve... but believe me when i say this, those credentials they received r not bought with money. they invited people come down to look how they function n they were given the ISO (Issued by International Organisation of Standardization), i know bcos i studied how accreditation companies issue those. And their Products r True! i have studied in the field of healthcare and by the way how they describe their products and how they work, i agree with them, simply bcos i knw! their products mainly are aimed at treating Hypertension, Cardiac Diseases, Kidney Diseases, Liver Diseases and Rheumatism (pain in the joints, esp knees). it also improves blood circulation. i m intending to get a set for my parents bcos my dad is diabetic n hypertensive. what's more, the product comes with a 10 year warranty! if they r not so confident with the product, y would they give such a long warranty? think abt it. but 1 thing i would advise is, guard your heart well n stand firm in ur beliefs n integrty. and they also have a far-infra red therapy for the products.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The benefits of static magnetic fields is still very vague... Inclonclusive... It's just that people don't bother to come out with a book to counter the claims... unlike Da Vinci Code  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> See their PET and you'll know that it's a bunch of bull.... If there's an improvement, they'll claim that it's because of the benefits of the product, if there's a deteoriation, they'll claim that it's a warning sign for any impending problem blah blah... Either way, they're saying the product is good...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for their other health supplements, should be good. but, there're many other cheaper alternatives in GNCs and nature's farm etc <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Moreover, the main grudges against Enyouth is always about their twisted culture, people and system...
