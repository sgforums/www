            <div class='col-md body'>hmm nv expected my post to generate so many replies (after my 'friend' tricked me into going for that dumb seminar), nor did i expect enyouth to still be up and going about their shady business. But it still looks like many pple still take the usual stand of being anti-mlm, personally i don't like their marketing tactics nor the way the pple behave when trying to get you into their company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i seriously dun encourage to join. i was trick there n forced to take the product which they claims haf use for alot illness. they were also veri confident say that they would gladly refund the money if pdt got no effect which really has no effect at all.. instead my dad condition got worse. went back to confront n they insist the pdt is good. when i say abt the refund thing, they just refer me to top management n ask me down to company n explain the full detail. i said i will bring my sis along n they were like damn shock, kept asking me not to bring my sis. fishy there? they were trying to influence me again. of cos i wont go down office. i chose a cafe instead. n yup.. Enyouth has breached the law of DSAS. 2 laws to b exact n there is no nid to pay for the DSAS. guess is just the company wan to recover the cost of printing the stuff all these. Enyouth has no ethics at all.. DUN TRUST THEM. i m writing a letter to their top management n see wad reply they gif.</div>

James Phang.... Quality is almost same everywhere..... Stocks come in from CHINA and they buy in Bulk...

Else its really not feasible that company still need to rent cars for "CAR ACHIEVERS"<br><br>Hanging ard at the coffeeshop will never make a company successful, pls go and get a proper office and do it with PRIDE. In EY with the same teaching, BF/GF casual sex partners and ONS are so common and not in the discreet manner... its like SDU... The BOSS himself got caught humping a gal executive in OFFICE got caught on CCTV by wife so now the wife abandon him and therefore he is in shit(INSIDE INFO). Beat up LIM BOON HONG in public.... U are who u mix wif.... when u wanna be successful u must be with someone of standard and with capabilities and not those who HUMP ard with own ppl or beat ppl up....<br><br>OPPORTUNITY??? Magnetic Therapy in Mkt since 1980.... 27yrs already??? where got KANGTAO still?????<br><br>IN MLM important points to note or consider before embarking on a new journey.......<br><br>Product got MARKET or not???<br>Company Creditbility and Reliabilty (Background)<br>Awarness/Marketing/Advertising campaign good or not???<br>Celebrity/Medical Endorsement???<br>Big Group MNC Retail Partners???<br>Mediocre Prices and affordable with results proven and cheaper by buying direct.<br>Company Admin/Logistic Support???<br>People you working with???<br>Pioneering Stage with FACTS or Pioneering stage by talking...(some company after 5 yrs still pionnering.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br>Public Events, Roadshows<br>No Pressurising Tactics nor insult to parents or watsoever<br><br>If any company can fulfil such conditions... Its worth a try<br><br>Personally i will never try company that is SHOUTING CRYING AND RIDCULOUS CULTure type.... PIONEERING FOR THE PAST DECADE, Company full of DYED HAIR SCHOOL DROPOUTS, OR BEST GALS EXECUTIVE SHOWING BRA AND BREAST TO ALL PPL IN THE COMPANY.<br><br>Unfortunately, there are alot of such company in the market.... therefore Tarnishing the TRADE...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enyouth has some new recruitment tactics now. They post jobs and recruitments advertisments online to attract people to make enquiries. Then they will contact you for an interview (which is claimed to be informal) at their office. But before that, there's the usual dinner trick (which may or may not be at the coffee shop) to make you think EY is a company with very friendly corporate culture blah blah.<br><br>From my own experience, I would say that EY presenters lack of basic presentation skills. Probably because they do it too many times, the pace of the presentation is too fast. The system sounded to complicated and confusing to me (maybe this is their purpose). The presenter I encountered cracked many jokes which are not funny at all.<br><br>They need a lot of training because I could tell that others at the presentation were also not convinced.<br><br>The company makes me feel very confident of myself because I am better educated than most of their so-called managers. They don't even sound better than those student leaders from my secondary school. Maybe I am being to mean, but if you don't want to waste the money you spent on your education, don't join kids' company. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys,<br><br>jus to add my experience with enyouth here, i would like to add wad i have encountered.<br><br>first of all, my fren (we have usually been in contact) called me told me there is tis  place with nice food she noes of and wants me to join her for lunch there. And the location venue was : clarke quay. i was like erm clarke quay gort nice food meh n sorts. so when i reach the place she told me another fren of hers will be joinin for lunch n guess wad she brought me to their famous coffeeshop gathering place. her fren was pretty much very late n i gort to wait for her when i gort other plans instead. when she came down den she started to share wads her company n wad they do n hw ez it is to get to the top position. (she nv talked abt the products). then she keep asking me to go up to their office, but thank god i nv went up). tis fren of mine was like showing me the BMs her managers gort n they like gort the $ to keep changing their cars n so forth. &gt;&gt; end of meeting 1<br><br>so out of my curiosity on wad my tis fren's new job is ( after knowing she is in MLM n MLM is so much infamous), i met the same manager as of meeting 1 cos she say she want to share hw one can werk thru successfully on enyouth ( she made me went down to clarke quay again but again she is late ). when se reach she decided not to tell me anything but jus plain chit chat ( so basically i went down n got no info out of them but she still tells me to join). &gt;&gt;&gt; end of meeting 2<br><br>den my fren arranged for another meeting at the same place again ( tis time round she brought another manager ) then she roughly told me a few of the products they had n even tell me that their magnetic therapy beddie stuff is proven to useful n backed up by NUS. guess wad, as dealing wif materials macroscopically n microscopically is one of my forte, the report they showed me was 1. nothing conclusive, 2. they removed the SEM pictures which was the most important details of the report 3. report was of shoddy quality, the kind where undergrads could write.<br>the manager also refused to let me leave, unless i joined their association. n suggested me to buy some products home to try ( n i didnt) n they made me late for my other appointment &lt;&lt;&lt; end of meeting 3<br><br>then after tt my fren ask me to get the starter kit from her on one fine evening n meet for dinner n share some stuff with me ( i tot wad n she made me go down to clarke quay again) tis time round i brought my gf along since after tt we planned to go somewhere else. when we got there i saw one big group of her associates n they jus plainly chat n leave. neither did i get my starter kit nor get any sharing frm them &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; end of meeting 4<br><br>then another new deal came she tell me she will be goin up stage to collect a prize at tis event ( from the co) n wants me to go see her get her prize n pass me my kit. when i went there i wasted one entire nite, n she nv gort any prize , n she nv bring my kit &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, end of meeting 5<br><br>then on the way i found out she thrown in thousands of dollars in their product n i also found out her manager keep making her ask me to take product. then she made me go down another time for my kit again, n i brought my gf down again ( obviously they dun wan to tell me more abt their product or werk schedule n secrets to their work). when they saw us her manager said  she din bring my stuffie down ( n made me go down empty) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; end of meeting 6<br><br>she brought the kit down finally (late again) n nv share any stuff as she promised n of cos the kit had no product details in it &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; end of meeting 7<br><br>finally my fren ask me to go down again to share stuff wif me ( i decided not to turn up, most probably its another useless meeting, cos my OWN FREN has been telling tales to her manager abt me).<br><br>points to make: 1) attitude of the managers &gt;&gt; are they even selling products when the very first tink ppl wanting to sell their products will hope that every one noes their prdt by word of mouth n etc n gain interest in them.<br>2) sharing of company details n stuff ( until now i noe nuts abt their point of their company)<br>3)hw come get a kit need to go down so many times. jus pass me the stuff will die issit? (they made me pay 50 bucks n they are so reluctant to gimee anything&gt;&gt; did the mangers pocket the $ since dsas no nid to pay de?)<br>4)they nv gimme the actualli product infos n etc, how do they expect me to sell? ( n of cos their main point is to get me to buy, but i dun even noe wad they haf in all, den hw to buy?)<br><br>last point: they just made me see wad kinda fren i gort.<br><br>catnmousegame<br></div>
