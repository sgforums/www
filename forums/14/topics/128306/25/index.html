            <div class='col-md body'>They're affilated with DSAS. DSAS members are supposed to refund no questions ask 7 days (cooling period).<br><br>Anyway, you can logged a complain to DSAS and CASE. BUT that wun get you back your money.<br><br>You must go to their counter (think on the top floor) to DEMAND for a refund directly. Please do not waste time speaking to the distributors. Of course they'll try to convince you not to as their commission is on the line. You must be insistant enough. Do not take no for an answer, because even the counter staff will try to refer you back to your group's SDM to speak to you. If your parents are the loud mouth type you can ask them to come along.<br><br>Goodluck.</div>

That time, I bought this cleansing with toning &amp; ALA+ and Phyto-C Plus product from enyouth. They said this product are very good.At bottom of the bottle, It written astral mag pte ltd,those disturbutor say that only singapore got this mlm company which other country don't have.Somemore, the liquild of cleansing is very watering after I use all the product there is don't have any effect. It like normal.<br><br>spycamper, How they mix the product of cleansing,toning &amp; ALA+ and Pyto-c Plus? They got their own factory or in their office got a hidden place to make the product sercertly ?Why they use the billy DJ of FM97.2 of his sickness as a promoter to sell the product? Why they also use the magic word ''  To make people Healthy '' ?Will you think those younger generation who continue working in enyouth will get stuck? will you think they will feel very stress that they do not have money to pay their bill?<br><br>When I walking pass-by, I went to the carpenter st to see how they surive it. I went there , i saw them like restless standing along the carpark smoking like strugling,wasting time wearing with formal uniform and long pants. That time , I use to see alot of car park at there, but nowadays, very few cars parking at there somemore i don't know why those people working enyouth,they park their BMW car at the back lane but not at the main carpark. I do not know why ? Spycamper, can you tell me? I just saw they only drive around the carpenter st and why not all over the place? is it they no liences at all? I even saw the person who drive me to tao pahyo, but his face look like very stress. He just like talking jokes with me and say'' Never mind it's ok I can bring you to the place'' will you think he drive the car but without liences so he worry? Somemore he just buy the cheapest drink &amp; food to eat. Somemore working in enyouth shall have high standard and not eating in those kind of hawker centre wearing with nice clothes. Will you think the car they drive all are rent or drive his parent car?<br><br>One of the guy looks like gangster, But where can be owning a car. But i read from his friendster info , the car which he driving is rent from the car rental. Is it he want to show off that he rich?Will you think he got any driving liences? </div></blockquote>They dont park their car there because they dont put coupons and those wardens come regularly at that street, so they hide their cars away from there hoping they are not caught with no coupons. Common sense answer, us your head and think. I am not their people but my friend who are in there told me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the list will goes on as days,weeks,months and years goes on. MLM just doesnt and will not work in Singapore. Here is not like States, Malaysia, Taiwan or so. A MLM Co that existed for near to 7 years and still looking for pioneer can say that they have never really grow much. We are not talking about tradtional corporate business or co where their growth is slow. For MLM, their growth should be fast and tremedous as they are making use of replication and multiplication business model. Take for Nuskin (I am not and will never be a nuskin distributor) for example, they only take 9 years to be shortlisted in 33 countries stock exchange and become an international brand. Just use your head and think where was Nuskin when they are at 7th years of operation? At least half or more of the achievement i listed above. EY distributor ask yourself what have EY done till now? Just a kuchang kurak achievement. I can only say the greatest achievement of acquiring Carpenter st offices, joining venture with an Renowned Entertainment and Event management co, iso, scientific advisory board etc is just a minor and small fraction what Nuskin had done. For what EY had done, i suppose Nuskin had done it their 1st year or so. To make matter worse EY have implemented Maintenance system which previously they proudly claim they dont have and different from other mlm co. In this maintenance system if you dont reach your quota per mth, your earnings of your downlines will be flashed to your upline which mean if your downline earn alot and you dont maintain the quota, your supposed earning will be taken by your upline!!!<br><br></div>
