We really appreciate it.<br><br>i went down to the company with my friend. it was quite easy for my friend to get back the money. not much trouble given. probably for the fact that brokenluv went down with us (Thank you!!!!!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">). and my victim friend found out that manager's cousin is our former classmate. our former classmate sms the manager about it. maybe that's why the money was gotten back without much trouble.<br><br>as usual, like what most people said the the forum, they tried to convince my friend to stay. and even offered to down size the bed from a king sized to a single. in a way, it's like helping the to secure some point values.<br><br>my friend haven't exactly got back the entire sum because they said the amount is too huge and need to go through the accountant. it'll take about 2-3 weeks for her to get her money back in full amount. and they charged her a hundred dollars for administrative charge. it's very silly isn't it? brokenluv, who was a victim before, argued to them that there's no administrative charge incurred on him few weeks back. i would say they're quite smart because they wrote in the terms and condition that administrative charge will be incurred depending on the decision of the management or something. not very sure. it basically means that they have the flexibility to decide if they wanna charge the administrative fees and how much they wanna charge. but oh well, what to do.. at least can get back most of the money. i really hope they won't drag and not return the money to her.<br><br>my victim friend introduced me to that company using the same tactics.. haven't meet your for a long time and let's go for a meal. i went and take a look. thankfully i didn't agree to anything even though it looked really enticing. i didn't felt at ease. something's fishy. and who would actually buy these overpriced products? does it really work? if it's so easy, why are there so few sdms in the 8 year old company? i feel that it really takes a lot for those people up there to stay there. they don't exactly have to risk much of their money. because the only risk they have to take is the relationship with their loved ones.. the trust, faith and love that you've been building. when they bring in their friends or relatives, they bring in because they wanna create more downline. and downline = more income and more point values. so it's really not as easy as what they say to stay up there. it's rather ugly.. i must say.<br><br>my friend and i learnt quite a bit from this event. i really feel that many people don't know how dirty and ugly it can get. i feel that there should be some awareness drawn to the mass especially gullible and young teenagers like my friend and myself. because this may be another expensive lesson for someone else to learn from. do you think bringing these to the media can be helpful?<br><br>p.s. many thanks to those people who offered help to my friend via call, sms and pm. and thanks a million brokenluv for your help! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and oh yes, we noticed that most of them have some serious obsessions with cars. we were sitting on the sofa while waiting for the manager. and we noticed that many of the staffs would go to the window and looked downwards. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  maybe it's a way to psyche themselves to work hard for a higher positions and the car incentive. umm, interesting. haha.</div>

You are all being duped!!!! You all only got 7 days cooling period to get the refund, after that, the co got no obligations to return even a single cents to you!!! By that time they might just refused to give you the money!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe the refund shud be given back since they gave a black and white of the refund, stating that the refund wud b given back...? this is kinda a serious case if they r goin to deny the refund..i was there as a witness as well so if they dare try anything the company's in trouble.</div>
