            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I was the one who used "RUN'!! and I still standby that.<br>As for you, I shall wait and see how long you will stay in ENY....<br>Meanwhile, best wishes to you! ....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dranoel:</div><div class="quote_body">for those who are flaming "RUN" pls answer the following qns<br>Have u been working in EnYouth before?<br>If not, how can u defind them as scammers? Is it becoz ur fren say so? Den did ur fren work in ENY before? Or they fren told dem?<br><br>If u did work in ENY, wat position did you held? How many days have you been to company? How did the company scam people? They didnt pay you? They receive money but never give goods to customer?<br><br>The products are certified by NUS report to be true. The system accquired ISO 9001: 2000. The company is protected by DSAS, Direct Selling Association of Singapore (awarded by government). How is this scam?<br><br>If you guys think mlm (and btw if u include ENY in mlm, tat means you don even understand how things work as ENY is a SLM, single- level marketing company) is immoral, have u guys realised that all of us are doing mlm everyday? You watch a movie, tell ur frenz its nice, ask them go watch, izit tat network marketing? In ENY, you try a product (which is 100% optional), and if its good, u tell ur relatives and frenz its good, buy or not is another matter.<br><br>If you discredit the questionablity of the product, may i ask are you a certified doctor or a scientist? Wat makes you so sure that the product is fake or out to con others? You used it? isit from ENY or other companies? If not, pls mind your words and stop acting like Mr-Know-Everything to discredit others<br><br>Flaming is easy on the net, you don't have to be responsible for your words but as i believe people here are educated and responsible, i wish to express my plead for the stop on these unfounded discrediting.<br><br>Any futhers queries can be addressed to me, will be willing to help out.<br><br>Last but not least, in everythin we do, there are people who make it, there are people who don't. In exams, people get A's and people get Fails. If you wan to get a A, you would obviously ask those people who got A's and how did they did it? Would an idiot go ask a failure? Same case there, no doubts there are people who don't make it, they failed only because they either give up or didnt put in efforts. Thus, they began enjoying defaming the company for scamming and such. Lets face it, man always put the blame on surrounding and never reflect on what they did. No efforts = no gain, isn't that right?<br><br>Stop feeling skeptical and negative about ENY or networking as even the government is promoting it now. The world still turns without you. u can stand there 20years not turning with the world, come out of it to realise it changed alot without ur knowing. Anyway, juz giving an advice as defamation is against the law of tort in singapore. Your future is urs, nothin to do with me ^^<br><br>GL HF!</div></blockquote></div>

You watch a movie, tell ur frenz its nice, ask them go watch, izit tat network marketing? In ENY, you try a product (which is 100% optional), and if its good, u tell ur relatives and frenz its good, buy or not is another matter.<br><br>Last but not least, in everythin we do, there are people who make it, there are people who don't. In exams, people get A's and people get Fails. If you wan to get a A, you would obviously ask those people who got A's and how did they did it? Would an idiot go ask a failure? Same case there, no doubts there are people who don't make it, they failed only because they either give up or didnt put in efforts. Thus, they began enjoying defaming the company for scamming and such. Lets face it, man always put the blame on surrounding and never reflect on what they did. No efforts = no gain, isn't that right?<br><br>Stop feeling skeptical and negative about ENY or networking as even the government is promoting it now. The world still turns without you. u can stand there 20years not turning with the world, come out of it to realise it changed alot without ur knowing. Anyway, juz giving an advice as defamation is against the law of tort in singapore. Your future is urs, nothin to do with me ^^<br><br>GL HF!</div></blockquote>all these script are so familiar.... they really teach u well.... everyone who juz join them and are highly motivated will use these "tai chi" whenever someone spread -ve.. u got potential....</div>

Now its they want to convince other people leh? When u're trying to sell something, u have to sell it to people, not expect people to automatically come buy from u? I thot this is something basic all competent salespersons should know? Their own silence is not convincing anyone, and im certainly not going to help them by going down to their HQ to check. They want, they provide a cert number for verification. Otherwise, they're all just cheating people.</div>
