Very sly and inethical thing. I've had 5 people approach me "do u know what u're here for?" when i was tricked down. So I confronted them, they'll always just walk away or say "u'll know later". This "business" method is a shame to the corporate sales world. Enyouth deserves its current reputation as a trickery company.</div>
