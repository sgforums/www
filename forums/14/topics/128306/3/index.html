            <div class='col-md body'>sorry for coming back and replying so late. Pretty bz recently.<br><br>Heng, u wan ISO cert, go get it from carpenter Street company 5th floor and stop bugging us acting like an idiot. Comments are free anyway, I can always claim to be CEO of SIA here, who knows, who cares.<br><br>Since no1 here, after so much of flaming can give concrete evidence of ENY scamming or cheating people, I suppose that would be just plain empty talk. Unless some1 can prove me wrong otherwise.<br><br>Yes many people have left, they left not because the company cheats people isn't it? They left because they personally don't like how the company works? Weak, how often do U see people doing things that they like? They earned a huge sum, realised they don't like doing it or tink they are too good for tis job now hence they leave? Presumption of reasons why they leave and not coz of company cheat people<br><br>Furthermore, there are people ard who can prove the claimed 5-figure income, what makes you tink they are cheating? U CANT DO IT DOESNT MEAN OTHERS CANT! Don be a fugger. 1 word for people who cant do it and claim them cheating (and u noe it urself), WEAK. For those who have done it and still decided to leave, I respect you for ur preservance in company although I have no idea why u choose to leave.<br><br>Last but not least, Hi there NEMY and catbyte.<br><br>A word of advice for people ard, in this world, when there are good people, there will be bad people as there will be comparison.

They left because they personally don't like how the company works? Weak, how often do U see people doing things that they like? They earned a huge sum, realised they don't like doing it or tink they are too good for tis job now hence they leave?
