            <div class='col-md body'>Was involved in this incident a few days back. Was a little fed up with myself for being a little too guillbile. Thought I share my experience with people so that they have a clearer picture of what is actually going on in companies like this.<br><br>I was called up by some fella asking me whether I'm interested in a job and all. Me, having nothing better to do, decided to meet up with the contact at Clarke Quay MRT the next day. I met up with him the next day at about 3 in the afternoon, where I was directed to this building somewhere nearby the station. He brings me to the highest floor, where he briefly introduces me to the company, the acheivements of his boss (there was a television show where he appeared on, talking about how he got back on his feet after repeated failures), and the products they sell.<br><br>Ok. After the sight-seeing, he brings me a few floors down to this "activity room", where he brings me around to see further acheivements made by the company and staff (showing me stuff like photocopied pay cheques in 4-digit sums), and introduces me to some of the product distributors. In the next couple of hours, I'm given a briefing on how this supposed SLM (Single Level Marketing) "business concept" works and another on the kind of products they're selling. Up to this point, everything looked professional. The me then was compelled to join, as the profits they claimed were indeed rather attractive. It sure looked like a lucrative industry for people to make money, AND with relative ease, I might add.<br><br>Went for a short break in the form of a late lunch at the nearby coffeeshop in between the briefings, accompanied by one of the staff, where I was told and shown (by the posh cars of the senior staff parked nearby) of more achievements made by the people in the line. I also supposedly managed to get my "doubts" clarified by him. The little chat that was held helped to "let my own guard down".. And having been won over by the warm hospitality of the people in the office, I decided to stay on and find out more.<br><br>.. And that was what things started getting awry for me.<br><br>Back later in the office, one of the SDMs persuaded me (now that I think of it, it's more of PSYCHO, not persuade) to get one of the products, some bed that makes use of magnetic therapy to improve blood circulation. Thinking back, he was rather smart in his choice of words and systematic approach to get me hooked on the deal. First he emphasizes on the aspect of fillal piety, using my grandmother as the reason to get the product. Then he focuses on the differences in profit a 1st-Level distributor gets in comparsion with a 2nd-Level one. I was idiotic enough to be completely convinced by the offer, and it wasn't long enough before he brought out an order form for me to sign. A few seconds later, I freaked out at the amount I saw - $1650. It was probably peanuts to him, but it definitely wasn't to an 18 year old.<br><br>I tried to shove the deal aside, but was once again reassured by him, saying that he will pay the remaining of the cash first (I agreed to pay an initial deposit of $200). A few minutes later, I find myself being accompanied by a female staff who led me to draw money at one of the nearby ATMs. But, thankfully, as my pay for my previous job didn't go through yet, I was left with insufficient money to pay the deposit. Thus, I was told instead to pay a sum of $70 which was apparently for the distributor rights to DSAS. I blindly complied with the request.<br><br>A little later, back in the office yet again, I find myself being shown around to the people all around, congratulating me on becoming a member of their "big family". I was introduced especially to many of the SDMs, those people who have made it, who gave me advice on "putting in the effort in the job to make it far" and "not telling others about my decision". After a brief chat with the guy who "closed" the deal with me, I was told to come back the next day at 1230 for a "group meeting" where I would be informed of what to do. I still remember him flipping through a magazine showing a series of posh cars before he left in a great hurry.<br><br>"If he can do it, why not I?" I thought to myself.<br><br>On the trip back though, I freaked out once again. The thought of starting a job which requred yourself having to break even quite a substantial amount was startling to me. I thought with much gloom about the long hours I had to endure, about the time I would have to sacrifice with my friends in order to clear the financial deficit I got myself in.<br><br>Back home, having my suspicions getting the better of me, I decided to look online for any sources of information that could let me know better about the job and all. After a few moments of searching, I landed myself in one of the threads in Sgforums, and to my horror, I saw posts about all sort of negative things about the job itself. Exaggerated as many of the posts seemed to me, it still made sense and logic in return to the advice I was offered earlier. It was only until then that I realized I had been well and truly conned.<br><br>I went to the DSAS site, hoping to understand the regulations. To my relief, I found a line which stated that there was a 7-day cooling off period where customers could cancel their orders from their sellers should there be no monetary or product transcation taking place, which had to be clearly printed in font 12 text on the product invoice. Well, at least it wasn't that bad now, knowing that I didn't have to pay for something that could actually be gotten at a much cheaper rate (as what I had discovered in the forums).<br><br>So the next day comes. After some serious consideration, I decided to forgo the offer, thinking that I wouldn't have the time to commit myself to the job. I msg-ed the SDM thanking him for his time and effort, cancelling my order and requesting my $70 back. I was then later told to come down where he could talk with me over my decision, to which I gave him a meeting time and place. Strangely enough, he hasn't replied since then.<br><br>I do not know whether he is busy or whatsoever, but from the way it seems, it does appear evident that it will be a challenge just to get my $70 back.<br><br>While I admit I voluntarily agreed to all the things, there is definitely something with their business ethnics that I find very questionable. WHY THE BIG HURRY FOR PAYMENT? Hey, I just signed for something, and the next thing I know, I'm told to go down to get the money. I do not understand in any way why they are rushing customers to give them the cash.. Or more specifically in my case, why am I being rushed to supposedly "invest" in a company product where I've not even given time to consider whether I should go ahead with the job in the first place?<br><br>In a way, the case is reflective of their sincerity - It gives the impression that they just want to close the deal quick, get the cash quick, then shake the customer off once he foots the entire payment and gets his product. I feel fortunate that my lack of funds saved me from making a potentially wrong choice.<br><br>Another thing is that while I admit that there looked to be people who can make it big in this line, how many actually don't? Sure, it looks impressive with all the figures the SDMs are boosting to get each month, but how many actually are fortunate enough to get to this stage with all the effort they put in? In my opinion, many of the promises that the people claim are not quite what they are. I understand that the coporate world is a complex place - But using such a method to give youngsters a wrong mentality towards money-making as an easy thing to do.. I think that's rather underhand.<br><br>I am not sore regarding the possible loss of $70.. I just feel the need to highlight that it takes more than just effort to climb the ladder. If you can go against your conscience and say that money is more important than anything else, then I'm afraid I can't say anything further.<br><br>People interested in the line, please do seriously consider before you decide on anything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my edited version of lifezone88's post for everyone's reading convenience. I have tried to rephrase it in a more understandable format to the best of my abilities. &gt;<br><br>Hi .... I'm new in sgforums.<br><br>I'm a chinese boy who is 18 years of age. I have read about those people who wrote into the forum about enyouth. And I must say, I was also a victim. I was contacted by my friend to meet up at clark quey mrt station. She still works in enyouth presently if IÂ’m not wrong. She was my friend from amk ITE who always used to play truant.<br><br>When that girl arranged to meet me up at a coffee shop, there were two other guys accompanying her. They wore very nice clothes asked me if I wanted to drink a few rounds.  I obliged and joined in their sponsored drinking session, which was apparently barley actually. After the drinks, they queried about my interest in cars.<br><br>Thereafter, they brought me to a building where I was taken to an office in the top floor. They show us an article pasted at the wall describing all about car achievers and their success stories. They then led me to a room for a group talk. After attending the talk, I decided to join. However, I had to pay $14 for the business package. They also persuaded me to buy their products. I was introduced to the product. They also taught me the tricks of promoting the product and convincing the customer. One point to note was not to push too hard and when making an appointment, it was a definite no-no to disclose the name of the company or workplace premises. The way to lure prospective customers was to ask them out by the suggestion of an Â“outingÂ”. Now who would be the people to call? I was told to ask myself who would be friends that were close enough to me to the extent that they would bail me out of jail if I were ever in trouble. Those would be the prospective targets to get in touch with. I was persuaded to purchase the therapeutic bedsheet they were selling. A guy even said he bought one for his sick mother by pawning expensive jewellery. I was shown a receipt as proof. I was then further persuaded by their salesgirl to buy one too and was accused of being selfish to my family when I declined. She claimed she used her savings to purchase one for her parents.<br><br>Do you think this is a scam? Some of my ITE friends have joined Enyouth. Do you think the company is blacklisted? The incident happened a few months ago and hence I wish to share the experience I encountered.<br><br>My first appointment made to sell the product was with my friend whoÂ’s 36 years of age. Before the meeting, I was asked to memorise a script to convince the party over the phone to agree to my meeting at the cafe. During the call, I was immensely stressed and was rushing through the conversation. But I was told not to ever disclose the companyÂ’s name in any circumstance to avoid suspicion. My friend was asking me where I was and I told him I was outside. When questioned on why I was to meet up at the proposed place, I quickly changed the topic and at last, he agreed.<br><br>Then my upline who had pulled me in also accompanied me to the meeting point. When my friend got to know about it, I felt like a liar and a betrayer. The appointment still carried on nevertheless. When it was all over, I returned to the company with my upline and after that I returned home. I felt like I had wasted my time. Later on, my friend called me to ask me more about the whole affair and I told him my upline was teaching me the ropes of starting a business in distribution. I was warned by my friend to be careful. Fortunately, I have quit since January. When my upline got to know of it, she chatted with me over msn and wanted to know to reason for quitting. She assured that there would be people to help me out in the promotion. We ended up quarrelling.<br><br>I was at the same time persuaded by another member of Enyouth who asked me why it was a waste of time when I could potentially be a car achiever. I told him I felt it was all fake. He said I was stupid to turn down the chance to earn easy money and a chance to become an sdm (?).<br><br>I have found it a waste of time to go down for groupings and talks. It was usually all about presentations and note taking. When I parted ways with them, I was treated like a stranger.<br><br>My conclusion is: Those newcomers of Enyouth, please quit as soon as possible or you will stand to lose your bright future. It will be a life of without happiness and one where you canÂ’t earn a living. ItÂ’s much worse especially if you do it full time. You spend money out of your own pocket to fix appointments and still, no one cares about your feelings. The money you end up wasting comes up to more than the product you sell. Trust me! Luckily I quit earlier according to my friendÂ’s advice.<br><br>Reading all these posts made me want to share my encounter. I also pity those youngsters who skip school in order to do this business. This is a job with no returns that will make you suffer. There is no basic pay. There is no such thing as easy cash for if there were, there would be lots of people working in Enyouth. You only stand to regret. So quit now while there is hope.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: brown;">Just here to add my objective view on this subject:<br><br>I guess there are alot of Networking companies out there who uses different techniques for recruitment. There are also bad horses in each company, be it Corporate companies or networking companies. But there's a fact that we cannot deny that majority of the products sold by Networking companies are not bad.<br><br>Eg: Bath Soap from NuSkin smells heavenly on your skin even after a few hours. The dietry fibre from Melaluka proves to be very good to our digestive systems and it helps in detoxicficating our system. The calcium pills from Amway really did help alot of woman in strengthing their bones. And of course the F.I.R mattress from Enyouth also proves great help for our blood circulation.<br><br>People who joined all these Networking company, i believe what you should look at should be the following;<br><br>1) Can you firstly trust the person that brought you to the Company?<br>(long time friend, relatives, brothers..etc)<br><br>2) Why would you want to explore other money generating opportunities in the first place?<br>(need to support family, pay for studies, extra pocket money... etc)<br><br>3) Are you comfortable with the enviroment that you see?<br>(are the people there serious in this business or are they there for fun...etc)<br><br>4) Do you think you can succeed in this enviroment?<br>(Main point is not in what company you join, but what kind of person are you. If personally you are a fighter, you'll excel in any sales job that you find and the boss will be very pleased with you. You will also expect a high flying career. But if you are not, it doesn't matter where you go. You'll also keep on complaining about the company, the system, the people and everything but yourself.)<br><br>Motivational talks in Networking industry is roughly the same as what you will find in financial industries. Their basis is the same. I encourage people who attend these talks to take the seminars as an educational ones, meaning listen to those things that are applicable to you, and dump those information which is not. Only this way, can we improve ourselves. This is applicable to any talk or seminars we sign up for. Sometimes, the speaker may be good. But not all of the content may be suitable for your case. Therefore as adults, we would have to know how to identify and filter information.<br><br>Lastly, i would wish to add, by writing "things" about any Company here will prove to be very foolish of us. Cause while those people that we talked about are still earning big bucks, taking their over ridings, and here we are writing our ass off without being paid a cent. End of the day, the only way to prove them wrong will be to be more successful than them.<br><br>And whether you like it or not, the Networking industy will boom in 2008 when Singapore host the Worldwide Direct Selling Assocaition Congress in Singapore. I believe that a string of marketing campaigns will be held before the actual congress. And the Govt will explain more in detail what this industry is all about and how it can help us. This industry have proven to to be the 3rd most profitable company in the whole world as stated in Fortune 500 magazine. If it can help U.S to improve their econmy &amp; they have been doing it for the past 50 yrs, i'm sure this industry will help spur Singapore and many countries too.<br><br>My conclusion will be, look for a suitable Company that you are comfortable with. And make sure you are at the top before 2008. And you'll reap the profits. Don't be like the bubble tea owners. Monkey see than monkey do, in the end all die together. The person who benefits the most is the pioneers who started the business than sold off to other owners. Don't be sour grapes. Make sure you can be better off than all of those whom you have mention. As for you, your friend brought you to Enyouth. You left the Company. If one day, your friend were to suceed there, and drive you around with his / her BMW, how would you feel? Nothing is more important than having money in your pocket. Face the fact. You and your family need to eat. Your bfs &amp; gfs need presents. You need a trip overseas to relax. All these need money. But earn it without betraying your conscience, that's more important.</span><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SolidSnake:</div><div class="quote_body">Here is my edited version of lifezone88's post for everyone's reading convenience. I have tried to rephrase it in a more understandable format to the best of my abilities. &gt;<br><br>Hi .... I'm new in sgforums.<br><br>I'm a chinese boy who is 18 years of age. I have read about those people who wrote into the forum about enyouth. And I must say, I was also a victim. I was contacted by my friend to meet up at clark quey mrt station. She still works in enyouth presently if IÂ’m not wrong. She was my friend from amk ITE who always used to play truant.<br><br>When that girl arranged to meet me up at a coffee shop, there were two other guys accompanying her. They wore very nice clothes asked me if I wanted to drink a few rounds.  I obliged and joined in their sponsored drinking session, which was apparently barley actually. After the drinks, they queried about my interest in cars.<br><br>Thereafter, they brought me to a building where I was taken to an office in the top floor. They show us an article pasted at the wall describing all about car achievers and their success stories. They then led me to a room for a group talk. After attending the talk, I decided to join. However, I had to pay $14 for the business package. They also persuaded me to buy their products. I was introduced to the product. They also taught me the tricks of promoting the product and convincing the customer. One point to note was not to push too hard and when making an appointment, it was a definite no-no to disclose the name of the company or workplace premises. The way to lure prospective customers was to ask them out by the suggestion of an Â“outingÂ”. Now who would be the people to call? I was told to ask myself who would be friends that were close enough to me to the extent that they would bail me out of jail if I were ever in trouble. Those would be the prospective targets to get in touch with. I was persuaded to purchase the therapeutic bedsheet they were selling. A guy even said he bought one for his sick mother by pawning expensive jewellery. I was shown a receipt as proof. I was then further persuaded by their salesgirl to buy one too and was accused of being selfish to my family when I declined. She claimed she used her savings to purchase one for her parents.<br><br>Do you think this is a scam? Some of my ITE friends have joined Enyouth. Do you think the company is blacklisted? The incident happened a few months ago and hence I wish to share the experience I encountered.<br><br>My first appointment made to sell the product was with my friend whoÂ’s 36 years of age. Before the meeting, I was asked to memorise a script to convince the party over the phone to agree to my meeting at the cafe. During the call, I was immensely stressed and was rushing through the conversation. But I was told not to ever disclose the companyÂ’s name in any circumstance to avoid suspicion. My friend was asking me where I was and I told him I was outside. When questioned on why I was to meet up at the proposed place, I quickly changed the topic and at last, he agreed.<br><br>Then my upline who had pulled me in also accompanied me to the meeting point. When my friend got to know about it, I felt like a liar and a betrayer. The appointment still carried on nevertheless. When it was all over, I returned to the company with my upline and after that I returned home. I felt like I had wasted my time. Later on, my friend called me to ask me more about the whole affair and I told him my upline was teaching me the ropes of starting a business in distribution. I was warned by my friend to be careful. Fortunately, I have quit since January. When my upline got to know of it, she chatted with me over msn and wanted to know to reason for quitting. She assured that there would be people to help me out in the promotion. We ended up quarrelling.<br><br>I was at the same time persuaded by another member of Enyouth who asked me why it was a waste of time when I could potentially be a car achiever. I told him I felt it was all fake. He said I was stupid to turn down the chance to earn easy money and a chance to become an sdm (?).<br><br>I have found it a waste of time to go down for groupings and talks. It was usually all about presentations and note taking. When I parted ways with them, I was treated like a stranger.<br><br>My conclusion is: Those newcomers of Enyouth, please quit as soon as possible or you will stand to lose your bright future. It will be a life of without happiness and one where you canÂ’t earn a living. ItÂ’s much worse especially if you do it full time. You spend money out of your own pocket to fix appointments and still, no one cares about your feelings. The money you end up wasting comes up to more than the product you sell. Trust me! Luckily I quit earlier according to my friendÂ’s advice.<br><br>Reading all these posts made me want to share my encounter. I also pity those youngsters who skip school in order to do this business. This is a job with no returns that will make you suffer. There is no basic pay. There is no such thing as easy cash for if there were, there would be lots of people working in Enyouth.
