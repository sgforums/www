Isnt it overkill?One thing i rejected many companies because of high maintenance, meaning high sales quota for a period of time to achieve returns or income.<br><br>I asked my friend what is the lowest price of an item in Bel Air. She said $50 ++. Problem is aromatheraphy products are not in high demands as other products, and with relatively high price, it is not easy to sell, although you will still achieve some sales.<br><br>I hope your friend mean group sales requirement, and not personal sales. But even then for group sales, this is the highest group maintenance requirement i seen so far. Even the second highest I seen so far doesnt come a tenth of this.<br><br></div>

We DUN get our supply fr Lampe Berger Asia-Singapore branch here k. We got our supplies directly fr France... Didnt haf 2 deny anythin... N 4 ur info, our CK Tang counter onli started off like 2-3 yrs ago, but Lampe Berger is not 1st launched so late... Itz already in e S'pore market since long liao.

Itz in fact v convenient n easy 2 use. Yes, u haf 2 lite up a flame on e catalytic burner, but itz onli 4 abt 5-8 mins. Tats all. Unlike those candle burners, ur flame goes on n on til it finishes burnin. Juz imagine e amt of carbon dioxide u inhale?<br><br>Itz easy 4 Lampe Berger lah... An hr b4 slpin, juz lite ur lamp up n rem 2 off it b4 turnin in. As simple as tat. I dun see anythin difficult wif tat? N itz definitely gd. Not juz becoz ppl wanna make money. Althou im not workin 4 tat company liao, i stil use their products n feel tat it helps... Ok, it may b expensive, but since u already decided 2 "invest" in dis product, u shd b prepared -in terms of money-wise spent on dis products...<br><br>If u tink u cant afford 2 keep spendin money on it, den dun start it in e 1st place liao... Coz if u use, u tink itz gd, u'll surely continue usin it on n on...</div>

Plus you wouldnt want people to join in this type of biz wont you, or else they get your market share too.

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand that the Wong is the sole agent for the whole of South East Asia. Normally under such circumstances, CK Tang can import direct from France but certain profit margin be paid back to Wong with his approval.<br>Very few people will use their products long term. You know MLM tactics, the distributors will learn from the Company to overclaim on their products and many LP customers are stuck witht their bottles.<br>I know someone in Malaysia is collecting LP bottles cheaply and resell as used item and make a small profit margin. This is one of the reason their business was affected and they changed system  by asking people to join in a form of an investment, as much as RM20,000 for a beginner.<br>I am not saying the product is no good but the MLM price is definitely not value for money, when you can get it for less than half its price from U.S. Any products must be evaluated with its price, right ?</div>
