            <div class='col-md body'>I know once upon a time, nobody will advertise for MLM products.<br>But these days, I see people giving out flyers on "Lose weight" and "Do business" which obviously is some wellness products of MLM companies.<br><br>I remember last time they were not allowed to do this.  They were only allowed to talk to people first, then hand out flyers.  This was a restriction by law, I think.  But what is happening now?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe in the personal touch, thats why I dun openly advertise...Only through sincerity can one actually share the business...with the helping pple mindset...advertising seems more like desperately looking for pple, which is not what it shld be..and my philosophy...only those who are interested I will personally explain etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I choose to believe that MLM is a people communication business. Sincerity, honesty binds network. But once a while good advertisement is a good strategy for invitation and even mass recruitment. I think there should be a balance of both.<br><br>Unfortunately, sincere and honest MLMers are hard to come by nowsaday. And like what the rest have mentioned, subtle sell may not work as well as before now. Probably they have to re-inject/innovate and think of some new marketing strategies from time to time.<br><br>Yes, I've also came across professional website done by mlm groups presenting their professionalism and unique identity. Some of them are really good.<br><br>I think doing survey in public needs a licence from the authority.<br><br>Cheers,<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My awareness about Diamond Water is that it is a MLM company. I do not know much about this company, but feedbacks about Diamond Water product were superb.<br><br>Yes, it used to be that MLM do not do advertisement in the inception phase of this industry in SG. Strictly by word of mouth only. Then some smarter companies realised that Singapore is too small a market and there was a need to re-inject and reinnovate their marketing strategies and hence we now see advertisements. For a handful few or maybe just one, went further on TV and was a sponsor for NKF show and National Day. Part of a branding process.<br><br>More unique strategies will continue to emerge. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Have a nice weekend.<br><br>Concerned Man<br><br></div>

I have been with BWL for 4 months.....<br><br>We have a manager meeting every month and we get to speak with the founders Dr. Dora and Dr. Doreen, who gives us very good advices in doing our business. One thing I find in this company is that the distributors dun say too much about their skin care product, people usually ask them "how come your skin is shinny, smooth and got rosy cheeks?"  Most people "fall off their chairs" when they realise the female distributors at bwl dun put on any make-up!<br><br>And if you are a Singaporean, why not support a Singapore listed MLM company?

Stock rose 300% within a month! Sales in Malaysia has over-taken Singapore. The upcoming market will be Indonesia. I have been with BWL for 4 months.....<br><br>We have a manager meeting every month and we get to speak with the founders Dr. Dora and Dr. Doreen, who gives us very good advices in doing our business. One thing I find in this company is that the distributors dun say too much about their skin care product, people usually ask them "how come your skin is shinny, smooth and got rosy cheeks?"  Most people "fall off their chairs" when they realise the female distributors at bwl dun put on any make-up!<br><br>And if you are a Singaporean, why not support a Singapore listed MLM company?  By the way, BWL has also won the "Singapore Promising Brand" award. </div></blockquote>there are so many singapore MLM companies.. why BWL? lol.<br><br>anyway, there are alot of people out there that dont do make up and dont use bwl but their skin still very good. hmmm... how to explain this??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
