The rich do get richer, but they also get poorer, like wise for the poor. Anyway, so what if a book is best selling? It just meant it's a popular book, but filled with good advice or not is not necessary. Cocaine is so hot selling, but does it mean it's any good? Macdonalds is so hot selling, but does it mean it's very healthy? Anyway, RDPD is on a few best sellers, but doesn't mean it teaches u the correct stuff. If you look at the books reputable financial magazines or institutions recommend, like Forbes, RDPD is not one of them.<br><br>It may be New York times best seller, but it doesn't mean much. New York times also not a full fledge financial news paper even it does have some financial news, just like Straits Times is not a full fledge financial newspaper.<br><br>Robert Kiyosaki got famous because MLM companies started buying his books in bulk and distribute them. That's why you see he keeps praising how good MLM companies ah. If he doesn't recommend MLM, why would MLM companies buy his books? He may have pointed out some interesting facts about finance in his books but many things written are quite questionable. Read at ur own risk!</div></blockquote>exactly.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>here is the 10 reasons:<br><br>Why the Poor will Always be Poor<br>An article taken from web site of Wallstraits.com<br><br>There is an old saying: The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It's true, and there's a logical explanation why it holds true in every capitalist society. Put simply: the rich understand the difference between an asset and a liability, and the poor never quite get it. The rich work for investment capital, while the poor work for disposable income. The rich buy appreciating assets and allow returns to compound, while the poor buy depreciating assets and live paycheck to paycheck. The rich live a bit below their means until their compounding investment returns supply enough passive income to support a lavish lifestyle, while the poor live just at their means throughout their lives.<br><br>I was reminded of the stark distinction between the haves and the have-nots when the Straits Times newspaper carried a cover story about the new Singapore Shares and featured a large color photo of a long line of poor and elderly waiting to cash in their shares on the very first day of issue. When the reporter asked why they were choosing to sell so quickly, they invariably replied, "I need the money". No doubt, their newfound wealth will evaporate before year-end.<br><br>Education is not the key to wealth. Income level is not the key to wealth. Rich parents can lead to wealth, but it won't guarantee continued wealth. Winning the lucky draw is not the key to wealth. The secret to wealth creation is simple: set aside a portion of your regular income in an appreciating asset with compounding returns. One of the best vehicles for wealth creation is the stock market.<br><br>Anyone can be a millionaire by retirement age. That's right, anyone, with any education level, and with any income level. If you can put aside just $25/week and invest it in a stock portfolio that yields long-term returns of about 12%/year, you will retire 40 years later with $1,188,342. Even as low as the barrier is to joining the ranks of retired millionaires, so few, less than 1% of the population, will ever come anywhere close to achieving this simple goal. Why?<br><br>There are basic mistakes made repeatedly and consistently by average income people that lead them down the road to poverty, or lower middle-class at best. The most basic mistake is to buy a lifestyle you cannot yet afford, using borrowed money to make up the difference. Typically, money is borrowed at high interest rates to pay for things that eventually depreciate to zero value. The worse investment is probably a car, which is expensive, has high operating costs, and rapidly loses value.<br><br>Those who never quite figure out the difference between an asset and a liability, and the magic of compounded returns on even small investments over time are doomed to suffer in poverty for a lifetime. Amazingly, no schools offer courses in basic family finance to help avoid such a trap. Too often a car, a stereo system, a new sofa, or a handphone are purchased with credit cards as if they were assets... when they are really heavy burden liabilities. To escape the poverty trap, learn the following lessons. Study them until you understand the principle behind each reason that traps you in poverty. It's not too late to break free!<br><br>Top 10 Reasons You Will Never Be A Millionaire<br>#1 That $25/week means you'll have to go without a Starbucks treat every single day! No way! I'm not into that short-term pain for long-term gain crap. Live for today!<br><br>#2 Instead of living just below my means, I've decided to live just above my means and allow my income to catch up with my lifestyle as I get older. In the meantime, I can support a nicer lifestyle using credit cards and a loan from Mom &amp; Dad. The interest payments aren't that high.<br><br>#3 Instead of buying stocks, I decided to buy a car. My girlfriend loves my Mercedes! My car dealer and banker had no problem lending me the $200,000, so it must be within my means. After the monthly car loan payment, I still have plenty left for insurance, maintenance, repairs, road taxes and petrol. I love to drive! No more busses &amp; trains for me.<br><br>#4 Stocks seem too risky, so I've decided to keep my savings safe-and-sound in fixed deposits with my bank. They are guaranteed 2.5% per year interest and I can't lose my money.<br><br>#5 I decided to invest in stocks, but my broker recommends I sell when I can realize a 10% profit. He say's "you can't go broke taking a profit".<br><br>#6 I decided to speed up the millionaire process from 40 years to 20 years by improving my stock market returns to over 20% instead of a steady 12% per year. I think I can do this by trading speculative stocks as they indicate buy &amp; sell signals on the price chart patterns.<br><br>#7 Instead of buying stocks, I decided to invest in a second property. My grandfather made a fortune in property in Singapore. I can buy a second condo for $500,000 and lease it out for cash flow of $1,000/month. I only have to put 20% down too, just $100,000, and I can borrow that on a personal loan from the bank with my current income.<br><br>#8 I need all my money for necessities today. Instead of saving $100/month today, I'll wait until I'm 30 or 35 and save more aggressively, maybe $250/month, to make up for not saving today. It will be easier to save later because I'll probably have a higher income.<br><br>#9 Instead of saving just $100/month, I decided to save $200/month and retire early as a younger millionaire. The problem is that I keep needing money for some unplanned event that comes up, and it forces me to liquidate my portfolio every so often, then I have to start all over again. Sometimes I have to sell at a loss in a bear market when an emergency comes up.<br><br>#10 I decided to speed up the wealth creation process with some help from my friendly broker, who agreed to lend me $1 for every $1 I invest in my stock portfolio... something called a margin account that effectively doubled the size of my portfolio. It worked great in 2000, as my tech stocks rose 10%, I made a 20% gain! Then when the techs sank in 2001, my portfolio kept falling and my broker kept calling--something called a margin call, that required me to add more money to maintain less than 50% debt level. I added all the money I could, but the stupid stocks kept falling and eventually the broker forced me to sell them all at a huge loss!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read a lot of comments up there.. fyip, this is a forum.<br>Freedom of speech yea.<br><br>Jus a bit of sharing here..<br>So much things have been said.<br><br>There are many ways to earn money.. as to each' standard of Success in life, individuals varies...<br><br>Some people choose to work, business or engaging in investment to reach their objectives. Ultimately, all reaches one point.. but at different rate.<br><br>Im a Networker myself; still I maintain that common respect for all.. on what outcome and decision a person would choose, it's ultimately their life ya?<br><br>On a whole, businesses out there.. be it MLM or Traditional Biz, they are there to provide an income source for everybody. All organisation runs in a hierarcy plaform. The higher level you are, the more income you deem to have and of course.. resposiblities. Every individuals have to go thru the process of getting up there, be it, a boss of a company or employee.<br><br>With regards to MLM, many have negative feelings and feedback. In all kind of biz, some succeed.. many fail. Same things goes here.<br><br>Ultimately, a company success is much dependant in its marketing side.<br>One company can have the best product in the world, top management or hugh company asset.. to me, its factor.. but its secondary. In business simpicity, any business would need Products and Client Base, reflect on businesses you see today.. its running on the same cycle.<br><br>I can see that many members in this forum strong negative feelings with regards to MLM. I conclude that majority might have been 'burn' by it or heard feedbacks froms friends. Qns to ponder about..<br><br>Have you tab into it and gave all out for the biz?<br><br>if yes, did you meet and learn from the right people?<br><br>choosing one's mentor is important, be it even we are in the quarant of employee. you learn the right things, you see result. you do the wrong things, you get nothing. its a simple equation.<br><br>Ultimately, one thing here, factors like company profile is still very important. One should always know one's company vision and development in years t come; and of course, is the company able to support it's development? Its relates to if you are looking at it for long term or short term.<br><br>As pertaining to my personnal development, Network Marketing its has help me diversified into many business industry. Its serves as a foundation and platform to achievement of my life, not jus in terms of income. For me, money is just one part of my life and i do have many areas to further improve and achieve; friends.. family and even my leisure. Importantly, living life to the fullest and being happy the bottom line. then again, to each has its own standard of success and happiness in life. You need not have to be rich to attain that, then again, money is not the main factor in life, but it will affect other factors.<br><br>When we embark into a particular action, we always have an objective, be it seeing a movie, working or dabbing into business. Companies out there can try their best to propose that you earn tons of money if you join them; but if thats not your objective.. you would not see it and therefore commit to it. ie: I can propose you that you hit a five figure income in a month, but if you do not know why you should earn that kind of money, why do it?<br><br>my opinions are on neutral grounds, anyhow, om me if you wish to share with me. no obligations here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Next, try to know more people in that company, talk to their uplines and downlines - if they are Profession Company and Networker, they will introduce you to their other distributors. Attend their company OPP and also weekly OPP. Try to find more about their products. If the company distributor is strongly base on $, then I would advise you not to look further at this company.<br><br>Just feel free to ask me anything, and I will do my best to help you.<br><br>Lastly, NTI has been making a 'storm', but I wonder, how come, I have been so actively in this industry for many years but still haven't been their 'target'.<br><br>Bottomline ritual, do your homework.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The math factor can be illustrated in a simple 6-level chain in which each person recruits just 5 people. at least 3 levels of recruits ( 5+25+125=155) are needed for each participant tp begin to achieve a profit based on override commissions from the purchase of the "downline".<br><br>Top level - 1<br>Level #2 - 5<br>Level #3 - 25<br>Level #4 - 125<br>Level #5 - 625<br>Level #6 - 3125<br><br>3906 participants total.<br><br>Since only those with 3 levels below them are profitable, only the Top Level person and the individuals in levels #2 and #3 qualify. Each of the people in the next three levels below does not have enough "downline" to generate a profit. (Those in Level #4 each have 25 in their downlines. Those in Level #5 have only 5 people, and those in Level #6 at the bottom has none. This means that 31 out of 3906 or less then 1% in the six-level chain, have as many as three levels below them and are profitable. More than 99% are unprofitable based on their positions.<br><br>This basic formula holds true no matter how much further the chain extends. Approximately 99% at the bottom of the chain which profit is not possible. For example, if the scheme recruit one more level, Level #7, another 15625 participants would join. The tota would now be 19531. The number in profitable positions, Top, and the individuals in Levels #2,#3,#4 would grow to 156, and this number would still equate to less than 1% of the 15625-person organisation.<br><br>The tricke of the scheme is to cover up this reality and to convince each and every enrollee that he/she can suceed by building this large and deep downlines. Theoretically, the bottom levels could recoup their money by finding new distributors to join under them, but that would continue to work only if the scheme could go on forever and there were an infinite number of people.<br><br>In summary, if the income opportunity depends ultimately on purchases by sales representatives that are recruited "downline" rather than on the retail sales by those sales representatives, the upline-downline structure will always requrie that the vast majority of sales representative be the bottom of the "downline". Their losses serve as the ultimate source of profit to a very small number in the "upline". The sales representatives occupying the lower level positions on the chain cannot earn a profit until they, in turn, recruit a much larger group of new recruits below them. The proportino of a very small number of sales representatives at the top, where income is possible, to the very large number at the bottom,where income is not possible, will remain the same as long as the business continues.<br><br>Whether such as scheme is deemed legal or not, the losses will occue just the same. Personal testimonies from those at the top, high motivation of participants, inspirational speakers at sales rallies, strict adherence to the "system" advised by the leaders, and extraordinary time and effort of new recruits cannot cahnge the laws of mathematics and the MLM business model, which dictate a massive "failure" rate and a miniscule "success" rate.<br><br>Courtesy of http://www.falseprofits.com. download the pdf file to read more</div>

If you simply understand that you are buying a worthwhile product at a fair price... then NOBODY loses, even those that never make any money. The "LOSERS" are those that pay lots of money simply for the opportunity... when the product is not worthwhile. The reason all Network marketing companies continues to be such a fast growth company is that the product is WORTH IT... even for the person who just buys the product.<br><br>Over 95% of traditional businesses fail too, and I doubt that 99% is an accurate figure for MLM.  I've heard 95% of MLM'ers fail. Again, though, the word "fail" is subjective... they are using the word fail to mean "didn't make any money".  Well... how many people have spent more money than they have made with traditional products bought at the supermarket?? Everyone!  It is a unique business when you can buy a product you love AND actually make money from it.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">The bellow message is to all Network Marketer:</span><br>People will choose to believe whatever they want too. If you can simply present to them a great product whether they make money or not, then you have to let them decide their next step.</blockquote></div>
