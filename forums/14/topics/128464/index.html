Key thing is binary is easiest to explain and fastest to work and in a way makes the most money for the MLM company owner, the MLMers will forever have to try to balance both sides and now and then they will find their money being returned to the company.<br><br>As for the Fix 1-5-25-125-625, it is actually a Forced Matrix System (FMS) used to intentionally force out a pyramid structure that would otherwise exist on paper because in reality, no network organization is a perfect pyramid left to its own growth. So effectively, the 625 people on 5th level will pay money every month to feed everyone above them, and they all have to each find 5 other people to get them to pay every month and get their downlines to keep recruiting.<br><br>So if a "FMS 5x5" is eventually allowed to work out perfectly, the whole world's population of over 4 billion people will be recruited into the system and this MLM company, in a matter of half a year.<br><br>It is the same concept the Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes work on.<br></div>

The perfect pyramid situation is the ideal dream for MLM owners, unfortunately reality do not go this way easily, hence many companies like this will use FMS.<br><br>Think of chain letters, think of other matrix plans, there are signs where it attempts to create this type of FMS structure.<br><br>The structure will keep growing until someone below the pyramid realises that they are the suckers, that is where the collapse begins and starts...<br>... then the ex-MLM owners will move on to start another new MLM company.. taking with them whatever money they have gotten from the current MLMers.</div>

be realistic lah, u will need man power<br><br>as for why binary and not mlm, coz mlm, is not really finding business partner, they juz recuit u into the company and throw u aside, i have being conned into a mlm company for their talk lah, so i noe, and do u know that mlm has break away, so if there is this break away in mlm, will the person u recuit help u? or fight for promotion and earn more commission?<br><br>as for binary, its like helping one and other, coz in binary, they only have two legs, and they also can earn alot, imagine, u managing 5-7 lines compared to 2 lines?. which is a easiler job? and by having 2 lines, u have to help ur friend, by helping ur fren, ur fren will see that u are a good fren and also helping him to earn money also, OF COURSE by helping him, u are also helping urself, so if this is the case, why not choose to help 2 people ; u and ur frenz in binary system compared to a selfish plan MLM which is u help urself only, makes sense?<br><br>its like u have lots of cars and maintence to pay, can u really afford all those, ( not hard feeling, but u just can't anyhow penalise a company without knowing the facts!!)<br><br>2)read books such as Rich Dad Poor Dad?<br>do u know that the company which i was conned into which is a mlm company, i shall not say its name, so as to not ruin its reputation as its not professional to say other companies. they also recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad, and if u didnt read the newspapers, lifestyle section, its in the top 10 selling chart almost every week in the bookstores, this type of book is open to all people, why do they network marketing companies recommend this book?<br><br>its because they really hold the facts as to how to improve urself in terms of purpose of like, objective of life  and of course in terms of money how to manage ur money wisely!!<br><br>3)low start-up cost<br><br>why not get a low start up cost to earn money, if u are given the chance to do business, would u wan?<br><br>i am a typical singaporean and knows that all ppl are KIASU so its normal and not all ppl in singapore are rich, and do u know why poor ppl always be poor and rich will always grow richer?

            <div class='col-md body'>weijian...... my humble advice to you...... why choose a company that only priority itself instead of its ppl, choose a company that plan you to go far. I believe that you are still in the first 3 yrs in Network business, this business if you really want to understand it, takes at least 3 yrs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my humble advice to those in NTI too, dun pin all your hopes there, its always good to have more than 1 source of income. Yes i do agree NTI is a great place to learn about sales techniques and stuff. Mr Jackie is a very good teacher. But u guys must understand, in mlm as well as those in the outside world, only just 5% of the ppl will truly earn big bucks while the rest will continue paying the start-up fee and the monthly maintainance fee to support the big earning uplines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Weijian,<br><br>BRo~ you read too much rich dad poor dad already la. The rich do get richer, but they also get poorer, like wise for the poor. Anyway, so what if a book is best selling? It just meant it's a popular book, but filled with good advice or not is not necessary. Cocaine is so hot selling, but does it mean it's any good? Macdonalds is so hot selling, but does it mean it's very healthy? Anyway, RDPD is on a few best sellers, but doesn't mean it teaches u the correct stuff. If you look at the books reputable financial magazines or institutions recommend, like Forbes, RDPD is not one of them.<br><br>It may be New York times best seller, but it doesn't mean much. New York times also not a full fledge financial news paper even it does have some financial news, just like Straits Times is not a full fledge financial newspaper.<br><br>Robert Kiyosaki got famous because MLM companies started buying his books in bulk and distribute them. That's why you see he keeps praising how good MLM companies ah. If he doesn't recommend MLM, why would MLM companies buy his books? He may have pointed out some interesting facts about finance in his books but many things written are quite questionable. Read at ur own risk!</div>
