There are more and more companies either doing MLM or setting up MLM divisions.  Some companies include Dell and IBM.   I guess it's about time that we all stop living in the 20th century and move with the trend.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Dear Students and Alumni,<br><br>We hope you had a happy and safe New Year.<br><br>The starting date for the one-year **** program conducted entirely on the home campus in , , has been set.  Students may arrive on campus beginning Monday, March 28, with classes beginning the weekend of April 15.  Graduation is May, 2006, with a campus ceremony hosted by President John Doe.<br><br>For those of you who are not aware of this program, this is an exciting new opportunity for your family and friends, with US$1,000 financial rewards for you.<br><br>Based on feedback we received from students who attended Meeting 5 in the U.S., we now offer the entire one-year **** program on campus.  In addition, we offer a referral fee of US$1,000 for any student who gets a friend or relative to attend the campus program.

Of course who knows maybe in the future underwear maybe sold thru MLM as well...we never know. Amway is a good example of selling a wide variety of things. Anyway the point is the word 'everything' is being loosely used here. It's  jus not believable at the moment and wise ppl can only choose to either believe it or dismiss it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its true, mlm is the pretty much the career of the future, and i believe it, only because job security is deader than disco.  And it IS true that major established companies in america use mlm as a vehicle to expand further. Dell DID do it through mlm. How do i know this?<br>Well i read "Business school, for people who like helping people" by Robert T. Kiyosaki. You can find out a lot about mlm in his book, and he wrote a book on mlm because he feels that he never used mlm to succeed and retire, and thats why he feels he can look at the industry objectively. He was skeptical about the industry too, when he was approached with an mlm proposal earlier in his "career". But later on he was suprised to know one of his close friends, a sucessful millionaire already, doing an mlm business. So out of curiosity, thats when he did his research on mlm, and says if he could do it again, he would have done an mlm business. But he says there are good companies and bad ones, and not to join one until you've seen and evaluated at least three.<br>If you want to know know more about mlm from an objective point of view, read the book, instead of listening to hearsay. The most expensive advice is free advice.<br>I really respect RK , and ive learnt a lot about finances just by reading his books. And his book "rich dad poor dad" has changed my future. I'm also doing an mlm business part-time because id rather keep my day job and "mind my own business", instead of workin for someone elses company all my life and "minding their business." Passive income soon wont be an option anymore. There are statistics that say 10 years from now most of the products at home will be from mlm. But who cares about that. I think what'll matter is whether you utilised this powerful vehicle to create a network to provide passive income for yourself, or just watched it happen, and think to yourself, "Maybe i shouldve found out more. Or given it a shot." I think that would be tragic. You can always keep telling yourself job security exists till you get retrenched. Or you could keep your mind open.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

More like "jei sao fei"..... like if I introduce 5 names to a magazine and I get one year's subscription for free.</div></blockquote>Actually.... jei sao fei is how MLM started.  The first group of consumers use the products... say about 100 consumers.  90 of them got good results.  10 of them give up on the products due to various reasons : not within their budget, not suitable or dun need the product anymore.  The 90 consumers will be encourage to spread the word of mouth on the product results to their contacts.  The company is willing to pay them for that.  This is a lot cheaper than paying the TV commercials and selling the products thru distribution channels.<br><br>The 90 consumers will be divided into the various categories:<br>- Want to make a living out of sharing the product results.  Thus, in a way, they are doing business now.  Consumer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Business people.  This is the group of distributors that are highly active in selling and recruiting.<br>- Want to make small income.  These people do not want to make a living out of this.  But they don't mind sharing the products with their friends and still get paid.<br>- Only want to use the product.  That's it.<br><br></div>
