              <p>Eh,anyone can help me how to get out of that company?Coz the sales kit is still with me.I just worked and have been trained there for a week before I call it a quit.Coz it's like once you go in,they try their effing best to make you stay there with all those "promises" and that motivation.</p>
              <p>Should I go to their office,return the sales kit and say to the manager,"I quit"?Or should I just be straight forward to her?</p>

              <p>Ya,that's what I may intend to do,but it's like quite rude one.Coz if like that,then they will think "wa,this guy no ethics one!"Then,if I were to quit smoothly by explaining to her in front of her face in a str. forward manner,she will confirm shoot me with questions of why I decided to quit.Then,my guess is she will effing motivate me to be confident la,be willing to take risk la and all that stuffs.So,I'm somehow trapped.</p>
              <p>Actually,nobody in the company is bound by contract.It's a matter of ethical business.But the so-called top people will effing try to pull you again back,either by calling you back etc.That's why many people don't like this company,coz very annoying one.</p>
              <p>Even the so-called testimonials in their presentations are like so outdated and fake!My concern is not about their products' quality,but their process in marketing strategy.I think those who quit will agree with that.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying we should downgrade local entrepreneurship,it's just that our domestic population is so small.Singapore only got human resources.But if this company can protrude out to the developing countries or M.E for their water tech.,then God wills it to happen.</p>

              <p>I'd like to share my first appointment which obviously my parents are the prospect.My presenter is a car achiever.Usually,the prospect would just nod to what is being said whether he/she likes it or not,right?.But my dad damn stylo.He fought back by telling what I would say,logical answers.Lol.</p>
              <p>Those questions are,"Singapore's water so clean what?To kill those germs in the tap water,just boil and sterilize it lar!","You say Singaporeans don't have the time to exercise so blood circulation is lacking.Rather than sleeping on magnetic bed and pillow,isn't exercising the NATURAL way of improving blood circulation?" and many more which I forgot.</p>
              <p>The point is,no one has ever heard of prospect debating with presenter.Usually,the prospect will get "educated" and decides whether to buy or not.Presenter,in some cases can 'seduce' people's minds into buying their products,without doubting the products' quality.</p>

              <p>I can answer that. Something I've have learnt from my friend who study marketing</p>
              <p>Yes, they are members of CASE and the ISO is reliable. The ISO is bound to expired in this coming Sept. Which I suppose they going to renew it soon. In order for a company to be ISO certifited, its management, logistic and admins have to acheive internation standard. And if you were to say the ISO cert. itself is use money buy one right, why loan shark dun have? LOL!</p>
              <p>2. They can disturbute to supermarkets, but it defeated the purpose of creating awarness. I know some disturbutors there actually disturbute to their schools.</p>
              <p>Lastly, yes DBS and Citibank provide backup and is 0% installments fee, if prospect has no such credit cards, they can opt for Hitachi plan. 6% annual interest fee. 24 mth installment.</p>
              <p>That's all I know.</p>

              <p><span>i cant help it but jump on the bandwagon and tell all pro-mlmers.. they are heading in the right direction... what we need to do is keep our heads cool and ignore ignorant people.. As Albert Einstein once said... ''Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.'' live and let live... WE ARE GONNA BE RICH... and these people can continue working from 8-5 for money! btw to all people who are negative about mlm.. lets just say you need to be educated.. and i suggest you thank me for sending you the title of a book by Donald Trump and Robert Kiyosaki.. two successful businessmen who are significantly richer then any one of you retarded individuals(sorry couldnt help it)... the title of the book is 'Why we want you to be rich' .. now get your lazy and ignorant ass off your couch and go educate yourself... meh.. so much for the traditional education system...every single one of you negative people have the word retard imprinted on your forehead.. last but not least... please thank me once you read that book... as they say... 'KNOWLEDGE IS POWER' MOTHER ****ERSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS... oh btw.. im not saying all mlm co's are good.. there are black sheep DUH.. like everywhere? VE has a decent system. Complaints are mainly from people who quit...another pretty saying..'' Winners never quit and quitters never WIN''</span></p>

              <p>Typical Arrogant VE-rian. I was like you once. Thinking that VE system is the best and everything else is not as good as VE system. I'll give you 3 months till you start to cry about your bad decision. By the way, I didnt follow the VE system, yet i have my own co. and earn at least 10K per month.  How much have you earned?</p>
              <p>Before you want others to educate ourselves, you should educate YOURSELF 1st! Being someone as naive and ignorant as you, you would have been easily brainwashed by VE personnels.</p>
              <p>VE is one bad influence, how could they discourage people from extending their knowledge, be it if they want to get into the mlm industry or not. Ask Donald Trump or Robert Kiyosaki and they will tell you that EDUCATION IS KEY. Mind you not the 'education' that VE is giving. Trump &amp; Kiyosaki are successful businessmen. Their motive of 'recommending' MLM is unclear. NO DOUBT that they got to become successful as their are now, NOT FROM MLM. And YES KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. Go educate yourself.</p>
              <p>And without 'those 8-5', who the hell would buy VE uselss products?</p>
              <p> As Albert Einstein once said... ''Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity. Right back at you.</p>
              <p>Call it negative on us. My boy, you are too brainwashed by VE.  You call those who left quitters, i call them those that have MORAL VALUES.</p>
              <p>I am not saying that MLM co.s and the system is bad, there are black sheeps in every industry and VE is ONE OF THE BLACK SHEEPS. VE, decent system? You make me laugh.
