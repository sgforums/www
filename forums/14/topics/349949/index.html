              <p>By the way, I called up 3 advertisement in the newspapers, and its ALL venture era agents. Its pretty obvious, they called their co. as VEG pte ltd, which is more deceiving than VE group.  Located at MDIS building. And still have the check to say that its ALL BASIC PAY, NO SALES. Bunch of Liars!</p>
              <p>Anybody want to go down and make 'trouble'? I mean by asking them qns that they sure wont want to answer.</p>

              <p>Agent: It's about admin etc - This may vary, but agent will NEVER say that it's mlm and you have to use your own family and friends as prospects.</p>
              <p>PPL: Oh? Ok, where is it at? (Curious, just wanna see what going on)</p>
              <p>Agent: It's at MDIS Building</p>
              <p>When you reach there at the MDIS building, it would really be like a formal interview, write in your particulars etc. Then, they will try to push you into their network with the thought of MONEY and FAME without doing anything.</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>If your friend joined VE, they will call you up and meet at a place near eunos for a drink and some chit chat. While you were drinking or having a meal, his manager will come and sit with you like an old friend and try to get you into the office. Once you are at the office, the will try to push you into their network</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>IF you choose to join, they will put ideas in your head aka brainwashing you into thinking that you are SUPERIOR to those who have different ideas than you about VE. Example those who prefer working for 8-5, VE top managers always say that we should pity them.</p>
              <p>And when questioned about the ethics about scamming your friends and prospects, they will say that our friends and prospect would later be grateful to us as we introduced them into this system.</p>
              <p>The products are the best in the world that other products are deem are only as good.</p>
              <p>Treat school as part time and VE as full time. This have led many students to actually quit their tertiary education incl. myself</p>
              <p>Always emphasize on how great VE boss is and top managers are,</p>
              <p>Until 10 nos means we should not give up. This means until the prospect says 10 NO then will should keep trying to sell them the products or recruiting them.</p>
              <p>Always say that how much we have changed for the better when we joined VE. This rediculous. Those who claimed how much they have changed were usually humble people who changed into arrogant bastards. If these arrogant bastards have achieved success and loads of money than it would be understandable that they have been led by monetary gains. But these bastards dont even have a single cent and still come to their friends to borrow money. Friends who he/she considered as pitiful as they did not join VE.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>VE is a company with bad ethics and culture. No need to say about mlm. Even if this co. deals with the most legitimate business, it will still be a bad company. DONT EVER JOIN! You will push your family and friends away.</p>
