              <p><br>My co. is dealing with construction materials.</p>
              <p>You can say that. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> Still I am PO by VE's unorthodox tactics. And they have been using the same 'congratulations, you have been shortlisted for an interview' tactic for more than 3 yrs already. Shouldnt they change?</p>
              <p>This is what happens when VE target immature, naive teens as their distributors. But then, even the 'mature' leaders teach down these unorthodox tactics to these younglings. It's the WHOLE CO. CULTURE that is the problem.</p>

              need to do is keep our heads cool and ignore ignorant people.. As
              Albert Einstein once said... ''Two things are infinite: the
              universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the
              universe.'' live and let live... WE ARE GONNA BE RICH... and these
              people can continue working from 8-5 for money! btw to all people
              who are negative about mlm.. lets just say you need to be
              educated.. and i suggest you thank me for sending you the title of
              a book by Donald Trump and Robert Kiyosaki.. two successful
              businessmen who are significantly richer then any one of you
              retarded individuals(sorry couldnt help it)... the title of the
              book is 'Why we want you to be rich' .. now get your lazy and
              ignorant ass off your couch and go educate yourself... meh.. so
              much for the traditional education system...every single one of you
              negative people have the word retard imprinted on your forehead..
              last but not least... please thank me once you read that book... as
              they say... 'KNOWLEDGE IS POWER' MOTHER
              ****ERSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS... oh btw.. im not saying all mlm co's
              are good.. there are black sheep DUH.. like everywhere? VE has a
              decent system. Complaints are mainly from people who quit...another
              pretty saying..'' Winners never quit and quitters never
              WIN''</span></p>

              <p>So tell me... why are VE agents always tricking peole down and cold calling people and hiding the truth about their location, what they do and even their name? Something up your sleeve?</p>
              <p>Rich?</p>
              <p>Ok, do this: take the number of all the people who had EVER been in VE (now and previously, active or inactive), the number of "currently active" agents and the number of agents who had actually reached the sustainable level of income that you define as "successful". Whats the percentage of "success"?</p>

              <p>Thats how VE retains people on their agents list even when the agent is inactive, he doesnt officially quit the company because they are told "quitters are losers".</p>
              <p>Very sly move. So instead of the usual way of trying to persuade them to stay or change the company philosophy for the better, they use this.</p>
