            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I had bought a magnetic mattress from this company called Asayo Group about 8 yrs back for about $1700 under hired purchase. But after using for a while I find the mattress useless so I return it to the company and stop paying the money. At first they chase me for the money but after a while stop cos I heard the company is under some financial problem.<br><br>But now they started to send me letter demanding me to pay them back the money I owed they and the amount they claim from me become $26,000plus!!! How come can become so much cos I rem the interest that time I sign the hired purchase agreement is only about 11% a year and I had paid $300plus as deposit and only hired purchase for $1300plus.<br><br>Somemore the hired purchase form is an inhouse form and not from any bank or finance company so I want to know whether it is valid cos I heard my friend saying that in order to do hired purchase a company need to have a license from MAS to collect the interest or else it will be illegal money lending.<br><br>They threatened legal action if I dun pay them the full amount within 14 days!!! Anyone can advise me on this matter?<br></div>

But if their claim is legal why they dun go small claim to claim me that time when I stop paying the installment? I now still dunno their claim is valid against me or not  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

I will not mention name here but 1 of the Asayo manager who  in charge of hire purchase before did many dirt things to some accounts before he was caught and got sacked. You could be 1 of the account victim. That Ex-manager opened his own company selling quite similar products nearby now.<br><br>If your claim is genuine, many people can help you and you have no reasons not to reveal your identity. If you don't identify yourself, you proved that your message is just another trick from a competitor company.<br><br>Asayo is doing bigger and bigger again and such dirty trick could not harm them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Adrian,<br><br>What I can advise you is try to act innocent first. Go(kiddingly) ask your upline why the interest is so much, ask had them made a mistake? Get a copy of whatever you signed and if all else fails threaten your upline to refund you, if he resist, complain to case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, the help you asked for should be from a lawyer which I am not.<br><br>Hence just some thoughts to the points raised by you.<br><br>Â•	You had bought a magnetic mattress from <strong>Asayo Group </strong>about <strong>8 yrs back </strong>for about <strong>$1700 </strong>under hired purchase.  <strong>Paid $300 </strong>plus and <strong>loaned $1300plus</strong>.<br><br>Â•	Since then, you had returned the mattress to the company and stopped further payment.<br><br>Â•	<strong>Now</strong> Asayo Group started to <strong>demand $26,000p</strong>lus.<br>Â•<br>The hired purchase form is an inhouse form.<br><br>Â•	They threatened legal action if you donÂ’t pay within 14 days.<br><br>Â•	You have no document at all other than the most recent letter from Asayo Group.<br><br>I guess, they are many ways to look at and handle this issue.<br><br>I guess after more than 8 years for Asayo Group to start demanding is a bit too long.  They do not have any mitigating factor in cutting their lost, ie they cannot demand such a large sum in such a long lapse in common sense.<br><br>So I guess the best action is to do nothing and just sit tight and collect all the letters (legal or otherwise).  Once you have sufficient details from Asayo Group ie their lawyer letters etc, then raise this to CASE with copy to The Strait Times.  Try to write precisely.  CASE do have voluntary lawyers to help out.  I think The Strait Times do take interest to see the outcome of such underdog case.<br><br>I guess other could also suggest to write to CASE immediately.<br><br>It is very good that <strong>ck2004kc</strong> offered his help.  I do think you can take up his offer at the same time.<br><br>Good luck.<br></div>
