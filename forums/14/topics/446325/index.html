              <p>Personally I am tired of trying to hire sales persons to work for us 
              in the company. And over time, I feel that MLM sales persons seem to be 
              more than able to and motivated to sell products.</p>
              <p>I have never 
              done MLM and I think its tough, the commissions are not easy to earn but
               yet people can make a nice sum in sales- $5k to $20k is really very 
              nice. With zero salaries, benefits and targets that are recurring.</p>
              <p>Should
               we as a company decide to go down the MLM route for our products rather
               than waste more time and effort in hiring sales people who sit on their
               backsides but want a basic salary but bring no sales- then we let them 
              go. Vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>We actually have a good product but just we are super bad at sales.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any help please</p>

              <p>Let me share with you 2cent worth.</p>
              <p>I've seen the product that you're trying to sell. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> It's quite hard to sell a software because you need leads and many networking efforts.</p>
              <p>The model of MLM is basically rewarding (or sharing part of the profit with) the person who bring in the sales. This is a good model because it's fair and square. However, it's harder to retain good sales person because they are not tied down with any committments.</p>
              <p>In your company, you must engage one or two good sales executive/director (perm) and let this person be a source of motivation and main connection to the prospective clients and current MLMer.</p>
              <p>In MLM, there's a term called affiliation. The rule in doing business is to let your executives handle the sales, and pay the lead guy affiliation fee for bring in business. That should be the right model. So by doing this, the clients are yours and you're making affiliation fee to the guy who make the deal come true.</p>
              <p>Remember, the key word is affiliation fee. Paid to the guy who brings in the client.</p>

              <p>TS: if you're seriously considering selling a product, try test water first..</p>
              <p>be it in tradditional sales or via network marketing..test response first..</p>
              <p>don't jump directly inside..</p>
              <p>for i personally have seen a handful of establish multi-million mlm companies collaspe due to a combination of many wrong factors over the years since I got to know MLM.</p>
              <p>there's a few companies from both local and overseas that i have seen, worked with and know of (Top Management Individuals &amp; CEOs) that literally have their business wiped out in over a few years due to BAD MANAGEMENT, selection of wrong individuals, one of which is still in the process of bleeding money..</p>
              <p>so thread forward with precaution.</p>
              <p>Such as operations, business model, compsensation, location, operating hours, manpower, rewarding structure, talent retainer/recruitment scheme.</p>
              <p>In Sales, there's a saying</p>
              <p>"There's no bad product, there's just bad sales person."</p>
              <p>A good sales person should be able to sell anything and everything. That is a skill that not many (less than a handful) in any MLM company will ever made it to the top to learn such a skill.</p>
              <p>Just like there's a saying: There's no ugly woman, there's only lazy woman.</p>
              <p>If you want to start, hire and seriously consider finding somebody who knows really deep stuffs about Networking Marketing as well as understand how to play (do Singapore style of MLM) who knows how to counter skeptism.</p>
              <p>If you're not able to find such top quality individuals as consultants and advisors..don't waste your time and money.</p>

              <p>To sum up..regardless of whatever business you do..when it comes to products or services..</p>
              <p>be it online/offline..there's a common problem..people..</p>
              <p>from customers to sales representatives to customer support staffs..</p>
              <p>you need to train, prepare and manage them for the unforseen situations..</p>
              <p>i was at the right place at the right times, and was able to seen and learn from many different sources when I started learning about network marketing..</p>
              <p>The key to business is not education..but investing in individuals who's well educated..who's talented seeking a platform for them to utilize and realize their potential..</p>
              <p>so when it comes to hiring/recruiting of talents..give them space to grow and don't limit them..else they will find start looking for better alternatives..which there are many for those who wants to go beyond network marketing.</p>
              <p>Networking marketing is just a start..</p>
              <p>If your company are bad at sales, just learn sales in terms of communicating with the clients..</p>
              <p>if you believe your product is good products..sell the benefits &amp; advantages to the clients, its as simple as that..but say it like you mean it..(that's the difficult part in terms of tone, expression, body language)</p>
