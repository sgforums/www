            <div class='col-md body'>The hottest issue in this thread is the debate between Jedi and Alex, here's some facts I like to share with you guys:<br><br>a) Alex is right about Amway paying very low, in fact the lowest pay-out against its collection price. Being the lowest pay-out, obviously the Company will not admit but anyone can calculate from the plan. Being the lowest pay-out is not necessary a bad Company to join if the prices are low or products easily marketable but in Amway, their prices are not cheap.<br><br>b) Jedi's explaination of the 1% on depth where he used A - B -C - D and if all 21%, A actually earns 3% is wrong and misleading, it's actually still 1% on the total. Think of this, it it goes to 100 generations of 21%, the payout is 100% ?<br><br>c) Amway still doing well in US and many Countries should not not be used as a claim to be taken as a good business. They are well because they are the oldest and best in training. If you look at the amount of products they are selling, then you can consider them as poor based on average sales per product, as compared to years ago when they have less products. Think of this, if Amway is a good business, it should be easy to do, why should there be so much trainings and meetings ?<br><br>d) For your info, Amway only ranked no. 3 in Malaysia today. No. 1 and 2 are Elken and Cosway, both Malaysian owned Companies which has a much much shorter history. Why do you think Amway could be taken over ? Majority of their members left them after experiencing the truth.<br><br>e) I understand Jedi's position, he was trained to understand in this way. Nearly all the MLM Companies I knew which have weaknesses will train their members  to emphasize on their strong points and when their weak points are being brought out, they will turn to other directions and say, "...we are taught not to bring down other Companies...... blah, blah, blah....." I feel that they is really nothing wrong to bring down anyone or Company if what is mentioned is the truth. Isn't this better than allowing more people being victimised ?<br><br>f) I have personally seen many people, some my friends who worked very hard in Amway and spoke just like Jedi. Some even declare that they will never leave Amway or join other Company. Few years later, they are forced to live up to their words, not making money from Amway but too ashamed to join others.<br><br>My advice to Jedi and every MLMers is you can claim the Company you are in is the best(you are not wrong because it is the best of your knowledge and you do not know about the others) but Never declare you will not leave it. You never know if a better opportunity could just be around the corner.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey!<br><br>What's all these bashing about other network marketing companies?  Haven't you heard what Big Al says, we should stop talking bad about other network marketing companies as this will give the whole industry a bad name!<br><br>Each and every company has their good and bad part and it's up to the individual that decides what is best for him. Amway, NuSkin, Herbalife, Forever Living are all good companies as if not, they will not be around for so long.<br><br>I am not from these companies mentioned but I just hope that all network marketers or even potential network marketers to stop talking bad about other companies.  What we should do is to educate the consumers why should they buy from network marketing companies and not from the retail outlets!</div>
