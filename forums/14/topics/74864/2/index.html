I think we should tell others the good &amp; strength of our company, and not to say "your compensation payout is too low" "your company is too old".<br><br>are you trying to compare the retail profit &amp; performance bonus?<br>if yes, then great! did you calculate the PV &amp; BV ratio also? many companies claim that their payout more than 65%, but if you calculate the PV/BV ratio with Amway's system, their payout actually only 32.5%!<br>If you wanna study about Amway marketing plan, then I give you one clue. Study about the InDepth Bonus of 1%, study carefully how it work and how it was paid.<br><br>if you wanna say Amway total payout is less, then please study about SIP (Sales Incentive Program), FAA (Founder Achievement Award) and also ALS Growth Bonus under the SIP scheme.<br><br>cheers!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span></span><br></div>

Why their government allowed Amway to operate in their country including Singapore?<br>I believe that Singapore government and ministry of finance already study &amp; do some research on Amway's reward system. Since you say it's unfair, are you trying to tell me that Singapore government is useless to let a unfair plan to run in Singapore?</span></span></div>

You don't even know the power of MLM.<br>If one week go sponsor one friend, one year you sponsored 52 friends into your network. You need ONLY 2 years to complete this 100 person line.<br>You think this is impossible?<br><br>The calculation I gave is not to make anyone shiok, it's just a basic calculation of one of the bonus BUT people always set their mind at 1% only. They didn't realise that the Amway reward system is totally different from others, Amway allow you to accumulate this 1% from your whole team.<br><br>I believe that if you know some marketing plan from others company, you will find that they only limit your bonus until 5th or 7th generations. Why?<br>Amway gives 1% for unlimited generations and others company gives 2% for limited 7 generations, so tell me "WHO IS GIVING HIGHER PERCENTAGE?"</span></span></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
