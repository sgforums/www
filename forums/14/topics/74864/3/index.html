Dun say u are the victim cause u are selling and promoting their products, and when something bad happens u say u r the user and say u r the victim. Not very gd huh. Must practice some social responsibilities lah, check ur products properly make sure is good den promote...<br><br>Dun scold me pls hahahahha jus passing by to make some comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't agree completely with the comments on the problem is with the individual. Not neccessarily true. It could be the company policy, ethics, rewards plan and even the upline.<br><br>I like to use the phrase " you don't know what you don't know". It's correct. I think I know but I don't really know. A lot of people joined MLM but is it the right one for them. Do they know it?<br><br>A study done in the US from a book I've read long time ago, statistics shows 97% of the people do not like selling. I realised I don't like selling. I joined a number of MLM company but never did feel like doing it simply because many MLM is selling focus. I never wanted to get involved in MLM but joined many out of obligation.<br><br>I have a negative impression MLM until one MLM company came up with a revoluntionsed concept, totally different from the traditional direct selling concept. Ah, this is the one for me and I have done it. I really enjoy being in MLM because I've found the right one for me.<br><br>One of my good friend whom I have know for over 20 year since school days, who is also in MLM. He said his company is a traditional direct selling company, he knows my company has a new concept, something new and interesting. The comments he made is that he can see many of members, upline or downline, have so much stocks in the house, just because cannot sell, have to buy just to earn a cheque. I asked him for an honest answer, this people claim they earn so much, are they actually earning so much? The answer was " A few do but most don't". The thing that really disturb me is that "If I stop selling, I will not get my cheque unless I stock". This is not the basket I'm going put my eggs into.<br><br>That's my comment, some may take it, some may not. People may call me stupid and naive if they want but I know what I will have that they can't have. Dream big and make it happen. Never let any dreams stealers to steal your dream.<br><br>Ciao,<br><br>Ben<br><br>email : benwong99@hotmail.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, Jedi and Alex Wong. Please calm down.<br><br>I, myself, am doing referal marketing. But as i move along with the program, realise that doing this business is not just about sales. I start to develop myself and I feel that after I continue to follow the program, i am a much better person that last time.<br><br>Well, i think that if an Network Marketing or Direct Selling coy is so convincing that you join them, then there must be something unique inside their program that will help you fulfill your dreams. Stick to that point of view.<br><br>A few things i have learn when doing referal Marketing.<br>1. Never criticise other MLM infront of other people, instead just keep promoting your company's best assets.<br>2. Treat people from other MLM with respect. If the disrespect you, it is their wrong doing, coz their member will learn wrong things from them too<br>3. If your fren, relative or colleague doing other MLM, just share with them the rewards and perks that you have recieve from your Coy. It is up to them to share with you or not.<br><br>The main thing here is duplication. What u do, your member will follow. Nothing is this world, till date, is the best.. so why get upset with other people who dun have the same dream with you???!! The saddest thing is only when you and your partner dun have the same dream!! So, why bother about others.<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

MLM is a new thing to many of you and it takes a long time for an entire culture to accept anything new.  If you would think of it as just another way to market products and be opened minded to why it works then you may be a bit surprised.<br><br>Take a look at this video from a professor at the University of Illinois.  He hated MLM and wouldn't have anything to do with it.  Then he decided he was going to do a project and research the industry.  Guess what happened???  Take a look at "Brilliant Compensation".  It's the link at the top middle of this web page.<br><br>http://www.anmnow.com/streamofincome/index2.shtml<br><br>OH, and to answer the question from the thread.<br>Reliv International a food science company is one of the latest to arrive.<br><br>Warm Regards,<br>Lisa</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>jedi...what do you mean by "see you at the top" and "we talk good about MLM then we make money &amp; our dreams come true"<br><br>there are two things i can infer from your statement<br>1) you are NOT YET at the top<br>2) by saying that "we talk good about MLM... then our dreams come true", it tells me that you are a firm believer in something termed as "self-fulfilling prophecy" it means what you say will come true...am i right?<br><br>you haven't reached the top yet... and yet you are making statements like "then we make money" and "our dreams come true"... that's a groundless presumption on your part. we are discussing facts here, not presuming things which have yet to come.<br><br>moreover, you said that a huge number of MLMers are just mere consumers.. and they are not seeing the money because they don't work for it. oh how do you know that they are not working and just consuming? again...you are just making another assumption. have you got the statistics to prove your statement?<br><br>my hunch tells me that you're barely three months into this industry... but in order for a meaningful discussion to take place in this forum... we want proven facts... not groundless statements</div>
