Since when you see any documents from Amway stated that you can be financial freedom after you JOIN Amway? No, rite?<br>We always tell our distributors, NO FREE LUNCH IN THIS WORLD.<br><br>Amway gives a opportunity for you to make your own way to your own destinations.<br><br>Again, this is a fair opportunity, how much effort you put in, how much reward you will get.<br>I believe that many people join in MLM is because of the products, or some just to support friends.<br>That's why you can see, many people join in MLM, but little people really FIGHT for it. There is a HUGE difference between JOIN and FIGHT.<br><br>If you really wanna see things from the bad side, then conventional business also not as good as MLM business. Why?<br>We can see many software house that develop third party software, but which owner of the software house is richer than Bill Gates? Thus many software house closed down due to pirated copy and etc.<br>In MLM business, although 10% people successfully made their way, but at least the 90% people didn't lose much. The joining fees of MLM business are far far lesser than setting up a convention business. maybe around S$100. The company will absorb the operation fees &amp; delivery charges plus storage area rental. All you need to do is just to use the products &amp; share with friends.<br>Change their spending amount into your business volume.</strong></span></div>
