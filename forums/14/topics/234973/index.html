            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Ok heres the explanation, hope it is understandable  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Firstly, as long as u are at least a 21%er here, u can receive ur 2% leadership bonus from the 21% international leg or if u have 2 or more international legs, you will receive the 2% bonus too, and they can be used as qualification for Emerald pins and higher, including the one-time cash, ALS trips etc. However, the Emerald and Diamond bonus are only for domestic legs, meaning for Emerald bonus, 3 domestic legs, Diamond bonus, 6 etc. However, if u already have those, the international legs can be used for the Emerald and Diamond bonus too.<br><br>Anyway, do not be discouraged. Even in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei alone, there is plenty of room to go up to Emerald and above. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>You do not need a lot of pple to become Diamond. Be focused, continue to work hard and never give up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers</div>
