Build up a network of recruits.  <strong>Do a revolt</strong>, and set up a new coompany and bring over the whole string of recruits uder your own company ie under you.  The whole idea is to stop paying commission to the ones before you.<br><br>Please do not try if you do not have guts.  Remember, a revolt could be put down also.  Study the document which you are supposed to sign before joining the MLM.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Of course but dat is not the fault of mlm...any more than the instituition of marriage is to be held accountable for the heartbreak of child abuse...<br><br>It's sad dat  PatrickLTH has chosen such a one-sided view...<br><br>Whether u are approached by a loved one offering a great product that has improved therir lives dramatically or a fren who encourages u to participate in a fun, easy and creative business please be open to what is being offered...<br><br>Profitting frm relationships both giving and receiving is one of the most richly rewarding and worthy of all human endeavours...<br><br>Maybe u could look at money as a symbol or measure of genuine value...when u do dat u might see that  giving money is an exchange of something more than dollars...or even an expression of love or appreciation... Why would u not want to create a better lifestyle with ppl u care most abt? It's only natural...<br><br>if ur good fren were to be in mlm Im sure he will do all he can to make u involved and make u a millionaire ....of course pestering ppl to death is another matter....<br><br>Mlm is for consenting adults ONLY.</div>
