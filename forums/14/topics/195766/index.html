            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, let's face the fact.<br>goto www.acra.gov.sg that's where u can register a company.<br>What kind of company, ok , we call it MLM.<br>What about the products u have for your company?<br>The usual way of doing is to import a container of so call 'unique item' that singapore dun have, then say its good and good and say you got the best compensation plan.<br>People join, people recruit.<br><br>Lets all face it.<br><br>The top leader in MLM doesn't sell anything, they just give seminar and training. The ppl or downline learns to be a leader and trains other.<br><br>Where the money comes from??<br><br>Ya, from the product...<br><br>Who buys?<br><br>You and the downline.<br><br>Yes, ppl can buy the product without joining the company,<br>but the product is of very low price and has a high margin markup coz<br>the company needs to profitable, and the $ paid to the leaders.<br><br>Ok, if you really want that product, you fly oversea to get or maybe order from www.ebay.com for a cheaper one<br><br>SO before u join MLM,<br>think again<br><br>OK ok, never mind the MLM company background is good and product is really good. But beware coz a good product always has competitor and market share. Even if the company manufacture the product, yes i agreed that it can be unique but it still face competition from the normal supply demand chain.<br>Its not a point whether the product is unique, comsumable, price competitive or whatsoever, the product must bring value-for-money to the consumers.<br><br>Dun waste so much time in attending lectures or having your weekend burn for a year or 2 and give up, do something more meaningful<br><br>SO before u join MLM,<br>think again<br><br>To add on, what happens? If a grad joins full-time MLM but his/her profession is doctor/engineer, wouldn't it our economy shortage of these positions?<br>If university grads this year is 100%, and of these 50% choose to do full time MLM instead of relevant job/career vacacies, what will happen to the economy then? Will we face a shortfall in talents? and if those 50% of those grads, only 2% of the 50% succeeded and the rest choose to return to work what will happen then? those who return actually lack behind their peers already...<br><br>What about those who succeeded? Yes, SLK, CLK, BMW<br>Earn $10K Spend $10K, its no better. What happen what the downline reform and leaves or the company change name? (The company change name very often to hid their previous bad-mouthing who had left, check the ACRA you will know whether a company has rename its company name) When a company renames, usually the downline under u leaves, leader also leave.<br>Those who has succeeded is back to square one.<br><br>Who is the future then?<br><br>SO before u join MLM,<br>think again<br><br>If you want to join, can also. No problem, but but but dun pay any cash to the company, try know more about its product and sell to those ppl you dun know.<br>See what's the feedback. Ya, ya,ya they will say you need commitment or even if you start a biz like MLM you need capital or you need to buy the product to see how good it is so that you're confident and sell more and earn more... bull shit. Does a Merz Sales man own a Merz 350? Does the property agent who sell the condominium owns one at orchard? ya,ya,ya dun say its different coz they doing sales and its MLM. Come on, face the facts, a company need sales to be sustainable if not wind-down already. MLM also is a biz under a company, so what do u think?<br><br>Even for new startup, ya, join now the pioneer old startup join later then small fry, if they really say it this way, walk away coz there is really no such thing under MLM concept<br><br>If you want to join, dun pay a single cent first for the product or to be what down or upline. see if the company still runs good for 6 months. If a lot of new faces every month, then walk away.<br><br>SO before u join MLM,<br>think again<br><br>Paralysis Analysis Doctorate<br>Anti MLM Division<br>Flowersand<br><br>coz flower and sand dun mix<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, that is quite an interesting spin on a topic as diverse as MLM. However, it is important to keep in mind that there are MLMs that actually work. Firstly, your statement about "the top leader does not sell anything" is applicable for other companies other than MLM. The main idea of a proper MLM is both the distributor and the buyer both use the product and the distributor-buyer relationship is supposed to be that of a recommendation and I guess if your product is good, there is no harm in the distributor buying it.

When people do MLM, they forget that they are in the Sales line. Market share, market value and market forces and competition must feature in the marketing of the product. The product in question must be of a certain standard, be of a reasonable quality and be priced competitively compared to competitors.

            <div class='col-md body'>U want to join network marketing can, but make sure is single level marketing. It means if u rise to same rank as your uplink, the link will be cut. He will not get the comission. But same also? The link join to an even higher uplink.<br><br>Basically, newcomer must look out for history of company, value of product, pricing of product, comission rate, mlm plan and compensation plan. I stand against mlm because out of so many mlms, only Amway and tupperware survive well cos they sell big variety of useful products.  Even that, 70% of the network dun earn more than 500/month. Singapore mlm company is a NO. Some even like to boast their ISO cert &amp; DSA cert etc etc. This cert is easy to get if u follow their guideline. Some DSA cert company even sell overpriced item and emphasize on recruiting. The product is there to make it legal only. Furthermore, sg market is so small. The funny thing is most of them in sg import bio-magnetic stuff or life science products selling them overpriced. A click to ebay can check that they are grossly overpriced.<br><br>At the end of the day, only 0.3-0.5% comprising the tip of the network make decent cash. They will quit also when the worthless product stop selling and they dun get comission from their downlinks.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>most of sg mlm dun make u cash<br>U work very hard to recruit and sell, at the end of the day u get so little<br>Unless u confident their product can sell well,without any starting purchase of the product and u are the first few to join, dun join.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Baddieko:</div><div class="quote_body">U want to join network marketing can, but make sure is single level marketing. It means if u rise to same rank as your uplink, the link will be cut. He will not get the comission. But same also? The link join to an even higher uplink.<br><br>Basically, newcomer must look out for history of company, value of product, pricing of product, comission rate, mlm plan and compensation plan. I stand against mlm because out of so many mlms, only Amway and tupperware survive well cos they sell big variety of useful products.  Even that, 70% of the network dun earn more than 500/month. Singapore mlm company is a NO. Some even like to boast their ISO cert &amp; DSA cert etc etc. This cert is easy to get if u follow their guideline. Some DSA cert company even sell overpriced item and emphasize on recruiting. The product is there to make it legal only. Furthermore, sg market is so small. The funny thing is most of them in sg import bio-magnetic stuff or life science products selling them overpriced. A click to ebay can check that they are grossly overpriced.<br><br>At the end of the day, only 0.3-0.5% comprising the tip of the network make decent cash. They will quit also when the worthless product stop selling and they dun get comission from their downlinks.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>most of sg mlm dun make u cash<br>U work very hard to recruit and sell, at the end of the day u get so little<br>Unless u confident their product can sell well,without any starting purchase of the product and u are the first few to join, dun join.<br></div></blockquote>is it????  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
