Just like NTUC, if you are a member, you will be given NTUC link points. But for SE, the rebates is capped at SGD$19,200 and $96,000.<br><br>Sounds like an investment on the surface but come to think about it, it alos doesnt seem to be an investment for you are given benefits based on your loyalty and support. Which is pretty common in the world now.<br><br>Banks give you interests in return for you to put money in their bank. But well, i think SE "interest" is way too high.</div>

If you have read my previous replies in other threads. I mentioned before, this whole concept could either be a ground-greaking concept never been seen before or it could be just like any other scams.<br><br>Difference is, this time round, this SE has created more headlines than any other companies. True enough, there is no such as free lunch but if this is a true blue MLM company, the people inside who have earned what they claimed definetely did not work for free.<br><br>Im certain that my post here could spark some flaming but Im just trying to look at things with a bigger pespective.<br><br>When we talk about entreprenuership, we are talking about venturing into the unknown. That is also why most people prefer to stay at where they are in their comfort zone. What may work or percieve to be wrong might not be the same tomorrow. No offence to some forumers, if you are sitting in front of your computer and simply joining in to pass some comments. I strongly urge you to reflect upon yourself. Firstly, who are you to judge? Secondly, does commenting/criticing make your any better? Lastly, sometimes i really wonder, did this JP guy really owe you anything? It seems like some of you really have a deep grudge against him. Think again.<br><br>Afterall, all great inventions, creations as well as people started out as non-conventional, un-realistic, impossible as well as im-practical.<br><br>To all future entrepreunuers, this could be a great business concept in the making, I truely hope that everyone will look at this concept with different points of view, not just the negative side.<br><br>p.s: Im still studying this concept. Just a point of view from a neutral fellow forumer. Cheers!</div>

I hate to sound bias but there are some issues which you brought up which i need to question.<br><br>Disclaimer: Now i will really be sounding like im bias.<br><br>1) Well, On the negative side, everything that involves putting money in and simply getting money out thru a not authorised way = ponzi?<br><br>On the supportive side, if you have read the news well enough, the news claimed that SE indeed have products in their E-mall as well as a product called EmCall which is worth $21,000. (which after finding out, it is actually worth 2,100 mins).<br><br>Ive known enough ponzi schemes to judge. Ponzi, in short is no products, no actual office and no physical bosses. In short, members would not have known what the company actually is doing, except getting money. Agree?<br><br>If SE's E-mall and Emcall is truely real and one of their products, would you kindly explain to me how Ponzi does it looks like?<br><br>Im really sounding Pro-SE but im sorry, im just trying to defend entreprenuership as a whole.<br><br>2) I agree that many have been cheated before, and I also agree that you have the right to warn people about scams and if im you, i would have done the same. But look, MLM as itself, does not equal to scam, MLM is just a difference way of franchising, marketing. Well, if people truely regard news and the Gov.t messages and directives as a judgement. I cant see why the Gov.t legalised MLM. Unless you are telling that their directives are flawed? If so, why bother to read up the news and browse the MAS? Agree?<br><br>3) Well, I've known some of his projects and in fact, to tell the truth, ive been involved before. Track records are impt. But haven you read up biblographies about successful people who have failed many times before they broke thru?<br>Just to quote, 'I am sure there is some dangers to it and the way he operate things....'  Well, how sure are you? and have you work with him before? if you didnt, how do you know how he operates?<br><br>4) Well, as for the last part of your response, I find it rather irrational. By saying I love you father could be a way of showing affection to this JP guy. For a person to say that, he must have really benefitted from JP. Well, there is one chinese phrase called  'Tai Shan Yi Fen Zhong, Tai Xia Shi Nian Gong', which means, it takes ten years of effort for a minute on stage. Perhaps the hardwork and determination this guys gave cant be compared to the 'famous people' but i find it rather detesting that you said that they didnt put in any hardwork or effort?<br><br>Well, Bill Gates started with his OS system, perhaps JP started with his emall and emcall.<br><br>'a bunch of teenagers walking around in suits doesnt help either.'<br><br>I cant help but feel sorry for you, teenagers wearing suit? Which part of it is wrong? I feel sorry for you are also a teenager and yet you cant accept the fact that some other 19yr olds out striving for a better future and you, down there is undermining that young pple cant go far.<br><br>Nth to Cheer about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>-.-  there is a reason i ask u to cheer.......dont sound so angry mah  u  r defending ur views i defending mine....<br><br>teenegars can walk around in suits why not. i trying to point the fact that students like me going around asking people to join SE dont seem so good....unless its a good company but so far, the newspaper isnt giving credits to sunshine empire. and even so, would u feel more comfortable doing business deals with teenagers or adults. IF a  teenagers wanted to strieve for a better future....at least study finish b4 considering other things. u can tell me, a cert is nothing but down the road, u can ask how many people has regretted it not studying hard. singapore is a meritocracy society. i dont wanna get into details for this.....<br><br>the quote father i love u is from the newspaper mah and i juz say my views lor. but the thing is, he gone abit too far because affection does not have to be shown in such a way. its more of like a cult status if u ask me. however, its either the editor has paraphrase , i choose to believe that this are his own words. the first impression he give me when i saw the newspaper is very bad.<br><br>I dont know SE well enough and the products they carry in the em mall and that service em call. no comment on that<br><br>of course people are allow to fail but the thing is....how they fail and if they got learn from it or not. when i mention Bill gate first started his company, i mean he went around showing people his sample and PROVE that it work. for SE....income invoice is the best evident unless....they didnt pay taxes... as for JP himself, not much about him except that infamous NOP NTI thread lor. i juz taking from there de.<br><br>defending entreprenuership and defending SE is totally diff.  I support entreprenuership as you do but i juz dont think joing SE is a good idea.<br><br>however, all this are my personal views and we can juz end this arguement here ok. i dont wanna start a war in here... and i know where i am headed to for my future and not every1 is as lucky as me.<br><br></div>

So what if they wear suit? Striving for a better future through this kind of method disguits me even though many of them are around my age group.<br><br>Im not in anyway related to SE or have been related before. However, from what i have read from the many posts regarding this company, including the MAS alert list and more recently, the one about water theme park in Sarawak, i can only say time tells whether they are legitimate business or is there a bigger plot behind.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. Definitely sound interesting. Being Blacklisted or under investor watchlist of MAS is not a good thing. This sound serious? I don't think Mas will just anyhow blacklist some company without investigating.?<br><br>And omg, j*mes say hes better than Warrent Buffet? Hes a legend? Thats sound like some 3 year old kid saying he is a superman. I mean wake up. Warrant buffet dun go around asking people to join his company. Hes' is pure intelligent and superb analytical mind.<br><br>I dare  not say MLM companies are all scam but seriously.. on the surface they potray out an image of "free lunch" earning more than those graduate, masters or even FUND MANAGER... Sounds crazy but they are convincing us so.<br><br>Singapore is a practical and realistic company. We have to work hard in order to earn. Not just going around recruiting and play mind games with one and other. :<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by azh86:</div><div class="quote_body">Sometimes i really wonder why i must reply to such response. I hate to sound bias but there are some issues which you brought up which i need to question.<br><br>Disclaimer: Now i will really be sounding like im bias.<br><br>1) Well, On the negative side, everything that involves putting money in and simply getting money out thru a not authorised way = ponzi?<br><br>On the supportive side, if you have read the news well enough, the news claimed that SE indeed have products in their E-mall as well as a product called EmCall which is worth $21,000. (which after finding out, it is actually worth 2,100 mins).<br><br>Ive known enough ponzi schemes to judge. Ponzi, in short is no products, no actual office and no physical bosses. In short, members would not have known what the company actually is doing, except getting money. Agree?<br><br>If SE's E-mall and Emcall is truely real and one of their products, would you kindly explain to me how Ponzi does it looks like?<br><br>Im really sounding Pro-SE but im sorry, im just trying to defend entreprenuership as a whole.<br><br>2) I agree that many have been cheated before, and I also agree that you have the right to warn people about scams and if im you, i would have done the same. But look, MLM as itself, does not equal to scam, MLM is just a difference way of franchising, marketing. Well, if people truely regard news and the Gov.t messages and directives as a judgement. I cant see why the Gov.t legalised MLM. Unless you are telling that their directives are flawed? If so, why bother to read up the news and browse the MAS? Agree?<br><br>3) Well, I've known some of his projects and in fact, to tell the truth, ive been involved before. Track records are impt. But haven you read up biblographies about successful people who have failed many times before they broke thru?<br>Just to quote, 'I am sure there is some dangers to it and the way he operate things....'  Well, how sure are you? and have you work with him before? if you didnt, how do you know how he operates?<br><br>4) Well, as for the last part of your response, I find it rather irrational. By saying I love you father could be a way of showing affection to this JP guy. For a person to say that, he must have really benefitted from JP. Well, there is one chinese phrase called  'Tai Shan Yi Fen Zhong, Tai Xia Shi Nian Gong', which means, it takes ten years of effort for a minute on stage. Perhaps the hardwork and determination this guys gave cant be compared to the 'famous people' but i find it rather detesting that you said that they didnt put in any hardwork or effort?<br><br>Well, Bill Gates started with his OS system, perhaps JP started with his emall and emcall.<br><br>'a bunch of teenagers walking around in suits doesnt help either.'<br><br>I cant help but feel sorry for you, teenagers wearing suit? Which part of it is wrong? I feel sorry for you are also a teenager and yet you cant accept the fact that some other 19yr olds out striving for a better future and you, down there is undermining that young pple cant go far.<br><br>Nth to Cheer about.  </div></blockquote>ponzi scam doesnt means no office no products.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>MLM is not scam. however, sunshine empire is not MLM either. it disguised itself as MLM but actually running a ponzi scam.<br><br>emall is just a website where some unknown companies advertise their products online. sunshine empire DO NOT distribute those products listed in the website. if i'm a distributor in sunshine empire, which do i market? the website??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> then what is my compensation payout for marketing the website???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>you claimed to know enough ponzi scam to judge.. good for you.<br><br>however, i think you going to eat back your words for JP is definitely much more clever than you. hello.. i think when JP first played ponzi scam in singapore, i think you are just 4 YEARS OLD!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
