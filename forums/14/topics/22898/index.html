It is only the people at the top who are doing any good. One of my ex-friends got sucked into Amway. Thought she was going<br>to be a millionaire in 6 months. Sad really I couldn't stand all the preaching and it ended a good friendship because I was not<br>prepared to take the insults of being told that I am a negative thinker and as such will end up an under-achiever. She still has not<br>got her big house or her Mercedes and if the truth be known probably could not afford to buy a new bicycle. Anyone who approaches you with one of these schemes my advice is to answer in two words. One beginning with F and the other beginning with O. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Hence its better for you to recruit people to sell, than to sell the product itself - when people sign up under you, you get a cut from their sales even when you sell nothing yourself.<br><br>Essentially, something is wrong when more effort is spend on getting people to sell the product, than to sell the product itself. Even the act of signing up profits the people at the top when you pay joining fees and buy supplies to sell to others.<br><br>Unless you got in at the very beginning, it is pretty likely that your efforts will only end up profiting others much more than yourself.</div>
