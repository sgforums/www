            <div class='col-md body'>MLM is waste of time network marketing. Usually the owners of MLM companies will try to flash their 6 figure salaries &amp; luxury cars. Just remember the people who start the MLM business will be the ones always richs while their downlines will gradually get poorer and poorer. Most of MLM profits are obtained through purchasing stupid tapes/books on how to get rich and attending pathetic seminars. One more thing MLM people always say education waste of time and they always try to compare the cost of a can of coke.

            <div class='col-md body'>As mentioned in my posting about MLM under the bel air topic. Not all MLM companies are bad, it depends on how they conduct the presentation and how the compensation is structured. As long as they operate within the limits of the MLM act and priced the product appropriately with emphasis on selling more than recruitment would it be okay. Unfortunately many of these distributors do every thing from withholding of information/misrepresentation to trick people to join up to finance their up startup cost. please read my previous posting to have an idea of the rules and regulation surrounding MLM and how to recognise a proper MLM company or a pyramid-scheme recruiting based one.</div>
