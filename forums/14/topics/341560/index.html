              <p>Hello!!</p>
              <p><span id="radContent">In addition, the Act exempted certain classes of
              schemes, such as insurance-related schemes, master franchises and
              schemes that adopt direct selling and network marketing methods,
              provided they satisfy certain conditions. The exempted schemes and the
              conditions are set out in the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling
              (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order. The Exemption Order was
              amended in 2001 and came into effect on 1 January 2002.(taken from the website)</span></p>
              <p>MLM is not a commerce crime like what you said,if the company meets the criteria then it is not illegal,read properly first please.</p>
              <p>Anyway it's good information for people to understand the difference between a pyramid and a mlm. Thanks.</p>

              <p>the only way to help ourselves get out of mlm is to get our own hands dirty and know the tricks of MLM inside out so as to arm ourselves with armour piercing bullets designed to pirece through the psersuadsive convincing discussions of mlm agents.</p>
              <p>there's only so little to what law can do, since these days, those small mlm companies who's out to do mlm scams they themselves are smart enough to hire lawyer to ask and find out the loopholes of the mlm law to  make the best use out of it.</p>
              <p>so there's not other better way to understand and protect yourself against mlm other than studying it. but do study from the right person who's not bias and will take a neutral stand and opinion on mlm.</p>

              <p><br>I agree with <strong>Ageleon</strong>, I want to add that many people in this world are just living in their comfort zone. They have never attempted to try MLM but yet they speak evil about it. They knew very little about MLM industries but yet they speak of it as if the industry belongs to them and they know the industries inside out. They avoid their fellow MLM networker friends as if they have become someone horrendous. Sad to say, they are just subconsciously making excuses to protect themselves and avoiding new opportunities.</p>
              <p>I used to be skeptical about MLM myself, I don't need to elaborate because as soon as I do that, more negative feedbacks will be showering this post. However, like Ageleon said, I had to let go my ego and my pride as a "know it all" business owner to try my hands on MLM industry. The reason why I joined MLM out of my skepticism was due to my respect and trust to two of my business associates, one of them went bankruptcy and owed the bank for $400K and his news articles can be found on major newspapers because he is quite a prominent person in Singapore. The other of my business associate, he had an accident which made him permanently paralyzed and he has to be on a wheelchair for his whole life and eventually he lost his businesses.</p>
              <p>Both of them came back due to their humble characters to try out the infamous MLM businesses, they have now made their comeback and lived comfortably. You do not have to believe me, but I know what I am talking about. The straits times, her world, simply her and other magazines and newspapers had interviewed them before. Therefore I know and I trust them, MLM is something I can try.</p>
              <p>For those who are skeptical, just stay like that, because even if 2 Christmases have passed you will most likely still be the same person with the same financial situation or just slightly better. As for us the MLM networkers, we are just open to you all. We have nothing to explain unless you want to ask.</p>
              <p>Skeptical persons are very dangerous and not ideal to join MLM, because once they fail the business, they will surely blame the MLM company and not themselves.</p>

              <p>Making mistakes again and again.</p>
              <p>6 months to 9 months is the most conservative time frame I'll say that it takes for an New-Blood to be so enthu about what there're doing.</p>
              <p>Even with consultation, still un-successful primary due to ask wrong group of people who will give such advises to come online. [Because uplines are just merely using their downlines to get them prospects without killing their own reputation since they are not the ones doing the dirty work. - Something like finding a scapegoat. So in future if any upline ask you to do online via forums etc. You know who to avoid :) ]</p>
              <p>While Harsh Fact is: They often don't even survive for 2-3 months online - Based
                  on experience since they practice high level suicidal moves. ROFL.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Typical Classic
              Example</strong></span> of what damages a <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">New Hot-Blood MLM</span></strong> Agent on
              <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mistakes</span></strong> that
              an agent does to kill his/her own reputation and creditability.</p>
              <p>Making mistakes again and again.</p>
              <p>6 months to 9 months is the most conservative time frame I'll
              say that it takes for an New-Blood to be so enthu about what
              there're doing.</p>
              <p>Even with consultation, still un-successful primary due to ask
              wrong group of people who will give such advises to come online.
              [Because uplines are just merely using their downlines to get them
              prospects without killing their own reputation since they are not
              the ones doing the dirty work. - Something like finding a
              scapegoat. So in future if any upline ask you to do online via
              forums etc. You know who to avoid :) ]</p>
              <p>While Harsh Fact is: They often don't even survive for 2-3
              months online - Based on experience since they practice high level
              suicidal moves. ROFL.</p>
