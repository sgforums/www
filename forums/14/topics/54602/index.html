            <div class='col-md body'>How to evaluate a network marketing business:<br><br>1. What is the product (s)?<br><br>This is the first question you'll want to ask. It should be something that you would purchase even if there wasn't a business opportunity attached to it. It should be a consumable type item. Something that is used up and re-ordered. This means repeat sales and increased profits.<br><br>All legitimate MLM opportunities have a real, solid product(s). If they don't -- watch out! The money will be made only by recruiting others which borders on being illegal.<br><br>When choosing a network marketing company, it is dangerous to choose one that has only 1 product. Because if something is wrong with this product, then the organization would collapse. Don't choose a company with only 1 range of products. For e.g. a company that sells only cosmetics. There has to be a wide variety products to cater for different people, different age groups and different needs.<br><br>2. How long has the company been in business?<br><br>Many new MLM companies go out of business within two years.<br>Usually due to mismanagement and poor cash flow.<br><br>There is a growth curve that most companies go through. You want to get involved with a company that has solid financial and management backing.<br><br>3. How profitable and easy is the compensation plan?<br><br>This will be where your income comes from. It must be fair and easy to understand for it to be successful. And must be tied into the sales of the product not just recruitment. Look for at least a 50% total payout depending on the level you're at.<br><br>4. What is the start up cost?<br><br>Most MLM businesses cost less than $500 to sign up and get your kit. This is because of regulations in a number of states. Just because it's more doesn't mean it's bad. But you'll want to justify the cost. Ask what you get for your money.<br><br>5. What support systems and training do they offer?<br><br>One of the reasons to get involved with a turnkey business is because you can plug into a proven success system. You should have the most experienced distributors teaching and helping new recruits get started. Do they offer seminars, tape courses, conference calls, web site support etc.? And for a reasonable price?<br><br>Take the time to learn from the best. You'll succeed much faster and with less time and effort.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi NW_GOD,<br><br>before joining any company, it is to your best advantage to evaluate first before heading straight in. It is not appropriate for me to list out which are the best 5 mlm companies as I don't actually go and evaluate every company. What i can tell you is I have been involved with 4 network marketing companies and finally found the ideal one.<br><br>The first company their main product is too expensive, culture wrong, and i can say the company management don't really understand what network marketing is<br><br>The 2nd company is one i get to know through the Internet. It has a very good replicating webpage for recruitment and products are quite common just like any other company. Their products are something like supplements, very common. And, management support is poor, response is slow.<br><br>The 3rd company is a very established one, with over 20 yrs. The main products are mainly weight management. products is good, it works but then the website support is not that good. i'm also looking for a company that can allow me to do recruitment easily internationally. the products are limited in singapore too.<br><br>The 4th company I stay on because it meets all the criteria i have mentioned in my earlier posting on 'how to evaluate a network marketing business'. most important is the company has a unique mission and I feel satisfied and happy just sharing this mission.<br><br>i've also been involved with Internet programs for the past 10 months and there really is a lot of scams out there. be careful too when joining programs totally internet based.<br><br>Network marketers are people with vision. people often have the concept network marketing is asking people to make them rich. WRONG! You would fail in this business if you think this way. Its actually a business  in which you should be thinking how you can help others to be successful due to your help.<br>And network marketing can be fun and easy.<br>It is the best business you can ever be in.<br><br>Hope that helps<br><br></div>
