            <div class='col-md body'>For those who wan to know more bout wat the hell is Network Marketing, pls give urself some time to view the following URL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> :<br><br>http://www.mlm.ch/<br><br>(copy and paste it in ur link)<br><br>u will find answers to :<br><br>1) How Network Marketing, this biz concept comes about?<br>2) Why Network Marketing products so expensive?<br>3) Why are their products so good?<br>4) Why people mistaken it as pyramid scheme? etc<br><br>Find out more answers from there. Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies. Jus take a look at the newspaper for the past one month, alot of articles is focusing on NETWORK MARKETING, and they also teaches us how to prevent from bad companies. if u wan to know, read the straits times forum on MLM and chinese lianhezhaobao on last sunday 18/01/04.<br><br>Most imptly, its not the money that counts. Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>

I met some companies agents who did this, and I praised them in the end. Btw, these agents also will tell me before hand they are presenting to me their biz opportunities, instead of 'lets go down here eat then bring you to the company'. I only forgive this method if the company in the end impresses me.<br><br>My experience , lets say ntiparis. The method was to keep harping on the company president, binary as the best plan in the world, and is an international company blah blah. Those posts in ntiparis thread by others will tell you enough that the usual marketing techniques is not to explain, but to 'boast'. Sometimes, when I got diappointed with the company, and my friend still yakking away about the greatness, I have the murderous urge to yank his hair out of his head.<br><br>And, nope I never heard of Goji, but at least beside the overselling part, he did put in some credible points like who back the company up, the accreditation of the CEO, but isnt it bit too much by calling him Bill Gates.
