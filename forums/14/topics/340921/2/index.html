              <p>I do hope you are different. But MLM is still a job; you are still a salesman. You are in a business when you can find your own suppliers, bargain for a price, then own a shop, a brand name, etc, to sell to your own customers. You employ people and pay them a salary/CPF, etc etc.</p>
              <p>As long as you are talking about climbing the ranks, or being rewarded for certain achievements, you are still in a company, not your own business.</p>
              <p>One thing in MLM you can learn is how to be good in sales, although it's not necessary to learn that within a MLM company.</p>
              <p>If you are good, you are better off coming out to set up your own business or shop selling your own things, and not stay in MLM.</p>

              <p>Eagle, you are right about setting our own business finding suppliers, bargain for a price and owning a shop to run the business.  I would not deny the fact that I may not be owning my own business in a MLM company and the possibility for me to earn more if I would to sell more products and at the same time, coach people to sell more products.</p>
              <p>Everybody would like to own their own business but not many can afford the tens of thousands of dollars to fork out first to rent a place and run their own business not knowing if they can or will succeed after leaving their full time job to run their own business.  I choose MLM because I have the possibility to do it part time without interfering with a full time job and not risking my tens of thousands of dollars at one shot.</p>

              <p>one last thing for people who have read the book before i go</p>
              <p><br>No matter what you do always remember!</p>
              <p>&gt;No person has the right to rain on your dreams.</p>
              <p>&gt;To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.</p>
              <p>&gt;Some men see things as they are and say, "Why?" I dream of things that never were and say, "Why not?"</p>
              <p>&gt;Dreams pass into the reality of action. From the actions stems the
              dream again; and this interdependence produces the highest form of
              living.</p>
