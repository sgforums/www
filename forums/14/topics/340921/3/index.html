              <p>so you PUSH your ideology on others and call people who don't accept it CORPSE and STUBBORN, while ignoring the fucking fact that you are STUBBORN in not accepting the fact that mlm sucks?</p>
              <p>if a product is good, will it need HORDES of people to do sales for it? and rather than selling the fucking product, the main purpose of the salesperson is to find other downlines?</p>

              <p>Don't fucking kid yourself... you want to help others to get rich? wake up lah, only a fucking idiot will think that mlm is making the world a better place. if mlm is so good, the world will be FLOODING with millionaires. how can that be fucking possible?</p>

              <p><br>What makes you think that skythewood is someone who works from 8-5? someone who brings home an average income? How would you be so sure that he is one of the top 5% rich people in the world? You are too arrogant and knowledge deficit regarding this matter. Too brainwashed and arrogant. Wake up from MLM is no. 1and see the real world. And FYI, the real world doesnt mean 8-5.</p>

              <p>Fact is, many people also do not like 8-5 jobs, and dreams of setting up their own business, commanding people around. Just that they do not take action. MLM preys on this part of human psychology and makes you believe deeply in them. It's really a masterstroke.</p>

              <p>People like Donald Trump and Robert Kiyosaki gathered lots of work and life experience on their journey to getting rich. But you? You know why everyone of us is flaming you now?

              <p>nope, don't process with your dick brain. yes, i called you a dick. you may try to appear civilized by making subtle insults, don't bother. it's the same as using vulgarities. except you are trying to "look" civil, which makes you look even more fake.</p>
              <p>if there is nothing to cheers, don't cheers. that is such a fake and fuck thing to do. IF the whole world do MLM, who will be the richest? the top 5%, the highest UPLINES. can't even figure that out, loser.</p>

              <p>Guys, no need to bother with the uber thick skulled PROMLM. It's really obvious that he is still a child. You cant reason with him. Just give him more time to wake up from his MLM is the best land.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In his Mindset:</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li>To be the top successful 5%, The ONLY way is MLM.</li>
              <li>Those who doesnt believe in MLM are losers/Quitters.</li>
              <li>And he is unwilling to see our rational POV.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>BTW, PROMLM , all the points that you have mentioned, I have heard it before many times and they are NOT from people who made it. Even those who made it to be millionaires through MLM, they definitely do not hold such immature and childish characters as of yours.</p>
              <p>You want to be on the TOP 5%, then change your attitude and mindset 1st. Dont think that you are one big shot who is in fact a NOBODY. And then try to teach others how to be successful. Reflect on your actions and words here and you MAY realise how unintellectual your mindset is.</p>
              <p>P.S. VE would love kids like you. So immature and naive that you could easily be swayed with their words and their 'group' sessions. I was there, kiddo. Just reflect one more thing, reflect on their tactics. Do you think it's ethical? Dont tell me the 'now can deceive, but it's for their own good' crap. If can live with it, it just makes you one of those immoral ones.</p>

              <p>To the topic starter.</p>
              <p>I think this tread is turning out into a heated debate over whos right and whos wrong.</p>
              <p>What i can advice you is that mlm is networking system that has being recgonise by many. ( There will be people arguing about this, just ignore their reasoning for now. )</p>
              <p>There are many people out there having a bad impression of it. The main reason i guess is how the representatives of those mlm company use various uncomfortable methods to recruit people.</p>
              <p>So if you are wondering whether to join anot, look into this few areas of the company:</p>
              <p>Make sure that the company is selling something you have seen and touched.</p>
              <p>Look into the history of the company and product they are selling. Does it have a good track record?</p>
              <p>Understand their compensation plan and the team that you would be joining.</p>
              <p>Most people in mlm don't join on the first meet up. If your friend is pushing you to hurry, tell them that you trust them that's why you decides to head down to take a look with them. Ask them to give you some time to look through it if they still want to be your friend.</p>
              <p>If they quit being your friend when you don't join, they don't deserve your friendship.</p>
              <p>Don't even think about joining their team cause their upline might be misleading them.</p>
              <p>There are many areas to look into but all this should be your main concern before joining.</p>
