              <p>very lucky you didnt go into that company,I know which one you are talking about,the one that says their vision is to be Asia's number 1 company by march right?I was previously from that company,reason i left being the products dont work after 2months and they are simply full of lies,was lied to over and over again and the worst part was to say it was not mlm,my friends in there are still brainwashed with lies and when i call them back,all their stories are inconsistant,1moment one say malaysia side will be asia no.1 and singapore will be later,next moment another say they will be Asia no.1 by end of December but only in the sales amount of the product.</p>
              <p>HELLO!! that company only formed in june or july and the facial bar originate from WBG so they are just another 'me too' product,how "creative". The main leader of the company is a really good speaker but his system is not duplicatable at all,he claims that you can find out his good name and his history on the internet but nothing pops out.One point to note is that upline support is really f-ed up,too many bad stories about the support and lastly they think way to highly of themselves.</p>

              <p>This is analogous to a scenario which you just bought a fast food restaurant franchise. You own a company too, who in the right mind would deny it's not their company after buying a franchise? it's all in your mindset and the way of thinking.</p>

              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/247577">ViciousCycle</a> -&gt; Sad to say, you just missed an opportunity. MLM is not even a scam like many people would have believed, if it is a scam, do you think Amway will still exist today ? do you think the Singaporean government will just sit down and see people get scammed ?</p>
              <p>It's funny how most of my friends can't see the value of having an MLM as a business, they see it as a waste of money. They are more willing to buy a branded $3000 bag, but they are not willing to invest on $2000 business which can earn them money in the long run, in the future.</p>
              <p>MLM is not a get rich quick scheme, the average successful people in the MLM industry need 5 years. Some people may become successful as fast as they want, like 2 years. it is all possible, depending on how open you are to the business ? most newcomers who come in to MLM industry have employee mindsets rather than business people mindsets. which is a shame.</p>

              <p>I can honestly say, yes they are walking franchises as well. They get to earn the profit sharing or commission if the company makes profits. Can you get profit sharing with any companies where you have to work from 9 to 5 ?</p>

              <p>Yes. Maybe you weren't qualified enough to work in a reputable enough company to know it. Simple example: SIA and Keppel Corp (recently 7.5 months year end bonus due to 2008 profits). With your new definition, all Keppel Corp employees are now walking franchises too? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>But I'd like to add, Property Agents and Insurance Agents are not what MLMers will call "Human Franchise" because their works are just not duplicable and expandable. Do you actually ask your clients to sign up as an insurance agent as well ?</p>
              <p>I don't see why it is a sin for some people to mention the business as if it's their own business. This merely proves how confident these people are towards the business they are doing. It makes them money enough said, and they have the power to earn as much as they want.</p>
              <p>Are you confident to walk out your office and say it is your business (if you are employed under a company), while you are just waiting for paychecks month by month? with the same income ceiling and you have no authority or rights or power to make changes to your financial situation? Where you effort and time is just worth the same every month?</p>
              <p>at least I have respect to the property agents and insurance agents even if they do not own the franchise technically speaking. They are just walking and talking representing their companies. But they do earn as much as their effort.</p>

              <p>When I say profit sharing, this has to happen monthly, and it is a recurring pay to you every month like a dividend. You know it is very obvious bonuses like the aforementioned profit sharing is not even considered passive income. Some people actually have to pray they get the bonuses, if they are unfortunate enough, there's no even bonuses.</p>
              <p>Again, I should emphasize. Those aforementioned employees are not considered "Human Franchise" because their works cannot be leveraged by others, can you sit down in your office and leverage others to work for you ? Unless you are the boss of the company who leverages the employees to work for the company or the business.</p>
              <p>In MLM, you create downlines in hope you can leverage them and these are duplicable.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the info by the way, the book or the author itself may be wrong in some way which I do not know about.</p>
              <p>But his life still goes on and his career can't be any better. Why stop doing the thing if others say bad thing about you ?</p>
              <p>J.K Rowling also had the same issues, but her books were just selling.</p>
              <p>It comes to the readers again how to interprete and use the contents. To me, his book and let alone his board game help me and my friends a lot.</p>
              <p>So imagine if one day a newspaper wrote a negative thing about your business or company, will you close it down immediately knowing the rest of others are still benefiting from it regardless.</p>
              <p>There will always be those who are so called "Dream stealers" in your life, this proves Robert has one too, I have too. but this doesn't change a thing because we do not commit crime that harm others. Some may find his books are misleading, but how many of those who find his books helpful? It depends again on you, which side do you want to choose?</p>
              <p>When I became successful, my friend's friends said my parents are just rich and they give me all the money, when I failed in one of the businesses, my friend's friends just said they had warned me before that I wouldn't be successful and I just kept dreaming ... so either bad or good .. people will still say about you.</p>

              <p>I wish you could've read closely regarding my previous post
              regarding "Human Franchise"</p>
              <p>You are called human franchise if you can reach out to others by
              duplicating your effort and time in hope you can leverage them.</p>
              <p>Can you do the same by buying stocks or dividends?</p>
              <p>Yes, if you are at a minimum of a middle level you can leverage
              the persons under you, but does it help boost your salary? if you
              help 100 people do you earn 100 times more?</p>
              <p>For third paragraph, I do run several businesses and I use only
              one single MLM company to support and fund my businesses. I do not
              see this as a dream, I think you are the one who should wake up
              from the dream of thinking why it seems impossible to start a
              business by becoming a network marketer. Why don't you just take up
              a challenge to yourself by becoming a networker? If you can't
              make even $1000 from MLM, this virtually proves something about you

              is a sin. I have my personal friend who recovered debts of
              SGD$400K during his career in MLM industries. As a business owner I
              also stand by the power of network marketing which I cant do with
              my conventional business.</p>
              <p>There is always a limit to everything, even if you work in a
              company regardless your position as vice presidents, managing
              directors, supervisors ... is it a crime to have a passive income
              from MLM industries? I may not be vice president of an
              international bank, but I have a friend who is one and I do not
              bring out his position to brag, but this is to prove even a person
              of his position is open to this as an opportunity and realizes that
              his job does not guarantee income security.</p>

              <p>Obviously you have never worked before. <br>If you "help" 100 people, your job scope is less by 100 times. In short, you get paid the same amount for doing 100 times less than what you have been doing. That frees up time for other things.</p>

              <p>Emperor's new clothes. I just graduated and reaching &gt;4k soon with full time job and sideline business. Expecting to reach more by mid-year. This is excluding other sources of income from money market funds, unit trusts, stocks and websites. Why would I even bother with your tiny 1k?</p>
              <p>This still proves how much you are living in your own world. Since you like to challenge.... Why don't you take up a challenge to yourself by earning without being a network marketer? If you can't
              make even $1000 <strong>without </strong>MLM in your own business, this virtually proves something about you

              <p>Where did I say network marketing is a sin? Point out the exact sentence.</p>
              <p>So common of MLMers like you to immediately say that I said it is a sin when I didn't. Is that a tactic taught to you by MLM? To put words into others mouth?</p>
              <p>Network marketer is not a business; you are still a salesman, a network marketer, but not a businessman. You don't have your own brand name. Period.</p>

              <p>Nah, but I don't see them preach network marketing as the form to financial freedom; they preach property investments, and they supposedly got rich from properties. Don't bring in totally unrelated stuff to support your weak sentences.</p>
