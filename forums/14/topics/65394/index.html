            <div class='col-md body'>No you are not rude.<br><br>I agree with you. A good company should not use other tactics to a influence a prospect from joining or buying something. Since you already arrived their office, they should be straight to the product and business, using other points to influence only show that their business nature do not have other attractions.<br><br>This is the problem with most MLM business, i find most of them very unethical. Normally such practices targat on the young market because these people are less experienced and more easily being misled, but have the energy to work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, after been to many "youngster" companies and hearing from people from other :youngster" company., I developed a phobia for these companies.<br><br>After many years from experience from school till now, it is not youngsters lacking drive or ideas which made many projects or organisation fail. Its the sensibility and maturity which is lacking when we consider few factors in what we are doing. Maybe on how to organise excursion, bringing our CCAs to a new height. Many a times during my secondary school years till now, a lot of successful CCAs owed a lot to the effort of teachers, rather than students. Of course I seen good ones run by students. But because of experience and maturity parity between youngs and seniors, its always scary for me to step into a 'young' organisation<br><br>For me, companies agents like AMH who are so called using 'hard pressure' tactics and other "unethical" tactics to lure people in are not blameless, coz of the presence of many senior people in company.<br><br>If the boss wished to attract young people, he should be influence them in the positive way since he is definitely the most experienced and mature guy in the company. You can say he cant control so many people etc etc.....then I am sorry to say "Too bad". The company will soon be come dysfunctional......maybe even cease to function.<br><br>Just my many 2 cents kekekekeke <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Edited for spelling errors</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

She asked,<br>"where am I working?"  I told her near Chinatown then she told me she went to eat at the hawker center near the Outram MRT with my friend." I was puzzled and told her, "there are no hawker center near the MRT."  She added, "The one that is further down abit."<br>She was slightly panic when she replied me, "Further down abit."<br><br>Some day later, my friend told me that she never have any meal with her in Chinatown before.  I do not wish to side my friend but I believe that the person is lying because firstly there is no hawker near the Outram MRT and moreover she was slightly panic when she was replying to me.  This is the bad impression she has given.</div>
