All these are not easy to patch back even after you left for some times. bad memories will always come back to haunt you if you have any conscience in you. haiz.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>er...one question i need to ask. why must they meet the prospects at the hotel? is it easier for them to duped the drinks of handsome/pretty prospects and @#$% them when they are unconscious? or is it easier for the members themselves to go "kai fang" when they are not meeting any prospects at the hotel <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>but at this rate, most hotel will BAN them from going to the hotel soon as complaints will start flooding their reception as the hotel guests smell something "fishy" (aroma).....or police will often come to investigate when some pretty/handsome prospects are @#$% by B'A members who are not the opposite sex but the same sex?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Use BA tactic call him out for  coffee &amp; then ask him to come into this forum.
