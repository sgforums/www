Do you think that people like to get into debts and ruin their own life? Do you? What the heck give you the right to say that? I also have my investments and whatnot, does that make me knowledgable?<br><br>Infact what got me into this is not so much on greed but my naiveness. I never thought that there are such evil bast**ds in the world <strong>that would not think twice about cheating people of their money</strong>. You think I would love to lose my life savings? For your info again, like you I also do invest in CPF and it is growing at a healthier rate than yours.<br><br>Once again please do not condemn others without knowing the whole fact. Do you know how many businessmen lost everything in the 97 asia crisis. Do you think they want that? Can you call them idiots for doing business since it is so "risky"? Likewise I thought that Belair was an legitimate business. Come on what could go wrong?!?!?!?!?? <strong>IT"S THE BLOODY SPONSER FOR NATIONAL DAY PARADE FOR GOD SAKE!!!!!!!!!!</strong><br><br>Please think twice before posting like you did...

It is really saddening to see how people have suffered and felt victimised by MLM - Belair.<br><br>However, I have decided to make a post here after reading how some of you have refused to admit that it was GREED that has caused all your troubles and problems. If it was not GREED, then I must say it is really your STUPIDITY. I cannot possibly imagine how someone can be so 'naive' to forge out $12k like that. Ask yourself, what was the triggering reason for deciding to join belair in the first place. Easy money? Thinking that you will make huge loads of money easily? Thinking that you will be your own boss? Thinking that your $12k will roll into twice, triple, fourfolds etc.?? This is not called naivety. This is simply greed.<br><br>If you say you simply join belair because you want to earn a living and provide for your family. Why didn't you just find a down-to-earth job and earn a stable income monthly?<br><br>You have landed in this bleeding shit yourself. Pick yourself up and face the music. When you point fingers at others whinning about hw you were victimised, please also reflect and think whether you were too greedy in the beginning.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey that was a long thread i see. Anyway I jus went for the seminar for Bel'Air at commonwealth last thursday.<br><br>Lots of enthusiasm but you don't see the true-self of people. I see all of them wearing masks and saying that they are doing a lucrative business which i tot if money is so good would you ever share your money with me?<br><br>Anyway, I went inside the room and was irritated by the overwhelming (not nice at all) smell. Even felt dizzy so i thought how could i ever had the passion to sell such things cos the speaker said you need to be passionate about your products.<br><br>Then i realize everybody there dressed in suit was carrying one of those burner! thats how the smell follows me everywhere!<br><br>Jus an advice to weak minded people - Be strong if there is any opportunities, it won't be shouting at you to say: Come Come I am a GOOD Opportunity!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone.<br><br>Let me give me two cents worth of thoughts here.<br><br>What's been done wrong has been done. No use rubbing salt into their wounds when they've already been so heavily in debts. Do you think that by doing so, it'll bring back the money that they've lost? Instead, we should give them our moral support so that they will have the courage to move on from here. Jiayou me friends.<br><br>What we should do now is to spread the message around about BEL'AIR. No doubt that some people might've doubts about what we spread because it's somewhat of 'good reputation' with themselves being a NDP sponsor and their propaganda (Me apologies, I dont know how to spell this word) about network marketing online in their global website.<br><br>Meanwhile, I'm still spreading around me words about BEL'AIR so do keep it up. It matters that the truth be heard and justice be brought to them soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, just like to clarify that I am not here to challenge or attack anyone. I am aware that this forum is for the benefit of educating the public of the perils of MLM or belair specifically. I am definitely not a fan of MLM or belair. In fact, I have been asking and sending links to many of my friends and relatives who are still in the belair circle to view these forum postings as I really hope that they can get out as soon as possible.<br><br>However, the reason why I made that posting was that if you want people to believe in what you said, you have to be 100% truthful (which I believe some of you are not and are still acting ????). To refuse that GREED is not a reason for joining MLM is simply lame. (Note: I applaud those who dare to admit graciouslyÂ….these are the people who will be able to pick themselves up and move forward.)<br><br>If we want to help those who are still blinded, we need to show them that this forum is impartial and is not a biased platform where you can only find whiners and losers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well said! Anyway greed did play a major part in how i ended up in Belair. But the wordplay and tactics used by them is why most of us "trusted" them. At that time, my uni fren introduced me to it. She alredi brought in several frens who I personally know as well. I was thinking, "hey, my frens are here, they said they're doing well. Can earn money etc etc... maybe I can be like them too, make money together. They're my frens, i know them, i trust them"<br><br>In actual fact the words that come out of their mouth is put in place by the Marquis and Duke above. There are cases where:<br>Their sister bring them in and the join in... cos it's his/her sister.<br>Their son/daughter bring the mother in... cos it's her own flesh and blood<br>Have u ever thought tat ur will sis/bro/son/daughter bring u to die? No!<br><br>Their ex-colleagues bring them in... cos they had working relationship before, altho not as strong as above 2 pts but it does happen as wat I observed.<br><br>The Dukes and Marquis are well aware tat when people trust each other they tend to follow or listen to wat their fren/mother/brother/sister said... who else to "trust" but ur own flesh and blood? Who else to trust but ur "frens" whom u've known for yrs?<br>Something for all of u to think about... there's more to GREED here... it's just barely scratching the surface of complex human interactions.<br><br>Oya... about reporting to police/authority I've been waiting until now to hear something from CAD... still no reply on whether any action at all to be taken...
