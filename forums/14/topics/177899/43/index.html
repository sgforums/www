            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Thanks for all the great info being shared. I'm sure a lot of people will stand to gain from the stuff here.<br><br>In fact, I find alot of information to their modus operandi very similar to the ones I've experienced.<br><br>I went to the seminar at commonwealth once after being approached by my friend.  To my surprise, I found nothing special in their presentation and was very sketical about the whole thing.<br><br>The way I was being approached by my friend was the same as mentioned in the earlier posts. Haha, it was so funny reading about it though I've suspected it on my very first meeting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>To cut the story short, I declined his invitation to join his group, the infamous AAA although I was curious when he mentioned that his group do not anyhow take in people. These "people" must first go through and pass a series of interviews with their uplines. LOL! What a joke!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Indeed, I was very intrigued by this very unusual "method", I suspected they are using some sort of reverse psychology on those people like me who are sketical about the whole business. Too bad it did worked on me, as in my line of work, I use it alot!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Initially think Bel-Air to be a normal MLM company, I was very shocked to learnt the truth after stumbling to this forum  a couple of weeks back. Now, I just hope that my friend wake up and cut short his losses although it seems highly unlikely. He just seems so fanatic about it and he's going to quit his job and go into it full-time.<br><br>Once again, a big thanks to those who help to spread the msg and prevent other people from coming into harm!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess they have to carrying on cheating people, because that is the only way they can sustain their monthly credit card bills... people, do not look at how much they are ''earning'' a month, as those figures are not indicative of how much they actually get to keep in their pockets at the end of the month...<br><br>Funny thing is how they actually use the cashflow workshop to get people to think about their financial situation, but actually those in Belair are in more dire straits...</div>

Ask her to read what have been written in this forum and if she is still not convinced, she will be the one who will finally get hurt. At most,  I give her 6 months and she will see the true colours of her uplines.<br><br>How long has she joined Bel'Air? If I earned 8 to 9K speculating in the stock market in 2 weeks time but loss a total of 20K in 6 months time, can I say I make money speculating in stocks?<br><br>I feel sorry for your sister. You had better get her out as soon as possible.<br><br>This thread will continue and is going to be number 1 soon. If she refuses to listen, tell the readers what happened to her 6 months from now.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All..<br><br>I've read with disgruntledness about bel'air etc etc and it's "networking" tactics.<br><br>I happen to be only of baron positon.. climbing the slow and steady way as a product user. I'm a fond believer of SOME products having read the PSB reports attached to some of the oils...<br><br>I have been very fortunate of my "upline" as she has never ever pushed me once to sign up count etc etc. though I could not say the same for her own upline who constantly badgered her to join up..<br><br>However.. she was one who took advantage of the 12k (15k goods) push up count promotion of 2 years back...she was quite pressured into doing so as she was one of the few that really believed in the product.. especially the eucayptus oil, the baby shower gel (has helped alot of friends with eczema babies) and the magnolia oil which has treated symtomatically kids with stuffy noses.<br><br>Sadly.. after joining up.. she n her hubby was left to fend for themselves as the group they were in disbanded (L**) what was left was the KLumpur Arm)<br><br>We are now left "orphans" and have solicted the help of D &amp; M another group to explain the commission and Pv qualifications. They also had no desire to ask us to make any switch whatsoever..They showed pure concern and I honestly say they showed no ulterior motives..<br><br>I become a worried_downline for my upline as she has all her goods "stuck" and have already passed the "refund" period..<br><br>The worry I have is not of the goods being stuck as she slowly sells it out or exchanges it for whatever her "downlines" need. The worry is of the 4k count maintenance and the 5% disc...<br><br>I am very upset that as a member she does not even qualify for the meagre 15% on goods!! I as a baron still get my 29% rebate -GST (24%).. She does not even get a cent!!! She'll be paying FULL RETAIL PRICE!!! Not only that.. when the 7% GST takes effect in July.. She'll need to even take out a further 2%???<br><br>This I believe is basic consumer deserves..<br><br>Fine! if she does not sell her goods.. she has 9-10k left.. fine! if her downlines only buy $200 worth each month.. but there is no reaason not to even award her her member privaledge of 15% (aft 5%GST)?? She pays $60 just like the rest of us....<br><br>So this is a consumer problem..NOT a BIZ/Pyramid prob any longer..<br><br>Anyone here has a suggestion?? CAn we then go to CHASE?<br><br>Another Prob: She is a housewife.. how on earth is she going to count the remainder of the 4k she needs to maintain in order to make sure she matches up and not lose the commission then?? It all does not make sense to us at all..Does that mean she has to call up every single downline and ask how much they spent for the month and then do the Math???<br><br>Those who are in similar position I hope we can band together and give Bel'air a piece of our minds..<br><br>I don't mind their products..some really has it usefulness.. but I think being in Count positon sucks!! They are neither up nor down.. and they pay the full retail if their downlines are not active...<br><br></div>
