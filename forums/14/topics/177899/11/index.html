Some wanted to refund but can't because they lost their invoice. And the company which still holds the record of the invoice refused to refund one of my friends. They really regret their decision to join this bloody company. Another friend took a long time to wait for his refund and I don't know if he still got back his refund. Maybe not yet? One more thing also: distributors will not get back their full refund because of GST 5% and the 10 % loss if u decide to quit after more than 2 weeks. I dunno if they still have other miscellaneous charges to minimise their loss as well as ur refunds.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It sounds very nice to have their refund Policy but according to MLM laws, they are required to give a 100% refund within 60 Days minus an acceptable administrative fee.

The 10% refund by the upline is only applicable that the uplines are still active and has sales volume. furthermore, the 90% refund by company is for those non-promotional items onli, i.e. not all 90% as stated. that person who wanted the refun can really "kao bo bak sai"....as what happened to many of my friends  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
