But look what i said. i said i got a problem with that statement, and if you do read, it stemmed from my argument with another person in the nti topic.<br><br>At this point of time, i have just lost faith in human reasoning.<br><br>&gt;.&lt;</span><br><br>thank you laurence for your contribution. but lets dedicate this thread to more discussion of B'A and the experience that people had gained from this company. fundamentally, most of the points that you had quoted are <span style="color: blue;">theoretically</span> right and B'A company is of course <span style="color: blue;">legal (money can do anything). </span>however, realities and theories are often too far apart.<br><br>a simple thing that i recommend you to do:<br>1) cut yourself at least a "clown" or "1+5 challenging monkey" system if you can afford the money. if you do not have the money, go and borrow from family, relatives, friends, credit card companies, banks, etc to enter this "glorious" biz<br><br>2) then start to enter their system and 100% dedicate yourself into B'A for at least 2 years. my definition of 100% dedicate=no other income sources, 24/7 9am-3am (yes! from morning 9am til early morning 3am), pay for all your own expenses including all the blood sucking fees. Must act "tua kang" of your friends, so must buy expensive and branded stuffs. no faked goods or sale goods pls, you must behave like a 5-figure income international biz man. (diu, owe pple 5 figure income then its true). Must follow what your "ducks" instructed you to do, if you dare to have your own thinking and defy their instructions, you'll be considered renegates and prepared to be marked<br><br>3) if you manage to find "clowns" under you, ask the below "clowns" to repeat step 1)-2). then kindly share with us your 2 years of precious experience...i think by that time, you'll start another thread much more fiery than this...i think you'll be much more "tu-lan" B'A than any of us here.<br><br>and if you think that MLM companies are so noble and righteous as what you'll think then congrats!!! you had found your true love (sincerely from my heart, wishing you all the best) !!<br><br>kekeke<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's not that education is the issue here. Using education to argue is a weak excuse merely to cover the person's greed for more money, whether he is highly educated or not. Seriously, it's the person desire to earn money that is the issue. The thing abt any mlm program is that it doesnt require rocket science to succeed. I believe that is the point they are trying to bring here. True.<br><br>But still why is it that people with low education like PSLE dropouts did not do mlm and can still get by with life? Why is it that graduates have to stoop so low to do mlm or bel air in particular? No dreams for the dropout? No I dun think so. Dreams are subjective, it may or may not require money. Having money does not mean success. It's material success. If you always need money to happy, then you will not be happy forever cos you are dependent on something. So what if so and so earns big bucks? It's credit to him...it's a measure of his ability. You must always have the ability to match your worth value.<br><br>My belief is that people do mlm is becos they want an easy way out of life, even university graduates. Some may claim mlm is not easy. True enough. If not for the money, will you still do it? It's still about the money. Making friends with an aim in mind? If undergrads who are doing mlm are so confident they will earn a lot of money, the thing is why don't they just quit their studies? It shows something right? They are afraid the business may not work out and it may affect their studies, hence they are not really confident.<br><br>Surely mlm or belair is not the only way to make money right?</div>

As due to human are easily influenced by atmosphere, people, words etc..... mostly everything cos we've thought &amp; feelings. Sometime is good to sick to your own princpal. I do think education is quite important as we've gained more knowledges, not just because of using that paper to prove what. With these papers, people will kinda respect you &amp; know your educational level. Cos nowaday people kinda treat each other fairly regardless of the papers.<br><br>Do you know some of the graduate BA leaders said these papers are like toilet papers to them, of cos lah these papers definitely is worthless in MLM, but they still boasted they've alot of under grad/graduate in their group.
