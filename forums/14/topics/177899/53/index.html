              <p>Hi, everyone,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm new to this forum, was searching for 'Bel Air' in Googles and stumbled upon this forum yesterday. To think that this forum has been surviving for almost 2 years. This shows how many victims are still being victimised. This is truly a fantastic forum. How I wish there was such a site when I cut count 4 years 8 months ago!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was out of BA 2 years 10 mths ago due to the atrocious, practical, money-minded and cold-hearted Ms &amp; Ds! Of course, ain't wanna elaborate what they have done since the previous posts in this forum have said them all. The hurts and debts (I owe a total of 70k, due to interest, not because of 1 + 5 or 1 + 15, but not enough $$$ in during my stay there but alot of $$$ out) that each of us is facing is what I was facing and still am facing now, are beyond words.  I just wanna find out if any of u have any idea where the hideout of these people, so that I can avoid that place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My friend, who is still in AAA a.k.a Beacon, recently called me out of the blue in Jun 08 that Huang Dong came to Singapore and wanted to invite me to Kovan. Excuse: I am not obligated to join them. Instead, can get updates. Of course, I also find excuse to reject.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently, just 2 days ago, she called me again, out of the blue, to invite me this Sat. She said they have a promotion which will last this month. Of course, I find excuses to reject. BTW, I was also tired from work. Din't really listen to what she says.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first time she called me, she wanted to invite me to Kovan. Hence, I thought they had shifted to Kovan. Not sure about Tanjong Pagar site. Anybody has any idea where are their whereabouts? Kovan, AMK or Tanjong Pagar? I just don't wanna see them.</p>

              <p>Nabethex,</p>
              <p>I see U as most useless person ever. iam not surprize you are not broke dur to MLM<br>not failure to recruit victims into mlm.Thats why you are so angry with <br>PPl who alert victims from falling trap into scams</p>
              <p>If you continue to be native, then U be destined to be broke, not me,<br>or any others who are invunerable against scams such as MLM &amp; pyramid scheme.</p>
              <p>Do read carefully, I didn't mention any thing negative on other trades <br>other than MLM/pyramid scams.Let me tell U, Most ppl who take the courage to<br>leave MLM are far more successful than those who continue to dream in their<br>MLM "empire".</p>
              <p>I often encourage ppl quit MLM &amp; face reality, do decent jobs or venture own business.<br>Its up to ppl to decide.Only hardworks/efforts paysoff, not shortcuts like MLM! </p>

              <p>PPl like Nabethex are born losers, not facing reality in this world. He rather continue believe in hiding himself from reality by joining MLM.</p>
              <p>Me too agree that Nabethex is destined to be broke. I seen many successful ppl, none succeed thru MLM.</p>
              <p>Nabethex, I see you as most negative. Be MLM-negative is not negative minded, but a strength in which resist against MLM/Ponzi scheme.</p>
              <p>I see Falcon Killer as very positive, have courage to step out of MLM &amp; earn a decent living.</p>
              <p>Successful ppl are mostly entreprenuer who estabish their own company, not ppl who join MLM/ponzi schemes.</p>
              <p>I had seen friends joining MLM, 90% go broke, only 10% hardly make $$$. Achievement by MLM are mostly fake, owning cars( loan or borrowed), paycheck &amp; cheque( create by themselves). Most recent example is sunshine empire.  </p>
              <p>Nabethex, i know you try to prevent ppl from getting alert from being scam from ppl like you. You don have to use such dirty tactics by cursing ppl broke, so as victim will not be able to be rescue by scam alerters. Shame on you Nabethex.</p>
              <p>... ...Can ppl who use dirty tactics be trusted? </p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi
                                      Everyone, I am an ex FGN associate and I total hated how they run
                                      the business and ruin Bel'air. For me I am more fortunate as I only
                                      invested $1000+ to be a Franchisee because I have a smaller contact
                                      list and can't collect enough funds to accumulate $12K to be a
                                      count position. But I must say through out my 6 months in bel’air
                                      which is 2 years ago,</span> I’ve learned quite alot of things
                                      about life, positive mindset and attitude in that process. And this
                                      have helped me alot in my own I.T company. So for $1000 to learn
                                      the mindset and attitude and be able to apply it in future is money
                                      well spent.</p>
              <p>You see everyone, the problem lies in FGN and AAA. They
                                      don’t follow those groups in Bel’air or Avita whom sells products
                                      to consumers base on their needs but a greedy method of directly
                                      selling one whole lot of products to downlines. Now this is where
                                      the problems lies. In everything you do, there is no easy way out
                                      and sometimes smart ways can kill.</p>
              <p> As for product wise, they are good products and are
                                      tested and approved in many countries including Singapore. Their
                                      products have indeed save lives and helped many people including my
                                      grandmother. So if anyone have excessive stocks and wish to clear
                                      them cheaply, email me at <span><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:star.buyer@yahoo.com.sg">star.buyer@yahoo.com.sg</a> with your list of products
                                      and selling price.</span></p>
