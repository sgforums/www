            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Bro k2wanviet,<br><br>since u started this warning, u should be very well aware how they will take your questions isnt it?<br><br>i remembered asking my upline to read whats written by SavedSoul, he told me after that that such things are very common one.<br><br>In fact, all the leaders inside AAA will claim to others that the public will never understand what they are trying to do. And that they are doing a great deed for the sake of the ppl. They considered what they are doing are acts of saviour and they considered those who condemn them to be foolish. They will always claim time will explain what they have been doing are righteous.<br><br>For yr info, i doubt any would dare to answer your questions. Cause they will either think its a waste of time explaining to you or think that ur just being very negative. And to them, they consider such behaviour to be very hazardous to them trying to "help" ppl to succeed. Thats why u always see them telling their victims not to go around sharing until u "cut plate".<br><br>Y cannot say?<br>Because they claim u dont fully understand the business yet. And 80% of the ppl out there are all negative and will dissuade them from joining.<br>However, is that true?<br>NOPE!<br>They dont want ppl to share cos they are afraid those victims will know the negatives sides of them and start comparing. In such a case, they will have to waste more time persuading the victim.<br><br>If the system is so good, if everything is so perfect like they claimed, y cant everyone discussed it isnt it?<br><br>Then the best part is everytime when a victim goes around sharing with others, they will get very uptight then the upline n downline and the marquis will start to get together and think of what to say to the victim. They will usually try to find out what the victim shared, whom he shared with, and what are the comments thereafter. Then they will try to solve the problem, after which sometimes even warn the person not to go around sharing anymore!<br><br>So although u post some really intriguing questions to them, i really doubt any will dare to stand out to answer u. Even they really do, it must be one of those "textbook" answers again which they used over n over again but never get sick of it. Truthfully to say, after reading your questions, i also know if a Marquis was to answer u what he or she will write. As for Duke, they will claim they have no time to deal with peanuts like u... Cos if u can affect 10 ppl, 100 ppl, they still have the whole world of ppl to find their victims.<br><br>And i will tell u what they would be doing now...<br><br>If they know this forum is posting so much of their "news" here,<br>They would be busily telling all the downlines must not go to this website cos there are too many negative remarks which are hurting to AAA image. And this is done by ppl who have failed or dont understand this business because they want revenge! smart right?<br><br>Then they would be planning how excuses to give their "prospects" on explaining why this website is releasing so much news on them. Usually they would ask the victim,<br>"So, do u think internet can believe? or u believe what your eyes are seeing?"<br>"Those are written by ppl who fail to understand because they are standing outside the door, they have no 5 fig income in their pocket, but we have! So u believe us or them?"<br><br>Then, they will be collecting info on what is written here and think of counter measures. This will include plans n strategies to change their way of functioning so that they can wash away all links.<br><br>Interesting right? What do u think those dukes are discussing till late nights everyday? Thinking of how to help every downlines? lol... dun be naive man...<br><br>Today i will not disclose any info on them. but i have 2 pieces of very power information coming up.

Anyway, peanuts do not come cheap costing as much as 600K(You know what I mean) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I do not have a 5 figures to boast but at least I am making an honest living unlike the Dukes and Marquis who  have no sense of shame acting righteous and as saviors to those who join when in fact they are the most vicious.<br><br>AAA/Bel'Air understands a lot about human psychology and act on their weaknesses but I think they have failed to realise that humans are by nature inquisitive. The more they advise their downlines not to visit sgforums, curiously will bring more to this website to seek the truths. We have them to thank for that.<br><br>I said before AAA/Bel'Air plotted their own downfall by introducing "1+5" &amp; "1+15". Many have left and more will follow. It does not matter whether the truths can influence 10 or 100 people on their decisions to join.There is one victim less for anyone who chooses to believe us.<br><br>Hope more will come forward to share their horrid experience with AAA/Bel'Air.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's been quite a while since i last visited this forum. Thought I am done with this AAA thing but it still bugs me...<br><br>I'm glad to hear more people are coming out now to share their experience with AAA especially people like ForsakenBeing and Joachim_piper. I truly believe what they posted here 100% as it is exactly what I've been thru myself. And it really saddens me that AAA is still around and claiming new victims as if they are above the law.<br><br>I hope within these few weeks there will be action taken against AAA. But one person going about it is not enough. We need more people to take the stand, to voice out to the relevant authorities, furnish them with evidence of AAA's pyramid scheme to bring them down!<br><br>I don't care if the AAA Marquises and Dukes read this forum. They have nowhere to run when the law is after them. So many victims know their faces and their names and where they usually hang out. To the AAA "Leaders", you people just sit and wait, karma will get you soon...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course i will continue to talk on them!<br><br>They have too much things to talk about, being inside there for that long...<br>Really observed a lot of things..<br>So wont mind sharing more...<br><br>This is a very nasty example on how they carry out their so called "business".<br><br>Some time back when they started the conning system, there was this middle aged guy called Mr X. (no real name). He was convinced to join AAA after around 1 week of "exploring" this business. After he joined, initially he was being given a lot of "homework" to do. Being one with limited education, he find it very hard to learn what he suppose to learn but the upline marquis convinced him once again that he must "change", there it is neccessary for him to do all that.<br>Then When this Mr X. attended the 1st first meeting after meeting conducted for all the partners, he realises that something is very wrong. He pointed out that if this is an ethical business, we should be able to go face to face with prospects and talked to them.<br>However during that time, they didnt do such thing. What they did was to ask a Marquis to "accidentally" meet another downline with his prospect during lunch or dinner. From then on, the upline marquis will then "break ice" with the person before proceeding to talk about MLM! And as usual, everything is prearranged, the Marquis will have all the information needed to "cut in" to the prospects, in this case meaning using the victim's weakness or dreams to talk about AAA. Then invitation of the victim is being done on the spot.<br><br>Mr X. felt that doing such a thing is very wrong. However, the upline Marquis keep changing the topic and tell him it is necessary to do so in order to succeed. And having to believe that as initially stated, Mr X. decided to carry on.<br><br>But this is not the issue!<br>There comes a time whereby Mr X. really couldnt take it anymore because he finds it very hard for him to do such unethical acts. Thus he was thinking of backing out. But here comes the REAL problem, as Mr X didnt question much before he joined the group as he only took less than 1 week to make up his mind. The upline Marquis all pretend to keep quiet and didnt tell him that actually he can do a refund. Instead, they keep dragging him on. Mr X himself even ask the question whether he can Refund or transfer to another person his goods but the upline Marquis just keep quiet and didnt tell him the truth!<br><br>So after a few weeks, Mr X finally lose his patience and went to the stock centre himself to enquire and to his amazement there is a thing called REFUND!!!! Thats when Mr X really blow his top off and got real pissed off. To add to his misery, by right there should be a 90% refund, however when the stocks are being planned. He wasnt allowed to make any decisions in deciding what stocks he wanted. So in the end when he wanted to do a refund, he realises that after doing a refund, he could only get back around $4000.<br><br>Mr X. was very very pissed off when he knows this and he threatens to call the police or lawyer. But guess what the upline Marquis say? Everything is in black and white and we never lied to him before! So thats his problem..<br>Champion....<br><br>Maybe many of u may question the truth of this account and ask y i know so much!<br>Simple,<br>because i was the person's direct upline!<br><br>All the while when this account is going thru, i was stuck in the middle of two poles. i know what i m doing might be wrong. But on the other hand i was told by them to follow exactly what they ask me to do. To keep monitoring his situation, to keep encouraging him etc. I wasnt allow to tell the Mr X there is a thing called refund!<br><br>And u know the best part, when Mr X. refunded, they then come out and say is ok because this Mr X is not the kind of person they are looking for, and he wont succeed in this business anyway if he carried on!! And they would had ask him to refund anyway!!<br>Ironic???<br>If thats the case y make him joined so eagerly?<br>If thats de case y dont let him refund?!?!<br><br>And this Mr X is furthermore not a friend of mine, hes just a stranger out there that i knew on the road. Y i knew him? because we are being told by our upline marquis and dukes  that we have to keep going out there to make "new friends"!<br><br>Im real glad that he actually went to do the refund himself and further taught me a lesson!<br><br>So guys, still believe AAA is a happy family? Still believe AAA are doing things for your own sake? Think twice...<br><br>Im sure many knows about the "1-2-2" system. Please please please never believe it!<br>Because infact 1-2-2 system is just a smokescreen!!!<br><br>Let me further elaborate...<br><br>When the dukes talk to you about 1-2-2, they are just showing you a "fake" thing. After u joined, they will change the whole story around, saying that 1-2-2 is too slow!! So they will ask u to adopt a 2+3 system. Meaning u have to open 2 count outlets in the first mth and 3 in the 2nd. They will claimed that this is an even faster way for you to start challenging marquis, which rightfully will be the 3rd mth onwards and you will have an even bigger income. And as usual, they will claim a lot of ppl are using this system and are doing very well...<br><br>IF u decided to take up that...<br>Good luck to you...<br>Y?<br>Because there are too much loopholes in it...<br><br>Yes, there are some which are really able to open the outlets as required. However, this trick will hurt for those who cant do it. Every mth begin u will have to set ur target, by the end of the mth... if u cant achieve it... they will start to pressurrize u to buy up the count position yourself. They will tell u its for ur own good. So that u can challenge MArquis by the targeted date u stated. If not, they will use  the hard method by asking you why ur target cant be reached! and they will start saying maybe u are not really keen in this business, and if u say u are, they will ask u to believe them, then they will start using those emotional ways to convince u to take out the money and buy up the count positions yourself.<br><br>But look clearly, if u do so.. its similar of making u do a 1+5 but just in a slower mode. I was once almost being convinced in doing so, luckily i failed, if not i would be crying now... lol..<br><br>Furthermore, another thing to note is that all if not more than 95% of the marquis all buy up the counts themselves b4. Yes, u could take yr time and go find ur 5 counts. But u think the dukes are going to spend so much time on u? Most of the Marquis usually only have 3 or 4 some only 2 lines, and these ppl are usually being presurrized by the upline marquis to buy up the rest of the count positions in order to challenge for marquis faster. they will claim its for their own good. They will give a lot of fanciful examples and paint a perfect picture to ask u to take the money out to do so, just like what Savedsoul mentioned about his friend because asked to filled up the positions.<br><br>So frankly speaking this is never a $14000 business, u will always end up investing more and more. And u wont be lonely, because the partners u are going to bring in are all going to repeat this cycle. If not u gonna eat grass man. And if u dont, the dukes will kick u aside and say goodbye and goodluck to u. So either u r really that capable, if not good luck to u...<br><br>Lastly, dont by fooled by their income slips. Let me show u a very interesting fact on how they achieve a 5 fig income for new counts.<br><br>E.g.<br>If u open a count outlet, u will earn $3700.<br>If that mth u manage open 2 outlets, u will be earning $7400.<br>But after that,<br>the upline marquis will approach u and tell u many things. In the end, he will try to convince u to buy to buy up remaining 3 positions.<br>3 x $12000 = $36000<br><br>They will tell u things like, "ur earning $7400 but not very appealing. If u buy up the remaining 3 positions, there are many advantages."<br>1. u can challenge marquis already.<br>2. ur pay slip will reflect $13500 as your income. Imagine if u show the pay slip to others, who wont be convince this is a good business&gt;?<br>3. if u go loan $36000, then next mth u get back $13500, plus $2000 frnachise total $15500, u can return almost half of it already. Then in that mth u go open another 2 outlets, one $12000 each( cos u prepaid already) then u will had settled all debts.<br><br>SO if u are a bit greedy and go n loan the $36000, good luck!<br>And does that payslip really reflect wat u earn?<br>u think bout it...<br><br>Easy as that? isnt it? but is it really so? u go figure it out yourself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ForsakenBeing:</div><div class="quote_body">no problems pal..<br>In fact, i have nothing against the ppl inside this AAA group because some of them are really nice ppl... but too bad they are just being blinded either by the sweet words of their uplines or they are just too scared to question the system...... after paying up more than $15000, who else can u trust except for them to help u get back the money..<br>And since ever since i backed out, they are still giving me so much problems and even make so much false accusation behind my back.(i will touch on this later). I really can't take it anymore but list out all the things i wished others would know.<br>My upline even ask me to be responsible to my sidelines and their uplines.<br>I mean fine, i will be... but i must also be responsible to the public. So i will continue to list out all the things they are planning behind ppl's back<br><br>As for today,<br>This is mainly for ppl who have already joined Bel'air and still struggling in it.<br>Look and wake up..<br>Aren't the uplines always saying the same things over n over again to us?<br>They always claimed we cant do well because we have our own problems, and thus we are not ready to commit to this business. But look closely, how many ppl are putting in 200% effort but yet still earning nothing every month.<br><br>Whenever downlines are having problems, they will claim that this is because the downlines do not believe in them, the downlines are too bothered by personal problems. In worst cases which they cant think of any reasons, they claimed that the downlines have "blindspots" which they failed to see, and thats what affecting them.<br>IS that really true for everyone? wake up man, wake up!<br>In AAA, they will always claim that a person not doing well is that person's fault. Its never the upline, the Marquis, or even the Duke's fault. Look, Ever since they adopt the "zhao shi" system, everything we said and do are all fake. Nothing is real! Yes, we might be "grateful" to the person who brought us into this business, but to tell ur friends, relatives they are earning 5, 6 figs a month when they are earning less than a foreign construction worker is really a joke!<br>To the upline Marquis, Dukes, come on... Face yourself in the mirror and ask yourself... Have u really EVER done well? or u are just building your success based on other ppls' misery? Cut the acting and be yourself.. Those who are earning nothing stop telling others ur earning 5, 6 fig a mth. its really hopeless..<br>To the downlines who are struggling, stop bother to go think about how to spot your blindspot. cos u will never finish spotting them. If your upline dare to ask u, "are u REALLY ready for this business?" ASk them back the same question. Cos i can see so many cannot make it MArquis in there who are not ready at all and yet still think they are so clever and ready. In the end, they just destroy everybody's life and still have no sense of remorse over it..<br><br>The uplines always claim that the downlines have to change in order to succeed. Change here change there but still being scolded for not changing.<br>Some poor things even got reprimanded and asked to go back and think again whether they want to change or not. But the fact is, they had changed but where the problem really lie?!?!<br>Answer: the uplines themselves. Look, they always ask ppl to change. but have they themselves really changed? Look at the behind scenes of some well known marquis in AAA, behaving like kids, stubborn, not willing to listen to ppl etc. And they claimed they have changed?!?!?! sighs.....<br>Some classic questions the upline always like to ask their downlines:<br>1. Have u really decided what u want to achieve in your life?<br>U answer yes and tell them whatever u have thought of, they will claim its not concrete, not realistic, too vague, and ask u to go back and think again<br>2. If u have not been doing well, what makes u think that u will do better this time?<br>3. Are u REALLY ready for this great business?<br>4. Can u go back and think of all your problems and possible solutions?<br>5. Are u sure u have no more "blindspots"?<br>6. Do u think u can really do it this time?  If not, please go back and think whats stopping u from succeeding.<br>7. Do u think if u back out now, u can succeed outside?<br>8. If u dont change, u can never succeed one u know, can u please go back n think what areas u need to change?<br>9. Have u figured out why u still have no results in this business? no? please go back and think bout it.<br>Nowadays, they are also asking the downlines to keep reading the book, "Secrets of a millionaire mind" to look for their blind spot. I can still remember i have sidelines whom have read the whole book allmost 2,3 times but still asked by their upline to go back n read further till they find the answers? WHere de hell are the answers they should find?<br>WOrse still, i got another classic example,<br>a poor girl from the start of this yr. ask to think this and that... everytime when she got the answer, the stupid upline marquis ask her to think of new things, or work on the old answers. now almost 7 mths have gone she is still thinking. And the upline marquis still tell her have to believe, must trust that once she solve the so called problem then she will succeed in this business.<br><br>So the poor ger spent the first few months thinking while doing full time, den end up no savings, no money to have meals, have to go back to work, pay debts etc. And for all these months, she cant go around looking for new victims or approach anyone to talk about belair. Meaning she have no income at all all the while...<br>Poor thing she still believe what the freak does to her is for her own good and thus still trap in this vicious cycle.. Good luck to her really... hope she wake up really soon.<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">All mentioned tactics &amp; etc so... are been using over &amp; over again, (haiz, sian!) if u can't do well, your "monkeys" or uplines will ask u to soul-search yourself. The FAQ 1 to 9 are their powerful, old recycled repeated quests always bringing it out to quest u. And I think they even dun know what is your bilndspot? Even if you tell them firmly about what your answers are, they're not convinced, (dun know what the heck, they think it funny huh?? FU..., man!) even we digged out our souls or the bottom of our hearts to tell them our deepest ans, they claimed it not! (They thought themselves are GOD <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> DOG (reverse spelling) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> ) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> SOme "monkeys" even worship their "Ducks" like God, their idoi (should be idiot!) OMG! Just that they didn't put an altars with their "ducks" photos in their house to pray.<br><br>They asking you to be responsible cos they think it will be a problems &amp; troubles to them if you leaf, they've to hold a meeting to think what to explain or tell all your downlines and what image will they leave for themselves their leader is leaving, and later on they've to wipe out all the Shi_ things you've created for them, of cos that the MAIN Most important things they're concering about  themselves, if you dun have any downlines or active downlines, u think they will bother so much, they dun even give u a call if you didn't turm up for a week. (they will just let u fly your own kites!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  This is partly my encounter I been sick for a week so but had told my head "monkey" about it, my own upline, a "monkey" didn't bother to sms me to ask my whereabout and surprisingly, even my own group sidelines dun know what has happen to me, (thought my head "monkey" will tell some of them) call me up instead to ask what has happen to me? (haha, close sideline more concerning about u than your own upline, "monkey") They will surely claim cos recently they are too up tight so busy had forgotten about it, if I'm their prospect, think they even will bring me to clinic consultation or bring me congee to eat, LOL!!!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>If not only $12,000 you've had invested if even more than that more than the amount  of  1+5 cos member fee, courses/ senimars, transports fee (cab fare too), meals (cafe...) if you're full time more worst, think you've spent annually $30,000 or more $50,000 that  you can apply for a Credit Card!! And the times you spent! They claimed if you really devoted in his Biz, put aside your family 1st but dun mean you dun care about them just the time you spent with them will be lesser as when u back home, all your family members already sleeping, maybe only morning breakfast a few mins or so can see each other. When you success then you will have more times! (Bull shit!) If you've had success, halo what they mean by success is become "duck" even if you've become a "monkey" you still have not time with family, dun talk about  5 digits!<br><br>Some senior "monkeys" been there for couple of years, for God sake, they are NOT EVERY Months earning 5 digits, some even 1 year or so not earning or even worst their income lowest than low-income workers.<br><br>Last but not least, all Ex-Bel'Airans quoting over here what we claimed ARE 100% or even 1000% TRUE or TRUTH (touch wood, even if we die someday, we have our righteousness to face!!!) despite whether we sucess in this Devil Biz!! (We've our "Liang Xin"!)</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting thread and I spent almost the whole day reading the posts in this thread in office. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Personally, I was from AAA before in BA too and quitted last year after things took a change within the group. All along, my marquis group which was under AAA, we didn't really agree on the way they do things and prospecting. Most of us were professionals and decided to "break out" from AAA for sometime to build our own style about 2 years back. The new style worked and attracted a lot of people, even consumers. However AAA targetted us based on this and my marquis was "summoned" to a lot of meetings, saying we are part of AAA and shouldn't break out from the main group. Finally, last year, our group went back to join AAA and that's where all the nightmare and pressure started. Basically I was just a Baron and not doing very well in the biz. All I really wanted from it was more on the personal development side which I think I've gotten when we broke out from AAA for the year.<br><br>Much more expenses came along when I went back to AAA and I was earning less than 1.5k per month and still need to feed family and pay this and that, sure not enough. Even my F and B stock were paid by my upline and till todate, I'm still paying him bit by bit. Moreover, he has never been active in the biz. But as a group, we paid AAA all the "fees" needed and went to the courses and things like that. However, only a few from the group really benefited from it, esp the China ppl coz of the 1 + 5 thingy, which was out for most of us. 2 months down the road, our marquis declared that they are leaving the biz and AAA... And that's how our group got dispersed as most of us no longer had confidence in it anymore... It's so different from when I first joined... Sad seah...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by k2wanviet:</div><div class="quote_body"></div></blockquote>A year ago, I started a thread warning about Bel'Air promoting the "1+5" and "1+15" investment schemes and had a good engagement with a Bel'Air's Marquis. A few tried to put me down with their unconvincing and desperate attempts to defend Bel'Air.<br><br>Latest posts by joachim_peiper and Forsakenbeing have proven once again what I had written are all TRUTHS and no exaggeration on my part. I was hoping the Marquis and those who have defended would come out once again to give their side of the story. I doubt they would as they would just be embarassing themselves if they did.<br><br>Since you claim to be a one of leader of " the noisiest group/AAA ", forumers are waiting for you to tell more.<br><br>(a) Is it true that many are leaving AAA/ Bel'Air?What are the main reasons for leaving? No income, no longer trust their "Leaders" or they are convinced AAA/Bel'Air is running a disguised pyramid.<br><br>(b) Does the "Leaders" follow the postings here? Do they view the postings here as a threat to their existence.<br><br>(c) In your opinion, how effective are the postings here in dissuading people from joining AAA/Belair.<br><br>(d) Are the recruitment numbers in AAA/Bel'Air dwindling? Be'Airians like to boast they earn 5 figures income. Do you agree that the majority are in fact struggling.<br><br>(e) "1+5" or "1+15" investment schemes. How many actually manage to recoup their investments? Do you have an estimate figure in terms of percentage? I am of the opinion that most if not all will suffer a hugh loss.<br><br>Since you are a former leader, your revelations about the inside story of AAA/Bel'Air will carry a lot of weight. Just hope you continue to expose this unscrupulous company<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Many thanks to the support and encouragements of k2wanviet and the other users... ironically i used to "hate" people like you guys for flaming multi-level marketing, especially Bel'air. Guess the situation has changed... now that i had seen the light and realise those bastards for what they are...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I am quite busy nowadays... busy earning money (from HONEST work) to repay my debts...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>In my spare time I will be more then happy to reveal more info for the benefit of the forumers... anyway to answer your questions:<br><br>a) Yes the turnover rate for these people are quite high. How successful a person is in this "business" will determine how long he can last. For myself, I make back my initial 12k investment in less than 4 months, so I was pretty confident of the business model. Quite a logical thing, as when things are looking good, people usually don't ask any questions regarding the system.<br><br>There are many reasons for leaving, usually the realization that Bel'air is just another glorified pyramid scam. Most people left because they didn't make much money after spending a lot of time and effort in this "business".<br><br>b) Some of the leaders do read these posts, but most consider them "garbage". In reality they fear these forums, for they themselves know that its the truth. They educate their guys not to go to forums like this one, for fear that they realise the truth about the whole thing. Yeah. Sucks.<br><br>c) I feel that these forums are quite effective. This comes from personal experience, when the friends me and my guys are following up on (to join the biz) rejected us after reading the contents of these forums.<br><br>d) As I mention in point a), their numbers are pretty much constant, with old people leaving and new people joining. Face it guys, there will forever be people out there searching for easy ways to get rich.<br><br>Most people inside are not making money. Period.<br><br>e) From what i know, the 1+5 and 1+15 investments schemes are total economic disasters for the investors. Only people who benefit are the dukes, who make use of these methods as a short-cut produce huge quantities of sales coume, so that they can complete their dukeship challenge.<br><br>Suffice to say, if anybody is interested to join force to take legal actions against these bastards, count me in!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>thats all for now folks... feel free to post any queries or questions.. will answer them as best as i can.<br><br>Thanks guys.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>im sure after writing so much so the past few weeks, many of u now have a better picture on actually how AAA operates.<br><br>LEts face it..<br>many ppl might feel this could be written out of frustration on im trying to flame them...<br>like i say...<br>i have no qualms bouts Belair company.. though their products are steeply price, somehow i still feel that their products do have their own uniqueness and uses.<br><br>But my main concern is that look out for the damn group AAA...<br>unless you are prepared to bury your consicience with you forever, this group is really not a place for many ppl.<br>Because once ur in there, u will not be yourself again anymore for the rest of your time there..<br><br>U will be living in a world of setups and lies... and believing still u are being honest and responsible to yourself. But is that really a fact?<br><br>U decide for yourself...<br><br>For those who believe AAA can bring u success and u like to be that kind of person... go ahead and take it up... cos i believe u will definitely succeed there..<br><br>But wait, whats is your definition of success?<br>Think carefully and wisely...<br>Can AAA really give u your so called success??<br><br>Look...<br>even the paychecks are all set ups....<br>u still want to believe?<br>If you want to, theres nothing i can do...<br><br>If you believe the dukes and marquis there really can guide u to heaven, dont ask why when u end up in hell...<br>If you believe the dukes and marquis are forever there for you, dont ask why when they are not there anymore...<br>If you believe the dukes and marquis and follow whatever they tell u to do, dont ask y when u realise there is no turning back...<br>If you believe the dukes and marquis and set ur friends and relatives up, dont ask y when u realise u have no more friends around you...<br><br>End of the day...<br>its ur own choice that results in all these...<br>So good luck to those who still insist AAA is a place to be in!!!<br><br>After i left, i really feel life is so much meaningful now... at least i can talk to all my friends openly... at least i am doing something worthwhile doing everyday... rather than living the days to do only the things they ask u to do..<br><br>And u think they will forever be your buddies??<br>look at me, until now... my upline havent even contacted me once..<br>those so called buddies in AAA never one even sms me...<br>life's cruel...<br>they are more cruel...<br>and the reason y none contacted u?<br>because they feel ur longer on the same path as them...<br>they feel ur now having a poor people mindset..<br>they feel ur a very negative person now..<br>they feel they have no time for u...<br><br>is that really called buddies?!?!?!<br><br>Go ahead... try it and u will know the taste... and remember to enjoy it... cos u wont be able to try it better elsewhere compared to be in AAA...<br></div>

So what the leaders said: "We can refund you all back 90% within 90 days!" ARE ALL BULLSHIT!!!! And there will be service/adminis chrgs to u too for refunding leh! (conditions required which they never will tell you that, only when U wana quit &amp; refund then U realise on that day!) Alot of hidden requirements &amp; terms they won't tell!  </span></div>
