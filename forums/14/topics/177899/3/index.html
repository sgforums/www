If it is 90 days, there is nothing much you could do now. Just take it as a lesson and do not waste your time recruiting "Count" because the one you recruited will probably end up with unwanted stocks like you.You may recoup some of the investments doing active recruitment but it is outright despicable to put your friend, colleagues or relatives in a spot. If the date is not due yet, under sgforums home page , key "Twincat" or " I am a guest " in search box and you should be able to get answers on how to quit Bel'air.<br><br>For the benefits of those who are seeking the truths, share with us your experience in Bel'Air.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess what i got a copy of their sales material which they used to brainwash recruits. you know what it says??? <span style="color: red;">in the 4th year 1999, without further expansion, we created an annual sales volume of SGD254 million in singapore and malaysia.</span> i highly doubt their claim as 254 million over 15K probably the amt required to join as count then is 16,933 counts recruited in just one year 1999 alone. if Franchisor then 1,000K entry means 254,000 franchisors recruited in 1999 alone. What i it means that by now, if i take one stone and throw in orchard road surely have at least good chance of hitting bel air distributor. Someone should investigate on this claim by them.<br>Next they mentioned  in 2004 our regional CEO was invited to attend a prestigious gala dinner organised for ministers. she was pleasantly surprised to be recognized by Minister Yeo Cheow Tong as a representative from Bel Air. Our CEO was heartened to see our Brand Bel Air is finally gaining recognition in Singapore that even our minister recognizes or company.<br>-what crap is this, so what if minister recognises you just polite to say hi and use his name to advertise for company beside using NDP sponsor to buy legitimacy. Can i recommend that we prepare a petition for all those disgusted with Bel Air business practices and send it to MPs as well as the NDP commitee to stop them from accepting Bel Air as a sponsor.

Yea, let us know how it goes. We must really bring down these pyramid schemes of MLM, these giving the rare legit MLMs a really bad name.</div>

What do you guys think???? </div></blockquote>MLM was legalised in Singapore only in June 2000. If the statement is true, it means Bel'Air operates underground from Singapore prior June 2000. Bel'Air used to hype that they were aggressively expanding their presence in  the hugh China market when MLM was illegal and prohibited in China. It only shows they have no qualms breaking the laws when there are money to be made<br><br>Have anybody who have attended Bel'Air seminars before the NKF saga was unveiled seen something more bizarre:- Bel'Air showing picture of Mrs Goh who was then a patron of NKF in their presentation materials. It was a blatant and calculated attempt to lure unsuspecting audience to believe that they are a reputable company by associating themselves with NKF and NDP. Mr. Chiam sued when a company make use of his picture to promote its products and services. Are they waiting to be sued as well? In any case, I am sure the rich and famous would not want to be associated with MLMs. Guess who will be next when they become desperate?<br><br></div>
