Success should not be gauged by what we wear, what cars we drive or how much we earn. It's a personal satisfaction that comes not out from your greed or desire for material stuff, but in terms of improvements in characters and behaviours.<br><br>Like what I've mentioned before. At the end of time when it comes, we will not be judged by how branded your cars may be, how much $$$ richer, whether you've achieved Marquis or Duke status or whatevers. I believe we will be judged on how much good deeds we have contributed to mankind and not destroying innocent people and their future. Karma exists and it will comes and strike when you dont think it will <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Most importantly, we will not be able to bring along what we have when we die but instead, the deeds we have done in this lifetime. Burning paper cars, joss sticks will not help much, but cheating people off money and their beloved ones will ensure you a lifetime full of sufferings.<br><br>Cheers everyone. Pray that family and friends whom you've fallen out with will forgive you guys and together, reconcile and lead a better life than now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Success should not be gauged by what we wear, what cars we drive or how much we earn. It's a personal satisfaction that comes not out from your greed or desire for material stuff, but in terms of improvements in characters and behaviours.<br><br>Like what I've mentioned before. At the end of time when it comes, we will not be judged by how branded your cars may be, how much $$$ richer, whether you've achieved Marquis or Duke status or whatevers. I believe we will be judged on how much good deeds we have contributed to mankind and not destroying innocent people and their future. Karma exists and it will comes and strike when you dont think it will <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Most importantly, we will not be able to bring along what we have when we die but instead, the deeds we have done in this lifetime. Burning paper cars, joss sticks will not help much, but cheating people off money and their beloved ones will ensure you a lifetime full of sufferings.<br><br>Cheers everyone.
