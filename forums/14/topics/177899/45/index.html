            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all...<br><br>As we now know, Bel'air has relocated to the location at Tanjong Pagar, but it is just a temporary location, while the chairman look around for a new stockist.<br><br>From what i have heard, the chairman has assured everybody that all distributors would still be able to withdraw stocks (Bel'air products, of course, not skincare or TCM), from the temp location at Tanjong Pagar, and then from the new stockist when it is set up. I heard that Lao Huang claimed he has plenty of oil in stocks, so nobody has to fear.<br><br>Of course this assurance is as good as peanuts for most of us who has suffered, but i don't think he will makan all our stocks, as we all signed the distributor agreement with his company, Sathelyne International, and will technically be able to sue him if he does that. Unless he has no intention of operating his biz in Singapore again... then yeah its possible he runs away... tho personally i don't really give a damn about it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Yeah like wat bangkok boy said, we are all moving on... but sometimes it just disturbs me to know that there is still no justice served on the evil-doers from FGN who had screwed up so many lives. I used to be one of them too, but at least i am now paying (literally) for my sins... at least i hav been forgiven (more or less) by <span style="font-style: italic;">most</span> of my ex-downlines for dragging them into that aroma shithole...<br><br>It is now one year since I left FGN... i was a marquis, and was one of the last to have the courage to leave, to force myself to realise that what happened in there is just a web of lies and deceipt. To those who are still there, they have no more excuses... they are fully aware of what they are doing, and know that it is wrong. Yet they persist in continuing their evil activities... continue to live in their little world of lies, while the rest of the world moves on... Sometimes i really dunno to be angry with them, or to pity them...<br><br>So Dark the Con of Man!!<br><br></div>
