            <div class='col-md body'>angelhiew, from wad u have posted,  i can assume that you have been completely "brainwashed" by all those so-called "meetings-after meeting". Plz touch and own heart and ask yourself whether this business is wad they claim to be. Are you earning any income from this business? Do you tink u are realli doing a good deed for those you have recruited into tis business? Did your family members know u are doin this business? Are u willing to listen to others comments and not just deem opposing idealogy as "negative"?</div>

She just kept quiet and the next time I was in MAM (Meeting after Meeting/Seminar), I was directed to one of the Duds to be pyscho. Anyway, I found out abour the Refund policy and decided to go down to Commonwealth to do the refund process. Did not inform my friend as I did not want to be pyscho by many of the so-called business associates again. This was still within the period of 90 days. However, I was not allowed to refund. Remember the 1+5 deal? Apparently, my friend had sold 1 of her downlines to me so if i need a refund, must go through her instead. When I confronted her, she said the company has to process this as I am one of it's distributors, not hers. Major Taiji-ing! So I am now left in a lurch and we are not on talking terms anymore.

And your friend's had transfered 1 of her 1+5 Court to you, that time also need to go thru that Admin lady, too bad I've forgotten her name, maybe u can ask those "cashiers" about this "lady" but dun know they willing to let you know a not as nobody would like to has any customers refunding their things!

            <div class='col-md body'>Go to the headquarters at Commonwealth and do the refund paperwork first. Remember to bring your invoice and refunable stocks. It will only take one morning. They will call your upline Marquis about this as he/she needs to sign an acknowledgment document. Get a few non-BA friends and body guards, especially in the Accounting industry <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> , to go with you if possible. As carrying and moving the stocks are laborous and you REALLY want to resolve it asap.<br><br>Rest assured that you can do this (If it is still withnin the defined period). If there is any resistance, please go to CAD and CASE. Make a photocopy of all docments.<br><br>It is highly unlikely that you wll get 100% back of what you have invested.

Actually, there were more who had shared their horrid experiences about the sickening AAA/Bel'Air before this thread was opened. These skunks could not defend their shameful deeds and therefore chose to remain silent. Amazing, this thread has hit 20,000 views and still counting......<br>I am sure more victims will come out to condemn the infamous AAA/Bel'Air. Hope those who have been victimised will come out to expose AAA/Bel'Air scam.<br><br>If you have friends in NUS, NTU, SMU &amp; polytechnics, warn them against joining AAA/Bel'Air. If you blog, link this site. Ask your foreigner friends from Malaysia, Myammar, China, Vietnam, Philippines etc to beware of strangers who said they could help you to have a better life. Also, let as many people as possible know about Bel'Air's thread in sgforums. The forum has helped a lot of people make a wise decision or share the pains of the havoc AAA/Bel'Air has stirred.<br><br>So far, they are able to avoid prosecution and remain unscathed. Therefore, we are more determined to expose their misdeeds. The most effective way is to stop them from recruiting new Counts. When recruitment of Counts dwindle, it will hit them hard as there will be no commissions for them. The whole disguised pyramid will just collapse when the members no longer trust their "cult leaders". They could never sustain a prolong failure to recruit because revenues from repeat customers are very small.<br><br>AAA/Bel'Air............ Continue with your stage performances <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . Oh.... I forgot, it has now expanded to Orchid Country Club,Marina, Suntec and Orchard. Let see who your prospects choose to believe when they come to know about this thread in sgforums. Your underhand tactics will continue to be exposed............<br></div>

Anyway, I found out abour the Refund policy and decided to go down to Commonwealth to do the refund process. Did not inform my friend as I did not want to be pyscho by many of the so-called business associates again. This was still within the period of 90 days. However, I was not allowed to refund. Remember the 1+5 deal? Apparently, my friend had sold 1 of her downlines to me so if i need a refund, must go through her instead. When I confronted her, she said the company has to process this as I am one of it's distributors, not hers. Major Taiji-ing! So I am now left in a lurch and we are not on talking terms anymore. I am hoping that the veterans here who have been there long enough or are more experience can advise me what should I do next?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>I am sorry to hear your story... I don't know how to tell you this, but if you took over one of your friend's position, i am afraid you can't return the stocks, UNLESS you friend's 1+5 was done less than 6 months ago. This seems unlikely as the company did not allow you to refund. But no harm asking again.<br><br>My suggestion is to gather some of your friends (esp the tough looking ones), go down to the company together, and kick up a fuss. Don't make trouble, in case they call the police, but just ask your friends to go with you for support.<br><br>Thats right. Threaten to take the case up to CASE or the authorities, on the basis that you have been conned. I am not sure how effective this is going to be, but maybe they will try to make some compensation for you.<br><br>Do you know any ex-bel'air people from your network? It might be good to contact them. What you are going thru was what many of us went thru when we left. It was like waking up from a nightmare... many of us found comfort and support from those who had also woken up from it...today i still meet up with many ex-belair distributors for a simple cup of coffee, with no hidden agendas... These days we look out for each other now, because few understand what we went thru in Bel'air.<br><br>I would like to apologize on behalf of your uplines...and your old friend. I can understand what they were thinking when they asked you to join. Honestly many of them were decent people, I can assure you that they do have intentions to help you. Sadly, their good intentions have all been twisted by all the mindset brain-washing sessions they went thru... now they are only pawns to their uplines, who are the ones making all the money. These people are beyond redemption now...<br><br>Best thing to do now is to move on with life. Many of us took a long time to recover, and most of us are still heavily in debts... Thats life i guess... All the best to you.. if you need any help you can always approach us here.<br><br>BTW which AAA network are you from? The 4th flr or the 3rd flr one? Just like to know, in case i can help. You can send me a private message if you do not want to reveal your id.<br><br></div>
