If we buy 180000PV to get the count position, we have to give only 95% of the money as we bought the status of franchise before that.

The associates must pay the fees for the offices (235FEC for Summit Parkview hotel and 30000MMkyat for Shwe gone dine office ). Even though both offices are not availble now, nobody is saying responsible for that.<br>4.One of the products (named Sun Diffuser), price has been changed recently from PV 3100 to PV 5000 without any notice nor any written announcement.

Or esle the invoice will not be valid. Even after changing into voucher, these voucher are only valid for only 1 year. They even stamp "goods are non-returnable or exchangable" on the vouchers. After exchanging your invoice into voucher, all your records in Bel'air will be deleted. This is cheating!!!<br><br>The last time i when to Bel'air stockist in Tanjong Pagar, only saw a few dukes/c.dukes manning the stockist. They are Pamela, li hui, Veronica,Irene.<br>I don't see more that 10 associates there!Only a small store room containing Bel'air goods. They even kept used Bel'air plastic bags like garang guni. Choice of products are very limited. They still using their old chairs, tables &amp; other furniture which they previously use in Hiap Huat Hse. Even computer, they don't even have LCD monitor! Counter &amp; Cashier also got no standard, just a table &amp; chair like selling newspaper!<br></div>

I think its the bad publicity by bel'air and AAA that prompt the building to change its name to rid itself of poor luck and poor image. I think most of the tenants will agree! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I must say that the forumers had done well to keep the general public aware of what the huang and AAA had done. If we keep on pressing hard enough, i reckon that no matter where and what name they had changed to, we'll still continue to nail them down!<br><br>this forum will continue to expose what they had done  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>my friend had once told me, if avita (equally notorious) had the support of their CEO and took over the 1st and 2nd floor of haw par techno, what had this huang do to help his team? if he is talking about full support, then go and take over a bigger place lah! whats the use of telling people you are doing international biz but cooping up at a pigeon hole manned by a few old ladies? talk "c*ck sing song"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>for those who had the old invoice by shiang series, you can kiss all your promotional items goodbye. they're not going to issue you with any other items....talk about a biz with endless supply of stocks and stability? haha...greatest joke of the year!<br><br>i think AAA can't stay at Hiap Huat Hse not only that they give bad name to the building, but also AAA wants to hide themselves due to their name alredy rotten. Plus AAA &amp; FGN no longer able to afford rising rental of HHH but also too afraid ex-AAA &amp; ex-FGN spread negatives, "fu mian"or MLM awareness. We know AAA now at Tajong Pagar, but where is FGN? Even join Avita, they most likely have their own office outside Avita one mah. FGN still hiding? Even Saddam was found by US force in huge country of Iraq. Where can FGN hide themselves in a red dot in the world map?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Withdrawal does not include any FOC (no PV) stock you have not withdrawn. You might lose all these stocks. They said the final outcome will be announced in the later stage (slightly BS).<br>As for exchange, not all stocks are available for you to exchange, i.e. Pre-planning your exchange stock imposes Â¡Â°challengeÂ¡Â±. They only allow ONE exchange per invoice, after that this invoice will be void. Please note that the exchange code has been changed. It is different from the previous time (Siang Series)<br>b) Voucher exchange. They have a voucher exchange option. But they only have 2000PV voucher. You have to do your math again lor. Each voucher has ONE year validity based on the date you exchange it.<br>c) On the counter, 5% will be given instead of the 20% discount. The difference is you have to pay more on GST. (This was executed since Siang Series managing period)<br>d) All Beauty Lifestyle &amp; Zen Series will no longer be carried at the stock center except for remaining stock. (Based on my memory, I think they only left Whitener &amp; Exfoliator)<br>e) Vital meridian and Magnolia (30ml) no longer be available. A new version of Magnolia call Â¡Â°Golden MagnoliaÂ¡Â± has replaced the old one. Smell HorribleÂ¡Â­ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>f) For non-essential oil, they donÂ¡Â¯t have anymore 500ml. Only 1.5l oil and selective 5l oil are available.<br><br>Last but not least, as BelAir is transforming, you never know when they will change existing or add policies that are favored to them again. So I urged everyone try to settle with them as fast as possible if any.<br><br>Cheers!</span> </blockquote> </strong>[/b]</div>

If we buy stocks from Bel'air the cost is 1PV=49 kyat + 25% tax (which is nonsense).<br>2. If we buy 180000PV to get the count position, we have to give only 95% of the money as we bought the status of franchise before that. But in Sg bel'air return commission based on 100% of PV but in myanmar on 95% of the PV. (even though they are saying PV 1:1 in Bel'Air)<br>3. The associates must pay the fees for the offices (235FEC for Summit Parkview hotel and 30000MMkyat for Shwe gone dine office ). Even though both offices are not availble now, nobody is saying responsible for that.<br>4.One of the products (named Sun Diffuser), price has been changed recently from PV 3100 to PV 5000 without any notice nor any written announcement. (Do associates have to follow what their upline said without asking why?)<br>5. Even stock distribution, they are cheating in PV. Somebody joined the biz by buying 270000PV but when she got the stock it is only 225000PV.<br><br>Who can explain me about that?<br>Are all the dukes from Sg (D Christ, D Jean, D Ronald, D Don, D Wan Way) sitting in Sg caring nothing for Myanmar Associates?<br><br>Btw, I take my  name as the name of the one and only duke in Myanmar (Expecting foundation of the cheatings).<br><br>I totally agree with Winnie Win. Those dukes are blood suckers.<br>1) They ask associates to pay fees for the office in HHH even in singapore. When the associates quit, there is no refund of rental fees<br>2) When any associates want to return goods, the dukes try their best to prevent the return of goods. Now even change marketing plan to make sure goods can't be return.<br><br>Btw myanmar associates can look for the following government bodies in sg to logde compaint or sue them if possible:<br><br>1) Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE)www.case.org.sg<br>2) Commercial Affairs Department (CAD)www.cad.gov.sg<br>3)  Direct Sales Association of Singapore (DSAS)http://www.dsas.org.sg/<br><br>In Sg, invoice no longer valid if after sept 07 &amp; need to change into vouchers. I suggest don change your invoice first. Use it to sue the dukes before it's too late.<span style="color: indigo;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Am a new member here. Would like to ask for some help, hope you guys can give me advice. I'll read thru the entire thread after I posted, cos quite long, haha...<br><br>I just bought a second hand belair/lampe berger diffuser off Yahoo auctions, cos I need to get something really strong for my home. I was told that the diffuser by them is very strong, so it'll work for me.<br><br>I can buy the oil from ppl who are clearing stock, but no one carried the burner spare parts and funnel. If I buy from ppl clearing stock, I have to buy a new diffuser. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> In the first place, I really didn't know it's so hard to find the spare parts. I thought they would be sold in shops (my stupidity).<br><br>So my questions are:<br><br>1. Can anyone sell me the burner spare parts and funnel? I have 1 diffuser, don't want to buy another 1. (I bought it for $10. Think the person was desperate to get rid of it.)<br><br>2. Does the diffuser really work? Cos I read on one of the pages in this thread, that it stops working after a few times. That would be really depressing to me. But then, I really didn't know this is some fake scam or whatever. I was just looking for a strong aroma diffuser to use.<br><br>Some help would be appreciated. Thanks alot.</div>
