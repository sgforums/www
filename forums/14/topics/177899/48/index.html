            <div class='col-md body'>Belair, the people there will tell you to borrow money from whatever sources to buy up count positions. The way to earn money is to recruit people into your downline to buy count($12000++) positions so you can get an overrides of $3700++ per recruit.<br><br>They will tell you this is an international business. It is in a certain way but not for everyone. This is a money game for the rich. For the poor, it's a lose-lose situation.<br><br>Here's why:<br><br>I have a close friend of low-income family who is still paying off his debts after borrowing money($7000) from GE. He is still a student in NTU and of course he could not borrow from GE at that time about 2 years ago. Thus he had to enlist the help of his father to borrow under his father's name. And they are still paying off debts to that financial company which likes to pressure people to pay up the loans by threatening legal action or filing bankruptcy on their debtors when they do not pay up on time or in full amount every month. They never try to understand people's problems or try extending the grace period of the repayment. Im feeling sorry for my friend. His father is so damn pissed with the financial company, GE and of course, BELAIR.<br><br>To those who do not have the chips to play in this money game, you have been warned with the personal debts, not to mention straining of ties with your friends and relatives. Don't be greedy. Once you have paid for your count position, you have been trapped.<br><br>For when you are successful, your downlines will expect you to help them and this will be a neverending process. When you are not successful, which is the case for 80 % of the people, you have debts to deal with and other effects of this mmoney game.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, Pay it forward.. what is the group u join in AAA?  Since when u left? Heard Kenneth Huang supposed to come and rescue all, is the Tg.Pagar the so called rescue plan ? Avita will be the one from Xiang Jie...<br><br>I think it would be great for us to share our experience so others can be warned about...<br><br>... It is very interesting that they actually systematically develop a lot of strategy on their victim... even using many persons to try pursuade one poor victim and everyone has to cooperate in the so call ABC role..where C is customer and A is the Monkey or Ducks.. very senior person that so called has earn big bucks and B is your friend that introduce you to BA... this is the usually the technique and some time they also bring the lamp to the MRT or places with many people to attract attentions.. I wonder they still dare to do that in the public.... "A" will usually tell his/her story and usually B will pretend to unintentionally ask A what type of income and where did he get the fancy phone, watch etc ..anything that is of C interest but he cannot afford .. and A will reply without to obvoius and C will be lead to thinking that A is so great...Phyco starts... and C starts to trust A... this is the first step towards the trap ...  This technique were used by many MLM company to attract young leaves..<br><br>They exploit on the persons weakness such as wanted to get rich, wanted to have more money, not wanted to work any more.... also anything can be leverage on and used against C smoothly ... BEWARE when your friend start talking to you like that.....<br><br></div>

Beware this is a tactic to<br><br>1, Win your heard<br>2, Let you feel comfortable with the group<br><br>Why is because your introduce friend has already prepare your background investigation report.. so they know your weakness ..  much like SWOT analysis on you ...<br><br>They don't talk about $$$ first, rather they want to make sure you think the BA is the ONLY business.. the $$$ is the second part because you can rent..you can sell your car... etc because they convince you first.. you will then do it on your own accord... Also whether you think you don't have the right mindset, the attitude, the ability is not important but as long as you are determined enough ... they assured you with their education system that in no time you will be fit... of course.. when you finally get everything done... then on the process day.. there is an interview!  By this time... the Big Dukes are there to give assurance and probably they wil tell you the condition of success .. by this time.. you probably has dream abut the business everyday and nothing should stop you now after going all the troubles to get the $$$ to start... so for you "Peer presure " and your own feeling will push you to agree on the conditions that you must follow what they ask of you.. 100% follow..<br><br>Beware!<br><br></div>
