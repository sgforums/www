If we pass this message to 3 ppl and they pass it on, more ppl will be aware and more careful of this.<br><br>Especially since I heard from a friend that they are moving their operations to Orchard 'cos Pan-Pacific Hotel warned them alredi. I can't confirm this to be true or not so just beware and remember their names.<br><br>And finally I am not targeting Bel'Air specifically 'cos they only supply the product, and their distributor network AAA are running their own business which is separate from Bel'Air. This I have to make clear 'cos it is AAA that is running the pyramid scheme.<br><br>I have kept all the info, the audio recordings, the training materials on how to draw a network diagram, etc... The network diagram is how they calculate the amount of money they will get if they or their downlines cut in more Counts in that month. I am relieved I stopped at that and get out of there. I won't be able to sleep peacefully if I cheated other people's money.<br><br><strong>Apply what you had been taught in Bel'Air.Warn 5 people instead of 3.Follow the <span style="color: blue;">1-2-2</span> system that they worship. Just warn one of your friend this month, two next month and another two the following month. If everyone follows this system and it works, Bel'Air will be famous for its notoriety in no time.It's free and you need not fork out 12K, 72K or 200K for joining AAA/Bel'Air. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But the most effective way is to get them into newspaper headlines and TV. Let Bel'Air present their 1-2-2 system and "investment plans " for all to evaluate. We do not need  progress package anymore as all of us will be earning 5 figures income every month. Let's see how Bel'Air will defend their disguised pyramid scheme.<br><br>From seminar rooms to Orchid Country Club, now Marina Square, Suntec City and Pan Pacific hotel. Coming up is Orchard Road to target the youngsters or foreign tourists for "oversea expansion" ? What next ? Going to another planet to recruit Aliens to join them as their are no more Counts to be recruited because they have lost their credibility. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Desperadoes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> </strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sabelli:</div><div class="quote_body">I got a friend who asked me to listen to a seminar in commonwealth, from Bel' Air (some 'aroma-medicare') MLM company.<br><br>First thing I noticed on the ground floor are the products, looked like Lampe Berger (another MLM i think) stuff only fancier. (recognised it 'coz i got a friend pushing me to buy his products from LB, ended up totally ignoring him).<br><br>Then to the seminar. Got to write down your name, mobile number, on the list before you go in. The whole room smell of their product, some diffuser thingy (think Lampe Berger).<br><br>The MC was some Myanmar girl, who said how her family benefit from using the stuff, how she is now earning a 5-digit income after 1 year into the biz. Everytime the MC said something motivating, the 'associates' will clap, and they will play that stupid dragostea song. So much of psycho'ing IMO.<br><br>The main talker is some ex-insurance woman or something, and said how she quitted her job to do this Bel' Air, saying she's earning a 5 or 6 digit (yah, right) income now.<br><br>Thru-out the seminar, she flashed pics of sports cars, holiday locations, houses (with occasional applause from 'associates' + dragostea song). The emphasis on the products were a bare minimal, although she said that the products will sell due to increasing air pollution, that the smell can kill H5N1 virus, blah blah blah)<br><br>She ended the talk with numbers, stressing about starting at a count level(investing 14K!!!) and getting your commissions by finding future prospects to join. And to work your way up to Duke (Count -&gt; Marquis -&gt; Duke) and earning some global bonus using that position.<br><br>The whole thing smells so fishy to me. This seems to be more of a pyramid scheme, by encouraging active recruitment instead of product sales.<br><br>- If u are investing 14k, and earning (i think 3.7k) per recruitment, where does all the rest of the money go to??<br><br>- These people told me that family and friends will definitely object to me joining this biz, but that I must have self-belief in it. They told me to think of what the 14k can bring to me, to fulfill my dreams. All these sounds like brain-washing to me! They said they can help me to find the 14k, but I must be the one to take the first step. Said I am not going to be doing this alone, that they will help me as I go along.<br><br>- How can these people sleep at night? Asking their family and friends to invest so much, and may not be able to recover the investment?<br><br>- How long can this recruitment chain stretch?<br><br>- Bel' Air got some Gold Medal and sponsored NDP for some years, how did they do it?<br><br>When I asked my friend if he is really getting a 5-digit income in this, all he said was 'there is no point in me showing you my income statement, if you dun believe in this biz'. Up till now, he hasnt showed me his income yet.<br><br>Oh yea, I was introduced to two people that joined (around 2 years ago) and are now driving Alfa Romeo and RX-8 sports cars, and another duke (I think) getting an Integra (still in NUS). Are these really possible? I shiver thinking how many 'downlines' are under them now...<br><br>Athough I may sound biased to Bel' Air, I like to stress that I am not against or for this business. I think that there should be some awareness for people thinking of joining this company.<br><br>Maybe someone (working or used to work) in Bel' Air will like to share his/her opinion on it? </div></blockquote>i wonder why dragostea din tei is populur wif companies...thailand also like tis 2 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Most of the ducks they are still owe ppl a lot of money$$$$ &amp; force to buy luxury goods,cars (esp continental cars) to show off . Furthermore, they are greedy, don care whether big or small $$ also "Sha" or suck. There is why i always address them as "SUCKER" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>FYI, most of the ducks borrow $$$ to buy up to "duck" position &amp; tell ppl "see , within 3 months , i can become duck , so can U" this is one of the method to brainwash the associates believe this biz can do so that every asscociate will like them to invest more $$$ in to this biz &amp; they will earn the commission from there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Hmm... if want to take actions, very hard. i think Scorpio76 once contacted CAD, but nothing was done. The thing is, they got products to sell and it covers up what they are really selling i.e 'marketing plans'.<br><br>As long as what they do are within the contact that you sign, they are by all means considered legal. Thus the recruitment or 'pyramid' scheme still remains hidden.<br><br>Although their means of getting people into this biz and hiding facts and figures, telling lies and faking being rich is more than despicable, nothing can be done unless the authorities bother to go undercover and unveil how many of these people are now in debt, bankrupt, and how many have actually earned money. And the failure rate and sucess rate of this company.<br><br>I also hate this company, alot. Because it makes me sick. My 'friend' also makes me sick. People changed so much do to greed, this really taught me a lesson. Maybe this really expose me to the dangers of the working society, and that things are not as they seems.

All he gave me as an answer was that this business is do-able, if not why is it still around. As a friend, I think I have done alot to warn him about it. I told him about the lies they make, brainwashing that they do, and even asked him to look at this forum and particularly this thread. I personally hope that he is smart enough about this business, and even that he can tell my Bel' Air friend to come clean about it.<br><br>(Hey Aaron, if you are reading this, I hope you are thinking about what I am saying, this is not some taxi-drivers talking coffeeshop talk, this is real people sharing what they know and experienced in this MLM coy. I know by doing this, you know who I am, but I really dun fuking care. I also dun care about friendship anymore. Earning good friendships are hard, BUT bad friendships can be easily broken. As you can see, I am real pissed off about it. So just wake up your friend.)</strong></span><br><br>Scorpio76 has not replied for sometime... does anyone reading this know of something that the Bel' Air people and particularly the AAA group did that is really against the law?<br><br>Can 'front-end' loading promotions such as '1+2+2', '1+5', '1+15' be considered legal? Especially since this scheme is actually targeted at the younger 16-24 age group?<br><br>Think only when someone from Bel' Air commit suicide or if the media decides to investigate it like the NKF saga then can something really be done. Meanwhile the only thing that we can do is try our best to let people be aware of this company.<br><br>Or if someone by any chance wants to contact Susan Long about it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
