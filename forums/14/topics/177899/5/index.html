I suppose a majority of people, those that lost alot of money (this includes me), really lose the faith of getting into an MLM company if an opportunity ever presents itself again.<br><br>Like what you have mentioned, people that fail in anything, should not really shoot down the whole system they were in, be it an MLM company or a normal business. They should know that they themselves are accountable for their own actions.<br><br>Everyone should have the rights to express their own views. In this case, there are some that are neutral about MLM and their business opportunities, but really like I said, from my perspective of things, legit MLMs are far and few between... they are really just so few.<br><br>Maybe in the future, the illegal or bother-line ones are investigated and removed, and perhaps only then will people change their views about it.</div>

If you are unfortunate to have been duped by fake companies, it is unfortunate.<br><br>As I have stated in previous posts, all too often it is because of greed that people are blinded by the tell-tale signs around them.

It just presents a Â‘good and badÂ’ viewpoint analysis.<br><br>There are many people out there who have a bad impression of MLM. Perhaps they have had bad experiences or known someone who did not succeed. However, there are always at least two sides to a story. That viewpoint is just the negative viewpoint. It is also true that there are people who have made money and become successful through MLM.<br><br>If MLM was as bad as some people put it, why was it legalized? That is a thinking point. If it was just get-rich-quick scams, it would never have been legalized. (Network Marketing was legalized in 2000 after years of being banned. Pyramid-Selling- a type of scam- however, is banned.)<br><br>Network marketing is being taught in universities across America. If network marketing was just a scam, why would universities have such a course?<br><br>Another interesting thing that I have come across is hear people blatantly say that the structure of MLM is a terrible scam contraption. If those people would just open their eyes, they would realise the biggest Â‘scamÂ’ in the world, would then be all around them- left, right and center. After all, a corporation is in a pyramid shape. In a corporation, the structure is of a pyramid, with the employees below and the CEO sitting right at the top. So then, what exactly is wrong with a pyramid? (By the way, the pyramid is also known to be the most stable structure in the world.)<br><br>In all industries, there are Â‘goodÂ’ companies, and Â‘badÂ’ companies. For example, if you bought a defective bag, would it mean that you would never buy a bag ever again? It is nonsensical to even think of. This is what is happening now. People are getting cheated by scam companies, and some of them have even started to be anti-MLM advocates.<br><br>The natural human instinct is to keep away from things that we donÂ’t know without actually understanding what it is. Instead of putting down an entire industry, perhaps effort should be made to find out if we were erroneous in our thinking. Remember, in some parts of the world, the tomato was originally perceived to be poisonous. This is just another case of perceived poison. It is unfortunate that the MLM industry has had its reputation tarnished, and that an entire industry is black-listed just because of a few rotten apples.<br><br>It is true that there are scam companies and evil people who want to make a quick buck out of those who have no idea what MLM is all about. These scams which disgrace the industry should instead serve as a warning to us to be more wary, and not to get cheated so easily. After all, it takes two hands to clap and; no one can make us do anything we do not want to. People, who got cheated, made the decision to get cheated. Obviously I expect backlash for the previous sentence, but I know that it is the wise few who see the meaning in it that will stand to benefit.<br><br>An important point to note that if you were to go into any type of business, not just MLM, the company you go into should:<br>Â• Have a good track record<br>Â• Is reputable<br>Â• Should have been around for at least some time<br>Â• And most importantly, you should FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMPANY<br><br>For MLM, you should also realise that is NEITHER quick NOR easy money. It might help you to earn more quickly or more easily, but it cannot be confused with quick and easy money. In every endeavour we set out to accomplish, we need effort, perseverance, and other qualities- This applies to MLM too. Many people join and expect instant results, and when they donÂ’t get that, they quit and brand it as a scam straightaway. This is extremely unfair and flawed thinking on their part.<br><br>If you were to come across any company saying that it is a quick and easy way to make money, I would indeed be very suspicious. Also, ask many questions, but ask the right people. After all, you donÂ’t ask a flight stewardess how to fly an airplane right?<br><br>Have you ever asked someone for their opinion on MLM, and they went, Â“Oh donÂ’t go into that! My auntie/uncle/auntieÂ’s uncle/ uncleÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s uncle/friendÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s friend/ friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friend/ etc got cheated!Â”<br><br>Did you ask that person what actually happened to his or her auntie/uncle/auntieÂ’s uncle/ uncleÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s uncle/friendÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s friend/ friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friend/ etc?<br><br>More often then not the answer would be, Â“Oh, come to think of it, I donÂ’t know. I only know they got cheated.Â” If I may say this, everyoneÂ’s definition of a certain something might be different. Two chicken wings might be a lot of food to me, but it might be just an appetizer to someone else. My point here is: what is the definition of Â‘cheatedÂ’?<br><br>Did that person try his hand at MLM, but failed, or did he get cheated by scam companies? To those who have been conned, perhaps you would feel strongly against the idea from earlier that Â‘you made the decision to get cheated.Â’<br><br>I would like you to know that I strongly sympathize with you and your situation. Even so, I urge you to look at what has happened from a neutral perspective, and to treat it as a learning experience. After all, you learnt to ride a bike by falling down; not just by doing everything right the first time.<br><br>"Money can always be earned again; but life is so much more than that."<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: brown;"><br>R ur family rich?
