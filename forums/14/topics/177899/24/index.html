            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I have my fair share of MLM a.k.a Pyramid System. I take you all back to 1995-1997 remember No.1 Products. I was quite young at that time and worked part time at a supermarket store earning a few hundred per week.<br><br>One of my idiot friend got me into listern to No.1 product and say about their magnatic bed have improve health functinos and stuff and count myself lucky I bought one thinking it would be good for my mom for health reason. Lucky that was during CNY and they had a rebate lucky draw and I got the $1888 draw and the bed cost was $1280 so lucky me got a bed and $600. (Suckers lost a bed and $600 to me).Being inmuture and easily psychoed I thought I got a good deal. They even gave me a cheapo members card.<br><br>Soon after I got called up for NS and stuff. 2 years down the road when I ORD my officer called me up trying to sell me another bed another company this time round I've got my experience with me and being firm in my decision. No mean No and more over I've one bed already why would I need to buy another one.<br><br>A few months ago I too had another friend that joined BEL AIR and made it... He asked me and brought me to the commonwealth place to listern I find it a baloni and BS. The speaker was a ex-DJ. No doubt his presentation was great but once bitten twice shy. So out of friendship and goodwill i got the cheapest lamp and a liquid... its still full and the lamp is unused.<br><br>Now my brother-in-law is sucked into NTI. Selling women's undergarment (Lu Mi Mi ) which by the way was sold by No.1 Products about a decade ago and where is No.1 product? Gone!!! can't be found anywhere. All these young people have no idea what business is about. Have not even step into working live and want to teach people twice their age about business. My dear brother-in-law... wake up and smell the coffee... have soemone to pay for your university fees go and study and get a good honors grade  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> don't waste your time at NTI playing know it all and selling undergarment to old women and neglecting your studies. I have to work and pay for my own university studies and study part time so difficult and tired.<br><br>Sorry that was personal... Anyway don't admire the people having office there they are at the top of the food chain. You are at the bottom and always will be. You are working so hard so that these people can fuel their car they drive... sleep on the bed and house they buy.<br><br>Based on their model you need to have at least 20 to 30 generations of downlinks and them to have thier own to be able to have an office there and make those flowery speeches. Think how many people you need to lure into the same boat you sit in and you might not know when the boat may sink<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MLM or Pyramid System companies will always be around. These companies work only on one expect of human nature "GREED" as Money is the root of all evil.</strong></span><br><br>Think about it, all of these MLM companies be it NTI, No.1 Products, BEL AIR, Amway, always promise a high pay without working just recruit peoplr will do. Nice car. Nice house. Frequent Holidays to the listerners. How many of the people asking you to join have them? Why are they always so eager to "help" you succeed? Cause if you don't join they can't afford their Car...House...Holiday...or their monthly expenses.<br><br>I work in a 8am to 530pm job earning about $3500... I own a car... have platinum cards offer to me by banks but I rejected I only need one for emergencys.<br><br>When I sit down to these people at these talks and psycho session I ask them a few questions<br>1. How long have you been doing this? (some say: 1 year or so)<br>2. Have you achieve a car yet? (Some reply: not yet but I'm getting there)<br>3. I own a car does it mean i'm more successful than you? (Common Replies: Blank Blank try to talk about something else).<br>4. Is your earnings taxable? (Common replies : Blank again)<br>5. If not taxable then in future how I apply for Credit Card? (Replies: Blank Blank again)<br><br>You people that are in MLM Companies and thinking of joining. Listen up: The only way to success is by hard work and a bit of luck. By asking people to invest 14k or 10k or what ever amount pls don't make real investers laugh...<br><br>If you really want to succeed<br>1. Saving 1/10 of your every monthly pay for a year or two.<br>2. Ask people that really succeed to help you invest. ( This is the difficult part so luck play a part to know such people and by saying that I don't mean Jackie "NTI boss" or other MLM boss. I mean those SME bosses you should look at them)<br>3. If not put your savings in bank that money goes in easily and take out very hard.<br>4. Don't be hasty in investing ask for 2nd or 3rd or 4th opinion as many as pos from people in the industry you intend to invest. (E.G. you are not going to as a pork seller if today's fish are fresh and nice right)<br>5. Don't regret if you invest wrongly but you must remember your mistake and learn from it and don't repeat it again.<br>6. But in any case if your investment does come out right make your investment's children(returns) make more childrens and make all these children create more children and make all your children(returns) work for you and in time to come 4-5yrs you will made it.<br><br>Be smart, stay cool you all .<br><br>Cheers<br>IronBandit<br><br></div>

I think CASE will not handle such complaints as they are set up to protect consumers and not businesses.

It is up to MTI to refer the case to CAD to investigate if there are any criminal offences committed.<br><br>Many of us here are convinced that AAA/Bel'Air are running a disguised pyramid scam. I  am perplexed why an investigation was never carried out despite the many complaints against them. They are destroying the lives of many and hope an investigation will be carried out before any tradegy happens.<br><br>AAA/Bel'Air have to go as they have no place in our society. The leaders must be prosecuted in court if any wrongdoings unveiled.

Another fren who is an accountant and doing her business part-time.<br><br>Before we manifest the negativity of MLM, we need to also seek out those who are successful. I was never involved in one and had the negative thoughts most of you had shared here.<br><br>I understand from her that you need to see a few points before you join any MLM. There are black sheeps in any industries, so you have to do some homework too. There is no such thing as instant money. Afterall, my friend who is a "diamond" director now, worked hard the first two years.<br><br>I believe that if you are going into a mind-set of helping friends to obtain financial freedom, the sincerity will show. Becos in any good MLM, you have to help your downlines to be successful first, before you become successful.<br><br>Thus, you give first and by giving, the rewards will come abundantly. However, there must be sincerity in hoping your frens to be successful.<br><br>MLM focuses on leverages. In our parents times, most people had 1 source of income. Most of the time the father is the sole breadwinner. But not anymore in these modern times.<br><br>MLM helps to increase income with less effort (as time goes by). But you still need to work hard at it.<br><br>Just sharing my tots...<br><br></div></blockquote>It good that some one in MLM is saiding MLM is good..<br>but pls dun start a account just to come in to talk about MLM k..<br>and pls related ur personal experience..<br>not because ur friends success then u said is good...<br><br>i can also said one of my friend in usa.. a drug pusher...<br>she also making lot of  money.<br>and she is happy about it..<br>as she can take drug..<br>and at the same time earn lot of money..<br>so u want to join??<br>low capital...<br>less effort also. (as time goes by)<br>just need to lowly extablish ur network..<br>start by giving first..<br>provide free drug to ppl.. let them hook on it..<br>then u take money from them..<br>drain them..<br>then u ask them to intro drug to their friends...<br>giving them commissions of every tranactions they done..<br>not bad isn' it ??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah...which is why i am asking people who are in MLM who are successful to share their experience.<br><br>There is no sense in badgering MLM if we ourselves only experience the negative side of MLM.<br><br>I am not in MLM so I am not able to share.<br><br>And for the question, why do you pray and not strike 4d and toto.. did you sincerely pray and focus on getting wealth? There must clarity in obtaining something you want. strike 4d then? what comes next? does it bring greatness in you.<br><br>If you help yourself to pay your own bills...that's good..but if you help others in someway or other....that's greatness....<br><br>In order to receive..you need to give first..... Ask and you will receive.<br><br>And saying that I am brainwashed isn't exactly correct. I am not for all MLMs as there are differences in MLMs. Like cars...you have diff types of cars with petrol consumption, sizes and power....it just depends on which suits you better...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo angel_lee789,<br><br>its good for u to bring up some points..<br><br>to certain extent, i do agree MLM as a business model is not a bad idea after all..<br><br>If not, companies like coka cola etc wont be adopting this structure...<br><br>but before we carry on discussing on, i would just simply put it this way:<br>i.e. this is just like discussing whether we have egg first or chicken first.<br><br>In every industry, there are good and bads...<br>im sure those that joined MLM companies before are all either out of greed or some is really believe that this is a genuine business.<br><br>Like Bel'air for example,<br>i do agree the product have its own uniqueness and market.<br>But however such qualities can vanquished in the market overnight..<br>So thou' i still agree Bel'air products is good, i do have doubts how long it can remain competitive in the market.<br><br>That brings me to the most important point. I.E PEOPLE.<br>Ever wonder Y MLM are always so badly reputated?<br>AAA is a superb classic example.<br>Man just cant resist the temptation of riches..<br>No matter how much AAA wanted to help others to improve their lives in the past, the leaders are now all blinded by greed, and thus start doing all the wrong things.<br>And when they start going on the wrong end, no matter how well they are doing, ppl will make sure they fall, and that includes me.<br>Worse still, ppl dont understand what is right and wrong when they all fall into this endless pit.<br>They will all just do as told.<br>thus,<br>Relationships start to be broken.<br>Friendships start to be betrayed.<br>Kinship start to erode.<br><br>U can argue this company is good, that company is good.<br>And this person is doing fine, that person is doing fine.<br>but problem is, u didnt know whats going on behind the scenes.<br>If they are adopting honest measures, then fine.<br>But problem is, Man always like to go short cut.<br>Therefore,<br>Every company can be ethical from the beginning, but i would say this wont last forever.<br><br>u can agrue all u want that whoever is doing well in this industry means that this industry is good.<br>But look all around u,<br>there are many top earners in insurance but is insurance that easy to do right now?<br>there are so many top earners in property but is property that easy to do right now?<br><br>it all comes down to u in the end, whether which environment will give u the right chances to succeed.<br>So remember, u can see 1 million doing so well in MLM industry, but u might just be 1 of the 1 billion who failed in MLM.<br><br>And personal point of view,<br>Dont waste your time in this industry.<br>No matter how good it is, end of the day, u will be back to square one.<br>Ur friend can be doing so fine now...<br>But just keep observing..<br>and u will know the truth..<br><br>P.S: before i joined AAA, i was convinced the same way u do. After seeing so many ppl doing so well in AAA, i thought thru hard work i can be like them.<br>Never to realise they are in more debt than earning more income. So SEE clearly for yourself.<br><br></div>
