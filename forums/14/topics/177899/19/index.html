            <div class='col-md body'>Below is AAA/Bel'Air's "marketing plan". I'd call it pyramid scheme. They pass out CDs with these stuffs after we buy up the Count position with $12K. So I share it here for everyone to scrutinise. Too bad can't paste the diagrams here, easier to understand. Abit long, read it if you are interested.<br><br>I got back my refund and I'm grateful I don't lose any more money than I have to. Also learnt some lesson in life from all this; Never give in to peer pressure especially in a group of strangers AND "ALWAYS" ask questions; if they tell u not to or forbid you then the more reason to dig further to get the information you want. But then, when you are brainwashed by these "people" it's hard to differentiate wat's right and wat's not. Kinda like a cult like one of my fren said when I told her about all this.<br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BelÂ’AirÂ’s Marketing Plan 1-2-2 Model</span></strong><br><br>The way the marketing plan is designed will determine how much you can make and how fast you can achieve it!<br>BelÂ’AirÂ’s marketing plan is designed for you to run it as a business, not for you to make part-time pocket money.<br>Allow me to share with you our BelÂ’AirÂ’s wonderful marketing plan.<br><br>BelÂ’Air has 7 levels of ranking: Grand Duke, Arch Duke, Duke, Marquis, Count, Baron and Franchisee. Grand Duke is BelÂ’AirÂ’s highest rank, it enjoys a total payout of 70%, followed by Arch duke 69%, Duke 68%, Marquis 64%, Count 51.5%, Baron 29% and Franchisee 20%.<br><br>Above this line, from Marquis to Grand Duke, are our companiesÂ’ unregistered Global Shareholder positions.<br><br>What I would want to bring to your attention is the position of Duke. Reason being if you chose to join BelÂ’Air business, your short term goal is definitely to become a Duke! If you think otherwise, then frankly speaking, letÂ’s just remain as friends, you need not join BelÂ’Air business. This is because Duke is our short term goal as it enjoys an average monthly income of S$30-200K, and it is currently the highest position attained by our distributors worldwide.<br><br>We all know that BelÂ’Air is an International Business, so we evaluate it from a business perspective. That is why we should start the business from the Count position. Count is our best starting position. What about Baron? Baron is actually for us to do retailing; we can sell to our franchisee network, making a 9% over-riding commission. What about franchisee? They are our consumers, and by accumulating their PV points without any time limit, they can enjoy up to 38% discount. That is why we evaluate BelÂ’Air from a business perspective, and Count is definitely the best starting position.<br><br>So how do we become a Count? Simple, we only need to get S$15,000 worth of products, but the rolling fund is a mere S$12,000. Why do we call it rolling fund? Simply because this is just a small amount and in a short period of time, you are able to break even using BelÂ’AirÂ’s marketing plan. Furthermore, by simply positioning as Count, you will be able to enjoy S$3,000 worth of free-of-charge products without even doing anything. Thus, you need not worry about the price of a tub of essential oil and how much it cost to light the diffuser for an hour as you have so much free products.<br><br>How do we operate the business after positioning as Count? Our AAA team has an excellent 1-2-2 model to operate the business. After you position yourself as a Count this month, you only need to complete 1 task in the first month, which is to follow our system and let your uplines assist you in opening your first Count outlet using the name-listing, warm-up and invitation techniques. So this is our Â‘1Â’:<br><br>In this case, you will receive S$1,000 franchise fees and an over-riding bonus of S$2,700, a total of S$3,700. Think about it, can a fresh graduate receive a starting salary of S$3,700 in his first job? Very rare! But in BelÂ’Air, it is already achievable in the first month. Next, let us look at the second month. We will be completing our Â‘2Â’. Likewise, we follow the system to complete our second and third count outlet with the help of our uplines. Of course, your first count outlet will duplicate your action last month to complete his first count outlet:<br><br>In this case, let us look at how much is our second monthÂ’s bonus. 2 Count outlets, S$3,700 * 2 = S$7,400. Count Generation Bonus for 1st level base on our marketing plan is S$750. So our total bonus for the 2nd month is S$8,150. In todayÂ’s economy, is it possible for a graduate to work extremely hard for the 1st month and get a pay raise of more than double, from S$3,700 to S$8,150? Unlikely! It is only in BelÂ’Air that you are able to double your income after just one month.<br><br>In the third month, when the entire network duplicate 1-2-2 model together, whtat will be the outcome?<br><br>2 Count outlets: S$3,700 * 2 = S$7,400. 1st level Count Generation Bonus: S$750 * 4 = S$3,000. 2nd level Count Generation Bonus: S$450 * 1= S$450. So the total bonus for the 3rd month is S$10,850.<br><br>In a short 3 months time, you are able to receive the 1st 5 figure paycheck of your life. A lot of traditional business owners are not able to make a 5 figure income within 3 months of their business, let alone salary earners. But in BelÂ’Air, just within a short span of 3 months, you are able to receive your 5 figure paycheck.<br><br>LetÂ’s take a look, for the past 3 months, we have made S$3,700 + S$8,150 + S$10,850 = S$22,700. Remember? Our Count rolling fund is a mere S$12,000. That is to say, not only did we break even within 3 months time, we actually made a profit of S$10,700.<br><br>Lastly, allow me to do a conclusion. What are our benefits after 3 months if we follow our AAA TeamÂ’s 1-2-2 model:<br><br>1. we have break even our S$12,000 rolling fund<br>2. we actually made a S$10,700 profit margin<br>3. we have opened 5 Count outlets, and each outlet have to purchase their Franchise 	    rights from us. Each Franchise rights is worth S$1,000, which also means that 	    we would have distributed S$5,000 worth of products. We started with 	  	    S$15,000 worth of products, in other words, we still have S$10,000 worth of 	    absolutely free-of-charge products. Thus, we can use the product extensively 	  	    without any worry, and also let our family members use for free. Of course, we can 	    continue to distribute Franchise rights.<br>4. Because we have completed our 5 Count outlets in 3 months time, we can start to	    challenge for BelÂ’AirÂ’s Global Shareholder position, Marquis, enjoying a payout 	    of 64%.<br><br>This is our BelÂ’AirÂ’s marketing plan. It is simple, easily duplicable, and low risk because we are able to break even in 3 months time. That is why Count is definitely the best starting position so that we can attain the Marquis position within the shortest possible amount of time and head towards our short term goal, Duke position.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(a) Products worth $15K??? Maximum payout is 70% which is distributed among the different levels in the disguised pyramid. It's is an exaggeration to say it's worth even 4.5K. A simple test is to ask yourself would you pay $15K for the products if they are available in the retail outlets? It's would be better for Bel'Air to claim that the products are worth $50K and now offering at a discount of $12K if you sign up as a Count <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>(b) It is obvious Bel'Air is running a disguise pyramid. The "Marketing Plan" main focus is on recruiting Counts to part with their $12K and not promoting the products to the consumers at large. The products are only a smokescreen to justify running a disguised pyramid without contravening the MLM's laws.<br><br>(c) The marketing plan is based on the assumption that all Counts will duplicate the 1-2-2 system by recruiting more Counts. In reality, is it that simple? Bel'Air is now notorious for its dirty tricks,misrepresentations and brainwashing sessions as more people come out to expose their misdeeds. Many recruits will not be leaving if the potential 5 figures income is real. I am not saying it is impossible to attain the first 5 figures income but I seriously doubt it could be repeated every month. It's simple Maths:- if the downlines stop recruiting, you are doomed with no income. I would be convinced if Bel'Air dare to provide the statistics here or to those attending their seminars:- how many counts were recruited in a year and the percentage of those who recruited 5 Counts in a 3 months period. I am sure they will be too embarassed to reveal the success rate. Bel'Air,take the challenge and publish it since it is simple, easily duplicable, and low risk.<br><br>SavedSoul, nice to hear that you have your refunds but I am sure you have lost several thousands dollars even though you quitted early as many items such as cosmetics and "promotional items" are non-refundable. However, it's never too early to leave Bel'Air as you will lost your dignity, reputation and trust of friends, colleagues or relatives if you continue with them.<br><br>Shame on those Bel'Airians who feel that they are the saviours of those who joined them.

As a human, i am a bit tempted, i was pursuaded by her into attending tis workshop abt cashflow which cost a bt 5bucks. After attendin the so called"meetin after meetin" thing, i am still at loss of wad these guys were doin for thier "biz". Curiousity and greed leads mi to attend a couple more of thier lectures and "meetin after meetin".I am still at a loss but tis friend of mine says i still need to attend a couple of their talks and they are choosing the right ppl for thier job, so i must show my sincerity by attendin em.<br><br>Since my friend kept deflectin abt the qns i ask her abt how to do the biz, i decided to do some research on the company and abt how mlm works. Most of the webs i came across, were all teachin abt motivatin others(juz like how the lectures were taught).

The thing is, they got products to sell and it covers up what they are really selling i.e 'marketing plans'.<br><br>As long as what they do are within the contact that you sign, they are by all means considered legal. Thus the recruitment or 'pyramid' scheme still remains hidden.<br><br>Although their means of getting people into this biz and hiding facts and figures, telling lies and faking being rich is more than despicable, nothing can be done unless the authorities bother to go undercover and unveil how many of these people are now in debt, bankrupt, and how many have actually earned money. And the failure rate and sucess rate of this company.<br><br>I also hate this company, alot. Because it makes me sick. My 'friend' also makes me sick. People changed so much do to greed, this really taught me a lesson. Maybe this really expose me to the dangers of the working society, and that things are not as they seems. (I am still young, 24 this year  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>I dunno what you guys think, but I once cautioned another friend about this company (cos my friend knows him as well). All he gave me as an answer was that this business is do-able, if not why is it still around. As a friend, I think I have done alot to warn him about it. I told him about the lies they make, brainwashing that they do, and even asked him to look at this forum and particularly this thread. I personally hope that he is smart enough about this business, and even that he can tell my Bel' Air friend to come clean about it.<br><br>(Hey Aaron, if you are reading this, I hope you are thinking about what I am saying, this is not some taxi-drivers talking coffeeshop talk, this is real people sharing what they know and experienced in this MLM coy. I know by doing this, you know who I am, but I really dun fuking care. I also dun care about friendship anymore. Earning good friendships are hard, BUT bad friendships can be easily broken. As you can see, I am real pissed off about it. So just wake up your friend.)<br><br>Scorpio76 has not replied for sometime... does anyone reading this know of something that the Bel' Air people and particularly the AAA group did that is really against the law?<br><br>Can 'front-end' loading promotions such as '1+2+2', '1+5', '1+15' be considered legal? Especially since this scheme is actually targeted at the younger 16-24 age group?<br><br>Think only when someone from Bel' Air commit suicide or if the media decides to investigate it like the NKF saga then can something really be done. Meanwhile the only thing that we can do is try our best to let people be aware of this company.<br><br>Or if someone by any chance wants to contact Susan Long about it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Sabelli,<br><br>Below thread was posted  by BrandSing who contributed to a Bel'Air topic started by me. It answers to your question about the "1+5" and "1+15" investment schemes promoted by Bel'Air.<br><br>Hi All,<br><br>I read with interest the commentaries posted here. I would like to share my personal views on this matter as I have attended one of those 1+5 / 1+15 seminars.<br><br>Please refer to the MLM Act Section 2(c) (vi), I quote<br><br>"A promoter of a scheme shall not, and shall take reasonable steps to ensure that participants in the scheme :<br><br>..<br>..<br>(D) in promoting the scheme or the commodity, use, or cause or permit to be used, fraud, coercion, harassment, or unconsciounable or unlawful means"<br><br>After the attending one of such seminars, I observed that there was alot of hype in it. (i.e. loud music, people sharing, lots of yelling, showing their pay cheques....) With some basic knowledge of human pyschology, if a persons' mind is not sufficiently strong, he/she may be swayed into making a decision which is not based on clear facts but emotions/ group dynamics.<br><br>So, my question is Belair infringing on the ACT by practicising 'unconsciounable' means to promote the scheme. Can the relevant authorities please look into it as we may not be qualified to ascertain it.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">[b]Promoting 1+5/ 1+15 is basically creating a virtual network before finding the recruits. Based on my reading knowledge of some US MLM consultants, creating a virtual network is not a professional MLM practice! It is not a representation of the TRUTH of doing MLM i.e. Not all will recover their 'so-called' investment into the essential oils.</span></strong><br><br>For your friend Aaron, I think you have done your part as a friend to warn him the dangers of Bel'Air. If he wants to learn the hard way, let him be. There is nothing much we could do.<br><br>Aaron, if you follow this thread, hope the information provided will lead you to making a wise decision. Many  have regretted and we do not want you to be another victim of this unethical company. Take care.[/b]</blockquote>Hmm... all I know about the AAA group is that pushing recruits to cut count or challenge marquis. If someone were to really investigate, I bet they will find out that recruits who start as a 'franchisee' is a bare minimum. I dun even  want to think about how many counts/ marquis actually have a network growing under them. If what you say is true (with regards to the MLM Act), these people are really violating the Act.<br><br>I am glad that by starting this thread, some people like Savedsoul and Logic101 realise what a pyramid scheme this is, and are able to save up their hard-earned money or are able to not get into debt.<br><br>To those that did not join or got out of the '1+5', '1+15' scheme, no doubt we will lose some money , but at least we manage to cut our losses and save our time and relationships with others.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

If I did, that's the end of my frenship with them. I guess your fren is too brainwashed to think straight for himself. If she is your close fren then what you can do is ask her out alone to some place that you arranged and talk to her in private. They are usually told to meet up nearby where the Dukes are so that if anything happens the duke can brainwash your poor fren.    IF she refuses to meet you at your specified location, she's already too deep in it and she has to fight her own devil. Me and my frens tried to get a fren out by asking her out to talk. In the end the dukes were all there at a nearby food court giving her instructions thru her mobile phone! They are like an organized crime so better be wary!</div>

When a complaint was lodged, CASE responded that since the goods were not bought for personal consumption, they could not take up the case. Besides, I think the amount is limited to complaint of less than $10,000.<br><br>Bel'Air is very good at circumventing the loopholes of the laws and<br>those comtemplating of joining Bel'Air should note that the company package the investment as a "business" and it is difficult for CASE to address your grievance should your investment turn awry.<br><br>The relevant authorities should be MTI or CAD since the former legalised MLM and CAD to take actions if there are offences committed. I think legal actions could be taken if Bel'Air contravences the MLM Act without you or anyone attending court proceedings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahaha, just found out something from my mlm friend...<br><br>Despite the Dukes that told me Bel' Air is different from Lampe Berger, my friend said both Bel' Air and Lampe Berger has the same Chinese name. She said they are known as ...<br><br>(han yu pin ying) ya^3 ge^1 dan^1...<br><br>Different companies but same name?<br><br>Anyone confirm this?<br><br>Besides, I heard the leaders of these two companies are brothers, and taiwanese at that. I went to Germany lately, just came back (world cup fever). There I saw Lampe Berger and Bel' Air products sold... in a fragrance shop.<br><br>The ...<br>lamps are around 10-22 Euro (around 20-44 SGD),<br>fragrances are - 500ml (20 Euro, ~40 SGD),<br>- 1 litre (35 Euro, ~70 SGD),<br>and 5 litre (90 Euro, ~180 SGD).<br><br>I would take photos, but the German lady did not allow. I asked her if they are used in aromatherapy, she said they are air fresheners... perfumes...<br><br>I think either the Germans have very cheap products, or Bel' Air and Lampe Berger mark up the price. If these companies are MLMs, shouldn't they be cheaper than market price? Since MLMs 'bypass' middlemen (they do not need wholesalers, retail shops...)???<br><br>And why the Europeans call them air fresheners??? Makes me want to laugh at either the Europeans, or the Singaporeans pushing these products. And I think I know which group to laugh at.</div>
