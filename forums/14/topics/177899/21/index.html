            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Real life experience from ForsakenBeing</strong></span>:<br><br>I would like to share a real account here im sure most of us had been familiar with. It is closely related to MLM actually but I am taking time off to write this article because I feel there is a need for many to know and be aware of the threats that im going to share.<br><br>Due to rising cost of living and expensive lifestyle, im sure many ppl living in spore really wish to live a much better life. Me too, are included. This happens some time back for me.Being a person actively looking for better opportunities; I was being introduced to go explore a so called international business by a close buddy of mine. Thinking that its something good as I was also trying out some other traditional business myself, I went with him. This company is a familiar name BelÂ’air, most of us would had heard it in the recent NDP2006.<br><br>Well basically the company really has no problem and their product does look interesting and unique to me at time time, but the real horror that im going to disclose is related to the group under Belair Singapore called AAA (Aim, Attitude, Action) located at Hiap Huat House near Bendemeer RD. This group is being set up by a family of sisters, 2 main culprits are called Veronica Loh and Pamela Loh. They hold the rank of Duke in Belair.<br><br>Y do I say itÂ’s a horrific exp? I will list a few insider things I know to warn everyone off it:<br><br>1. They will dress up in power suits and exec wear showing off to ppl how successful they are but actually almost more than 70% of the ppl inside are all earning nothing.<br><br>2. They will go around shopping malls in suntec, marina, now even orchard hunting for possible victims, particularly those salesgirl and sales man in retail stores. Those ppl inside who have run out of victims on their name list are forced by their uplines to go to these places to Â“make friendsÂ”. Over there, they will try to know ppl out of nothing and get their numbers, they will try to be friendly with you and at the same time showing off all the stuffs they used their very last penny to buy. Then once gotten ur number, they will slowly contact the victims thru sms den phonecalls then eventually ask the person out.<br><br>3.DonÂ’t be fool by any words they said. If your friend is a fellow Â“partnerÂ” in this AAA group, never believe any words he or she says. Because they meant none of them, especially those very touching words. They are all tactics used to make u fall into the trap. This group likes to give empty promises and then uses emotional ways to Â“close caseÂ”.<br><br>4.The uplines are always camping in hotels waiting for their downlines to bring their victims to visit them. If your friend ever called u to go with him to see someone very successful at a hotel. NEVER,EVER go with him or her.<br><br>I will share an account how they close case now:<br><br>When the victim is being targeted, The upline will usually arrange the victim to go visit a very good seminar on Friday, Sat and Monday. They will use the victim soft spot to make sure the victim comes. Upon arriving at Hiap Huat House 4th level, sometimes 3rd. The Â“friendÂ” will bring the victim around the place to know ppl of similar background to the victim n then those ppl will talk a lot of things to the victim.<br>These are all prearranged before the victim arrives.<br><br>What is the purpose of the 3 seminars?<br><br>On Friday, they will talk about life and destiny. This is to hyped up the person to let him or her have a feeling that he or she should makes changes to their lifes. After the talk, they will bring the victims to diff small rooms whereby a speaker will be there to ask ppl to go onstage to share his or her exp. The whole environment is created to be very warming, lively and positive. This is pre arranged as all the partners are required to do that. When the victim go onstage, the speaker already beforehand knew all the potential problems the victim has will start encouraging the person thru many means n smart tactic and sweet words.<br><br>On Saturday, they will talk bout the investment. Before that they will use a set of presentation called the diff mindset of rich and poor to trap the victim first. How is this so? Because no one would say they want to be a poor person. So If u wanna be a rich person, then according to them u must join them in this business. Remember, the investment to join this grp is a whopping $14,000. but they will assure u everything is fine and the victim need not worry about the amt.<br><br>On Saturday, they will also arrange some Marquis (ppl claiming they are the company shareholder and earning 5 fig every mth) to close case. These marquis will use methods called Â“the success modelÂ”. What it is? They claim in AAA, manay ppl succeed by adopting this model.<br><br>1.100% experience of the prdt. They will ask the victim to cough out $1000 first to buy prdts from them to use n exp it whether the products really got a market.<br><br>2.Fix position. Being aware that most ppl wont have money, tey will act kind and say after paying the $1000, they will help the victim solve the money problem. This is the tricky part. Cause at this point of time, they will start asking the person to loan from friends, relatives and also banks, insurance, ezycash etc.<br><br>3.Lastly enter the system. They will encourage the person to keep coming to attend the seminars. This is actually to make sure the victim keep coming down to the seminars and get influenced.<br><br>Let me warn u that throughout the whole thing, none of the words they say are actually what they meant. Everything is discussed behind the victimÂ’s back and they include what words to say to him/her, how to encourage him/her, how to plan to make sure the person will go raise the money etc.<br><br>In there, there also claim that in fact if u want to join them. U have to be the right person if not they wont let u join them, thus u have to go through an interview before u can join them. This is bull!&amp;@&amp;. Its just something for them to access the victim and also to make sure they find the right victims who wont give up halfway in order to make sure they wont be wasting extra time.<br><br>Im really sick and tired of these nonsense thatÂ’s y for me I choose to leave because I didnÂ’t want to do things this wat as it is not an ethical manner at all. But many ppl who are inside are still blinded by greed and willing to sacrifices their friends and relatives and make them land in heavy debts. Y? because in my time there, I had see many ppl suffer because they have to pay their debts back. And what do their uplines say? They will claim Belair is a platform for u to succeed, if u cant succeed here, means its your problems. How ironic right? Before u join they are claiming that they will do everything to help u succeed, but after you join and having problems they will then tell u these. Worse still, those that are not doing well will be considered outcast! Yes. This is the very way they operate. So if u are considering joining this so called big family, better take care. I can assure u more than 70% of the ppl are actually not doing as well as they always claim. DonÂ’t be fool by their exp wear, pdas, nice looking specs etc. they are all being bought using their very last cent. Y? because if you donÂ’t buy them, they wont help u to close case.<br><br>Im writing this not because on hatred towards them. This is the very method they are using now. I considered it very unethical n I donÂ’t wish any fellow Singaporean to be trick into this. Look at me now, being promised of a great international business but im now slogging myself off in a part time job to pay my debts and many others are doing that too. If u have the guts to try it out, its up to you. But donÂ’t make your relatives and friends suffer. Worse still, donÂ’t be like them going out to hunt for strangers and land them into debts. Please spare a thought.<br></div>

It's either they have more aggressive in their recruitment or they have to go all out to lure victims to attend their stupid seminars.<br><br>Many have woken up from their bad experience except for those who still think they can become somebody in Bel'Air.Wake up, Dreamers!!! The Dukes are making use of you for their own benefits. It's the money they are after, not your welfare.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's a very unethical job in bel,air, i had a previous experience myself, but luckily i pull-out in time b4 i kanna psycho by all the talks and meeting after meeting. I still remember the first time after the talks, a duke forgot her name liao, ask mi wad is my personal dream and objective, i told her i wanted some luxury car, but she saes it's something  materialistic, and ask mi for other dream like that concerns my family. I say tis becoz my friend who introduce mi had been psycho by this AAA team, and her dream tat cause her to do more sinful/unethical acts of deciet is her dream of letting her family retire early(wad a filial child), but she still dunnoe tat she wasted both her money and youth in tis so-called wonderful busineess which is claimed to be "motivating","happy working relations",and "successful". Why why are there ppl who still haven wokeup and realise how deep they had fallen into, and in the meantime, pulling more ppl into the shit hole... i am very shock and disapointed by the ugly side of reality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry i dont have any recordings on that because its not needed. When the victim is raising money, they will ask the victim die die must not try to borrow it own his/her own, they will meet out with the victim. Then, theyw ill teach the victim what to say during conversing with friend, relatives for loans.<br><br>few examples would be:<br><br>#asking the victim to tell their friends his family is having some financial problems and he is trying to source for money to help his family.<br><br>#need money for some purpose but when friend ask for wat reason, they will ask the victim to shun away the question and say something else. then will promise the friend that once able to return the money, the victim will tell him the reason at that time.<br><br>#for loaning with family members, they will teach the victims to use touching words to let the family members know that they r doing this for their own future n their family future sake.<br><br>And also, right now... AAA is using a system they call "Zhao Shi", refering to creating atmosphere.<br><br>What the new counts are taught is that they have to memorize all the duke and marquis background and praise them like god in front of the victim. If they dont do well, the dukes and marquis will not help the respective new count to take his case.<br><br>Also, they have to be act very sincere and treat the marquis and dukes like ppl who have saved them from what mishap or limitless pit. they have to bow to the marquis n dukes and shake their hands whenever they bring the victim to them, and when in front of the victim, in order to potray a very successful person, the new counts who brought their victim will have to look upon the dukes and marquis and keep praising them. I find this exceptionally disgusting as my upline upline marquis is earning nothing every month and i still have to praise him like a god... !@#!@$@#%$<br><br>When at seminars, the counts will have to stand on chairs, dance, cheer, clap loudly and have to agree with what the duke says. When the duke goes onstage to do the presentation, the ppl who bring their victims along will again have to praise the dukes like god again.<br><br>Simple to say, everything is being forced to do. IF u dont do it, then u are OUT!<br>Therefore dont be fool by the heart warming atmosphere and feel very at home, thats what exactly they are trying to make u to feel and once u feel that way, they will have even better chance to influence u... im looking for the recording that touches on this... if i have i will post it here for u all to understand how they exactly teached new counts to do all these.<br><br>Perhaps till then, u can decide for yourself whether this business is for REAL..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good day,<br><br>I would like to give all of you readers some insider-information about Bel'air, especially its most "successful" network..<br><br>Who am I? I used to be one of the leaders in Bel'air's largest network in Singapore... you guys will know.. cos it the one that makes the most noise.. you can almost call it a Cult..<br><br>What I have to say, after reading all the posts here regarding the nature of Bel'air 'business', and spending 1 year plus of my life in the network,  is that they are all TRUE.<br><br>Sad to say, it was never a business model, which many bel'air distributors like to claim.. it was just a glorified PYRAMID scam, especially with the introduction of the infamous 1+5 'investment scheme'... telling people to invest in 5 empty positions below them. We were told that this will allow us to progress up to marquis and dukes faster.. but thats only provided you can psycho others to join you in this crazy scheme. Each count position cost 12k, so a 1+5 will cost you 60k extra.<br><br>This scheme is how that network (the noisy one) manage to hit record breaking sales in 2005.. by pushing the downlines to invest in 1+5. Buying up EMPTY positions below them. So in reality no sales of the products took place.<br><br>Yeah thats right folks.<br><br>NO ACTUAL SALES TOOK PLACE.. it was just repeated buying up of stocks aka counts.. and thats how all those dukes in this network got their duke status. And they still have the god-damn cheek to go up stage to receive their duke award... still dare to say that they succeed because of their perserverance.. blah blah blah... This is disgusting, but true.<br><br>Because I was there... I was one of their so-called generals.. doing their bidding... i was so caught up in the "dream"...<br><br>It was initially a dream to build up your own business, and to help others build up theirs as well... when i first join Bel'air and this network a long time ago, that was my intention. In fact, that was the GENUINE intention of the uplines in the network. (Back then anyway.. )<br><br>We helped each other in all aspects of the business.. from simple encouragements, to helping others to handle case-meetings and presentations, and to share our various experiences.... It was as what Robert Kiyosaki said, a business where you help each other to succeed, where people will always back you up..<br><br>Everything changed after the senior leaders went to visit the networks in China, and bring back what they called a "sucess model". Apparently it was used to great effects in China.<br><br>This model demands 100% trust and belief in your upline leaders, and absolute obedience. This means that you can be somewhere in town, and when the leaders calls for you (meetings, discussions, etc), you jolly well come back in time. It also means you accept whatever your leaders tell you to do, for they have no reasons to "sabo" you.<br><br>This is all true.. unfortunately our leaders are only human.. not some god-like beings... we end up putting all the trust in a bunch of people who do not have solid leadership abliities, sufficient social experiences, and make poor judgement of many things... telling people to buy sports cars, big houses, quit their jobs to do MLM full-time, forgo some family time to do bel'air, among other things.. it sounds ridiculous, but its all TRUE. I do not deny that many of the leaders are charismatic, and do have various degrees of ablitities.. but they are certainly not qualified to make decisions that concerns a person's life and career!<br><br>What worked for desperate Chinamen did not work for Singaporeans..<br><br>They have turn the network into a bloody cult... if you don't believe me (and have some time to spare on evenings), just go attend any of the presentations by that noisy network. You'll see what i mean.<br><br>The reality is that many people were psycho to join, and lost a lot of money.. many people left the network when they realised that it has changed.. and was not what they expect to be..<br><br>I sense this change in the mood.. and voice out to my uplines that we are heading towards a disaster.. and guess what? They insist that all those people who left are unsuitable.. ie its not the network's problem. The problem is with those people. This was when i ask: "Then why let them join in the first place?? if they are not suitable?". The answer? For SALES VOLUME.<br><br>It got too scary for me to carry on.. what started as a happy family-like network business has turned into some money-hungry abomination...<br><br>To be continued....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no problems pal..<br><br>In fact, i have nothing against the ppl inside this AAA group because some of them are really nice ppl... but too bad they are just being blinded either by the sweet words of their uplines or they are just too scared to question the system. After all, after paying up more than $15000, who else can u trust except for them to help u get back the money..<br><br>And since ever since i backed out, they are still giving me so much problems and even make so much false accusation behind my back.(i will touch on this later). I really can't take it anymore but list out all the things i wished others would know.<br><br>My upline even ask me to be responsible to my sidelines and their uplines.<br>I mean fine, i will be... but i must also be responsible to the public. So i will continue to list out all the things they are planning behind ppl's back<br><br>As for today,<br><br>This is mainly for ppl who have already joined Bel'air and still struggling in it.<br><br>Look and wake up..<br><br>Aren't the uplines always saying the same things over n over again to us?<br>They always claimed we cant do well because we have our own problems, and thus we are not ready to commit to this business. But look closely, how many ppl are putting in 200% effort but yet still earning nothing every month.<br><br>Whenever downlines are having problems, they will claim that this is because the downlines do not believe in them, the downlines are too bothered by personal problems. In worst cases which they cant think of any reasons, they claimed that the downlines have "blindspots" which they failed to see, and thats what affecting them.<br>IS that really true for everyone? wake up man, wake up!<br><br>In AAA, they will always claim that a person not doing well is that person's fault. Its never the upline, the Marquis, or even the Duke's fault. Look, Ever since they adopt the "zhao shi" system, everything we said and do are all fake. Nothing is real! Yes, we might be "grateful" to the person who brought us into this business, but to tell ur friends, relatives they are earning 5, 6 figs a month when they are earning less than a foreign construction worker is really a joke!<br><br>To the upline Marquis, Dukes, come on... Face yourself in the mirror and ask yourself... Have u really EVER done well? or u are just building your success based on other ppls' misery? Cut the acting and be yourself.. Those who are earning nothing stop telling others ur earning 5, 6 fig a mth. its really hopeless..<br><br>To the downlines who are struggling, stop bother to go think about how to spot your blindspot. cos u will never finish spotting them. If your upline dare to ask u, "are u REALLY ready for this business?" ASk them back the same question. Cos i can see so many cannot make it MArquis in there who are not ready at all and yet still think they are so clever and ready. In the end, they just destroy everybody's life and still have no sense of remorse over it..<br><br>The uplines always claim that the downlines have to change in order to succeed. Change here change there but still being scolded for not changing.<br>Some poor things even got reprimanded and asked to go back and think again whether they want to change or not. But the fact is, they had changed but where the problem really lie?!?!<br><br>Answer: the uplines themselves. Look, they always ask ppl to change. but have they themselves really changed? Look at the behind scenes of some well known marquis in AAA, behaving like kids, stubborn, not willing to listen to ppl etc. And they claimed they have changed?!?!?! sighs.....<br><br>Some classic questions the upline always like to ask their downlines:<br><br>1. Have u really decided what u want to achieve in your life?<br><br>U answer yes and tell them whatever u have thought of, they will claim its not concrete, not realistic, too vague, and ask u to go back and think again<br><br>2. If u have not been doing well, what makes u think that u will do better this time?<br><br>3. Are u REALLY ready for this great business?<br><br>4. Can u go back and think of all your problems and possible solutions?<br><br>5. Are u sure u have no more "blindspots"?<br><br>6. Do u think u can really do it this time?  If not, please go back and think whats stopping u from succeeding.<br><br>7. Do u think if u back out now, u can succeed outside?<br><br>8. If u dont change, u can never succeed one u know, can u please go back n think what areas u need to change?<br><br>9. Have u figured out why u still have no results in this business? no? please go back and think bout it.<br><br>Nowadays, they are also asking the downlines to keep reading the book, "Secrets of a millionaire mind" to look for their blind spot. I can still remember i have sidelines whom have read the whole book allmost 2,3 times but still asked by their upline to go back n read further till they find the answers? WHere de hell are the answers they should find?<br><br></div>

It was as what Robert Kiyosaki said, a business where you help each other to succeed, where people will always back you up..<br><br>Everything changed after the senior leaders went to visit the networks in China, and bring back what they called a "sucess model". Apparently it was used to great effects in China.<br><br>This model demands 100% trust and belief in your upline leaders, and absolute obedience. This means that you can be somewhere in town, and when the leaders calls for you (meetings, discussions, etc), you jolly well come back in time. It also means you accept whatever your leaders tell you to do, for they have no reasons to "sabo" you.<br><br>This is all true.. unfortunately our leaders are only human.. not some god-like beings... we end up putting all the trust in a bunch of people who do not have solid leadership abliities, sufficient social experiences, and make poor judgement of many things... telling people to buy sports cars, big houses, quit their jobs to do MLM full-time, forgo some family time to do bel'air, among other things.. it sounds ridiculous, but its all TRUE. I do not deny that many of the leaders are charismatic, and do have various degrees of ablitities.. but they are certainly not qualified to make decisions that concerns a person's life and career!<br><br>What worked for desperate Chinamen did not work for Singaporeans..<br><br>They have turn the network into a bloody cult... if you don't believe me (and have some time to spare on evenings), just go attend any of the presentations by that noisy network. You'll see what i mean.<br><br>The reality is that many people were psycho to join, and lost a lot of money.. many people left the network when they realised that it has changed.. and was not what they expect to be..<br><br>I sense this change in the mood.. and voice out to my uplines that we are heading towards a disaster.. and guess what? They insist that all those people who left are unsuitable.. ie its not the network's problem. The problem is with those people. This was when i ask: "Then why let them join in the first place?? if they are not suitable?". The answer? For SALES VOLUME.<br><br>It got too scary for me to carry on.. what started as a happy family-like network business has turned into some money-hungry abomination...<br><br>To be continued....<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="color: blue;">A year ago, I started a thread warning about Bel'Air promoting the "1+5" and "1+15" investment schemes and had a good engagement with a Bel'Air's Marquis. A few tried to put me down with their unconvincing and desperate attempts to defend Bel'Air.<br><br>Latest posts by joachim_peiper and Forsakenbeing have proven once again what I had written are all TRUTHS and no exaggeration on my part. I was hoping the Marquis and those who have defended would come out once again to give their side of the story. I doubt they would as they would just be embarassing themselves if they did.<br><br>Since you claim to be a one of leader of  " the noisiest group/AAA ", forumers are waiting for you to tell more.<br><br>(a) Is it true that many are leaving AAA/ Bel'Air?What are the main reasons for leaving? No income, no longer trust their "Leaders" or they are convinced AAA/Bel'Air is running a disguised pyramid.<br><br>(b) Does the "Leaders" follow the postings here? Do they view the postings here as a threat to  their existence.<br><br>(c) In your opinion, how effective are the postings here in dissuading people from joining AAA/Belair.<br><br>(d) Are the recruitment numbers in AAA/Bel'Air dwindling? Be'Airians like to boast they earn 5 figures income. Do you agree that the majority are in fact struggling.<br><br>(e) "1+5" or "1+15" investment schemes. How many actually manage to  recoup their investments? Do you have an estimate figure in terms of percentage? I am of the opinion that most if not all will suffer a hugh loss.<br><br>Since you are a former leader, your revelations about the inside story of AAA/Bel'Air will carry a lot of weight. Just hope you continue to expose this unscrupulous company</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
