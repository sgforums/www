            <div class='col-md body'>I got a friend who asked me to listen to a seminar in commonwealth, from Bel' Air (some 'aroma-medicare') MLM company.<br><br>First thing I noticed on the ground floor are the products, looked like Lampe Berger (another MLM i think) stuff only fancier. (recognised it 'coz i got a friend pushing me to buy his products from LB, ended up totally ignoring him).<br><br>Then to the seminar. Got to write down your name, mobile number, on the list before you go in. The whole room smell of their product, some diffuser thingy (think Lampe Berger).<br><br>The MC was some Myanmar girl, who said how her family benefit from using the stuff, how she is now earning a 5-digit income after 1 year into the biz. Everytime the MC said something motivating, the 'associates' will clap, and they will play that stupid dragostea song. So much of psycho'ing IMO.<br><br>The main talker is some ex-insurance woman or something, and said how she quitted her job to do this Bel' Air, saying she's earning a 5 or 6 digit (yah, right) income now.<br><br>Thru-out the seminar, she flashed pics of sports cars, holiday locations, houses (with occasional applause from 'associates' + dragostea song). The emphasis on the products were a bare minimal, although she said that the products will sell due to increasing air pollution, that the smell can kill H5N1 virus, blah blah blah)<br><br>She ended the talk with numbers, stressing about starting at a count level(investing 14K!!!) and getting your commissions by finding future prospects to join. And to work your way up to Duke (Count -&gt; Marquis -&gt; Duke) and earning some global bonus using that position.<br><br>The whole thing smells so fishy to me. This seems to be more of a pyramid scheme, by encouraging active recruitment instead of product sales.<br><br>- If u are investing 14k, and earning (i think 3.7k) per recruitment, where does all the rest of the money go to??<br><br>- These people told me that family and friends will definitely object to me joining this biz, but that I must have self-belief in it. They told me to think of what the 14k can bring to me, to fulfill my dreams. All these sounds like brain-washing to me! They said they can help me to find the 14k, but I must be the one to take the first step. Said I am not going to be doing this alone, that they will help me as I go along.<br><br>- How can these people sleep at night? Asking their family and friends to invest so much, and may not be able to recover the investment?<br><br>- How long can this recruitment chain stretch?<br><br>- Bel' Air got some Gold Medal and sponsored NDP for some years, how did they do it?<br><br>When I asked my friend if he is really getting a 5-digit income in this, all he said was 'there is no point in me showing you my income statement, if you dun believe in this biz'. Up till now, he hasnt showed me his income yet.<br><br>Oh yea, I was introduced to two people that joined (around 2 years ago) and are now driving Alfa Romeo and RX-8 sports cars, and another duke (I think) getting an Integra (still in NUS). Are these really possible? I shiver thinking how many 'downlines' are under them now...<br><br>Athough I may sound biased to Bel' Air, I like to stress that I am not against or for this business. I think that there should be some awareness for people thinking of joining this company.<br><br>Maybe someone (working or used to work) in Bel' Air will like to share his/her opinion on it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some things are just a facade... some of these mlmers may be driving sports car but may not be bought with their own money, or they are risking huge debts to buy these cars, granted that some may be making enough to afford these vehicles... but the idea of owning these cars is to protray the image that they are successful and rich... even if it means taking up debts to buy the cars... if they are able to impress u and get u to join, then yes, maybe ur investments will help them pay for their monthly installment of the car.<br><br>eg... u have been psychoed to believe this marketing crap works, and u so believe in it... so after investing some money to the company for their products... u fork out extra money to buy a nice car with huge monthly installments becoz u believe u can impress and recruit.. if u manage to psych others to join, then their invesments will help pay ur installments... if it didn't turn out well, then man... after sometime u may have to sell the car and end up in alot of debt. But who knows?? as long as u continue walking around in ur suits... only god and urself know the truth.<br><br>the thing is u will never know if the recruiters are really making so much money. coz they are not obligated to show u their financial records. even if they show u their paycheck, so what?? They could always get their boss write a check of $10k and the check may be used over and over again and never deposited.</div>

Before u want to invest so much, decide for urself if this is best for u. Dun join becos it's for the sake of money. Naturally the money u invested will be pocketed into the uplines. That's why they will try all ways and means to convince u.<br><br>Dun wait till u join and incur debts and ur reputation will be gone becos most ppl are not rich. Many will have to borrow from friends and relatives and banks. And mlm usually involves in approaching friends and relatives. After that, u want to approach ppl who lent u money again? Think again.<br><br>Haiz, money can really cloud ppl's judgement.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I WAS from bel'air. I have to admit that I was brainwashed when I joined, not because of money, but I was a little tired of my job that time. I have to say it is very recruitment driven, although my upline and Co told me that I am actually looking for business partners, instead of just recruitment like what pyramid scheme does.<br><br>They also told me to get to know more people and see if they have potential, and if not just remain as friends. After that, I went to all sorts of gatherings, to get to know more "FRIENDS". Sadly, that's not the life I want. To me, knowing friends should be in a natural way, like knowing friends from schools, work, etc. instead of searching to get to know friends. Perhaps some people are ok with this way of making new friends, but I'm not. I got out of it after about a year. Recruited one of my friends, but felt very guilty about it. Both of us got out of it, and we are still good friends. That's how I feel about this experience.<br><br>Forgot to add that, they always tell me that I need a team to open a market somewhere, like overseas, that's why I need to find a few good business partners to work with. However, I never got an answer of their definition of open market.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi for those people uncertain about whether are they operating under a illegal pyramid schem. read this excerpts from the MTI website<br><br>. What is Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) and Pyramid Selling?<br><br>A Multi-Level Marketing or Pyramid Selling scheme will typically require participants to pay an upfront charge. In return, the participants are promised financial rewards for each additional participant recruited, as well as all new participants who are in turn brought in by their recruits - hence the pyramid-like structure.<br><br>As more salespersons are recruited, participants hope to recover their upfront charges and earn sizeable profits. However, such a pyramid schemes will eventually collapse when they run out of new recruits, resulting in those salespersons at the bottom of the pyramid losing all their upfront charges.<br><br>In the interest of consumer protection, the Government's regulation effort is targeted at preventing the proliferation of such high-risk schemes.<br><br>2. How do I recognise a pyramid selling scheme?<br><br>Many pyramid schemes often disguise themselves as sellers collectors' items, software, training programmes, etc, when all they are interested is to make a quick buck through recruitment. Members of the public who attend sales talks must be vigilant to such schemes. Illegitimate MLM schemes usually share the following characteristics:<br>When the promoter hype about how easy it is to earn money, people can get very rich in a very short time and that the way to earn money is by recruiting others to join the scheme;<br>The so-called product that you are supposed to sell is not something you would normally buy at its price;<br>Participants are required to invest money into the scheme, whether in the form of a joining fee, or buying inventory.<br>Remember - there is no easy money, you must believe in what you are selling and you should not put your money at unnecessary risk.<br><br>3. How are MLM activities governed in Singapore?<br><br>MLM activities in Singapore are governed by the Multi-level Marketing and Pyramid Selling(Prohibition) Act. The Ministry of Trade and Industry administers the Act.<br><br>The original Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act was first passed in 1973. In June 2000, Parliament approved an amendment to the Act to widen the definition of pyramid selling to catch all business schemes that were multi-level in nature.<br><br>However, as not all multi-level marketing techniques are undesirable, the Government concurrently enacted the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order (hereafter, referred to as the Â¡Â®Exclusion Order) to exclude legitimate businesses from the Act, such as insurance companies, master franchises, and direct selling companies which fulfill certain criteria. This Exclusion Order was implemented in June 2000.<br><br>4. Why is there a need to have an Exclusion Order?<br><br>Not all multi-level marketing techniques are undesirable. There are legitimate businesses using innovative sales tactics, and should not be lumped together with pyramid schemes.<br><br>Hence, the Government enacted the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order (hereafter, referred to as the 'Exclusion Order') in June 2000, to exempt legitimate businesses from the Act. The following categories of businesses were exempted:<br><br>(1) Insurance businesses that are registered, approved or licensed under the Insurance Act, the Insurance Intermediaries Act 1999 and the regulations made thereunder;<br><br>(2) Master franchise schemes and direct selling schemes which satisfy the following conditions:<br>the benefit received by any promoter or participant is as a result of the sale, lease, license or other distribution of a commodity and not as a result of the recruitment of additional participants;<br>the promoter of the scheme shall not knowingly make false or misleading representation or omission relating to the scheme or the commodity;<br>the promoter shall not make any representation on the benefits other than those allowed;<br>there should be a clearly stated policy on refund or buy-back guarantee.<br><br>After the Exclusion Order was enacted in 2000, the Government received feedback that the provisions in the Exclusion Order were not sufficiently clear. Some members of the public were also confused by claims of legitimacy by companies and often requested for the Government to clarify if particular schemes were legitimate.<br><br>In response to the feedback, the Government reviewed the Exclusion Order, and subsequently amended the Order in 2001.<br><br>5. Why is there a need to amend the Exclusion Order?<br><br>As a result of developments in the market and suggestions from the public, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in consultation with the industry, and taking into consideration the public's comments, has come up with a revised MLM Exclusion Order.<br><br>6. What were the amendments made in 2001 to the Exclusion Order?<br><br>The Exclusion Order 2001 continued to maintain that insurance companies and master franchises would be excluded from the MLM Act.<br><br>However, it also introduced the following rules for direct selling companies:<br>Safeguards - A participant cannot be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to become a participant in the scheme, other than the purchase of demonstration equipment which is not for resale, at no more than cost price and for which no commission can be given out. A legitimate multi-level marketing scheme would not impose a financial risk on salespersons. For example, salespersons should be entitled to full refunds, under reasonable commercial terms, for any inventories kept or purchased by them which are not sold to end consumers, so long as the inventories are returned within a period of 60 days.<br>Behavioural checks - The companies must not misrepresent the scheme as get-rich-quick opportunities, and should not use fraud, coercion, harassment, or unconscionable means to force people to join the scheme. Instead, the companies should focus their efforts on promoting the quality and features of the products. If a company wishes to show potential participants the earning potential, they must keep records of the maximum, minimum, mean, mode and median earnings of their salespeople in the past.<br>Sharing of commission - It is all right for a salesperson to share commissions from several layers of salespersons recruited by him. However, such commissions must be generated by sale of the product or service in question, and not through the recruitment of additional participants into the scheme.<br><br>7. When did the amended Exclusion Order come into effect?<br><br>The amendments to the Exclusion Order were published on 14 December 2001, and came into effect on 01 January 2002.<br><br>8. Where can one obtain the amended Exclusion Order?<br><br>The full text of the current Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order can be accessed at the MTI website.<br>.<br><br>9. What are the penalties for being in breach of the MLM Act?<br><br>During the review of the MLM Act in Year2000, the fines were raised from $30,000 to $200,000. Currently, a conviction under the Act will result in a fine of up to $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or to both. The fines are for the following offences:<br>promoting or participating in a multi-level marketing, or pyramid selling, scheme or arrangement.<br>registering a business which is designed to promote multi-level marketing, or pyramid selling, scheme or arrangement.<br>registering a company which proposes to promote multi-level marketing, or pyramid selling, scheme or arrangement.<br>In addition, the Act empowers a Court that convicts a promoter or participant of a multi-level marketing or pyramid selling an additional penalty of an amount not exceeding the amount or value of any benefit which the promoter or participant has received. This additional penalty ensures that the Act serves as an effective deterrent to potential offenders.<br><br>10. What would happen to "innocent victims" who participated in pyramid schemes unknowingly, and who did not benefit in any way before the scheme closed down?<br><br>Under the Act, all persons who participate in multi-level marketing or pyramid selling would commit an offence. This is because the participants would have played an active but destructive role of attracting others into the scheme. We believe that this is the best way to deter the potential promoters of such schemes.<br><br>Hence, we would urge the public to be extra careful and to exercise due diligence when deciding whether to participate in business schemes. They should be doubly suspicious of get-rich-quick promises. If they believe empty promises and hand over their money to the promoter, chances are they will be cheated of the money. At the same time, they might be guilty of committing an offence as they are participating in an illegal scheme.<br><br>11. Is there a special license required to conduct those types of businesses listed in the Exemption Order?<br><br>Companies whose business schemes fall under the Exclusion Order are not required to obtain a special licence.<br><br>12. Can the operators and members of the public seek the Government's advice on the legality of their business schemes?<br><br>It is not proper, nor appropriate, for Government agencies to give legal advice on which scheme is legal and which is not, as this would circumscribe the Government's effectiveness in enforcing regulation against fraudulent schemes that may evolve over time.<br><br>Instead, the operators and members of the public should acquaint themselves with the relevant laws, and seek legal advice from lawyers, where necessary. Lawyers should be able to advise on specific cases, according to the context and how the actual events unfold.<br><br>13. Which agency should a member of the public report to, if they suspect that certain business schemes are actually illegal multi-level marketing or pyramid selling schemes?<br><br>The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) investigates pyramid selling schemes. If you suspect a scheme has contravened the MLM Act, you can report to the CAD at telephone number 3250000 or lodge a report at 391 New Bridge Road, #06-701 Block D, Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore 088762.<br><br>also refer to this website from the US on statistics of earning potential of MLM Companies. http://www.mlm-thetruth.com/<br><br>it is your job to be informed and to report any wrong-doings to the relevant authorities. Lets make Singapore a more ethical/gracious society by bringing down those guilty of wrong doings.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>[A FRIEND OF MINE HAS THIS EXPERIENCE TO SHARE<br><br>1)The promoter (Upline) keeps stressing how easy it is to make money and how a distributor can easily make over SGD10K monthly within a period of 6 mths from entering the scheme. Talk about how good the current uplines are doing eg owing nice cars/houses 6 figureyearly pay as well citing an example of a senior distributor who makes over SGD1million yearly.<br><br>2)Signing fee is set at SGD13,000 as other levels of entry are not encouraged. Signing up at the higher levels gives the greatest income and promotion opportunities.<br>during first meeting hard core sales tactics are used such as 13K to sign up today, 16K to sign up another day to force a decision. (1st day discount)<br><br>3)Encourage recruits to think about the income opportunity and to come up with the 13,000K entry fee, Suggest surrendering insurance policies/taking up personal loans etc.<br><br>4)After successfully recruiting the candidate, starts brainwashing exercise to identify who are good candidates for recruitment. (eg the desperate, greedy/ambitious people) as well as to create a sense of justification on what they are doing. Eg it is alright to persuade friends/relatives to join the scheme as it gives the recruits great income opportunities as well as letting them enjoy the benefits of their products.( which is grossly overpriced) Saying that the company is a proud sponsor of NDP as well as receiving the confidence/endorsements of many leading ministers.<br><br>5)After my friend has confided in me, i directed her to the ST online forum to listen to the experiences of other victims as well as giving her a copy of a FAQ to identify illegal pyramid selling. Then then decided to terminate her distributorship with the company. However her upline tried to pyscho her to stay on and inform her there is a termination fee of 10% or 1300 as well as a further franschisor penalty fee of SGD1000 (total 2300) to frighten her to stay on.  After consulting the CAD, she then call up the company again to state her intention to terminate as well as our knowledge of the acts/laws protecting her. (60 days full money back refund) She still has not collected her money and the company has inform her they would revert to her soon on the refund and termination.<br><br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sabelli:</div><div class="quote_body">I got a friend who asked me to listen to a seminar in commonwealth, from Bel' Air (some 'aroma-medicare') MLM company.<br><br>First thing I noticed on the ground floor are the products, looked like Lampe Berger (another MLM i think) stuff only fancier. (recognised it 'coz i got a friend pushing me to buy his products from LB, ended up totally ignoring him).<br><br>Then to the seminar. Got to write down your name, mobile number, on the list before you go in. The whole room smell of their product, some diffuser thingy (think Lampe Berger).<br><br>The MC was some Myanmar girl, who said how her family benefit from using the stuff, how she is now <span style="color: red;">earning a 5-digit income after 1 year into the biz</span>. Everytime the MC said something motivating, the 'associates' will clap, and they will play that stupid dragostea song. So much of psycho'ing IMO.<br><br>The main talker is some ex-insurance woman or something, and said how she quitted her job to do this Bel' Air, <span style="color: red;">saying she's earning a 5 or 6 digit (yah, right) income now</span>.<br><br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt; 5 or 6 digits...10,000 = 5 digits, 100,000 = 6 digits....Does she know what's she talking about? 5 digits "salary" ($10,000 ~$99,999) is the pay of at least a Manager/GM/Director/Above of a Established company...Not convincing enough, IMO...</span><br><br>Thru-out the seminar, she flashed pics of sports cars, holiday locations, houses (with occasional applause from 'associates' + dragostea song). The emphasis on the products were a bare minimal, although she said that the products will sell due to increasing air pollution, that the smell can kill H5N1 virus, blah blah blah)<br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt;&gt; Why flash those pics of sport cars, houses??? Psycho-ing yongsters into "dreamland" and asking hard-earned money ($14K) from their parent ...<br>If that "smell" can kill H5N1, what are the scientists n researchers doing now? Why the death tolls of Birdflu is still rising? Might as well say, can cure AIDS and Cancers....<br>Also, instead of educating and promoting the benefits their products for health (since they mentioned abt curing H5N1), they're promoting the monetary gains by selling their products....what bullsh!t...IMO, they're promoting n trying to sell "dreams" to youngsters...</span><br><br>She ended the talk with numbers, stressing about starting at a count level(investing 14K!!!) and getting your commissions by finding future prospects to join. And to work your way up to Duke (Count -&gt; Marquis -&gt; Duke) and earning some global bonus using that position.<br><br>The whole thing smells so fishy to me. This seems to be more of a pyramid scheme, by encouraging active recruitment instead of product sales.<br><br>- If u are investing 14k, and earning (i think 3.7k) per recruitment, where does all the rest of the money go to??<br><br>- These people told me that family and friends will definitely object to me joining this biz, but that I must have self-belief in it. They told me to think of what the 14k can bring to me, to fulfill my dreams. All these sounds like brain-washing to me! They said they can help me to find the 14k, but I must be the one to take the first step. Said I am not going to be doing this alone, that they will help me as I go along.<br><br>- How can these people sleep at night? Asking their family and friends to invest so much, and may not be able to recover the investment?<br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt;If they don't succeed in recruiting ppl into their company, they CAN"T sleep at night... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br>- How long can this recruitment chain stretch?<br><br>- Bel' Air got some Gold Medal and sponsored NDP for some years, how did they do it?<br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt;&gt; You think what's the 14K per pax for now???</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>When I asked my friend if he is really getting a 5-digit income in this, all he said was 'there is no point in me showing you my income statement, if you dun believe in this biz'. Up till now, he hasnt showed me his income yet.<br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt;&gt; How to show when he doesn't even have that kinda income? To have a 5 digits income at such young age, he shld be in the newspapers..."Top 10 Younsters earning 5-digits salary"...If i've a 5-digits income per month, i would have shown to those which i'm going to recruit...dun say 5-digits, 3k~6k ncome, i would have "hao lian" to them already...IMO, why waste so much time n efforts in persuading ppl into the company whereby they can jolly well show their 5-digits income and easily can recruit ALOT of ppl into the company...</span><br><br>Oh yea, I was introduced to two people that joined (around 2 years ago) and are now driving Alfa Romeo and RX-8 sports cars, and another duke (I think) getting an Integra (still in NUS). Are these really possible? I shiver thinking how many 'downlines' are under them now...<br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt;&gt;Look, why study in NTU when you're earning 5-digits income n driving an Alfa or Rx-8?? An degree grad, earns not more than 3k per month as a starting salary...so, what's 3k income when they already earning 5-digits income?</span><br>Athough I may sound biased to Bel' Air, I like to stress that I am not against or for this business. I think that there should be some awareness for people thinking of joining this company.<br><br>Maybe someone (working or used to work) in Bel' Air will like to share his/her opinion on it? </div></blockquote></div>
