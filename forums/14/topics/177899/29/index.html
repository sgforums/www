Infact Newpaper comes to mind as they dig sensational stories.<br><br>2. Inform people of the correct way of doing MLM, one of which is avoid front loading companies, etc.<br><br>3. Inform people of some of the mind games they play, including the famous one of "letting your parents retire" promise, peer pressure, empty promises...<br><br>4. Urge DSAS to hold a tighter rein, including getting ALL so called network marketing companies to join. Once a member is found to fraud certain guidelines they will be delisted from the association. This includes the founding members!!!!<br><br>I'm sure you guys can think of more things.

Many people have pointed out to the government in the past regarding illegal massage parlours but they turn a deaf ear... it only takes a death of one girl to spark a massive clean-up.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are a few things that AAA ppl will tell their new friends. This is what they call "vaccination". Please pay close attention to these 'cause they are going to save you from losing your 12 grands.<br><br>Vaccination:<br><br>1. Before business presentation:<br>"In any business, there must be a product or service provided. But the product or service is just a medium. We are not doing retailing or direct selling. The first part of the program will tell you about the market potential behind the product. The second part of the programme will tell you more about the marketing plan. We are using franchising concept by opening outlets and managing outlets. Later on after the programme, we can sit down over a drink and I will explain to you in detail. "<br><br>This is also the time they will "tee up" their upline marquis so that they can introduce them to you later "naturally". Don't worry, their upline marquis will be walking by your table very soon to chat with you. Its all pre-meditated.<br><br>2. Before you head home:<br>" When you have a very great interest in the BA business and you go back and talk to ppl about it, you will most definitely face 2 types of people. First type of people are those who do not understand the business, and the second type of people are those who never succeed in life before. For the first type of people who do not understand the business, you have to bring him in to the business presentation before you can talk to him. For the second type of people who have never succeeded in life before, there's no point for you to listen to what he says. When successful people (my foot!~ can't help it) give you advice, you should heed their advice. Here I'm not asking you to join the business but for you to truly understand the BA business first (then whats the whole point of understanding if aren't targeting them to join you freaking bastards!) Never let those people who do not understand the business or have never succeeded before to influence you. Everyone in BA knows that the most successful people are those who follow closely with the successful leaders. And I believe that this is the first time our leader talks to you, and I hope you can talk to him a second, third or fourth time, until you understand and succeed in this business."<br><br>3. Before RTM:<br>" In any business, there must be capital involved. But rather than thinking of how big the capital is, you should think of how much this business can help you achieve the things you want. because this business have helped me (Strengthen your why by using your story) E.g. Achieving your dreams, giving your loved ones a better life, determining your own value in life.<br>Being a business-minded person I believe you share the same thought as other business owners, they will have two questions in mind, how fast can I get back my return of investment because once you get back your investment, there is no more risk.Subsequently how much profit can I make."<br><br>This is to mislead new friends from thinking about the real concern: the size of the investment. And, there is no return on investment at all. Also, the "why" of your friend who introduce the business to you has been rehearsed over and over again so that it impacts you in aspects such as family, work, self-value, retirement etc. It makes you feel a sense of crisis and that you should follow your friend's footsteps in order to save your ass.<br><br>The reason I'm posting this here is to let everyone know the tricks that they use. What they say are biased to their advantage. Even though it may seem logical, it all points to one thing --&gt; join them. Many can be fooled easily by what they say. So be forewarned.<br><br>With so many things said about AAA, its time for something to be done. Yes, no authorities will dare to expose the atrocities that this group has committed. By doing so, what will it say about our government? I have a dying urge to post the photos of the LIM brothers.<br><br>One (slow) means is to cause their "market" to be stagnant. People in there will leave once the business is heading nowhere without involving the authorities. Unless the FOOLISH choose to continue in their WAY. This forum needs more publicity. Tell everyone about it. Yeah, I agree this is not the most effective way but its the most direct means we can get our hands on. And until the authorities take some action, we can only wait. So why not make our waiting worth the while? Besides, if you still have friends in the business, we wouldn't want them to get into trouble with the authorities yet, would you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> <span style="color: blue;"></span><br></div>

Mrs Soo changed the company name to Lampe Burger using pyramid scheme and it was very successful. But later on this company have to bankrupt because the supplier is 黃樹立's father 黃國屏, he make her no more business then take over her company and woalah, here come the all famous Lampe Berger where we see right now. But then 黃樹立's older brother (黃樹雄 is very jealous and use some tactics to stop his younger brother to get any supply. So at the end, 黃樹雄 become the leader of Lampe Berger. His younger brother been chased out and have to create another brand called Belair.<br><br>If after reading the history of Lampe Berger you still believe 黃樹雄 is an honest business man then I really got nothing to say.<br><br>Here is link of Next Megazine (HK) further investigation on Lampe Berger, Next Megazine is Hong Kong most popular megazine, if you still doubt this megazine is lying then I'm speechless as well:<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/joyfulluck/news_next.html<br>[This message was edited by orange88 on 2006-06-17 13:25:16.]</div>
