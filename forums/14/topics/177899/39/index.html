            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Specially written to those who <span style="color: red;">DO NOT HAVE A CORRECT IDEA </span>on the goods refund clause.<br><br>In the marketing seminar, most speakers would have mentioned something about the<br>30 days- 100% refund;<br>90 days- 90% refund (10% will be used as the administration costs).<br><br>Now, lets evaluate this together.............<br><br>What exactly happens during this process?<br><br>When one decides to refund all the goods to the company, the company will <span style="color: green;">take back ALL the goods </span>and give you a cheque which consists 20% of the amount of your goods(10% as administrative). WHY? Still remember the company 70% payout policy? The rest of the 70% was long ago being distributed to your uplines.<br><br><span class="large">STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND?</span><br><br>Which means the outstanding 70% amuont, you will have to cross your fingers and pray hard that ALL YOUR UPLINES are earning money and thus you will be able to receive the remaining balance. IF NOT, sorry, you will have to chase after this sum of money from each of your uplines <span style="color: red;">PERSONALLY</span> as the stockist <span style="color: blue;">WILL NOT HELP YOU </span>with this.<br><br>And if this really happens, FORGET ABOUT IT. You do not have to bother to keep pestering them for the money. Simply its all because you are down-on-your-luck and too naive to believe in this policy. And also, to be fair, all these uplines have made a HUGE maintainence for that. Its $5000 bucks if I am not wrong. If we are to blame anyone for these, its gonna be ourselves and the very intelligent Kenneth Wong. He is really right on the strategy this time round.<br><br>He is actually able to earn from both sides: the uplines and the newbies.<br>I really wonder why the people are still in it?<br><br>Now people, <span style="color: red;">if you are still coming to a decision whether to join a not</span>, be prepared to be able to afford and lose the capital. And don't blame anyone else because many of us have shared our experiences in here and <span style="color: green;">ITS YOU WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BELIEVE US</span>.<br><br>And those who are still considering to do the refund, forget about it. I rather keep the goods and not let KENNETH WONG recycle the stock and use them on another victim. And anyway, since I am only able to get back 20% of what I have invested excluding the promotional items which are strictly no refund.<br><br>To those who still in it... I have got nothing to say... You guys are TOO STUBBORN. If you still got the heart, leave the others alone and start living your own life!</strong></div>
