Too bad i bought the products for the 'Bel' Air experience' (a diffuser, 10 litres of oil and some pure essential oil crap).<br><br>actually come to think of it, something very fishy. i bought the product but havent paid him mah. i told him i'll meet him in town to pass him the cash. then last minute he asked me to meet him in commonwealth to transact...<br><br>ended up i transfer the money into his posb account. i told him, no more boon keng or commonwealth for me hahaha.<br><br>Its a really good learning experience for me.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">So anyone got a long time friend asking you to meet at boon keng or commonwealth for a game, be careful hor...</span><br><br>Friend's duke name... hmm... you got PM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My english is teruk, hope every one of u can understand.<br>Well well is my turn to share about my experience in Bel'air..<br><br>I am malaysian, At the beginning, one of my old friend started call me for tea(coffee bean), and what i knew that time, he is doing about "chinese essential oil" stuff and he quit his engineering job and focus on this carrier. So i wonder why he can quite his engineering job and right now can do this kind of business. At that time i thought that was very good oppurtunity if i can involve in it.<br><br>So next time having tea again in CB, he introduced his friend to me, his friend older than me 1 yr, drive a mercedes car (not big small eyes, that abit old fashion one), my friend kept impressing me that he can drive such a car, and he has so so many car and so so... so..start talking with him again, he analize that current carrier trend, current economy situation and so so....mmm...whatever he said, normally i have to agree with him and nod nod my head. So, this really let me feel curious about it, how can he so successful..and so rich.<br><br>So i went to do my international passport and intend to see sg to see whehter what kind of thing they do..and can be so financially freedom. At first i think about that is direct selling, i kept asking about what they do, but they denied to tell me. so after i reach commenwealth,i saw lot of nice car at outside of their office, my friend told me some of them only do for 2 month and  they brought me to their stockie. oh...those are essential oil thing and those "stage".<br>They ask me to attend their talk, arh then i saw many ppl carry their essential oil and those aromatherapy thing. Em so i have to listen to their talk, and i kno w this is kind of MLM thing, i really do not interest about it. and i felt really headache after the event, actually i intend to back, but since i saw many old friend there, so ..after that we went for tea loh. arh..the Mercedes guy come tell me a lot of thing again..as if what other has shown b4 those policy. actually that time i don have any idea about it..but he can talk for few hours bla bla much thing loh.<br><br>After the tea was about 1 something, so i went back with my friend in yuo chu kang, arh..the place he stay really very narrow, not well tidied and so so..<br>the second day morning, they have meeting, so i do follow him to BON LAY, well well..that time my idea is to see see how they have meeting. em..so i think some one hav mention b4, they start crazy dancing b4 they start the talk. Well i can say that the meeting is really wonderful and good, teach u about leadership, how to communicate with others, good education...but then maybe that is kind of brain wash activity.<br><br>Em i only think of how they cut count then can earn it back with in few months? And my friend told me he has already earn back his cost. SO for sure i will ask them how they do it after cut count. The answer i got was "Just u cut the count , then follow our system, we well teach u how to do, it is no point right now u step into out system b4 u cut count."  Well, i can say that , this is a good business oppurtunity, but then not suitable for me, because i don have extra money to do it. Well, but they kept on asking me to borrow from others, or use the current money (my money in back is for my house) and can earn it as soon as possible, whatever financial problem can be solved it easily. That time i do realll think of borrow money from back or whatever inoder to do this business.<br><br>Well, luckily i discuss this with my mum, she strongly disagree with me, and i have to think in annother way. And after i think such a long time, i decide not to do it, and i told my friend. My friend ask me for tea again, another mercedes guy come, they kept brainwashing me again..wow..really thanks god i don have extra money..or else i will step into it.<br><br>Em i do try b4 their essential oil and aroma therapy thing, andwhat i dulan is my friend ask me cut "small plate" and i do not know what his small plate means, and i tell him i just wan to try some only. Actually i quite regret that i did not ask for the price, and he did not tell me those price as well. He is very passionate to take those stuff for me teach me how to use. That time what i got is a stage, 5L , and some bottle of essential oil. So i ask my friend give me the bill, wow..it shock me that cost me about RM2xxx...money is not the matter, but then those thing i think not really worth that and those thing are really expensive. NOw i wonder, is my mistake not to ask for the price b4 i take those thing from him..ai~...so i pay him Rm200 monthly, sometimes i don have extra to i don pay him..haha, as i think so he so rich. my case just small matter..so he wont mind about it.<br><br>And right now he always call meand i avoid his call (from februart till now guah), even sometimes he use another phone to call me, and i picked it accidentally, he non stop talking again, ask me go to what event and so so...even he ask me go for SAT D&amp;D, and event at night, come on, that D&amp;D need money 1, so lucky i din go and really so lucky i have found this forum.<br>well, that all is what i share for every one, next time i will share about, how they date ppl..how they communicate with ppl<br><br></div>

So i wonder why he can quite his engineering job and right now can do this kind of business. At that time i thought that was very good oppurtunity if i can involve in it.<br><br>So next time having tea again in CB, he introduced his friend to me, his friend older than me 1 yr, drive a mercedes car (not big small eyes, that abit old fashion one), my friend kept impressing me that he can drive such a car, and he has so so many car and so so... so..start talking with him again, he analize that current carrier trend, current economy situation and so so....mmm...whatever he said, normally i have to agree with him and nod nod my head. So, this really let me feel curious about it, how can he so successful..and so rich.<br><br>So i went to do my international passport and intend to see sg to see whehter what kind of thing they do..and can be so financially freedom. At first i think about that is direct selling, i kept asking about what they do, but they denied to tell me. so after i reach commenwealth,i saw lot of nice car at outside of their office, my friend told me some of them only do for 2 month and  they brought me to their stockie. oh...those are essential oil thing and those "stage".<br>They ask me to attend their talk, arh then i saw many ppl carry their essential oil and those aromatherapy thing. Em so i have to listen to their talk, and i kno w this is kind of MLM thing, i really do not interest about it. and i felt really headache after the event, actually i intend to back, but since i saw many old friend there, so ..after that we went for tea loh. arh..the Mercedes guy come tell me a lot of thing again..as if what other has shown b4 those policy. actually that time i don have any idea about it..but he can talk for few hours bla bla much thing loh.<br><br>After the tea was about 1 something, so i went back with my friend in yuo chu kang, arh..the place he stay really very narrow, not well tidied and so so..<br>the second day morning, they have meeting, so i do follow him to BON LAY, well well..that time my idea is to see see how they have meeting. em..so i think some one hav mention b4, they start crazy dancing b4 they start the talk. Well i can say that the meeting is really wonderful and good, teach u about leadership, how to communicate with others, good education...but then maybe that is kind of brain wash activity.<br><br>Em i only think of how they cut count then can earn it back with in few months? And my friend told me he has already earn back his cost. SO for sure i will ask them how they do it after cut count. The answer i got was "Just u cut the count , then follow our system, we well teach u how to do, it is no point right now u step into out system b4 u cut count."  Well, i can say that , this is a good business oppurtunity, but then not suitable for me, because i don have extra money to do it. Well, but they kept on asking me to borrow from others, or use the current money (my money in back is for my house) and can earn it as soon as possible, whatever financial problem can be solved it easily. That time i do realll think of borrow money from back or whatever inoder to do this business.<br><br>Well, luckily i discuss this with my mum, she strongly disagree with me, and i have to think in annother way. And after i think such a long time, i decide not to do it, and i told my friend. My friend ask me for tea again, another mercedes guy come, they kept brainwashing me again..wow..really thanks god i don have extra money..or else i will step into it.<br><br>Em i do try b4 their essential oil and aroma therapy thing, andwhat i dulan is my friend ask me cut "small plate" and i do not know what his small plate means, and i tell him i just wan to try some only. Actually i quite regret that i did not ask for the price, and he did not tell me those price as well. He is very passionate to take those stuff for me teach me how to use. That time what i got is a stage, 5L , and some bottle of essential oil. So i ask my friend give me the bill, wow..it shock me that cost me about RM2xxx...money is not the matter, but then those thing i think not really worth that and those thing are really expensive. NOw i wonder, is my mistake not to ask for the price b4 i take those thing from him..ai~...so i pay him Rm200 monthly, sometimes i don have extra to i don pay him..haha, as i think so he so rich. my case just small matter..so he wont mind about it.<br><br>And right now he always call meand i avoid his call (from februart till now guah), even sometimes he use another phone to call me, and i picked it accidentally, he non stop talking again, ask me go to what event and so so...even he ask me go for SAT D&amp;D, and event at night, come on, that D&amp;D need money 1, so lucky i din go and really so lucky i have found this forum.<br>well, that all is what i share for every one, next time i will share about, how they date ppl..how they communicate with ppl<br><br></div></blockquote>Thanks for sharing.<br><br>Ya lor ya lor, your story is almost the same as mine. you lost RM2xxx, I lost S$1000. This so-called friend... haiz, blinded by greed. Actually we should be glad that we manage to wake up and realise all these before we invested further.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
