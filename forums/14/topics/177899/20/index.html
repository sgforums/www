I went to Germany lately, just came back (world cup fever).

I asked her if they are used in aromatherapy, she said they are air fresheners... perfumes...<br><br>I think either the Germans have very cheap products, or Bel' Air and Lampe Berger mark up the price. If these companies are MLMs, shouldn't they be cheaper than market price? Since MLMs 'bypass' middlemen (they do not need wholesalers, retail shops...)???<br><br>And why the Europeans call them air fresheners??? Makes me want to laugh at either the Europeans, or the Singaporeans pushing these products. And I think I know which group to laugh at.</div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">Ya, in Chinese is called Ya Ge Dan, as Bel'Air head office is Taiwan and all their education trainning all in Chinese &amp; Manadrin, only partial in English or other as they wanted to promote it as International. The products are from France. In Europe areas, they are using that as air refresheners. But Bel'Air did R&amp;D of their essential oil which come out of 20 different types essential oil research from  Europe, Asian etc... plants oil. As they claimed their products are good and go thru R&amp;D by their Taiwanese well-known professors hence are expensive as the products are very good "medicine". And they do claimed if you see Bel'Air products in the retail market and it much cheaper, it illegal to those high ranks, senior associates &amp; the company and they'll banned the distributors as the member whose had sneak it to sell.

During the early 1900's, it was marketed to French institutions where hygiene was most important such as hospitals and mortuaries. At that time the lamps used methyl alcohol which gave off formaldehyde on combustion. It was efficient but smelled unpleasant.<br><br>In 1927, Maurice Berger sold the company to Jean-Jacques Faillot. He changed to ethyl alcohol which has the scent of Apples on combustion. This change moved Lampe Berger into the consumer market. Faillot began collaborating with great bottle designers of the period including Galle, Lalique, Baccarat, Saint-Louis, Sabino and Tharaud. In the 1930's sales reached approximately 20,000 lamps a year. Exports began, but had mixed success. Many failed because ozoalcohol was considered a perfume product and was taxed as a luxury item.<br><br>Lampe Berger suffered during WWII. Faillot died in October 1940 as a result of wounds he received when he was knocked down by German military vehicle in Paris. His son, Gilbert, succeeded him. To further the companies problems, raw materials became almost unobtainable, and then the factory was damaged by bombing in 1943. Following the war, production began gradually since raw materials were still difficult to find. The war resulted in a lower standard of living, therefore production of luxury crystal models were abandoned and the porcelain and earthenware models were created.<br><br>By 1973, Lampe Berger was producing 80,000 lamps per year And the company was sold to the retired industrialist, Marcel Auvrey. His son Philippe took over in 1989 and in 1992 he set up the first Lampe Berger subsidiary in New York. In 1998, Lampe Berger began the prestigious signature line of lamps by famous designers. They also began using new materials such as enamel, pewter and opaline.<br></span><br><br>Anyone know what happened after that? If it was once the French's proud history, and it shows up like this especially in Singapore and other Asian countries, I think that Maurice Berger is now turning in his grave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, i am new to tis forum and MLM also. Recently when to Bel'air for their talk. After seeing their marketing plan, i really questioned whether their marrketing plan is legal. Anyone here who knows the law in Singapore very well who can help clear my queries.<br><br>1. They are concentrating on recruiting people (they claim they are doing human franchising. They are not looking for salesman or delivery man, hence they do not need to sell their product, they are doing wholesale business by distributing their products to new recruitment.) To me, it seems that they are not interested in promoting their products by selling it to others even though they claimed that their products are superb, great and explosive in the market. So is it legal? They are not selling the products to others, they are only selling the products to new recruits (distributors). So all the income(sales) come from recruiting people. To me, their products is just a tool to make them look legal. They are actually selling their system(marketing plan).<br><br>2. Does anyone check the price of their products. From their marketing plan, they seems to make the price of their product very high to earn more. This is what i understand from their presentation, kindly correct me if there are any misunderstanding. To be a count, u buy 15k worth of product but given 20% discount by paying 12K. By recruiting one count, you get 18% of the 15k and a total of 13.5% of the 15k given to six generation upline. So 31.5% of the 15K (4725) is given out to the network. They claim their company"s payout to the network is 70% of their profit. For every sales of 12k products(after discount), 70% profit = $4725 so their total profit is about 7k, that is only true provided the company's claims of 70% profit given out to the network is true and that doesnt include the 3k discount. If the discount is taken into consideration for every 15k sales of product, their profit is about 10k (triple their cost price). I dont believe the company will only take 30% of the porfit. So they r selling their products at a very high price, at twice the cost price or even more. Is this legal?<br><br>When i question them, whether their business is legal. They used their sponsorship to NDP as a prove that they are legal as the government is very strict in choosing the sponsor for NDP moreover they are the main sponsor this year. Hope to get reply soon to clear my queries. Thank.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>they still have 1+5 strategy. but didnt hear anything about 1+15 b4.<br><br>They are damn good at brainwashing others. I was thinking to join them after attending consecutive sessions until the last session that present their marketing plan. That is when i realise their marketing plan is not what i want to do to achieve my dreams. I dont want to use those money earn through this way. It is just not ethical.<br><br>I walked off after that session and told my friend i am not interested but he still want me to attend more sessions to clarify my doubts saying that i will regret if i missed this great opportunity. Know they still want to brainwash me, in the end i scolded my friend that those money is not what i want and ask him to wake up and consider quitting but he has been brainwashed thinking that he is helping others to earn big money(just an excuse to lie to himself that what he is doing is actually not ethical).<br><br>How come the police is not doing anything to stop this kind of operation, brainwashing people, misleading people that they are helping others to earn money when they themselves have been cheated without themselves knowing it. Maybe MPs can try letting residents more aware of MLM or at least let everyone know this forum where they can get help if they encounter anyone asking them to join MLM.<br><br>Now once anyone suddenly ask me out for meal, i will know that 50% chances he has join MLM and is trying to recruit me in.

Every tuesday and Thursday they will be there to bring new targets(friends) to see their products, and show that they are the main sponsor of NDP and the awards they got. After the presentation, they will go to a nearby hawker centre where they try to brainwash you again.<br><br>HHH is the training centre of AAA where they have activities conducted there. To what i observed, every Wed is the day they invite people to play the cashflow game. Monday, Friday and Sat or even Sunday, they have other presentation to show more abt bel'air and at the same time brainwash you.<br><br>Basically, after every session or presentation, they will have a one to one talk with you, a Marquis will talk to you brainwashing you why you should join the company.<br><br>To me their so call business is to recruit people, their daily job is just to find targets for their network and try to convince(brainwash) people to join the company. What kind of job is this? What service does it provide? No product selling, no service to the society? Everything they do, there is a motive to convince people to join the network. Sponsoring NDP to claim that they are recognised by the government, conduct seminar claiming to educate their associates but truth is to brainwash everyone who attend the seminar.</div>

At most it is 68% now as grand Dukes left. 70% payout looks very attractive, but after some study, it may mean that someone is paying for the 6 levels of middemen who will get some profit share and some with few thousands paycheque (* may not worth the investment *)<br><br>Yes, they were the sponsor for NDP and NKF shows previously - it's official.<br><br>It may be legal, but not necessary ethical.<br><br>I believe they have stop the 1+5 and 1+15 strategies and move back to just a count strategy. BA use to have three main groups, but I think one big group is now fractured as their charismatic Duke left. Interestingly, this group did not practise the 1+5 and 1+15 thing.<br><br>Those groups adopted the 1+5 and 1+15 may also have exhausted their resources.<br><br>I do not think they have much room to play with in sg.<br><br></div></blockquote>Concerned_man welcome back. One group  down and two to go. The 2 remaining groups are AAA and Scentalite ? It would be great if this particular Duke left because he is pricked by conscience and deserve no sympathy if he left because recruitment is drying up. Have you got any information why he left? 5 figures income, you know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Why the government or police is not doing anything?</div></blockquote>Because Bel'Air is a "Good Corporate Citizen" by sponsoring NDP and NKF. I am bewildered too !!!! Perhaps, there will only be actions when tradegy strucks. Singapore prides itself as a country having very strict laws but I would vehemently disagree  when it comes to enforcing the MLM Acts. I cannot imagine a company like AAA/Bel'Air is allowed to operate for so long when they are clearly operating a disguised pyramid scheme.<br><br>Quick to clamp down on massage parlour when tradegy happened but nothing seems to be done about Bel'Air <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
