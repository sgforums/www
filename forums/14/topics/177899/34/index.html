            <div class='col-md body'>Another Thread to read before joining<br>By IronBandit  On  31 August 2006 Â· 01:51 PM<br><blockquote> have my fair share of MLM a.k.a Pyramid System. I take you all back to 1995-1997 remember No.1 Products. I was quite young at that time and worked part time at a supermarket store earning a few hundred per week.<br><br>One of my idiot friend got me into listern to No.1 product and say about their magnatic bed have improve health functinos and stuff and count myself lucky I bought one thinking it would be good for my mom for health reason. Lucky that was during CNY and they had a rebate lucky draw and I got the $1888 draw and the bed cost was $1280 so lucky me got a bed and $600. (Suckers lost a bed and $600 to me).Being inmuture and easily psychoed I thought I got a good deal. They even gave me a cheapo members card.<br><br>Soon after I got called up for NS and stuff. 2 years down the road when I ORD my officer called me up trying to sell me another bed another company this time round I've got my experience with me and being firm in my decision. No mean No and more over I've one bed already why would I need to buy another one.<br><br>A few months ago I too had another friend that joined BEL AIR and made it... He asked me and brought me to the commonwealth place to listern I find it a baloni and BS. The speaker was a ex-DJ. No doubt his presentation was great but once bitten twice shy. So out of friendship and goodwill i got the cheapest lamp and a liquid... its still full and the lamp is unused.<br><br>Now my brother-in-law is sucked into NTI. Selling women's undergarment (Lu Mi Mi ) which by the way was sold by No.1 Products about a decade ago and where is No.1 product? Gone!!! can't be found anywhere. All these young people have no idea what business is about. Have not even step into working live and want to teach people twice their age about business. My dear brother-in-law... wake up and smell the coffee... have soemone to pay for your university fees go and study and get a good honors grade don't waste your time at NTI playing know it all and selling undergarment to old women and neglecting your studies. I have to work and pay for my own university studies and study part time so difficult and tired.<br><br>Sorry that was personal... Anyway don't admire the people having office there they are at the top of the food chain. You are at the bottom and always will be. You are working so hard so that these people can fuel their car they drive... sleep on the bed and house they buy.<br><br>Based on their model you need to have at least 20 to 30 generations of downlinks and them to have thier own to be able to have an office there and make those flowery speeches. Think how many people you need to lure into the same boat you sit in and you might not know when the boat may sink<br><br>MLM or Pyramid System companies will always be around. These companies work only on one expect of human nature "GREED" as Money is the root of all evil.<br><br>Think about it, all of these MLM companies be it NTI, No.1 Products, BEL AIR, Amway, always promise a high pay without working just recruit peoplr will do. Nice car. Nice house. Frequent Holidays to the listerners. How many of the people asking you to join have them? Why are they always so eager to "help" you succeed? Cause if you don't join they can't afford their Car...House...Holiday...or their monthly expenses.<br><br>I work in a 8am to 530pm job earning about $3500... I own a car... have platinum cards offer to me by banks but I rejected I only need one for emergencys. If I join in their crazy party I'll just have to slog out even more after work and might get nothing in return.<br><br>When I sit down to these people at these talks and psycho session I ask them a few questions<br>1. How long have you been doing this? (some say: 1 year or so)<br>2. Have you achieve a car yet? (Some reply: not yet but I'm getting there)<br>3. I own a car does it mean i'm more successful than you? (Common Replies: Blank Blank try to talk about something else).<br>4. Is your earnings taxable? (Common replies : Blank again)<br>5. If not taxable then in future how I apply for Credit Card? (Replies: Blank Blank again)<br><br>If you are there you can ask them these questions too listen to their reply and if they change the subject. Cause they can't convince you they will confuse you. Stay sharp and firm. You have a choice the money is in your pocket, they can't take it if you do not want to give it. If they do take without you approval its robbery. Another tactic is if they offer you goods for trial ask for a signed letter that these are free and for trial make sure it comes with a company letter head. Don't touch just see the item you never know if they will pull a fast one on you. In shopping center rules are once broken considered sold in MLM companies once touched considered sold. Like my experience in BEL AIR keep pushing things for me to buy I said NO they keep insisting and outcome walk away come back later sit down and say I only want this that and that end. Nothing more you want to give me at your own cost cause I wouldn't pay as I've no money to pay for the rest.<br><br>You people that are in MLM Companies and thinking of joining. Listen up: The only way to success is by hard work and a bit of luck. By asking people to invest 14k or 10k or what ever amount pls don't make real investers laugh...<br><br>If you really want to succeed<br>1. Saving 1/10 of your every monthly pay for a year or two.<br>2. Ask people that really succeed to help you invest. ( This is the difficult part so luck play a part to know such people and by saying that I don't mean Jackie "NTI boss" or other MLM boss. I mean those SME bosses you should look at them)<br>3. If not put your savings in bank that money goes in easily and take out very hard.<br>4. Don't be hasty in investing ask for 2nd or 3rd or 4th opinion as many as pos from people in the industry you intend to invest. (E.G. you are not going to as a pork seller if today's fish are fresh and nice right)<br>5. Don't regret if you invest wrongly but you must remember your mistake and learn from it and don't repeat it again.<br>6. But in any case if your investment does come out right make your investment's children(returns) make more childrens and make all these children create more children and make all your children(returns) work for you and in time to come 4-5yrs you will made it.<br><br>Your money is hard to earn, keep it for rainy days and opportunity that comes along. If you are not sure always remember these few things: "You are in control, Your money is YOUR MONEY, You don't owe anyone of them S**T, No means NO, Walk away and keep your money"<br><br>Be smart, stay cool you all .<br><br>Cheers<br>IronBandit<br></blockquote>How I wish that i had read this forum B4 i join n left belair<br><br>Y am i still sharing my experince because Paying It Forward is not about 1 day,1wk ,1mth, 1 yr .

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Unfair:</div><div class="quote_body">Let me share how i woke up from the nightmare<br><br>(1) You must let them listening to your phone conversation between you and your friend<br><br>(2) Why all the successful upline leave the place? only new member and old old member are still inside. where are those in  between?<br><br>(3) They treat us as as idiot. They told us to be simple, simple and simple. They control our life. We can't go home earlier, we must attend everyday, we must go there everyday. Some time, upline will call us to rush down even though they knew they will leave after you reach for 5min. (just want your appearance there only, to let freshmen see that your group are so strong)<br><br>(4)The speech by speakers are getting worse. They exaggerate a lot of things which are not true......like " i apply the oil for 1 day, my 10 year wound scar was hardly seen", then they will say, is up to you if you believe, but that's true.............., everyone who stays below the stage will agree to make you agree...........do you think we are idiot<br><br><span class="large">(5) During the Hui Hou Hui, Actually everything are planned. Like a few months ago, a new potential Huo Ban bring her mum here.........In order to cheap her mum, they "randomly" chose a few person to answer interview by speakers.....................surprisingly, they all said that they joined b'cos they want to let their parents to retire, their dreams are to fulfil their parents' dream, ..........but i saw that they are told to say so before the Hui Hou Hui. .............just to cheat the parents of potential customer ..................Cheap Cheap Cheap and Disgusting.......</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">(6) Lastly, This is most important!<br>They forced my potential Customer to sell car, to take loan from insurance, relative and ..... even though they knew that he need earnings to support his family.........how cruel they are! They even asked potential huoban to keep it from his parents, dun let his parents know................. HOW BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!</span><br><br>SO, I WOKED UP....................I JUST CAN'T STAND THE WAY THEY CHEAT OTHERS..................</div></blockquote>Hi UnFair,<br><br>We all know how u feel. From wat u have mentioned,  i guest you were from the most inhuman group - Diron's Group. His style is " die die ask ppl to cut count/CM to feed him" n after u cut count / C.M, he will say when your mind set is correct then you only can come in "the operation" otherwise ask u to go back and think - WTF.<br><br>For everyone information,  alot of M from his team have left.  He had sold his Condo quite sometime. If a duke can make big $$$, why he needs to sell his condo. He is a big liar  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Glad that you have woke up &amp; start a fresh life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"></span><span style="color: indigo;"></span><strong><br>Sorry since i left belair, i have throw all things related to it, including pics taken. Therefore, i do not have pics of the past ARch duke. In fact, in belair, it is impossible to be an Arch duke. Just the challenging volume, it needs to be 400 million or 4000 million (in taiwan currency).<br><br>Give a few quotes, last year there are two challenging Arch Duke in Taiwan and one or two in China. Till now, none has achieved that status yet! Why? Cos there are not enough dummy dukes yet.<br><br>Let me share with you my two cents worth of thoughts of Chairman Huang:<br><br>1) Six or more years back, he try to implement the status of Count to be common. meaning many ppl to cut count. Therefore, he say Count is a good position where most of the ppl who wants to do biz, can come in as Count...(His purpose is to create more Marquis....wait pls see later part why he does that)...<span style="color: red;"></span></strong>[b]and so HUANG got what he wants...more than 70% of the international network go crazy about cutting counts everywhere...thinking that being a marquis can earn 5 figure income! SIAo!<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"></span>2) NOw since counts is so common, last year 2005, he strategise his plans to create DUKE! To be a duke, u must have alot of marquis. Therefore, he start to give a good idea to teach his ppl to tell the rest about the 1+5 or 1+15 position...after he did that, BINGO! yes! there are more empty marquis (without knowledge and skills!) NOW!!! Who have suffered the most?! And Chairman Huang is so smart, since marquis is already so common...he increase the maintenance fee to 90000PV ($5000 sing)...HAHA! He claim that this can motivate the marquis to open up new Count line to have the ability to challenge for DUKE...F**K off! Can you imagine how much has he earn?<br><br><span style="color: green;"></span>3) Look at what happen now!!! No successful Arch Duke at all. I have a Duke friend in Taiwan (who complete her duke status in just one month in June 2005), SHE HAS LEFT TOO! Her aggressive Challenging Arch Duke has left too...cos she herself know that she do not want to be a chess, it is impossible to be a full qualified ARCH DUKE! Mind you, these people i know are really very good qualities...NOW TAIWAN, is also very low in morale. Sigh! there are so many hidden things that we dun know...<br><br>How about Singapore? The dukes in AAA, i can tell you, all of them uses scheming plans and uses all their fortunes, parents, relative fortunes to be where there are!! They are just empty Dukes in name only! Really....<br><br></div>

If YOU are reading this, Just to let you know that Your dad was actually spending his time crying in the ward. Your parents are not young anymore. Seriously, what Your parents want is to see you spending time with them and NOT making 'empty' promises to give them that and give them this. Ask yourselves, how much time you have spent with your group? And how much time you have spent with them? Your parents are not putting a strong front not because they want to... They just do not want to make YOU upset and worried. But see how much you care for them! You guys were not like this before. What has changed you? Stop questioning and complaining about how the people who left has changed that worse. Its the change that you people made which turned them away. Please wake up especially Nel*on. You are Not a parasite. Its time you stand on your own feet and decide for yourself the road that you are going to take!

I think most of the people who have seen Bel' Air's true work also feels the same way as you, and even those who are still inside. Hope those people who are in Bel' Air are able to judge for themselves when they read this. Only themselves can make the decision.<br><br>Everyone has their moments of folly, but to learn from mistakes is what living is all about. Hope you will recoup your financial, trust and relationship losses soon. Time heals all wounds.<br><br>Believe me, complaints against Bel' Air had been lodged, to CAD. But too bad, they did not take any actions. All the conning that Bel' Air are using are really well hidden from the media and public. They hide the pyramid scheme by using the products as a cover. What really puzzles me is that their way of recruiting, and asking people to 'cut count', is really just creating a virtual network. In that case, it is really illegal, as the MLM act state that creating a virtual network is not in accordance with the guidelines. Anyone can help with that? Anyone try letting the media know?<br><br>Let your friends, families and relatives know about this company and forum, 'Pay it forward'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , and soon everyone will be aware of it. Let the company die a slow and painful death, if the authorities cannot help us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HI Good Morning, This my 1st time in this post. I find this post very interesting, why?<br>I can not understand why so many of u r willing to take out $12K of ur hard earn money and do a maintaince of $5K every mth.<br>Jz bcos some ppl promised u a 5 figure income in 3 mth, if u follow the system?<br><br>If I have this kind of money. Well, I will get a very good fund manager, invest the initial $12K and top up $5K every mth. Most of the good fund manager can fetch u a good accumulated of 30% return in two years.<br><br>So 12K + (5K X 23) = $127K x 130% = $165.1K - $127K = $38K<br><br>In MLM the main idear is to enable ppl with very little start-up capital to run their so call home business.<br>So if u need so much money to start-up must well start a traditional business...... The fried prawn mee uncle every mth oso can earn 5 figure.<br><br>MLM is abt duplicating n leveraging, so wat made u so sure ur fren or relative can come out with tat kind of $ to buy ur idear.<br><br>So whose the gulity one, Its not the company, the speaker of tat night, the product, not even the ppl tat bring u there.<br><br>ITS YOU, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT COURSE ALL THIS. THE GREED OF BEING SUCCESSFUL USING THE SHORT CUT. IF U R NOT GREEDY U WILL NOT FALL INTO A TRAP LIKE THIS.<br><br>Plsea take some time look at my post A Job, A biz and MLM. The england may be a bit lousy but tats may 5 cent experience.</div>

Most of them choose to buy Marquis lines instead of opening new Count line.

So what give them the right to tag you, as Â¡Â°WRONG MINDSETÂ¡Â±??? Is it just because they are Duke??? But donÂ¡Â¯t forget that they can become Duke is because everyone take out money to buy them the position.<br><br>Piece of advice for those who are still in there and following this forum, ask yourself this<br>question. If the people you believe in have been going against their word, can you still believe them?<br><span class="normal"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
