            <div class='col-md body'>NM or MLM is a workable business model if you have a large sum of capital for its growth and existence. Time, efforts and money would be greatly required to succeed in this business that requires ethical and consultative approach.<br><br>However, most people are overtaken by their own greed and expectation. What you see is the application of 80/20 rule where sponsors focus only on downlines who are strong in their sales or recruitment growth. It is a valid approach because not many of us can succeed in this business.<br><br>We have to ask ourselves if this business upholds our value, belief, and ethics when dealing with people, products and business. Otherwise, it is not your cup of tea/coffee to begin. There would be conflict of expectation, betrayals of friendship/kinship, and so forth as highlighted by the previous contributors of this post.<br><br>The key factor is determine whether such company is running a pyramid marketing based on recruitment rather than product selling.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, the easiest way to tell the difference from a proper MLM and a pyramid selling is.<br>1)Proper MLM's products could easily be sold in the direct market at the same price as thru MLM. Eg if a company decides to sell a slimming product (similar to extrim etc etc) thru retailers instead of MLM, it would be at the same price. Pyramid selling products on the other hand are over priced and could never be sold effectively thru direct channel. Only way to suceed is to con people to join, sell hope and overpriced product at same time. Ask yourself whether would people buy some expensive aroma products (even more expensive than CK, Polo fragrances {considered luxury products} if they see it for sale in CK Tang etc etc.<br><br>2)second is the strong emphasis on recruitment (heavy start-up cost eg 13K for Count in Bel Air) New Distributors have to bear heavy entry cost to join business. Disincentified to join at lower levels.<br><br>3)they will often brag about the income potential of people doing the business (eg dukes making easily 500K yearly) Marquis (180K) and Count (80K), they often miss out on giving real evidence proof eg IR8A form (IRAS return form stating income). IRAS should really check on the incomes of these so called top distributors (Maybe some tax evasion or misrepresentation) They also fail to provide proof of average return of distributors and will based their presentation on the words of a few to mislead the audience.<br><br>We need people who have been victimised or who feels strongly against unethical and illegal pyramid selling to step up and report their complaints and greviences with the relevant authorities. Only with the action of the public would people who commit wrong be rightfully punished (remember NKF).<br>The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) investigates pyramid selling schemes. If you suspect a scheme has contravened the MLM Act, you can report to the CAD at telephone number 3250000 or lodge a report at 391 New Bridge Road, #06-701 Block D, Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore 088762.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>What is Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) and Pyramid Selling?<br><br>A Multi-Level Marketing or Pyramid Selling scheme will typically require participants to pay an upfront charge. In return, the participants are promised financial rewards for each additional participant recruited, as well as all new participants who are in turn brought in by their recruits - hence the pyramid-like structure.<br>As more salespersons are recruited, participants hope to recover their upfront charges and earn sizeable profits. However, such a pyramid schemes will eventually collapse when they run out of new recruits, resulting in those salespersons at the bottom of the pyramid losing all their upfront charges.<br>In the interest of consumer protection, the Government's regulation effort is targeted at preventing the proliferation of such high-risk schemes.<br><br>2. How do I recognise a pyramid selling scheme?<br><br>Many pyramid schemes often disguise themselves as sellers collectors' items, software, training programmes, etc, when all they are interested is to make a quick buck through recruitment. Members of the public who attend sales talks must be vigilant to such schemes. Illegitimate MLM schemes usually share the following characteristics:<br><span style="color: red;">When the promoter hype about how easy it is to earn money, people can get very rich in a very short time and that the way to earn money is by recruiting others to join the scheme;<br>The so-called product that you are supposed to sell is not something you would normally buy at its price;</span>Participants are required to invest money into the scheme, whether in the form of a joining fee, or buying inventory. Remember - there is no easy money, you must believe in what you are selling and you should not put your money at unnecessary risk.<br><br>3. How are MLM activities governed in Singapore?<br><br>MLM activities in Singapore are governed by the Multi-level Marketing and Pyramid Selling(Prohibition) Act. The Ministry of Trade and Industry administers the Act.<br><br>The original Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act was first passed in 1973. In June 2000, Parliament approved an amendment to the Act to widen the definition of pyramid selling to catch all business schemes that were multi-level in nature.<br><br>However, as not all multi-level marketing techniques are undesirable, the Government concurrently enacted the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order (hereafter, referred to as the Â¡Â®Exclusion Order) to exclude legitimate businesses from the Act, such as insurance companies, master franchises, and direct selling companies which fulfill certain criteria. This Exclusion Order was implemented in June 2000.<br><br>However, it also introduced the following rules for direct selling companies:<br>Safeguards - A participant cannot be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to become a participant in the scheme, other than the purchase of demonstration equipment which is not for resale, at no more than cost price and for which no commission can be given out. A legitimate multi-level marketing scheme would not impose a financial risk on salespersons. For example, salespersons should be entitled to full refunds, under reasonable commercial terms, for any inventories kept or purchased by them which are not sold to end consumers, so long as the inventories are returned within a period of 60 days.<br>Behavioural checks - The companies must not misrepresent the scheme as get-rich-quick opportunities, and should not use fraud, coercion, harassment, or unconscionable means to force people to join the scheme. Instead, the companies should focus their efforts on promoting the quality and features of the products. If a company wishes to show potential participants the earning potential, they must keep records of the maximum, minimum, mean, mode and median earnings of their salespeople in the past.<br>Sharing of commission - It is all right for a salesperson to share commissions from several layers of salespersons recruited by him. However, such commissions must be generated by sale of the product or service in question, and not through the recruitment of additional participants into the scheme.<br>[During the review of the MLM Act in Year2000, the fines were raised from $30,000 to $200,000. Currently, a conviction under the Act will result in a fine of up to $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or to both. The fines are for the following offences:[/b] 	promoting or participating in a multi-level marketing, or pyramid selling, scheme or arrangement.<br>registering a business which is designed to promote multi-level marketing, or pyramid selling, scheme or arrangement.<br>registering a company which proposes to promote multi-level marketing, or pyramid selling, scheme or arrangement.<br>In addition, the Act empowers a Court that convicts a promoter or participant of a multi-level marketing or pyramid selling an additional penalty of an amount not exceeding the amount or value of any benefit which the promoter or participant has received. This additional penalty ensures that the Act serves as an effective deterrent to potential offenders.<br><br></div>

If many are disgusted with their presentation materials after attending the seminars, it says a lot about the company. Just attend the seminars and you will be convinced the company is recruitment driven and not product focus. I was agnast when they promote the "1+5" &amp; "1+15" investment schemes. Are they still on "offer" or there are more innovative get rich promotions?<br><br>Hope more who have attended the seminars conducted by Bel'Air will share their experience.</div>

Did he treat you lunch at Fullerton Hotel or anything ?<br><br>I think all that needs to be said has been said. So far there's been a lot of negativity about Bel'air. Yet there's no agent from the company to help defend it's reputation, at least down here. Don't get me wrong. Im anti-Belair. But i'll explain some things on what they say sounds unbelievable. There must be a reason why some ppl continued to stay in Belair even though a lot of negativity has been poured onto them. It has to be the money of cos.<br><br>Actually Bel'air's so-called ''strategy'' is not to be a ''salesman'' but selling Counts to potential downlines. That's their sales pitch. They want you to believe you are  doing a big business under the pretext of entrepreneurship. Actually, it's possible to earn $60k if you have overseas downlines, especially mainland Chinese. The mainland Chinese are generally very hardworking and shrewd people.<br><br>I have heard of people travelling to China and liase with overseas contacts and build their downlines there, setting up a big stockist centre containing the products and selling them like a traditional business. How well the upline earns depends on how much the sales volume is for that month.<br><br>But it's a delicate balance of managing ppl in China and Singapore. Generally speaking, it's better to establish a network in Singapore before going overseas. If you do the latter, u can find instability in your network foundation becos you do have to constantly monitor the progress overseas. Besides you have to keep teaching them how to conduct the business. That's the reason why Belair agents will tell you that it's an entrepreneurial business and you can earn a lot of money. In short Belair's selling point is that it allows you to do business anywhere, achieve your sales volume and still earn Sing dollars relative to the sales volume, theoretically speaking.<br><br>If you look at Bel'air's compensation plan, generally speaking, how much you earn is based on how many Counts you have 'cut', so u will be promoted faster and theoretically 'earn' more. Example: Cut more '1+5s' which is like 300k sing dollars, so you will be promoted faster to marquis, THEORETICALLY speaking.<br><br>It's a neverending business.  Like any business, there's a possibility that your network can collapse if you don't manage your team well, especially your frontlines. Dukes sometimes have to look for potential partners.<br><br></div>

HAHA</div></blockquote>Haha, I think your 'friend' is about as 'honest' as my friend, income of 5 digit my ass.<br><br>If i got an income of 5 digit,<br><br>1)	I will not take MRT to Commonwealth (Bel'Air HQ). Just flag a taxi, so simple and don't have to squeeze for space on the train. (And how much really does 	it cost? 10 dollars tops? what is it if one is earning 5 digit income haha.)<br><br>2)	I will go to Fullerton Hotel for a 5-star dinner to bait my friends to join (my friend treated me one BBQ chicken wing, seriously).<br><br>3)	I will give up my day job (my friend is still a salesperson in some electronic store), why bother to face your boss, have fixed working hours, and still 	get f'ed left, right, up, down,center, when you can just attend seminars, workshops, speeches (and whatever they throw at you) on how to use a 	aromatherapuetic lamp.<br><br>4)	I will not be desperately looking for people to 'join' this 'business opportunity'.<br><br>I think the 4 points your friends make needs abit of editing... so here goes:<br><br>1) 	Ability to analyse and spot trends in the world (eg the bird flu can generate a lot of fragrance business)<br><br>Aility to analyse and spot trends in the world, even if Bel'Air really can't fit into the trend, must convince people that it does.<br><br>2) 	Must love money<br>Must love money , but in this business you have to cheat your family, friends and relatives and ask them to fish out a 'low risk investment' of 12k so 	they can have the chance to love more money<br><br>3) 	Must be ambitious so that one is willing to fork out time<br>Must be ambitious so that one is willing to fork out time to listen to brainwashing talks, trainings, collecting stocks, going to HQ (commonwealth on 	weekends) and training centre (Boon Keng on weekdays) i think, every 7 pm, , not too sure. And of course no transport provided.<br><br>4) 	(i forgot)<br>Maybe along the lines of 'after you sign the documents, you are on your own, if your friends/family don't want to fork out 12k, there is nothing we can 	do, just make sure u collect the 12k worth of lamp goods (i heard lamps similar to Bel'Air, Lampe Berger, is available on the market at 10% of Bel'Air 	selling price), and don't ask for refund.'<br><br>Take my example, when I went to some Marquis' house for celebration (he is supposedly earning 5 digit). I looked at his house, almost cannot imagine if he has that kind of income, why don't he do up his shack.<br><br>Like what DKSG said,these friends can really be written off (but disowning family members is a bit drastic).<br><br>Just look at the people doing the Bel' Air business, observe what they really own and do. Of course, they'll psycho you by saying things like how negative people feel about MLMs, how you have to put in alot of hard work prospecting, and that only through perseverance and determination can you earn that type of income. I found out from some anti-mlm websites, that some people do earn these income, but only because they start early, and have plenty of downlines that are striving so hard to survive (to recoup the initial investment), thus giving these few people the high commission.<br><br>People have got to think, if they are earning so much money, where is the source of their money coming from? There must be some poor soul that is buying your product (read: marketing plan), and they are gullible to believe that this is an investment of money that will provide returns of tenfolds.<br><br>Just too bad that no legal investigations are conducted in MlMs like Bel' Air, NTI or whatever company.<br><br>If you believe in what your friend says, then hopefully what he says is really true. Maybe he went overseas and got a major network of distributors going. I've lost 1k in this, but more importantly i lost my trust for my 'friend' (and to think, he used to be quite streetsmart too). This type of friends, I rather not have. Feel so pissed what he took me for.</div>
