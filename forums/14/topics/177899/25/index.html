            <div class='col-md body'>Well i do admit that there are people who succeed in MLM, just as there are people who succeed in Banking, Finance, Politics and all kinds of professions, be it good or bad.<br><br>I also agree that from the beginning, MLM groups, eg AAA does want to help people improve their lives, help people to make more money. I myself have felt the warmth and family feeling when i was there. It was not a pretense... many of the uplines do genuinely want to help, and are there to help.<br><br>However, sad to say, power &amp; money corrupts.. no matter how good their intentions are, their judgement were all clouded by money and success. So much so that they forget their humble beginnings... the story goes: they want you to make money, so in order to do that, you must be a marquis! Whats the faster way to be a marquis? do 1+5 invesment!<br><br>You see what i mean? They are totally obessessed with climbing up the pyramid, to the extent that they use their OWN money to buy the success.. end of the day what they get? Just a useless position... no real strength or depth in their network... in time to come, kaput... all their dreams turn into nightmares... then they will wake up.<br><br><strong>Regarding network marketing</strong>, most of the companies in this part of the world are pretty much pyramid "scheme" trying to market incredibly expensive products to people... nobody will ever buy them... One of the supposed virtues of network marketing is that it eliminates traditional cost of distribution, bringing the products direct to the consumers.. hence cheaper products for the people. However NONE of the MLM products you see in the market now are cheaper then their "conventional" competitors sold in NTUC!<br><br>Where did all these $$$ go? Into the uplines' pockets!<br><br>In order for a MLM network to survive, and for people in it to make money, the products' prices must be SEVERELY marked up.. if not there will not be enough commission for the distributors to survive.. most companies try to go around this "problem" by selling expensive "unique" products that promise incredible benefits... yeah unique products that NOBODY will need in their daily lifes... unless brainwashed of course... if these products are introduced into the mainstream market with their original pricetag, you just see how many people will buy... none i say.<br><br>So my point is that its all a brainwashing scam... design for a few individual to take advantage of other people's ambitions (or greed if you want to view it negatively) to get rich themselves...<br><br>SO DARK THE CON OF MAN!!<br><br></div>
