Want to get out but is already more than 3 months period. Still have a lot of stocks.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Scrutinise the contract you have with Bel'Air for the refund policy. If it is 90 days, there is nothing much you could do now. Just take it as a lesson and do not waste your time recruiting "Count" because the one you recruited will probably end up with unwanted stocks like you.You may recoup some of the investments doing active recruitment but it is outright despicable to put your friend, colleagues or relatives in a spot. If the date is not due yet, under sgforums home page , key "Twincat" or " I am a guest " in search box and you should be able to get answers on how to quit Bel'air.<br><br>For the benefits of those who are seeking the truths, share with us your experience in Bel'Air.<br><br><strong>[b][b]Carrocks, hope you are following the threads.Scorpio76 has done a lot to expose the pyramid scheme.

It should centre its attention on whether Bel'Air is a disguised pyramid that emphasise on the  recruitment of prospects rather than products which is prohibited and illegal under the MLM laws.<br>Like many forumers who have expressed ther views,I have no doubts what Bel'Air represents. CAD just need to attend the investment seminars conducted by Bel' Air to see for themselves whether views expressed in this forums are lies.<br>It is the right time to express your experiences with Bel'Air for the benefits of those who wants to know the truths.</div>

You are then asked to invest the different positions available: Franchisor, Baron, Count, Challenging Marquise etc. The $12K+ investment dwarf the "1+5" or "1+15" investment schemes they promoted last year where "1+15" is really a 5 figures investment( I am not sure whether it is still on "promotion" ).<br><br>Whatever position you invest, the first $1K stocks is payable to your introducer, not Bel'Air.

            <div class='col-md body'>This post does not support nor put down MLM/ Network Marketing. It just presents a Â‘good and badÂ’ viewpoint analysis.<br><br>There are many people out there who have a bad impression of MLM. Perhaps they have had bad experiences or known someone who did not succeed. However, there are always at least two sides to a story. That viewpoint is just the negative viewpoint. It is also true that there are people who have made money and become successful through MLM.<br><br>If MLM was as bad as some people put it, why was it legalized? That is a thinking point. If it was just get-rich-quick scams, it would never have been legalized. (Network Marketing was legalized in 2000 after years of being banned. Pyramid-Selling- a type of scam- however, is banned.)<br><br>Network marketing is being taught in universities across America. If network marketing was just a scam, why would universities have such a course?<br><br>Another interesting thing that I have come across is hear people blatantly say that the structure of MLM is a terrible scam contraption. If those people would just open their eyes, they would realise the biggest Â‘scamÂ’ in the world, would then be all around them- left, right and center. After all, a corporation is in a pyramid shape. In a corporation, the structure is of a pyramid, with the employees below and the CEO sitting right at the top. So then, what exactly is wrong with a pyramid? (By the way, the pyramid is also known to be the most stable structure in the world.)<br><br>In all industries, there are Â‘goodÂ’ companies, and Â‘badÂ’ companies. For example, if you bought a defective bag, would it mean that you would never buy a bag ever again? It is nonsensical to even think of. This is what is happening now. People are getting cheated by scam companies, and some of them have even started to be anti-MLM advocates.<br><br>The natural human instinct is to keep away from things that we donÂ’t know without actually understanding what it is. Instead of putting down an entire industry, perhaps effort should be made to find out if we were erroneous in our thinking. Remember, in some parts of the world, the tomato was originally perceived to be poisonous. This is just another case of perceived poison. It is unfortunate that the MLM industry has had its reputation tarnished, and that an entire industry is black-listed just because of a few rotten apples.<br><br>It is true that there are scam companies and evil people who want to make a quick buck out of those who have no idea what MLM is all about. These scams which disgrace the industry should instead serve as a warning to us to be more wary, and not to get cheated so easily. After all, it takes two hands to clap and; no one can make us do anything we do not want to. People, who got cheated, made the decision to get cheated. Obviously I expect backlash for the previous sentence, but I know that it is the wise few who see the meaning in it that will stand to benefit.<br><br>An important point to note that if you were to go into any type of business, not just MLM, the company you go into should:<br>Â•	Have a good track record<br>Â•	Is reputable<br>Â•	Should have been around for at least some time<br>Â•	And most importantly, you should FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMPANY<br><br>For MLM, you should also realise that is NEITHER quick NOR easy money. It might help you to earn more quickly or more easily, but it cannot be confused with quick and easy money. In every endeavour we set out to accomplish, we need effort, perseverance, and other qualities- This applies to MLM too. Many people join and expect instant results, and when they donÂ’t get that, they quit and brand it as a scam straightaway. This is extremely unfair and flawed thinking on their part.<br><br>If you were to come across any company saying that it is a quick and easy way to make money, I would indeed be very suspicious. Also, ask many questions, but ask the right people. After all, you donÂ’t ask a flight stewardess how to fly an airplane right?<br><br>Have you ever asked someone for their opinion on MLM, and they went, Â“Oh donÂ’t go into that! My auntie/uncle/auntieÂ’s uncle/ uncleÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s uncle/friendÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s friend/ friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friend/ etc got cheated!Â”<br><br>Did you ask that person what actually happened to his or her auntie/uncle/auntieÂ’s uncle/ uncleÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s uncle/friendÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s friend/ friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friend/ etc?<br><br>More often then not the answer would be, Â“Oh, come to think of it, I donÂ’t know. I only know they got cheated.Â” If I may say this, everyoneÂ’s definition of a certain something might be different. Two chicken wings might be a lot of food to me, but it might be just an appetizer to someone else. My point here is: what is the definition of Â‘cheatedÂ’?<br><br>Did that person try his hand at MLM, but failed, or did he get cheated by scam companies? To those who have been conned, perhaps you would feel strongly against the idea from earlier that Â‘you made the decision to get cheated.Â’<br><br>I would like you to know that I strongly sympathize with you and your situation. Even so, I urge you to look at what has happened from a neutral perspective, and to treat it as a learning experience. After all, you learnt to ride a bike by falling down; not just by doing everything right the first time.<br><br>"Money can always be earned again; but life is so much more than that."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I want to ask, what exactly is Network Marketing/ MLM? Is it<br><br>a) selling products, and if people are interested in joining, they have to pay a small membership fee in order to gain commission from the sales of those products to other users?<br><br>OR<br><br>b) selling of the compensation plan of this company to people, that if interested, have to pay a substantial amount of money for the stocks, and can be interpretated as a 'pay to play' scheme? In order for you to recoup this initial amount, you are HIGHLY ENCOURAGED to recruit, instead of directly sellin these products to interested parties??<br><br><strong>I should highlight the flaws of MLM in this company, Bel' Air. One thing to note, I am really focusing on just Bel' Air. I completely agree with Brochow that there are bad eggs and good eggs in a basket, just a matter of how you find which ones are bad and which are good. This thread that I started was just to share my experience of Bel' Air with you guys. </strong><br><br>I guess that the 0.1% of people that made it in MLM companies (<a href="http://www.mlm-thetruth.com/STATISTICS.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlm-thetruth.com/STATISTICS.htm</a>, <a href="http://pyramidschemealert.org/" rel="nofollow">http://pyramidschemealert.org/</a>, <a href="http://www.falseprofits.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.falseprofits.com/)</a> means that there is that much percentage (i.e 0.1%) of you succeeding in buying a good egg.<br><br>1) The entry free of $60 is ok by me, but what can you do??? You have to invest in $1k for the Bel' Air experience in order to qualify as a franchisee??<br><br>Why is there a need for you to pay up for this experience?? If you have signed up for membership by paying $60, you should at least have the rights to recommend<br><br>this product to your friends/ family/ relatives'. Granted, $60 is not a sum that is high, but if you are to compare the products' cost price, their selling price<br>are highly elevated!!!<br><br>In my opinion, a respectable MLM will just require you to sign up under a reasonable amount, and purchase whatever quantity/ type of stock that you are interested in using or selling.<br><br>2) What happens after you enter as a Franchisee??? You get highly psycho'ed by your "friend' to "CUT COUNT". In fact, they stressed that only with a count position can I really break into this business. What does this imply???? That if you pay $12000, you can buy up your position as a count. The products that are sold to you are refundable if not used in 90 days, but some uplines are clever in that they give you products that are non-refundable, what does this tell you of their ethics???<br><br>3) If you leave this company, they will still keep pestering you, for instance, asking you to come to their events. My friend is still boasting that he has a 5-digit income, he is doing very well, etc etc...<br><br>4) The people in this business, I feel, have alot that they hide from the general public and would-be distributors.<br><br>Have you been to any of those seminars that Bel' Air conducts?<br><br>Their people psycho you with them driving fancy cars, (in Bel' Air, was a Alfa romeo and an RX-<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, flash you pictures of sucessful MLMers, images of beautiful houses, cars, boats and a care-free life. They hardly ever focus on those products, and if they do, it was about things like how the products can give you 'residual income' (that means, people will still buy the oil from you after they used theirs).<br><br>Heck, after I burn my $400/4l of oil, I think I'll just put the lamp as a decor.<br><br>They also give you false sense of potential demand for this product. When I went to their talk, they state that in the near future, air will be so polluted that everyone will benefit from using this aroma-therapy diffuser thingy. They even demo'ed how the diffuser can remove smoke from a cigarette butt. It later struck me that, even if these products can remove smoke, lower bacteria count or cure bird flu, how many people will actually pay for this?<br><br>The seminars are, all-in-all, movtivational gatherings. I think of them more as, trying to keep those distributors that might be considering leaving, to stay pass the warranty period, especially those that 'cut count'.<br><br>What's even worse, is that Bel' Air Marquis (A****) told me that this company is doing 20% active retailing and 80% passive usage!!!!! I will be surprised if even 2% of their stocks were sold to people that are not in this business!!! I think this business is doing 100% recruiting.<br><br>Some ex-Bel' Air people says that they pay for these seminars where they bring prospects, training guides, and other sessions... Do people consider the overall expenses that distributors have to fork out??<br><br>Alot of these seminars are really just brainwashing, showing abit of false commradery, that, after I am now glad that I leave this disgusted joint. I do not know how the uplines treat their downlines, but in my mind, I think they treat you completely different once you signed above the dotted lines.<br><br>To the two posters above, do you know, according to  <a href="http://www.mlm-thetruth.com/EVALS-MLMs-shutdown.htm" rel="nofollow">Consumer Awareness Institute</a>, there were close to 650 MLM companies that are shut down by law enforcement agencies? I shudder thinking how many are still under investigations. What does this tell you about them. If I buy a bag that 650 companies make and is defect, what is the chances of me buying a non-defect one?<br><br><strong>Why we choose to look at those people who fail ?</strong> How many people fail?<br><br><strong>Why not we look at those who have suceeded ?</strong> How many people succeed?<br><br><strong>Does newspaper publish sucess story or failure story ?</strong> Success stories are published day-to-day, how many failures want to let the media know????<br><br>By the way, do not compare MLMs with bags, we dun need MLM in our daily survival. The MLM industry is not tarnished by a few rotten apples; the MLM industry is tarnished by alot of rotten apples.</div>

Besides, how many Singaporeans in the age group of 18-25ish can really afford to pay for these Bel' Air products??<br><br>Bring a more 'seasoned veteran' with more knowledge of the business world or MLM into one of these seminars, and see if they shoot down this company on the spot.<br><br>Its better for us to learn now, instead of living a dream of cheating others and self-deception, until its too late and ending up in debt, losing friendships/ relationships, and your own time and real job.<br><br>By the way, does anyone know what's the difference between Count and Challenging Marquis? Just curious...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This post does not support nor put down MLM/ Network Marketing. It just presents a Â‘good and badÂ’ viewpoint analysis.<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>However, your perspectives are very similar to my former friend who first introduced me to Bel'Air. It was as if I am attending another MLM seminar. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </strong></span><br><br>There are many people out there who have a bad impression of MLM. Perhaps they have had bad experiences or known someone who did not succeed. However, there are always at least two sides to a story. That viewpoint is just the negative viewpoint. It is also true that there are people who have made money and become successful through MLM.<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Do not mix up with a true MLM company and a disguised pyramid. For those who have succeeded in a true MLM, Good Luck. I despise those who claim to be MLMers but running a disguised pyramid scheme</strong></span>.<br><br>If MLM was as bad as some people put it, why was it legalized? That is a thinking point. If it was just get-rich-quick scams, it would never have been legalized. (Network Marketing was legalized in 2000 after years of being banned. Pyramid-Selling- a type of scam- however, is banned.)<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Yes, it is the MLM that the government legalised, not disguised  MLM pyramid <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </strong></span><br><br>Network marketing is being taught in universities across America. If network marketing was just a scam, why would universities have such a course?<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>As you say, it is Network Marketing not Recruitment Marketing. Study fully Bel'Air business practices and compensation plan before deciding they are true Network Marketers. Network Marketing focuses on building consumer good will by offering products that the consumer wants and not on active recruitment. Attend Bel'Air recruitment seminars and judge for yourself.</strong></span><br><br>Another interesting thing that I have come across is hear people blatantly say that the structure of MLM is a terrible scam contraption. If those people would just open their eyes, they would realise the biggest Â‘scamÂ’ in the world, would then be all around them- left, right and center. After all, a corporation is in a pyramid shape. In a corporation, the structure is of a pyramid, with the employees below and the CEO sitting right at the top. So then, what exactly is wrong with a pyramid? (By the way, the pyramid is also known to be the most stable structure in the world.)<br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Another MLM talk. Mixing an Organisation Structure that has a shape of a pyramid with running a disguised MLM company that is pyramid in nature</strong></span><br><br>In all industries, there are Â‘goodÂ’ companies, and Â‘badÂ’ companies. For example, if you bought a defective bag, would it mean that you would never buy a bag ever again? It is nonsensical to even think of. This is what is happening now. People are getting cheated by scam companies, and some of them have even started to be anti-MLM advocates.<br><br>The natural human instinct is to keep away from things that we donÂ’t know without actually understanding what it is. Instead of putting down an entire industry, perhaps effort should be made to find out if we were erroneous in our thinking. Remember, in some parts of the world, the tomato was originally perceived to be poisonous. This is just another case of perceived poison. It is unfortunate that the MLM industry has had its reputation tarnished, and that an entire industry is black-listed just because of a few rotten apples.<br><br>It is true that there are scam companies and evil people who want to make a quick buck out of those who have no idea what MLM is all about. These scams which disgrace the industry should instead serve as a warning to us to be more wary, and not to get cheated so easily. After all, it takes two hands to clap and; no one can make us do anything we do not want to. People, who got cheated, made the decision to get cheated. Obviously I expect backlash for the previous sentence, but I know that it is the wise few who see the meaning in it that will stand to benefit.<br><br>An important point to note that if you were to go into any type of business, not just MLM, the company you go into should:<br>Â• Have a good track record<br>Â• Is reputable<br>Â• Should have been around for at least some time<br>Â• And most importantly, you should FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMPANY<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Doing recruitment? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </strong></span><br><br>For MLM, you should also realise that is NEITHER quick NOR easy money. It might help you to earn more quickly or more easily, but it cannot be confused with quick and easy money. In every endeavour we set out to accomplish, we need effort, perseverance, and other qualities- This applies to MLM too. Many people join and expect instant results, and when they donÂ’t get that, they quit and brand it as a scam straightaway. This is extremely unfair and flawed thinking on their part.<br><br>If you were to come across any company saying that it is a quick and easy way to make money, I would indeed be very suspicious. Also, ask many questions, but ask the right people. After all, you donÂ’t ask a flight stewardess how to fly an airplane right?<br><br>Have you ever asked someone for their opinion on MLM, and they went, Â“Oh donÂ’t go into that! My auntie/uncle/auntieÂ’s uncle/ uncleÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s uncle/friendÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s friend/ friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friend/ etc got cheated!Â”<br><br>Did you ask that person what actually happened to his or her auntie/uncle/auntieÂ’s uncle/ uncleÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s uncle/friendÂ’s auntie/ friendÂ’s friend/ friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friendÂ’s friend/ etc?<br><br>More often then not the answer would be, Â“Oh, come to think of it, I donÂ’t know. I only know they got cheated.Â” If I may say this, everyoneÂ’s definition of a certain something might be different. Two chicken wings might be a lot of food to me, but it might be just an appetizer to someone else. My point here is: what is the definition of Â‘cheatedÂ’?<br><br>Did that person try his hand at MLM, but failed, or did he get cheated by scam companies? To those who have been conned, perhaps you would feel strongly against the idea from earlier that Â‘you made the decision to get cheated.Â’<br><br>I would like you to know that I strongly sympathize with you and your situation. Even so, I urge you to look at what has happened from a neutral perspective, and to treat it as a learning experience. After all, you learnt to ride a bike by falling down; not just by doing everything right the first time.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Above views are quite similar to a friend of mine in Network Marketing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> </strong></span><br>"Money can always be earned again; but life is so much more than that."</div>
