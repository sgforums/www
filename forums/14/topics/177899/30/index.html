Then it will be wha wha wha see how strong our sales is the leaders will tell everybody(but never tell ka ke lan buy leh)This is call earn own ppl money easier .

            <div class='col-md body'>well it seems like everybody's fav topic cannot seem to die down... guess its a good thing ba ... like what i always emphasize.. THE WORLD MUST KNOW ABOUT THIS.<br><br>Bel'air business always emphasize on "Trust &amp; Believe". I dare ask:<br><br>How to trust &amp; believe uplines who can't even complete the basic requirements to challenge for marquis &amp; dukes?? They dare call themselves leaders and dukes!<br><br>How to trust &amp; believe uplines who have to ask their downlines to "re-invest" into the business in order for themselves to go up duke!<br><br>Does it make any sense?!?<br><br>I sincerely hope that some of the chaps still operating the bel'air "business" (or should we call it a SCAM?) can just spare a moment to think about this.<br><br>We started out with noble intentions, armed with the oirginal ideals of MLM (Teamwork; One for All &amp; All for One, etc) but Somewhere along the way people get corrupted by $$$ and power... and start to manipulate the very people who have come to trust them and treat them like family...  like the Lim bros...<br><br>Now it is truly a mess... I have spoken to some of the guys inside the network and sadly most still refuse to see the truth... still trust and believe blindly...<br><br>The only way to help these people is by letting more people know about what's going on. We can stop them from recruiting more people and creating sales volume... with no new recruitment and no sales, its only a matter of time before the networks collapse, and everyone will finally wake up from their nightmares... and (dare i hope) the evil-doers end up sweeping the roads!<br><br>Thus i strongly urge all who read these forums not to dismiss it as mere ramblings or the ususl bel'air thrashing from unhappy people, but rather take a bit of time to understand what is really happening in there... and let all the people around you know...<br><br>PLS DON'T LET ANYMORE PEOPLE GET CHEATED!<br>PLS DON'T LET THEM RUIN ANYMORE LIVES!<br><br>YOUR VOICE MATTERS! THE WORLD MUST KNOWS!<br><br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bravo, U've finally seen the light like I and many others did here in this forum...<br>Life is beautiful when u realized you still have frens and families and not those "fakers" in AAA/FGN/Belair who is out to profit from your suffering...<br><br>Just curious, wat prompted you to get out of there? Did you stumble upon this forum? Or you suddenly realise it after a day off from the so called "family"?<br>Please do share with us, I'd be very happy if this forum is beginning to raise awareness in people....<br><br>Cheers!

The first impression of this biz is really good, because the ppl there are so nice, so real , and all of them are heading to the direction ,,creating a better future. i was so attracted by them that i want to be with them....because this environment or scene cannot be happening in the real world that is so realistic... therefore without really understanding what the biz is abt, i went to borrow that $12k and became a count and own my first ever biz...i guess many will also be excited because  u will be earning big bucks fromm then on. and i believe in my uplines and sidelines that they will help me....<br>i really like the initial period where they are really like families, they are ppl like students, teacher , soldiers, nurse, policeman....ppl from all works of life..<br>and althought they are tired , they are happy because they are all working like families to create a whole new life.<br>as time goes by, i begin to understand the real essence of this biz. meaning u need to find "generals" and by helping  these"generals" become successful, u will be successful. althought i know that finding ppl will be difficult , but i still keep faith in this biz, as i believe that since others can do it , i willl also be able to  do it . therefore even when i face objections outside, i still hav "correct mindset" as i want to earn my money back. in my time back there, i hav cut count , and at the same time, my counts left me...but i told myself that i must hang on...my parents and future is still waiting for me....<br><br>but here comes the part wher i really wake up form the world that i am living in and relook at life.. when i was having difficulties in surving, meaning no money, and with friends coming to want that money back, and more families problem appear, i was really under a lot of pressure. i went to talk to my uplines.. u know what i was told?"life is life, biz is biz. who doesnt have problems?tell u what go cut one count and your problems will be solve, trust me" What is this?i just want to talk to someone and thats the response that i get. they will always tell u to call...calll...calll, find ppl for event , must hit sales vol. if u dont hav ppl u dont hav hope......if u cant find anyone, u are having wrong mindsets...<br>what has happen to the "family" that i once know, is it because when one became "rich" they change...why? now all they care is whether u hav counts to cut. no count  means no money. even if u can find the person who wants t join , he will need find that $12k. he will need to borrow the money like what u did when u became count...trhe cycle goes on and on. whats more , now got 1+5, more ppl in debt...what is this, what is earn big money?by borrowing money?this i sall bull shit...<br>i believe those in the network who are struggling , are finding it hard to survive, worst still if u need take money from parents...heard that one monkey took loan to survive, can the person wake up the Fcuking idea and stop listen to R&amp;D!wake up now....u are just following blindly to someone who doesnt hav real substances!!<br><br>TO those who hav left the network..congrates because even though it might be hard, i guess u are happier compared to life in belair...<br>to those who are monitoring this forum and still in the network..stop thinking" this person is wrong mindset, i wont be like this person, iwill be successful...i will proud him wrong.." or "who is this person, hmmmm.." i strongly recommend u to take at least a day off, take a look at your friends, your families, most of all take a look at the whole picture...if u atill think u can be better than me, i can tell u that there are alot of ppl who are more capable than u when they are in the network, why do they leave if it doesnt hav any problem? there is a saying, "wu feng bu qi lang" meaning, whatever u heard, doesnt came from nowhere. this time round when u take a break, really ..."SEE THROUGH, THINK THROUGH"<br><br>CHEERS!<br><br></div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I really do need used diffusers, can't pay much though and I am not keen to join Bel-air after what I read here. So, please, if you really do want to sell your diffuser, please SMS me at 97191956. This ia a genuine request. Cheers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
