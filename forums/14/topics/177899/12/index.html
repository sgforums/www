            <div class='col-md body'>Something must be done. People who are easily motivated by money will fall into their ridiculous traps. If not, more and more average income people will suffer into bad debt and the co. gets richer. Don't say $210K, $13k is enough to kill! Still there are people who are stupid enough to believe their words!<br>I know there are people who are still in debt from jus cutting the count. How do they repay the money? By eating bread everyday and trying to save as much as they can to repay the money.</div>
