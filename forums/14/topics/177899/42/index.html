            <div class='col-md body'>Well trust me, Bel'Air ripped money so much from my family. At first I thought it was a really good, solid company.

Alot of those high-earning dukes they say dont really earn a stable income 5 digit income every month as they say! Whoa? Why?  Because there is really no sale of products to end-consumers.

Is this not forced selling?<br><br>Bottomline, if someone is bragging about checks and how much they earn, ask them how many % of the people really earn, and how many are just stuck with products because their uplines lured them to buy-up.

Please update once they are  really closed in April. Next..... let see how long long the Commonwealth HQ will last. I doubt they have enough loyal consumers to sustain their operation.<br><br>With so much bad publicity, the name Bel'Air stinks. They are a shame to the whole MLM industry.</div>
