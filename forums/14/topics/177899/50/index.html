By forcing ppl to invest just to earn downline's $$$ is a selfish act.<br>They only care about themselves, not caring for their downline's welfare.

Sun left and start that maleluca and then my fren told me Bel air start to disintergrate.  U know i USED to think MLM was such a great idea until i saw all the flaws and unethical methods used by companies in sg that i lost faith. So, my word of advice is, do not touch MLM unless u seaching to go bankrupt the easy way or u really have a GOOD and ETHICAL mentor to start with. I doubt that such a mentor would exist though.<br><br>GREED will only destroy you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Start by learning. I believed that you will benefit more than you lose. I'm previously a distributor of Bel'Air as well. I learn about character building/ personal development, get to socialise with people of all walks of life, learn about the power of marketing through networks, introduce to new products that you might not seen before, strategies they adopt, presentation skills, human/people relations is key. This skill set is so important to everyone and anyone who wants to succeed in life. Be it business, investors or professional.<br><br>Joining a network marketing is a stepping stone to open your world to world of business &amp; people. Without the inspiring talks about life and the motivation those successful people gave me i might not be what I'm today. I'm starting my business this year with my group of uni friends and're also into investing of property &amp; other people businesses. What we're doing here is to increase our passive income (Money that come to you whether you work anot) to be more than our expenses so that we're no longer in the rat race and 80% of the world's population are trapped in.<br><br>I hope what i said will trigger some of your thoughts. At the end of the day Everybody wants to be rich but feel are committed to becoming rich.<br><br>Cheers! &amp; all the best hope you're on the road to financial freedom!!</div>
