            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone.<br><br>Sometimes, it makes me wonder why people tend to mix up entrepreneurship, self-employed and multi-level marketing. To me, it's too common a misconception.<br><br>From what I've learnt, an entrepreneur or self-employed forks out his/her own capitals (borrowed from whoever they know) to start up a business that's of their own, not under the umbrella of another company.<br><br>But in multi-level marketing, you're still under the umbrella of the company and you are only their distributors of the products. Not one who ventures their own business on their own.<br><br>Eg. You are building up your own network inside a multi-level marketing company yes, but it doesnt make you an entrepreneur but just a product distributor of a higher level. You are still under the the umbrella of whatever company you may be in.<br><br>Just because of the financial freedom, flexible working hours that they claim to have? But in the end, you have to meet the sales target you're supposed to achieve isnt it? You dont have the same freedom of what some people think they are as entrepreneurs.</div>
