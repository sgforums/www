(Truth color shown up)</span></div></blockquote>Same experience for me. Truths and no exaggeration. They are trained to speak the same language. Bel'Air operates like a cult where they demand you to follow strictly to their system with no questions asked.Why?<br><br>The whole pyramid will simply collapse if members and the public start casting doubts on their business practices. Actually Bel'Air's structure is very fragile. They do not have a large base of repetitive customers and solely depends on Counts recruiting Counts for their survival. Once recruitment numbers dwindle, the income of the uplines will be adversely affected and more will leave the place.<br><br>It is utterly absurd and stupid to assume the uplines will earn 5 figures income every month. The money must come from somewhere and for Bel'Air case it is through the recruitment of Counts and not loyal consumers. The bad publicity is going to affect Bel'Air as more people come forward to expose them. They will then find it more and more difficult to convince people to cut Counts. If only those who join are franchisee, I wonder how long they will last.<br>We shall see.<br></div>

You must be really angry this time to see what had happened to your friend. We must continue to expose Bel'Air hidden agenda or more people will get harm.<br><br>When I started a thread last year and raised  concerns on Bel'Air promoting high investments and urging prospects to borrow from banks and credit card companies, a Bel'Air Marquis insinuated that I was lying. How could I have lied when I was relating what I have seen with my own eyes and not hearsay?<br><br>I pondered what we must do to convince people to understand that Bel'Air is running a disguised pyramid. A few have approached CASE or CAD but it seems Bel'Air is above the laws, invincible and nothing much could be done.<br><br>Bel'Air tactics to get prospects to cut Counts are deplorable and despicable. They are plotting their own demise and justice will be done.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This is a true event of how I got duped into AAA-BelAir Pyramid Scheme.<br><br>One day a friend who I never met for so long asked me out to dinner at Marina Square. Though far and puzzled, I went anyway since I was free. The dinner goes along well when she started to tell me she don't like her job and wanna concentrate on her business 'cos can earn 5 figure income and more. She also asked me whether I have ever thought of doing business. In actual fact she is digging for information which I have no clue at that time. Meanwhile she was busy SMS-ing away.<br><br>After a long dinner she said she wanna buy something but didn't, then we ended up at McDonald's at Marina Square as she said wanna eat sundae. We continued chatting and she continued her SMS-ing. Then her Â“frenÂ” called her who happens to be at Marina Square to pass her something. She started singing praise of this lady who earned a lot of money doing this business of theirs. We chatted and my friend told her I have intentions of doing business and earn big money(who doesn't?). This lady then called her so-called business partner who is also Â“coincidentallyÂ” nearby at Pan-Pacific Hotel. So we rushed there while my friend kept singing praise about how successful they both are and how Â“luckyÂ” I was to have this chance to meet them as they are very busy Â“successfulÂ” people over and over.<br><br>At Pan-Pacific we headed to the nice &amp; classy lounge area where this guy in his early 30s dressed very impressively with bright colored shirt and cufflinks and polished leather shoes. We chatted on what my dreams are and how fast I intend to achieve success. Also talked about rich people and poor people mindset(*Rich Dad Poor Dad thingy*) and he also said to be successful one must change mindset and recommended me a bestseller book titled Secrets of the Millionaire Mind. He sounded REALLY convincing with his Â“imageÂ” of success and all. In the background, whatever this guy said, my fren and her partner always agreed by saying Â“Yes.... Yes... YesÂ” as if on cue. I should've known something was wrong but this guy is good at psychological mind games and I was hooked. In the end my fren asked him whether I can attend their seminar on Friday and awards ceremony and DnD on Saturday saying only those invited can go &amp; how lucky I was that I can go and kept SMS me the same thing while I was leaving. I never thought much and agreed on going to the DnD as well which costs $130!(what the heck was I thinking?)<br><br>On that Friday I was told to dress formally with tie as I would be meeting a lot of Â“successfulÂ” people. We met at Boon Keng McD where there're a lot of people my age dressed in long-sleeved shirts and tie. The ladies wear formal wear and carries LV bags and wore Prada spectacles and carrying the aromatherapy diffusers. We proceeded to their HQ; AAA Entrepeneurial Center at nearby Hiap Huat House on 4th Floor where I see lots more similar people dressed in power-suits and ties and sweating like monkeys under hot and stuffy weather. The center is open for members only and those Â“invitedÂ”. The seminar on friday talks about Life and Destiny, more of those Rich Dad Poor Dad thing and about how destiny can be changed with change of poor people mindset. The speaker are really well trained to deliver powerful speeches and very motivating! Newcomers are encouraged to dance on chairs and give replies with hand gestures and shouts. This kind of environement is to open up the potential prospects to make them feel like a family of AAA.<br><br>After seminar is the sharing session, every prospect is encouraged/urged by their introducer to go on stage and share what they have learnt from the seminar. Those who don't speak chinese well or not comfortable are cheered on by the crowd. Of 'cos in that kind of situation most of the prospects won't dare to say bad things about the place or the people. Any worries or weaknesses that the newcomer has, all disappeared with a few loud cheers and hand clapping.<br><br>On normal days, Saturday is when they presented their own AAA-System/Marketing-plan. There's 1-2-2 where u Â“cut countÂ” with $12k worth of stocks and recruit 1 people in the first month and 2 each on the subsequent 2 mths. Another one is 1+5 where u Â“cut-countÂ” and buy up 5 count positions with $72k worth of stocks and able to challenge Marquis position with only 2 of the lines active. Come to think of it, when it comes to all the figures and the cutting count thingy, their slides flashed by really really fast. I myself did not manage to catch most of it. Also another point to note is that none of the rules and regulations of the distributorship were discussed. E.g.  How many days to get full refund if you want out, which I only found out after I  Â“woke upÂ” from the scam. Even BelAir's website did not publish it, I only found out from their distributor handbook the nite before I decided to call it quits. They only talked about their system and not BelAir's. My upline fren did not even know that as a couple they can share a count position but the upline never told them that. She and her boyfriend both cut count to get in, Double Whammy!<br><br>The sharing session continues after the marketing plan. By now the newcomers are all hyped up and ready to go. It's like a rollercoaster ride with the adrenaline rush. It's that sudden rush of excitement and encouragement that got most of us trapped without time to really investigate the good and the bad. They also imposed an Â“interviewÂ” to screen out the people with high ambitions/greedy, or those who wants in 'cos they were made to believe they can change their family's life. It's all psychology at play especially with their team of Â“believersÂ”. They also said the product is the best and no need much publicity, we only need to believe in the system 100% and the AAA Team 100%. Those who failed to answer all 100% during interview with the upline Marquis will be failed. But they are not easily let go, back in the gathering room, the lower level Marquis with the help of their brainwashed teammates will encourage the poor fellow to raise his confidence level so that the next time he will definitely pass the interview by answering all 100%!!!<br><br>Those who passed will now have to come up with $12k to cut-count and they urge you to do it the next day usually at Marina Square Food Court. In there, there were some 20+ year old kids who just finished Poly/Diploma, one girl is still below legal age of consent at 17yrs old, some even get their brothers and sister to join after they cut Count! It scares me to think of how they get the investment $ from and how they gonna pay it without a steady job! The prospects who are so confident now are told money is not an issue and they will help to raise it. One of the way is swiping credit card at the stockist center or apply more credit cards since some cards can be obtained in 24 hrs. The main way is calling up friends with a prepared script which they claim has a 99% success rate. Let me tell you, it is 99% success rate! They've used the oldest tricks in the book! Repetition of the same phrase but not revealing what is the problem and using the 2 choice choose 1 method to get $ even at lower amounts. The more calls you make the more daring you are to ask for higher amount of money from your list of friend. And they claim it is now time to see who your real friends are. Yeah rite, those who lent you the money will become potential victims themselves! At that point, the thought of Â“disgraceÂ” never crossed my mind. I kept telling myself I'm doing this for my future and family. They have brainwashed me into  thinking that what I am doing now is alright and I will be able to repay them back when I am Â“successfulÂ”.<br><br>Those who have difficulties to raise the money are told to take up the franchise rights with $1000 first and come up with money slowly. This is their way to earn something in case the guy dropped out if he failed to come up with the large sum. Here is one thing I would like to expose. I myself took up the 1K franchise rights first to get products to Â“enjoyÂ”. The stocks came from my upline's upline Marquis! And I paid her instead of my fren who is my upline. I wasn't even brought to the parent company in Commonwealth to be registered as a distributor! After I quit I tried asking her upline Marquis for the $1k back but I wasn't able to 'cos in the pretext of showing me how to use the product, they opened it and it's non-refundable! I was partly tired and most of the time and I didn't get to think properly, all I thought was that I am on the road to success. Their meetings usually last til 12-2am from Friday to Monday as they tend to drag till very late. And we are required to attend the same classes even though we've been to it before-- more brainwashing!<br><br>Tired brain + Power Seminars = Brainwash<br><br>After the interviews and they think you have high chances of cutting-count, they will pass you a cd where a powerful lady speaker talked about the qualities that are needed in order to succeed in this business and AAA. And do a homework to be submitted to the Duke.<br>1)Leadership<br>2)100% believe in the system(AAA)<br>3)Love the team<br>4)bla bla bla...<br><br>I've uploaded it to putfile.org, it's abt 16MB and I am not sure whether the audio can be streamed thru Internet Explorer.<br><br>http://media.putfile.com/AAA-New-Distributor-Orientation<br><br>Some other thing worth mentioning abt this audio recording is that the newbies who are not yet successful and no experience in this business are told they have no rights to ask them any question! Just believe 100% in the system and it will bring them success! So the homework is to write down each and every word in chinese that the speaker in that audio recording is saying and remember it in heart. We all know how hard it is to write each and every word without rewinding and listening again and again right?. This all never occurred to me like a brainwashing at the time because I was already brainwashed! It sends shivers to my whole body to think back of it now! Another reason to complete the homework is that if you don't the Duke won't accept your case at Pan-Pacific hotel.<br><br>Also for 2 weeks after cut-count we are warned not to talk to others outside this business as they claim outsiders who are not successful will Â“pour cold waterÂ” on us. Also happens that within 2 weeks, if you decide you want out, you will get 100% refund on unused items. I was lucky I only used some small items. Items like diffuser lamp, facial cleanser, cosmetics and promo items are not refundable after 14 days! The nite I cut-count at Commonwealth, I already took out the above products as they cannot be stored at the stockist center. I never even questioned why is it that they're the one who came up with the stock list and not me. I was so brainwashed to not ask any question that I took out the products that nite worth $6k, half of my investment already! They also demand that we use the products from head to toe, inside the body to outside. That's because unopened goods are not refundable and that's where the upline Marquis get their income from! My fren was unlucky as she already started using a lot of her and her bf's products. They just terminated their distributor rights  last night and only managed to get back ~$2k from their goods. Both of them lost about $28k!!!<br><br>So I was in and continued going to their HomeParty. Where the main activity is not about the product usage but instead the newbies are sent on stage to practice the exact same Power Speeches at the seminars word by word! This is how they ensure the cycle repeats! Those newbies who can speak well will be loved and groomed further by the Duke and Marquises as the Duke himself will help in handling the newbie's Â“casesÂ”. Now the newbies have to fight for survival among themselves! The Duke will at this stage tell the newbies they are no longer Â“new peopleÂ” and they must start to be independent! This is the stage where those who make it will go all the way, those who don't just suffer in silence and drop out or con more people.<br><br>I was lucky that my upline finally came to her senses after her performance at work suffered and the boss and her colleague supported her to come clean and save her friends. Her upline Marquis is very persistent, they kept calling and SMS-ing her at work 'til she broke down and cry. They also tried to persuade her to buy up the remaining 3 count position ($45K) to qualify for challenging Marquis as she has 3 Counts under her. Imagine the debt she would incur if she continued on.<br><br>After she came clean with me, early next day I pack up all the goods and head to Commonwealth and terminate my distributor rights. All within 7 days of cutting-count! The upline Marquis was persistent in calling me and non-stop SMS me the whole day after I quit. I never accepted  any of her calls as talking to her would be a waste of time and they're all masters in brainwashing. I demanded whatever money that I can get back including the AAA member fees of $420; ($60 per mth for rental of the office) which is really high for so many people! And they say it only covers a small amount of the monthly rental!<br><br>I feel that this cannot go on any longer and more and more people will suffer! Friendship lost, family broken up and no trust among humans at all! Thinking of the poor young souls who already got so deep in debt really made me so mad at them! $12k is not the only investment, still have to fork out $300 or more to buy the power-suits, shirts and tie to look successful, taxi fare to go home as the meetings lasts til 1-2am most of the time, books, future seminars, etc etc...<br><br>Below are the list of names of the Dukes and Marquises linked to AAA:<br>1)Duke Diron Chua (Camps at Pan-Pacific Hotel, also speaker)<br>2)Duke Pamela Loh<br>3)Dukes Neo Lih Yaw &amp; Neo Lih Huey (who claimed their mom is the best fried oyster seller in RedHill)<br>4)Marquis Mike Lim (Camps at Pan-Pacific Hotel)<br>5)Marquis Hui Shan<br>6)Marquis Hwee Hwee</div>
