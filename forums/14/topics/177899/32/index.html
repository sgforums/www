            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys.. just sharing abit of thought...<br><br>there is really no such thing as no choice... the way I see it, some of those marquis still inside will end up like another R or D one day... majority will eventually leave of course, like us, to rebuild their lives.. but there will be 1 or 2 who stayed behind all the way to ruin more lives in the future...<br><br>Thus it is important that our work continues... if we don't stop them now, 5 yrs down the road, there's going to be another Baldwin, another me, another new victim whose only fault is that he/she chose to trust and believe... IT HAS TO STOP NOW!<br><br>we can't attack them directly in the papers... that could probably end up in a messy lawsuit... i bet those fcukers still have some $$ to sue us, so what we can do is to educate people abt the reality of such cleverly-disguised pyramid games... thru word-of-mouth, forums like this, etc (any ideas?)<br><br>The main aim is to increase public awareness of these evil networks, effectively cutting off AAA/FGN's supply of fresh new frens...<br><br>If they still don't want to wake up their bloody idea, then we just have to cut off their air supply... no more Mr Nice Guy...<br><br>What i want to do is just to save them from their nightmares, and punish the real culprits (R&amp;D) behind this..<br></div>

How do you think we can fight against them if we can't even overcome our own difficulties? If you are in debt, work to clear it. Its not impossible. And with all that negativity, hatred, anger building up inside, you can't be happy anyway.. and it doesn't help our current situation.<br><br>Of coz, I'm not saying "do nothing about it"... but when you can't help yourself through your own difficult patch there.. its only going to make the going get tougher. I hope all of you find relief from getting out of your own ditch.. afterall, being angry only harms us.. not them..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

At least we did learn a lesson (though its an expensive one) and most importantly, we are FREE now...

As a Marquis u hv 41% discount ,  $5k less 41% = $2950 maintenace a month , compare to the last time was 20,000pv which is $1,111 less 41% = $655.5 ( the difference is extra maintenace of $2,295/mth)<br><br>So i am wondering where this extra $2,295 goes to?<br>So if a marquis have to do maintenace of $2950 just by doing consumers sales that will not survive , that means they will have to CUT COUNT no matter which grp they belongs too sooner or later. (this was also shared by the senior distributor as mentioned below)<br><br>I came across a senior distributor on sunday 22/10/06 , we had a lengthly chat and i was surprised that she also left .<br>she shared wth me that she came to realised that this is not her bussiness as it was kenneth Huangg biz . That we distributors was merely super salesperson(i got a shocked)<br>What she shared was that she saw distributors leaving but had no impact on her(to her was they can't make it). But when Duke Raymondd Sunn left it left  her pondering why .<br>1.)Was he really earning that kind of $$$ .<br>2.)He has left but Belair is still running so if she leave belair would still be running , but if BEL'AIR STOP FUNCTIONING SHE AND ALL DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE TO STOP , thus she realised that it is not she bussiness because she has no control of it . (She told me she came to realise that all distributors are super salesperson 'working' for kenneth Huangg who has the control of the company called BEL'AIR .(Indeed something that struck me )<br>3.)I have ask her whether she still have the old magazines so that she came email me the pictures of  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> ARCH DUKE FU <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  so i can upload to let those who were told that there was no ARCH DUKE N THEY SHOULD LOOK TOWARDS IT .<br>4.)

As a Marquis u hv 41% discount ,  $5k less 41% = $2950 maintenace a month , compare to the last time was 20,000pv which is $1,111 less 41% = $655.5 ( the difference is extra maintenace of $2,295/mth)<br><br>So i am wondering where this extra $2,295 goes to?<br>So if a marquis have to do maintenace of $2950 just by doing consumers sales that will not survive , that means they will have to CUT COUNT no matter which grp they belongs too sooner or later. (this was also shared by the senior distributor as mentioned below)<br><br>I came across a senior distributor on sunday 22/10/06 , we had a lengthly chat and i was surprised that she also left .<br>she shared wth me that she came to realised that this is not her bussiness as it was kenneth Huangg biz . That we distributors was merely super salesperson(i got a shocked)<br>What she shared was that she saw distributors leaving but had no impact on her(to her was they can't make it). But when Duke Raymondd Sunn left it left  her pondering why .<br>1.)Was he really earning that kind of $$$ .<br>2.)He has left but Belair is still running so if she leave belair would still be running , but if BEL'AIR STOP FUNCTIONING SHE AND ALL DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE TO STOP , thus she realised that it is not she bussiness because she has no control of it . (She told me she came to realise that all distributors are super salesperson 'working' for kenneth Huangg who has the control of the company called BEL'AIR .(Indeed something that struck me )<br>3.)I have ask her whether she still have the old magazines so that she came email me the pictures of  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> ARCH DUKE FU <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  so i can upload to let those who were told that there was no ARCH DUKE N THEY SHOULD LOOK TOWARDS IT .<br>4.)
