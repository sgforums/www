            <div class='col-md body'>whoa so we have come to the stage of naming people... seems like making a "hit-list" of targets to get rid off  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>just to share abit with the forumers... I have worked closely with many of the individuals on that list... and i can frankly say that most of those people are decent and honest chaps... their only sin is that thay are just too misguided to see the truth... or choose not to see the truth..<br><br>the real culprits are the dukes... these are the guys who have been in bel'air for many years... they know how to play this game of manipulating people for their own gains... if not how can they can survive in MLM for so many years?<br>to them, MLM is all about getting people to join by investing large sums of $$$, thus ensuring that they themselves earn high comissions. Then when these ppl left, like me and some of the forumers, they will just move on to search for new victims... Sad to say, some of their so-called "generals" may choose to follow them on this evil path, mainly bcos they have mostly quitted their jobs, or bought big cars, and have no way out except continue to con people..<br><br>most of the marquis on that namelist belong to this category... a few also came from decent families (meaning they themselves don't have to support family, parents still working), so they can afford not to get a proper job, and continue to stay in bel'air, and try to produce "miracles" (Pui!)<br><br>so what we have is a vicious cycle of conmen continue to con new victims... and along the way, some of the victims join the conmen as well... So sad!<br><br></div>

They say that Marquis Baldwin's <strong>mindset </strong>is not correct?<br><br>I used to work closely with Baldwin. I can honestly say that he is a very capable chap, someone who believes 100% in this "business", and really puts in his heart and soul into helping the network. He bought the RX-8 also because of his belief in his uplines and Bel'air, and treated Bel'air as his only career.<br><br>When i left the network, his own network was already running into difficulties... too many ppl, including 1+5 investors, pulled out and asked for refund... I believe he has to pay back alot of his commission.<br><br>I can testify that Baldwin's network made significant contributions to the duke challenges of R and D...its true that he is not the main contributor, but he worked day and night to help his uplines complete their sales target. If his mindset is not correct, I honestly dunno what can be considered a "correct" mindset.<br><br>The truth is that the people at the top are making use of all their downlines to make money... if you are not useful anymore, or you became a liability to them, then you are considered "unsuitable" and have "wrong mindset"... regardless of whatever contributions you have made...<br><br>This is really sad.. forumers if you are reading this, please <strong>spread the word</strong> to all you know... we need your help in stopping these frauds from spreading their evils to the other innocent parties... now that they realise they have difficulties cheating working adults, they are now invading the universities... bcos they believe Uni students are more fresh in their outlook of life and therefore easier to brainwash/psycho...<br><br>Victims like me and Baldwin cannot turn back the clock, we can only move on with our lives.<br><strong>BUT <span style="color: red;">YOU</span> CAN DO SOMETHING!!</strong><br><br>Spread the word... don't let them harm anymore people... <strong>PLEASE</strong>..<br><strong><span style="color: red;">THE WORLD MUST KNOW!</span></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also want to verify that all that has been said about the 2 infamous brothers are all true... they have been talking about buying cars and properties since last year... but till now haven't smell anything yet.<br><br>THey both have no license yet, but like to drive their downlines' cars (which they psycho them to buy) around the carpark... oh yeah R behaves like a warlord of whatever u wana call him... just scold people or demand people to do whatever he wants...<br><br>I don't think they made a lot of money, because if you guys refer to my earlier post, it is highly likely that they themselves pump in quite a lot of $$$ to get their duke position.<br><br>A story to share with you all:<br><br>D completed his duke challenge in May, just before the 20th, which was the bel'air annual awards presentation. What people don't know is that just days before the 20th, his sales volume is merely HALF of what's required to get dukeship. How did he complete the other half? Its not thru his downlines, because the network (I was still there at that time) has already stretched itself to the max just to churn out that half of the sales target...<br><br>I do not know what tricks they pulled, but what i do know is that just days before the 20th, D and R went to Bel'air HQ to speak to the management... and when they return, we were told that D is a Duke!<br><br>i strongly believe they pump in their own money to buy out the required sales volume.. or at least they begged the company to give them discounts..<br><br>Either way, it just shows how insane they are... and they are telling their downlines to do the same (pump in own money for sales volume) so that they can make money out of it... and ultimately they themselves will benefit the most out of it, while most of their downlines will end up broke...<br><br>Are they evil or insane or both? You guys decide for yourself. What i can say is that these people really exist in our society, and the worse thing is that they have broken no law, and authorities cannot take much action against them..<br><br>What we can do is to let people know the <strong><span style="color: blue;">TRUTH</span></strong>.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>WHICH IS WHY THE WORLD MUST KNOW<br><br>PLEASE DON"T LET THIS EVIL CONTINUE...<br><br>WARN ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS!</strong></span><br><br>P.S. i have decided not to name any names, but if readers/forumers have any idea what is happening inside, they will know who I am referring to.<br><br></div>
