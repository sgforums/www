            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone.<br><br>Seriously speaking, there's something which I dont understand about this teacher who's from VJC. He has a good job prospect in MOE, considering himself a civil servant for the government. As an educator, he has the responsibility of guiding their students on the right path from harmful influences outside campus.<br><br>Yet this teacher steps foot into this BLOODY Bel'Air Business, which in me opinion's something intangible because you'll never know when will be the end of the Bel'Air era in Singapore at the ways of how they handle their distributors (apparently Bel'Air didnt take much action even though they are aware of their nasty acts. What does that show?)<br><br>Not only so, how good or bad his 'business' is in Bel'Air I'm not bothered.<br><strong>BUT HE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED TO INVITE HIS STUDENTS TO BE RECRUITED BY THOSE IDIOTS INSIDE THE COMPANY! WHAT DOES THIS SHOW?</strong><br><br>Bel'Air idiots. No matter how good your acts can be by being a 'good corporate citizen' sponsoring our National Day Parade events. Your filthy dirts can never ever be wiped off. Watch it, the One Above will handle you guys when time comes..<br><br>No doubt that Bel'Air may be successful outside Singapore I dont know. But in Singapore, it's those idiotic distributors (whoever UGLY DUCKS and MONKEYS you are) from Shiang Series whose going to create the downfall of them..<br><br><strong>TO ALL EDUCATORS OUT THERE WHO ARE IN BEL'AIR:<br><br>YOU GUYS BETTER NOT SEND ANY MORE OF YOUR STUDENTS TO THAT BLOODY COMPANY OR.. YOU GUYS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RUINING YOUR STUDENTS' FUTURE. IRRESPONSIBLE IDIOTS..</strong></div>

So what if u are a sponsor for NDP? it actually means nothing....<br><br>Let's take a look at NKF and TT Durai. Didn't he portray a veri nice imagine of NKF in the past? Rasie fundings was all about tears and hard work. Deceiving singaporeans of TEARS and MONEY.<br><br>How many of u guys still remember u need to TEE UP NKF and TT Durai when showing ur new frenz in Commonwealth? NOwadays never liaoz rite... WHY?<br><br>Because NKF was a scam! So uplines scared link NKF with Belair, will make ppl think tt Belair is a scam!<br><br>Look, NKF has been exposed. Sooner or later, its Belair. <span style="color: red;">DO U UPLINES BLOODY HELL KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN DEBTS BECAUSE OF BELAIR? </span><br><br>I wonder if Belair is still a main sponsor this year for NDP after so much bad reputations abt it. Imagine some ang moh saw our NDP and sees Belair as a main sponsor, den he came to sgforums and saw this thread. What will he think of Singapore?<br><br>OMG.... pls.... dun let Belair be the main sponsor any more.... its ruining singapore reputations.</div>

No doubt, that you guys may occasionally rant here and there. But the least I admire them guys is that their courage to share their bad experiences, the courage to stand up and face reality.<br><br>Not like those animals who think that they are God-like.<br><br>All of us know that one of our greatess weaknesses as humans is the element GREED. Everyone of us have things that we hold onto dearly and will not let go, including fame including money. Which's what those animals constantly use to psycho their fellow distributors inside. To those innocent associates, what is said may seem like a dream coming true without looking deeper into the picture as to whether whatever they've claimed can be trusted.<br><br>Whether in the end, the animals really got their cars and desires is another matter because they've already completed their deadly mission of psychoing newcomers into that company. The main aim of them doing so is merely to impress them with a wonderful life, which many people desire when they are sick and tired from years of working.<br><br>Just like people queuing up for 4Ds, totos..<br><br>One of the reasons why some people in there trust their uplines so much is because of the coverage of testimonials from the animals that are shown inside their official website. They could jolly well tell them to read or maybe even memorise them. Who knows.. People can make up stories you know.<br><br>If the network is expanding very well, then why are people leaving in the first place? No doubt, people may not be used to Bel'Air or that they dont think they have the potential to create a brand new world for themselves. BUT- The reasons behind them leaving the company is because THEY ARE DEEP IN DEBTS. Obviously there's something wrong behind, very very wrong. Isnt it?<br><br>Good luck to Mr Tan and Burmeses out there who're innocent not knowing about this scam.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
