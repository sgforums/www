And they ask me to be patience and wait for this saturday... The funniest thing is that the guy talking to me earn $10,000, but cannot spell simple English like " opinion"... man... it is really funny...<br><br>Guys...If u really want to destroy them, use this coming saturday night 6.1.07...<br>If u really want to get back waht u want and witness the wreckage of this company, call the police and tell them to come this coming saturday at the park near commonwealth mrt, If u believe it is a pyramid style business.<br><br>For these days, after listening to both side here and there (AAA), i only can walk one step, see one step (in chinese), i just want to see how professional is their brainstorming...<br><br>For guy outside see this post, it not that people from Bel'air is not reading... they are reading but prefer not to reply as they think like the "Rich"... which they are poor morally or morally bankrupt</div>
