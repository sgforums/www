Their point of argument is that all these money is your "1 time" investment. But really KNN, after that, then they will tell you there are further money that you need to put in...."inter-course" fees (training), misc materials fees, and if you want to take network bonus, you need to pay, etc....and recently, the "Glamourous" D&amp;D (diu and diu)...$130 for that din? pui!!<br><br>3) &amp; 4) Greed, and the reluctancy to find out more from others. If you are always putting money as quoted from 2), even if you manage to recover you earlier investment, you'll continue to put the money in again...never ending stories. Furthermore, if you bother to check with outside resources and question them, they will say that why you must listen to all negative remarks? you should listen to successful people of the ASS (AIRS) market...<br><br>from what i know, those who chose to leave, majority did not get their money back. Worse, the goods that they had bought are usually not exchangeable. Even more KNN is that they were told to use the goods on the pretence that its for their own good but in reality, they don't want them to return the goods. The reasons being that, how much the downlines return, their uplines need to "vomit" out the money that they had gained earlier. Understood? but there may be a few lucky ones. for those who chose to stay are struggling very hard to keep themselves alive...poor souls...may they rest in peace</div>

IBOs receive remuneration for shopping within their own business, for selling products and for expanding their network of people "downline" doing the same. An IBO receives a percentage of the profits generated by the network of all IBOs introduced to the system by him or her, and also of the profits generated by the people introduced by those IBOs, and so on.

Apparently the latter is more profitable. It's not abt earning the one time referral fee from recruiting downlines but rather the residual income generated from the entire network.<br><br>Any business more or less takes the form of a pyramid structure. It's only a matter of legitimacy. Network Marketing is by all means a legitimate type. However, it is not a type of business for everyone for it requires a lot of commitment. Those networkers with only the intention to recover their invested money are really in the wrong trade. Their motivation will finally skew them towards greed. I also can't accept those with little education and no common sense to be involve in this trade. Really tarnish the image of Network Marketing.</div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;"><span class="large">Halo, pls go to read my quotes! Meaning of MLM!
