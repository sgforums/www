            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by Sabelli:<br><br>Wah, this thread has grown so long haha. Hmm... if want to take actions, very hard. i think Scorpio76 once contacted CAD, but nothing was done. The thing is, they got products to sell and it covers up what they are really selling i.e 'marketing plans'.<br><br>As long as what they do are within the contact that you sign, they are by all means considered legal. Thus the recruitment or 'pyramid' scheme still remains hidden.<br><br>Although their means of getting people into this biz and hiding facts and figures, telling lies and faking being rich is more than despicable, nothing can be done unless the authorities bother to go undercover and unveil how many of these people are now in debt, bankrupt, and how many have actually earned money. And the failure rate and sucess rate of this company.<br><br>I also hate this company, alot. Because it makes me sick. My 'friend' also makes me sick. People changed so much do to greed, this really taught me a lesson. Maybe this really expose me to the dangers of the working society, and that things are not as they seems. (I am still young, 24 this year  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>I dunno what you guys think, but I once cautioned another friend about this company (cos my friend knows him as well). All he gave me as an answer was that this business is do-able, if not why is it still around. As a friend, I think I have done alot to warn him about it. I told him about the lies they make, brainwashing that they do, and even asked him to look at this forum and particularly this thread. I personally hope that he is smart enough about this business, and even that he can tell my Bel' Air friend to come clean about it.<br><br>(Hey Aaron, if you are reading this, I hope you are thinking about what I am saying, this is not some taxi-drivers talking coffeeshop talk, this is real people sharing what they know and experienced in this MLM coy. I know by doing this, you know who I am, but I really dun fuking care. I also dun care about friendship anymore. Earning good friendships are hard, BUT bad friendships can be easily broken. As you can see, I am real pissed off about it. So just wake up your friend.)<br><br>Scorpio76 has not replied for sometime... does anyone reading this know of something that the Bel' Air people and particularly the AAA group did that is really against the law?<br><br>Can 'front-end' loading promotions such as '1+2+2', '1+5', '1+15' be considered legal? Especially since this scheme is actually targeted at the younger 16-24 age group?<br><br>Think only when someone from Bel' Air commit suicide or if the media decides to investigate it like the NKF saga then can something really be done. Meanwhile the only thing that we can do is try our best to let people be aware of this company.<br><br>Or if someone by any chance wants to contact Susan Long about it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Sabelli,<br><br>Below thread was posted  by BrandSing who contributed to a Bel'Air topic started by me. It answers to your question about the "1+5" and "1+15" investment schemes promoted by Bel'Air.<br><br>Hi All,<br><br>I read with interest the commentaries posted here. I would like to share my personal views on this matter as I have attended one of those 1+5 / 1+15 seminars.<br><br>Please refer to the MLM Act Section 2(c) (vi), I quote<br><br>"A promoter of a scheme shall not, and shall take reasonable steps to ensure that participants in the scheme :<br><br>..<br>..<br>(D) in promoting the scheme or the commodity, use, or cause or permit to be used, fraud, coercion, harassment, or unconsciounable or unlawful means"<br><br>After the attending one of such seminars, I observed that there was alot of hype in it. (i.e. loud music, people sharing, lots of yelling, showing their pay cheques....) With some basic knowledge of human pyschology, if a persons' mind is not sufficiently strong, he/she may be swayed into making a decision which is not based on clear facts but emotions/ group dynamics.<br><br>So, my question is Belair infringing on the ACT by practicising 'unconsciounable' means to promote the scheme. Can the relevant authorities please look into it as we may not be qualified to ascertain it.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Promoting 1+5/ 1+15 is basically creating a virtual network before finding the recruits. Based on my reading knowledge of some US MLM consultants, creating a virtual network is not a professional MLM practice! It is not a representation of the TRUTH of doing MLM i.e. Not all will recover their 'so-called' investment into the essential oils.</strong></span><br><br>For your friend Aaron, I think you have done your part as a friend to warn him the dangers of Bel'Air. If he wants to learn the hard way, let him be. There is nothing much we could do.<br><br>Aaron, if you follow this thread, hope the information provided will lead you to making a wise decision. Many  have regretted and we do not want you to be another victim of this unethical company. Take care.</div>

Of course, to be fair, anyone who seen what happened to me back few pages, where I was assumed to be a Bel-Air agent and was told rather imprudently that I should only engage anti Bel-Air discussion, should be discouraged.<br><br>The second, as I can see, is the potential damage an online forum would do to a company, hopefully not by defamation, but by presenting facts, and some startling ones even.<br><br>I cant say for this thread, because I have not read through, but anyone who hop over to the topic on SwissCash, would see shocking information including Swiss Embassy's advisory on SwissCash as a scam. Imagine you are a member of SwissCash scheme and you were told not to come in here. Chances are some chaps wouldnt know of that advisory.<br><br></div>

The clerk told me it will be ready within 2 weeks from the day I quit. I've called earlier just to make sure they are processing my forms. I was really infuriated at that time and I think I scared the clerk real bad.<br><br>So far, what I lost is $1k for franchise rights. Actually I did not really lose the money, it's all converted to $1k of products which I find pretty highly priced. And I also lost about $400 for the fees for AAA's so called "brainwash" center. $60/mth til Dec. That money I tried to get it back but the "ducks" said I already signed the stupid form and I cannot get it back. It's their "rules". The thing that pissed me off is that on the form itself, there were no so called "rules &amp; regulations" printed! I guess this is another way they can suck money from poor souls like us. That is why I suggest we make this a big news so that more people won't fall into this trap.<br><br>Lately I heard alot of people are quitting from AAA. I guess more and more people are waking up from their "slumber" and wish to get out. I really hope AAA close down and those people who run the center be trialled in court for operating a Pyramid Scheme in disguise.</div>
