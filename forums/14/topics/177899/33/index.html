            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Read the message about a particular marquis who wants to leave Belair but because of the debts, got no choice but to stay.<br><br><span style="color: red;">One word: Disgusted</span><br><br>What does this person mean exactly? I felt really disappointed with him/her.<br>I believe that there are still many people who are stuck in Belair who will feel the same way too. But does this gives you an excuse to stay behind and get more people involved who will end up in deep mess like what you are in now.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Even a 3-year old child knows that when something is bad, he must not offer it to anyone else. This is what I called: Consideration and Kindness.</span><br><br>We make mistakes and we learn from them. Seriously, its alright. Dun ever worry about admitting these mistakes.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">My dearest pals in Belair, be brave and move on. Nothing is over yet. Nothing changes at all while you are still in Belair. Everything is still the same.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">1)Worrying that you may not be able to clear your debts? Only by staying in Belair can help you clear these debts?</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The truth is:</span> How much have you earned in Belair? Or should I say, how often has your uplines asked you to fork out extra money to buy your last count to challenge or to complete your challenge? To take it positively, maybe these uplines are really trying to help you.But the thing is, perhaps they themselves are also being blinded by Belair and would never expect you to end up in deeper debts too.I believe that they really mean to help you when they promised you at that time but frens, circumstances and situations happen ALL THE TIME.So, dun blame anyone if you are in deep debts because of this cause WE ARE THE ONES who listened and trusted them.<br><br><span style="color: green;">2)Worrying that your family members and friends will jeer at you when you leave Belair?</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The truth is:</span> Haha.. that's nonsense thinking! Your real family and frens will never use this to mock at you. But nevertheless, of course there may be some sarcastic ones. But the thing is, <span style="color: red;">WHO CARES?</span> Tell you frankly, most of our family members will actually feel relieve you finally make up your mind to leave. Its just that they do not want to express how they feel cause they thought that by telling you their honest views, or they might affect you and your 'career' in Belair. So, these very supportive parents and family of ours, will rather keep quiet and pretended that everything is alright. You are actually 'Releasing' them from all the worries and stress by coming up with a GOOD decision.<br><br><span style="color: green;">3) Worrying what will happen to your uplines and downlines when you leave?</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The truth is: </span>Maybe they are like you, already start to have hesitations about Belair. Do you think they will stop if you leave?Haha.. No way! Unless they themselves want to. Dun be naive. There is never a RIGHT time to leave... Dun stay behind and think that your presence will mean a lot to these people. <span style="color: red;">Thinking to help your downlines to earn back their capital before you leave?</span> Its ENOUGH! Better stop doing that! This is an absolutely wrong thinking! You are actually causing more innocent people to sink into deeper debts like you do! These 'new' people you are recruiting does not own tons of ten thousands to spare. They themselves will have to borrow from banks, frens and family to get into this. This will be endless, so please do not do that.<br><br><span style="color: green;">4)Worrying that you may not be able to find a good job as the market is rather competitive nowadays?</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The truth is: </span>Market nowdays is indeed very competitive and good jobs are hard to come by.  But are you truely afraid or its just the ego of yours playing tricks on you again? Money is all around us. There is no high or low class jobs. As long as its a honest job that can give us a peaceful and stressful mind, why not go for it for the time being and keep a look-out for a better one?<br><br><span class="large">            <span style="color: blue;"> NO WORRIES!</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br><br>Belair has trained us well and tough. Nothing outside will be too difficult for us to conquer. We have learned to be determined and strong willed so overcoming obstacles will definitely be not of any problem.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">If you have decided to give yourself and start afresh again, here are some tips:</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip 1:</span> Look in your classified ad section again. (See.. there are so many available great job offers.) Go to Jobs DB website too.... Start preparing your resume and fly it to every job that you think may suit you. Start calling and emailing now! You sure will have no problems with the interviews!<br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip 2: </span>Cancel all your credit cards and call the banks for assistance. Assure them that you really want to clear off the debts that you have owed them and ask for a good instalment plan to clear it. (I did this and the bank gave me a good plan and even a great discount for the debts! 2 more months to clear them and I am free!)<br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip 3: </span>Try to reduce your monthly expenses. If you have any existing internet or SCV services and the contract is already over, cancel them. If you have any cars, stop trying to afford them.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip4: </span>Draw out a good debts clearing plan.<br>For instance;<br>you are earning $2.5 k monthly, you can use $1.5K to clear your debts.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip5: </span>Have good time management.<br>If you do not earn enough cash to survive, then do domething! I am holding 2 jobs currently but I still can have 1 weekend off!<br>Who says you have to slog very hard to pay off your debts?<br><br>And last but not least, be true to yourself. That is really very important. Do not pretend to be strong if you really cannot take it. I know its really hard when you are already having a $10+K or even a $100K debt to bear at such a young age. <span style="color: red;">I never said that clearing debts is easy, BUT IT CAN BE DONE. </span>Dun ever give up trying to do that. Frens are always around you. Seek advices from them. I have faith that you be able to cross this hurdle. Jia you, Friend!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;"></span></strong><br><br>Have been in Belair for quite a few years, very active, used to be so passionate than anyone else. Trusted all the leaders there, abide strictly to the rules and regulations (though later realise the leaders break it themselves). working hard to expand own network...put all my heart and soul to build up my network. We used to be a true, hardworking and most of all Happy Network.<br><br>But all these is past.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Time really flies, left AAA more than a year. And have never regret that decision. But it is not easy. I can truly understand for those who have been in heavy debts, emotionally hurt, trust was tarnished, spiritually weak. Alot of ex-huobans that i know, had to suffer bad debts but also some got depression. I know one of them even wanted to commit suicide. Sigh!<br><br>It is really saddening to hear that. But i have been through all this. It is really over.<br><br>After i decide to leave, I have tried to put blame on others of what i have become...to make myself abit more comfortable. I know i can't do that. Worse still, i start to blame myself. It is retribution. I have let down so many huobans causing them to be in debts, emotionally hurt. That's where i start to have depression, illusions etc...i couldn't find a proper job. This has been a long period.<br>Until I slowly realise that every human being do make mistakes, u are not a saint. What decision we have make is based on our limited knowledge and feeling at that point of time. I just want to say "Everything that happens for a reason!" Learn from it.<br><br>AS what Past Tense has mentioned, with the communication skills we learn from Belair, finding a job is really not difficult. You have the confidence that most employees would like to have you. Trust me. I am glad that right now, at least i have the ability to pay my debts (though its still alot more, but it still can be done!)<br><br>I think now what is our responsibility is to keep on spreading this forum to others that we care. Jia you!<br><br>Should you have any problems, please feel free to enquire! Cos i know most of the leaders background very well.

Its just that they do not want to express how they feel cause they thought that by telling you their honest views, or they might affect you and your 'career' in Belair. So, these very supportive parents and family of ours, will rather keep quiet and pretended that everything is alright. You are actually 'Releasing' them from all the worries and stress by coming up with a GOOD decision.<br><br><span style="color: green;">3) Worrying what will happen to your uplines and downlines when you leave?</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The truth is: </span>Maybe they are like you, already start to have hesitations about Belair. Do you think they will stop if you leave?Haha.. ....... These 'new' people you are recruiting does not own tons of ten thousands to spare. They themselves will have to borrow from banks, frens and family to get into this. This will be endless, so please do not do that.<br><br><span style="color: green;">4)Worrying that you may not be able to find a good job as the market is rather competitive nowadays?</span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">The truth is: </span>Market nowdays is indeed very competitive and good jobs are hard to come by.  But are you truely afraid or its just the ego of yours playing tricks on you again? Money is all around us. There is no high or low class jobs. As long as its a honest job that can give us a peaceful and stressful mind, why not go for it for the time being and keep a look-out for a better one?<br><br><span class="large">            <span style="color: blue;"> NO WORRIES!</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br><br>[b]Belair has trained us well and tough. Nothing outside will be too difficult for us to conquer. We have learned to be determined and strong willed so overcoming obstacles will definitely be not of any problem.</strong><br><span style="color: blue;">If you have decided to give yourself and start afresh again, here are some tips:</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip 1:</span> Look in your classified ad section again. (See.. there are so many available great job offers.) Go to Jobs DB website too.... Start preparing your resume and fly it to every job that you think may suit you. Start calling and emailing now! You sure will have no problems with the interviews!<br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip 2: </span>Cancel all your credit cards and call the banks for assistance. Assure them that you really want to clear off the debts that you have owed them and ask for a good instalment plan to clear it. (I did this and the bank gave me a good plan and even a great discount for the debts! 2 more months to clear them and I am free!)<br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip 3: </span>Try to reduce your monthly expenses. If you have any existing internet or SCV services and the contract is already over, cancel them. If you have any cars, stop trying to afford them.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip4: </span>Draw out a good debts clearing plan.<br>For instance;<br>you are earning $2.5 k monthly, you can use $1.5K to clear your debts.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Tip5: </span>Have good time management.<br>If you do not earn enough cash to survive, then do domething! I am holding 2 jobs currently but I still can have 1 weekend off!<br>Who says you have to slog very hard to pay off your debts?<br><br>And last but not least, be true to yourself. That is really very important. Do not pretend to be strong if you really cannot take it. I know its really hard when you are already having a $10+K or even a $100K debt to bear at such a young age. <span style="color: red;">I never said that clearing debts is easy, BUT IT CAN BE DONE. </span>Dun ever give up trying to do that. Frens are always around you. Seek advices from them. I have faith that you be able to cross this hurdle. Jia you, Friend![/b][/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <span style="color: indigo;">Clapped..........clapped  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Wow... that what we had learned / gained from it &amp; motivation classes that the prices / money we had spent on it!!!</span></div>

They told us to be simple, simple and simple. They control our life. We can't go home earlier, we must attend everyday, we must go there everyday.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good job everyone, continue to reveal rotten details about the world inside Bel'Air <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I believe that there's justice for everyone of you people victims here one fine day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Jiayou me friends...<br><br>There's a question which's been pondering inside me head for quite some time after reading this thread. Why didnt anyone have the courage to report all these to the Commercial Affairs Department? No doubt that this is purely a pyramid scheme and those who're innocently involved'll be dealt with too for being involved in such a scheme. But I feel that it'll be right if this is brought up there and justice be justified.<br><br><strong>Why dont those CAD officers just send a officer-in-disguise down there to have a look themselves? Bel'Air may be able to cover it with their products. But one certainly has to go there and see for themselves. If CAD's really dedicated to serve our nation, the more they should have the extra mile to help you guys.</strong><br><br>Cheers everyone and congratulations to those who're out from the Bel'Air nightmare. As of last night when I pass through Haw Par Technocentre to peek at what they're doing inside (it can be seen from outside from a distance actually), I still see those sickening people posing around.<br><br>I've tried this. Whenever I just stand there to observe them, one of those in blazers and another downlines of his (the latter doesnt have the blazer on) stood in front of the panel 'Bel'Air PARIS' and raise their hands high at it as though... they are worshipping God. It's almost the same.<br><br>I dont belong to any religion but I feel that it's a blasphemy to see someone worshipping a company name like God. It's like you're worshipping an idol - some more, an idol who does damage everyday until now.<br><br><strong>EDIT:</strong><br><br>To those Bel'Air idiots who're still enjoying yourselves sucking up money of your downlines inside:<br><br>You people watch it. Apparently I've heard about you people using threats on your downlines who've posted their plights here because of you people victimising them. Dont think that by doing so, you people'll get anywhere. Engaging your lawyers may not be of any use because at the end of the day, if your downlines were to say that you people've sucked up their money. Surely, the company accounts will be checked. And surely, we'll know by the end of the whole journey who'll get the last laugh.<br><br>Just make sure that you dont be the next NKF.<br><br>To those downlines who're still struggling inside, get yourselves out of there. No point staying inside when you can've a better life outside. I always believe that those multi-level marketeers at the top're dividers of the income gaps.<br><br>They boast off their income, change cars every now and then, share their success as though Bel'Air is their god etc, but there're still people down there who're struggling like mad to earn their livings, even people commit suicide because they think that they're useless not being able to provide income for their family.<br><br>Really. What's the point of staying inside when you're still going to settle your debts someday? Get yourself out of there, get yourself a decent job no matter how low the pay may be and get your debts settled. No point staying inside and find that you're still bleeding profusely. The wounds wont heal until you've found a proper way to heal it.<br><br>Gambatte guys. I've not been a victim myself, neither was I inside any MLM company but I share you people's plight because I myself's from a low-income family.<br><br><strong>REMEMBER THAT BIG BEL'AIR PARIS SIGNBOARD POSITIONED OUTSIDE HAW PAR TECHNOCENTRE, JUST BESIDE FAITH METHODIST CHURCH AND VERY NEAR COMMONWEALTH MRT.</strong></div>

Apparently I've heard about you people using threats on your downlines who've posted their plights here because of you people victimising them. Dont think that by doing so, you people'll get anywhere. Engaging your lawyers may not be of any use because at the end of the day, if your downlines were to say that you people've sucked up their money. Surely, the company accounts will be checked.

            <div class='col-md body'>Was reading n saw this pls read BY      FlowerSand   on   16 June 2006 Â· 01:04 AM<br><blockquote>Ok, let's face the fact.<br>goto www.acra.gov.sg that's where u can register a company.<br>What kind of company, ok , we call it MLM.<br>What about the products u have for your company?<br>The usual way of doing is to import a container of so call 'unique item' that singapore dun have, then say its good and good and say you got the best compensation plan.<br>People join, people recruit.<br><br>Lets all face it.<br><br>The top leader in MLM doesn't sell anything, they just give seminar and training. The ppl or downline learns to be a leader and trains other.<br><br>Where the money comes from??<br><br>Ya, from the product...<br><br>Who buys?<br><br>You and the downline.<br><br>Yes, ppl can buy the product without joining the company,<br>but the product is of very low price and has a high margin markup coz<br>the company needs to profitable, and the $ paid to the leaders.<br><br>Ok, if you really want that product, you fly oversea to get or maybe order from www.ebay.com for a cheaper one<br><br>SO before u join MLM,<br>think again<br><br>OK ok, never mind the MLM company background is good and product is really good. But beware coz a good product always has competitor and market share. Even if the company manufacture the product, yes i agreed that it can be unique but it still face competition from the normal supply demand chain.<br>Its not a point whether the product is unique, comsumable, price competitive or whatsoever, the product must bring value-for-money to the consumers.<br><br>Dun waste so much time in attending lectures or having your weekend burn for a year or 2 and give up, do something more meaningful<br><br>SO before u join MLM,<br>think again<br><br>To add on, what happens? If a grad joins full-time MLM but his/her profession is doctor/engineer, wouldn't it our economy shortage of these positions?<br>If university grads this year is 100%, and of these 50% choose to do full time MLM instead of relevant job/career vacacies, what will happen to the economy then? Will we face a shortfall in talents? and if those 50% of those grads, only 2% of the 50% succeeded and the rest choose to return to work what will happen then? those who return actually lack behind their peers already...<br><br>What about those who succeeded? Yes, SLK, CLK, BMW<br>Earn $10K Spend $10K, its no better. What happen what the downline reform and leaves or the company change name? (The company change name very often to hid their previous bad-mouthing who had left, check the ACRA you will know whether a company has rename its company name) When a company renames, usually the downline under u leaves, leader also leave.<br>Those who has succeeded is back to square one.<br><br>Who is the future then?<br><br>SO before u join MLM,<br>think again<br><br>If you want to join, can also. No problem, but but but dun pay any cash to the company, try know more about its product and sell to those ppl you dun know.<br>See what's the feedback. Ya, ya,ya they will say you need commitment or even if you start a biz like MLM you need capital or you need to buy the product to see how good it is so that you're confident and sell more and earn more... bull !^@!. Does a Merz Sales man own a Merz 350? Does the property agent who sell the condominium owns one at orchard? ya,ya,ya dun say its different coz they doing sales and its MLM. Come on, face the facts, a company need sales to be sustainable if not wind-down already. MLM also is a biz under a company, so what do u think?<br><br>Even for new startup, ya, join now the pioneer old startup join later then small fry, if they really say it this way, walk away coz there is really no such thing under MLM concept<br><br>If you want to join, dun pay a single cent first for the product or to be what down or upline. see if the company still runs good for 6 months. If a lot of new faces every month, then walk away.<br><br>SO before u join MLM,<br>think again<br><br>Paralysis Analysis Doctorate<br>Anti MLM Division<br>Flowersand<br><br>coz flower and sand dun mix<br></blockquote>A few more thread to read before u join<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=195766<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=212333<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=207815<br></div>
