It is precisely why I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">considering MLM- financial freedom.</span><br><span style="color: brown;">MLM is not easy nor quick money, but it is a easier and quicker way to earn money. Consider this Life2BfUn, you get employed by a company at 20, slog till you're 60, and get laid off without pension because there is someone younger and cheaper to replace you. Is that your idea of a happy retirement?<br><br>If not abused, MLM is a decent platform to let you retire early. But wait a second, what is your definition of 'retire'? Enjoying life you're old and achy? When you hit 60, it is unlikely you have that abundance of energy to tour the world.<br><br>My definition of 'retire' is 'the ability to choose to work or not to work.' I want to be able to choose to do work that I like, not work because I have no choice.  If you still argue your case about "go to work &amp; earn as much as u think can earn back!!!", then all the best to you and your endeavours.</span>[/color]To why I am not involved in Bel Air- They are simply not the company I am looking for. In absolutely no way did I say that Bel Air is a good company. However, due to the fact I've had no dealings with them, how does this constitute any basis for slamming them? I hope this will end the same, repeated, meaningless questions.<br><br>Finally, to end off, a good company has the following variables: [b]<span style="color: brown;">Good products, good compensation plan, business associates you are comfortable with, a good mentor, a supportive company</span></strong>, and obviously, the most important variable- you.<br><br>It is entirely your decision the way you work the business, how often you work it, and how much you want it to succeed. Success depends largely on you. In fact, these should be basic elements in anything you set out to do.<br><br><strong>I quote a paragraph from a Bel'Air Marquise who posted in a topic:</strong><br>"relax lah get so kancheong, I've also attended. Those figures are for overseas expansion.<br>They do have different levels depending on your intention and capacity<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My sister joined and paid only sixty dollars ($60) and got to do the business already. </span><span style="color: red;"><strong>I'm considering for last 2 months and narrowed down my search to 2 possible MLM to do and will make my decision by next week</strong></span><strong>. </strong>[/color]If you want a copy of my compilation and checklist on what to look out for, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">send me a "pte message" with your email address and I'll email you a copy in pdf file ...cheers"</span><br>-----Compare it with those highlighted in bold Blue.

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all Brochow, please don't write your replies as if they were argumentative essays. Long winded goodness!<br><br>I see that you are an advocate of the MLM concept and cannot bear to see it bashed like that in these forums. I salute you for the defence of your ideology.<br><br>If you are indeed looking to join another MLM company, go ahead. Please open your eyes big, keep as sharp a mind as possible and find the right one.<br><br>Though I have never seen an ethical MLM company in Singapore, I do believe in the concept of "networks". Everything is a network, isn't it? From the air to the roads to the waters to the basic hierachy in any organisation, they are all networks.<br><br>In my opinion, the key question is: Is the network concept being abused by the MLM companies?.<br><br>Insurance companies are one good example that works (not all of you may agree though). Commissions are passed down the line but at the end of the day, it is an ethical business. Who brings money to a breadwinner's family when he dies? Relatives and good friends can only do so much. In addition, banks and accountants will start chasing back loans.<br><br>There was this company called "Asaiyo" (spelt correctly?) that is not. Its agents claim to have a mission to help people but are they really doing it? $2,500 for one bloody fuxking magnetic bed just to support the entire commission lineage. And $500 for a plliow stuffed with peacok feathers for better sleep? Where is the truth to it.<br><br>Brochow, if you wanna join an MLM company, please ensure that you can sleep in peace at night and that it really benefits people. It is also a marvellous idea when you mentioned about having financial freedom and retiring early. However, you must be realistic too.<br><br>A lot of you bros have also had bad experiences with Bel' Air or whatever irritating companies but do keep an open mind too yah.</div>

(Bloody hell, the sharing will take almost a few hours until 2-3am). Sian, imagine a small room packed with 30+ people. don't even have space to move, yet still have to listen for 2-3hrs. Then come the finally finale where all the new people will be asked to cut count. Since their plots are discussed here, I wander will they change their tactic this year?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
