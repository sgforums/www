Care to share what are your views? Have you found a good company that you are proud to be working with?<br><br>Some of us here have had bad experience that is why we share it out here to warn people to be careful. I myself have been through it and alot of those I know from that NM/MLM company felt the same way and quit. If suddenly a bunch of people quit like that, don't u think there's a serious problem in hand? Would so many quit if what they say is true? That you can retire young and rich? And be financially independent?<br><br>These are the questions that begs answers, so far I've not seen anyone step up to defend this "AAA/Bel'Air" company and what they're doing is right. All I've seen is bad comments and experience. Especially with their sister company Lampe Berger's scandal in HK and Msia.<br><br>So please jtchong, share with us if you are from Bel'Air...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its people like you that makes the industry so dangerous to work in. Those MLMs that actually work or are good are hardly featured in the forums. Those that are frequently mentioned here have problems. Sometimes its not just the people, its the whole system from bosses to products to people.<br><br>If you waht to explore your potential, there are many safer and time tested methods of doing that. And the best thing is that most of them do not require a monetary investment unlike MLMs. When people say things like<br><blockquote>work his life so hard till die..which majority of the sporean is doing rite now..<br></blockquote>it makes me very sick in my stomach as they seem to think that leading an honest life with no pricks in their conscience is a bad thing. I know many people of the older generation who led a fulfilling life, worked till old and were happy people. These people have true happiness as through the hard times we appreciate the good. Never be afraid to be normal and never be afraid to shine. If you never learn to see the pothole, you will keep falling in everytime you come across another one. These people with real experiences are sharing their experiences to show and tell people of the potential pitfalls and their committment to educating the public about potential pitfalls should put people like you to shame.<br><br>Fancy you coming here, defending a shadow of something you don't really understand. The point of this thread is to discuss about Bel'Air, there is nothing for you to positively contribute if you cannot provide facts as to why the claims against Bel'Air here are untrue. Come back when you have explored your potential of your linguistic ability as it seems far below par.</div>

Base on what you have posted here and in other threads, I must conclude you are the one who know little about MLMs but trying to act as an expert on the topic. Your postings are hardly intelligble and if this is the best you could present to your prospects, I seriously doubt you are going to be successful and if you are, I am amused by the cognitive reasoning ability of those who joined you. Get a mirrior and ask yourself the questions you posted to Rock'Star.<br><br>(a) Am I aware  how Bel'Air system works: The high investment amounts, the hidden costs, the compensation plans, their brainwashing seminars, their "trainings" etc<br><br>(b) How much do I know about MLM and NM ? You seem to know a lot, share with us your experience. I am sure forumers would like to know your expertise on the topics<br><br>Auntie Duke claimed earning 5 to 6 figures. Join her and you will be earning more than the American President with a 6 figures income, Dude <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>Shame on you for having such a shallow views about life <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>
