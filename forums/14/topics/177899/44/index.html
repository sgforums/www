DOn't forget when they are previously in this industry they sold to their families and friends.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all...<br><br>Been a long time since i last posted.<br><br>Just heard that <strong>Bel'air and Shiang Series (local distributor for Bel'air) are going separate ways.</strong> Apparently the CEO for Shiang Series, one of the key leaders in Singapore, has resigned from her post. Bel'air will send someone from Taiwan to take over the existing mess...<br><br>It seems that Bel'air will no longer carry the TCM and skincare pdts, and will only have aromatherapy stuff. The TCM and skincare would probably be sold by Shiang series, who would likely set up their own MLM company.<br><br>So what is going to happen to all the people who are still there. Would they go with Shiang Series to start another MLM, or would they stick to their highly "respected" Chairman Huang in Bel'air? Lets wait and see... :-)<br><br>It would seem that one of the biggest saga in the forum might be coming to an end. How ironic that all those network marketeers work so hard to build up their "Aroma Empire", and claimed they are building a lifetime career... sold out their family, friends and their own souls to be Dukes and Marquises...<br><br>Now the company play them out by splitting up with the parent company in Taiwan. The company did the ultimate Breakaway... so much for building a career with Bel'air...<br><br>What a Joke...and another lesson to us all that MLM just doesn't pay...<br><br></div>
