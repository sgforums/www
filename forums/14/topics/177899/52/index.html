              <p>falconKiller...i have been invited to there to attend some workshops. I am so glad that i saw this forum. I think we would need to help all the victims there!!</p>
              <p>btw, what they are doing now is legal??</p>
              <p>i talked with some of the 'successful entrepreneurs‘ there b4...they claimed that they started their business during their final year of study. They wanted to make changes b4 too late. But they din even say anything about their businesses.</p>
              <p>Because i was curious what they are doing then i start to google for all the entrepreneur names and the company name( where all the workshops held at).</p>
              <p>i am going to speak up with the person who brought me there and ask her to give me a good explanation.</p>

              <p>I was part of them more than one year ago. I seen many illegal or scam ways they are using. Leaders especially Don Lim,Ronald Lim &amp; Chris Chang often pressure ppl in investing many times more $$$ after joining. They earn their $$$ through forcing downlines invest more $$$. They don't earn their $$$ through selling or establish network. </p>
              <p>How can such slow progressing network earn so much $$$? They use unethitical tactics on ppl who have join their network for some time to very heavily invest further though means of hard borrowing. Do you think you can ever earn a single cent when joining them. By joining them, you don't get bankruptcy is consider very lucky.</p>
              <p>Now they are doing Avita pyramid scam, no longer Bel'Air pyramid scam. Those who have priends going to their workshop, pls stop them &amp; ask them read this forum.    </p>

              <p>icic....i am really glad i found this forum.</p>
              <p>The way they are using now is quite clever, they organize a lot of workshop and be very patient towards u...when they find u very desperate to success then they will introduce you network marketing. And they will persuade you how good is network marketing if compare to other distribution channels. I found it fishy when i heard of their so call successful entrepreneurs. I tried to google their name but couldnt find anything.</p>
              <p>When i question them why they want to hide themselves as a MLM group, they replied me that not everyone attending the workshop suitable to become their business partner, they are choosing partner from those workshops. And they claimed that those workshops are not related to the MLM group at all. Because all the workshops are purely to educate people about financial literacy.</p>
              <p>But guess what, their trend analysis told you that network marketing is the best distribution channels using Tim Sales and Charles King video clips. And they also tell you 'wellness' is the next big thing. This is obviously related to what they are doing.</p>

              <p><br>Doing recruitment does not means the person do not have any groups to take care of, all his downlines are inactive or he is not earning so he need to go and find more. Most of them do it because they want to promote to a higher rank. For some of the more established companies, promotion, especially for higher ranks, are based on the number of successful direct downlines the person has and these target may be hard or almost impossible to achieve, for example one company I know require you to have 100 direct managers in order to reach the highest rank. I think some local companies don't even have a hundered managers in the whole company. In order to achieve these rank, they will have to continue to recruit even if they are earning more than enough.</p>

              <p>why they focus on people who have join them and encouraging distributors to buy more is because to make them into believing that they will get more benefits by buying a higher rank in order to earn more overriding commission as like in insurance and property etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but newbies dun understand such will eventually get tricked by them into believing it's good but in fact it's not good for singaporeans as the compensation plan structure and model aren't suitable for Singapore due to the size etc.</p>

              Cashflow game teaches people to take risk and seize opportunities while you still have the chance. Anyone who played the game should know you have to do both if you want to win. 
                      
              In a way, it's not a bad thing but that is after all only a game. If you take the risk and lose, you only lose a game but if you take the risk in real life, you will be losing more.
                      
              And the game encourages people not to have children, that's not very healthy

              NOP and sunshine empire are two different companies but both are under EGA. Take note that unlike NOP, the boss of SE is not james phang.
              
              Anyway, I don't think james phang will have the money to open nti paris if NOP close down because of the lack of business. I think NOP close down because of magic kningdom, like what is happening to SE now.
