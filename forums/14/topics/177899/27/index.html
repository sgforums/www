Certain Groups are telling people to join as count, which requires 12k investment up front. After that you have to recruit other people to invest 12k as well... they call it building a "distribution network", and their aim is to "reach out to the whole population".<br><br>That was my vision as well, which was why i joined them. However the reality is that they are not concerned whether more and more people are using the product in Singapore or not... they just want people to invest the money so that they themselves can get their big fat bonus...<br><br>Thus in my opinion, these guys are running a <strong>cleverly disguised pyramid scam</strong>... only this one is legal as there is actual product sales involved, since the 12k is not pure investment, but rather its used to buy the products ie you buy 12k worth of products at the company. Technically this is not a "traditional" pyramid scam, so the authorities can't do anything about this.<br><br>Be Very Careful of which Bel'air Group you go to.<br><br>So what exactly is bel'air?

I heard last time they said it was Duck Diron's group or so...... Woops.... now the fengsui had drifted to Duck Chris's side???? Real a not, I doubt so lor i mean currently all groups..... and of cos will claimed their own group is the best, boast lah!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>About Baldwin, when I was still in as I belong to other Duck group. I thought he was once a very great General whose they claimed on that time. He the one whose recruited alot of people in that why Chris's group exploded then he the one who "help" Ronald to gain his Duck lor. Picked the Ducks Lim Bro to morn class every morn like their chauffeur. Now both of them become Ducks, he no longer an use to them then said his mindset is wrong or recently he didn't bring in anymore or alot of people then said he is wrong. I think all the leaders behave in the same way, those "M" if they see you didn't bring in any people further although you're still active or positive they will abandon you "slowly" in their list cos lately there not results from you, they consider you "slowly" a "failure" or your mindset is wrong if you won't bring in people anymore. Your presence to them is nothing.   </span></div>
