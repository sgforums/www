Stories of some of the ducks in the picture<br><br>Family 1:<br><span style="color: blue;">3 children (2 dukes, 1 marquis), yet poor parents still have to work to support themselves. Worse, youngest child is literally a parasite who did nothing, don't even look for a job, everyday will ask for $ from siblings and parents as too comfortable inside BA. They'll tell you that their parents work for sake of occupying their time. Bullshiit. If ducks are earning 5 figure monthly, why don't the parents retire and go do things they like as always claimed by them? Worse, the "tua kang" duck son will always tell people that he owned 2 cars and he'll put aside having children now as his focus is on his "career". Bullshiit again. Its b'cos they themselves are feeling very insecure about the future and avoid haing children. His wife still got some uses to him and so, temporary no relationship will be affected. But, nobody will be certain of whats going to happen next...</span><br><br>Family 2:<br><span style="color: green;">2 children (1 duke, 1 marquis). This family "lagi" more "tekon"!!!<br>Always tell downlines to follow strictly the golden rules set up by AAA. But were among the 1st few who broke the rules themselves. Seems that the leader don't care all these, so long as you can bring him $$. If you can, you are considered his "general" (zhan jiang), if not, you'll be condemned as seems as outcast no matter how much you had contributed before. Good news are, they getting their retributions as most of the big groups under them are already non-existent. Why? Cos they also follow the footsteps of their leader and go mess around with each other. Shame!<br>If they still can boost about their income to you, then you'll know that they were all BIG LIARS!!! There's a chinese phrase saying : "Shang liang bu zheng, xia liang wai"<br><br>for those who know their stories, will know what i mean. No need to elaborate further</span><br><br>The conclusion from what i learnt is that most married/attached male leaders will make full use of their wives/girlfriends to WORK and support them with $. Yet, behind their partners back, they are doing very "bad" things to repay their kindness. I already considered myself as rotten egg, however I'm only "xiao wu jian da wu"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, if any of the marquis are your friends, please encourage them to leave. All of them aren't making any money because they always use their money to lend to downline to cut 1+5.. they will start to plan before the money comes in physically.. many of the marquis end up using credit cards to pay for their daaily expenses. What about the cars that the dukes ask them to buy ? With no money, how can they pay the car loans? Whats worse is that they will tell them "you must not have poor people's mindset.." so even with no money they still must live extravagantly...</div>

Please have some respect for the poor souls.. some of the marquis still owe that fat ronald and don lim money, with the IOU in their hands.. so place yourself in their position and think again.. sometimes its really out of their control. Also, some stayed on because of their downlines. They still have to help them as what they have promised. This is a grey area.. whaat we need to do is to get them out.. whats the use of verbally abusing them here? if you r just venting your frustrations, maybe you should be more cautious with your words. Please do not get the wrong idea.. i'm not one of them.. but was an ex-belairian.. that i can admit.. we are here to share the facts .. not to defame any one of them.. especially the innocent parties..</div>

It doesn't seem like it.. Please have some respect for the poor souls.. some of the marquis still owe that fat ronald and don lim money, with the IOU in their hands.. so place yourself in their position and think again.. sometimes its really out of their control. Also, some stayed on because of their downlines. They still have to help them as what they have promised. This is a grey area.. whaat we need to do is to get them out.. whats the use of verbally abusing them here? if you r just venting your frustrations, maybe you should be more cautious with your words. Please do not get the wrong idea.. i'm not one of them.. but was an ex-belairian.. that i can admit.. we are here to share the facts .. not to defame any one of them.. especially the innocent parties..<br><br>alter_eeg0 it is the voice of antiFGN , but if those poor souls are going to repeat what has been done to them to others in the future , then what poor souls are they . They should STOP what they are doing n take responsibility of what happen to them , not duplicate what had hapeen to them (just imagine if them duplicate to your sisters,brothers, love ones).<br>They should step out n cause awareness to the public so less love ones will fall into the trap.<br>As FGN was mentioned here i believe The leaders like Chriss Changg , Jeann Ho should be the head evil doers because they dupicate the limm brothers , they all their downlines to leave Not pay them like what they do to the rest , then they can,t dupicate those evil doing<br><br>As what antiFGN post<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> We had cut counts, marquis n dukes.
