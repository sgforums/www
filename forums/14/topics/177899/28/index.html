            <div class='col-md body'>It seems like it's getting from bad to worse. I am one of those who had taken up 1+5. Everyone who is new to mlm, I would like to say... yes they have a refund policy of 90% of initial investment for a period of 6months..<br><br><strong>BUT</strong><br><br>What they did not say is that if the uplines can't afford to pay, or don't want to pay, there is nothing you can do about it. You can just suck your thumb. It's another way of saying, "F**k off, this is your problem, not ours"<br><br>(Is my contract valid since certain terms and conditions are veiled from me when I signed it? They have deliberately withheld it from me...)<br><br>There are many more terms &amp; conditions, many more sad stories... and I vouch that every single bad points brought up by everyone here IS true.<br><br>I hope that we can do something soon. I for one would want to organise somekind of meeting for all those interested in bringing those evil con men to their knees...<br><br>(are we allowed to leave our personal email here?)</div>

And he always said he live in condo in bukit timah...<br><br>Well...<br>Here comes the fact..<br><br>Condo in bukit timah had already long been sold..<br>dunno where the hell he is living right now but quite sure he is eagerly looking for a new place to live..<br><br>As for the jaguar,<br>i heard from sources that he was intending to sell it off in order to pay his debts.<br>In fact, it was said that he was quite heavy in debts.<br>He tried to push the price high and i think thats the reason why it isnt sold yet.<br><br>And another thing, ever wonder how Diron Chua manage to challenge duke?<br>he pump in the money himself to buy up a Marquis position under him...<br>something similar to a 1+15.<br><br>These are all facts that are unescapable..<br><br>I tried using these to verify with my upline Marquis.<br>He put it in another way that Diron Chua indeed is wanting to sell his car but the reason because is he wanted to change a new car. And truth is he is not in need to sell it at all...<br>if thats the case, y bother to sell it in the first place?<br><br>Furthermore, i've met up with another sideline for dinner once.<br>Without even near AAA topic, she started to explain to me how busy is Diron Chua everyday going around looking at houses and new cars because he wanted to change them liao...<br>Wonder ifs shes blind &amp; deaf or just simply stupid?<br>Obviously my upline marquis knows and afraid i could use this news and affect my sidelines and thus come up with such a stupid story to hide everything from them..<br><br>How rubbish...<br><br>So when he really sel his jaguar, everything will come to light..<br>But i wonder he still dare to sell it, because if he does then he got to come up with so much excuses..<br><br>And also,<br>all the blind downlines...<br>take a look at all the uplines..<br>no one is being true to themselves at all..<br>living their life in a pack of lies..<br><br>if u all really like to believe them so much,<br>continue to stay in ur dreams..<br><br>But dont realise its too late when u wake up!<br><br></div>
