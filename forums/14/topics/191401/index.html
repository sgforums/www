            <div class='col-md body'>To: A friend that I have not yet made<br><br>IÂ’ve heard you have been influenced to join a company involved in Â“Network MarketingÂ”, a nicer term for Multi-Level Marketing or MLM. Perhaps it is someone close to you that brought you in and introduced this opportunity to you? I know you were told to keep and open mind and be receptive of the ideas that were presented to you and the whole idea of making money, befriending people and at the same time expanding your social circle seems like a very good investment for an amount that you are willing to take out as an investment.<br><br>Possibly you have your parents, siblings or girlfriend/boyfriend in mind, thinking of how this additional source of income will aid your finances and help you provide for them better than you currently can. ItÂ’s a very filial and responsible train of thought that you have and somehow everything seems to make sense in paying a fee to participate in their programs and learn from their experiences and see what they can offer you to change your life for the better. Perhaps itÂ’s a shred of hope, a chance that you are hoping to buy.<br><br>I regret that I have to be the one who has to remove the blindfold that has been masking you. The world is a harsh and cruel place and we all have experienced some form of bad luck in the hands of fate. IÂ’m afraid that your participation in MLM might be a very painful experience indeed. I know you are thinking that IÂ’m trying to disillusion you or spoil your chances of succeeding but do hear me out, with an open mind, just like when you first heard the manager and others talk about the benefits of joining MLMs.<br><br>Let me first touch on the legal aspects of MLM. ItÂ’s a fact: MLMs are illegal in Singapore. As long as you make any money from introducing a friend to buy a license or distributorship, you are a party in propagating an illegal scheme. The law unfortunately does not look upon kindly upon people who actively participate in such schemes, finding them as guilty of breaking the law as the original creators of the scheme.<br><br>Secondly, have you heard of the claims your Â“uplinesÂ” have told you about making loads of money? Is a car enough proof for you? How many of the distributors actually can get to that level? Why are the same people quoted over and over again as the ones who have made it? A recent research by the Consumer Awareness Institute has found that gambling has a higher chance of making you rich compared to participating in an MLM scheme with a 97% chance of losing when gambling and a 99% chance of losing money when participating in an MLM scheme. Unless they show you the statistics of how many people recruited actually make money and back it up with income tax reports, you should be wary of the claims. A cheque on the wall can be written anytime and pasted there.<br><br>Thirdly, what exactly are you selling? Do the prices of the products sold make any sense to you? How about their recognition and reliability? The biggest question you need to ask yourself is Â“Am I selling a product or am I selling distributorships?Â” Lets take a look at a normal honest business like a franchise, which is similar to a scheme you are participating in. Franchisee purchases a franchise from the main company. He sets up a shop and sells goods belonging to the company with help from the main company in the areas of supply, stocks, marketing and promotions, all with some commission taken by the main company. However, his main business and sales volume still comes from selling tangible items. What are you selling? You are sold an idea of a franchise and you are selling this very same idea to others while paying a large amount of money to the guy who originally sold you the idea of selling ideas. Confused? Lets say you Â“boughtÂ” a distributorship (idea) at $1000. Then you Â“sellÂ” this idea to a friend and he buys it too at $1000. However, you get only $50 out of this sale and the company takes the rest. This process can be repeated with people he sells to giving you a fraction of the money he spent. How much does the company earn compared to you?<br><br>If I were the boss of a MLM company, IÂ’d be a very happy man. All my employees would:<br>1)	Pay me to work for me.<br>2)	Work very hard for me for free and earn money for me at the same time.<br>3)	Feel lousy when they canÂ’t sell enough.<br>4)	Sack themselves and leave if they donÂ’t perform up to standard<br>5)	Find other equally silly people to do the above 4 points for me.<br><br>Are you starting to feel a little bit conned?<br><br>DonÂ’t worry, there are a lot of people IÂ’ve spoken to who have started doubting the moment they handed over their money. The smarter ones did some research on the internet and found disturbing information that what they are participating in might be a scam. Others found that it was terribly unprofitable to participate. Then suddenly, most realize that the deal seems shadier than what they had thought at first.<br><br>Firstly, the original agreement, the page with all the clauses that they signed was not given back to them. Do you remember that whenever you purchased something theyÂ’d always give you the invoice that you signed back? That is a legal requirement. Next, they realize that the document they signed is full of legal disclaimers and references to terms and conditions that are nowhere in the contract. A sick feeling comes to the stomach as they realized that they have signed away their 7 day cooling off period and 60 day refund time and placed the fate of their ill-spent monies in the hands of the company. Best of all, the company does not recognize you as their employee or agent or representative. How about a proper official receipt that was supposed to be given to you when you make a purchase? Have you gotten one?<br><br>But the most devastating effect of participating in MLM does not lie in the monetary loss.<br><br>It lies in the network of friends you have harvested and dried up. Some have lost faith in you after you sold them a package and they lost their money. Some have heard about the truth in MLM and have kept their distance. How about the family members, cousins, friends, colleagues, school mates that you have listed down as your potential targets? Slowly your friends will notice your change as you see them as money-making opportunities instead. Some will feel betrayed by you. Some will oblige your request in the sheer goodwill of their nature, only to feel cheated and stupid for their moment of weakness. You are trading your social network for money. IÂ’m sure your friends, buddies, relatives and family are worth more than the money that you earn by recruiting them.<br><br>Suddenly, its not just only about you anymore is it?<br><br>You are young and have a bright future ahead of you. Do you know that the law does not differentiate between a distributor selling and promoting the scheme from the mastermind who created the scheme in the first placed? You are equally liable to be charged in court once it has been exposed. That will definitely throw a spanner in the works for your university studies. On top of that, if you are a NSF or a regular in the army, propagating or even being part of such a scheme will result in you being court martialled. Trust me, I studied Military Law and represented people before in a court martial.<br><br>IÂ’ve much more information regarding MLM that you might find useful. I feel that you have been kind and tolerant enough to read three pages worth and its best for me to stop here and let you reflect. Do PM me for more information and perhaps we could have an exchange of ideas regarding your MLM scheme.<br><br>Your Friend,<br>Eikei<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, I've written that quite some time ago when I started on my MLM awareness campaign. I've distilled what my friends and others who became friends with me told me though online discussions about their experiences with MLM companies and then put it in a letter form, hoping to get at least a few people thinking about what they have just committed to do.<br><br>No, I'm not in any MLM company. Astral Mag did approach me many years ago when I was still a minor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Currently I'm quite into helping people leave NTI which I feel exemplifies all that is bad in an MLM scheme. I believe I've talked to and even met up with quite a few people who post here on the MLM forums and I do hope some people who out of curiosity have come to SGFORUMS wondering why their company told them not to read this forum will read the letter and then it will sow some seeds of doubt in their heads.<br><br>Its so hard to reach out and stop these people and whenever I see the queue at the NTI payment counter, I just feel so sad for the people who are parting with their money. I've gone there a few times to help people and I've never wanted to make a scene there so I just watch as the 10 or 20 people get pressured right in front of my face and its so darn irritating.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They won't listen one....only when they lose their money and frens then they will wake up....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Eikei:</div><div class="quote_body">To: A friend that I have not yet made<br><br>IÂ’ve heard you have been influenced to join a company involved in Â“Network MarketingÂ”, a nicer term for Multi-Level Marketing or MLM. Perhaps it is someone close to you that brought you in and introduced this opportunity to you? I know you were told to keep and open mind and be receptive of the ideas that were presented to you and the whole idea of making money, befriending people and at the same time expanding your social circle seems like a very good investment for an amount that you are willing to take out as an investment.<br><br>Possibly you have your parents, siblings or girlfriend/boyfriend in mind, thinking of how this additional source of income will aid your finances and help you provide for them better than you currently can. ItÂ’s a very filial and responsible train of thought that you have and somehow everything seems to make sense in paying a fee to participate in their programs and learn from their experiences and see what they can offer you to change your life for the better. Perhaps itÂ’s a shred of hope, a chance that you are hoping to buy.<br><br>I regret that I have to be the one who has to remove the blindfold that has been masking you. The world is a harsh and cruel place and we all have experienced some form of bad luck in the hands of fate. IÂ’m afraid that your participation in MLM might be a very painful experience indeed. I know you are thinking that IÂ’m trying to disillusion you or spoil your chances of succeeding but do hear me out, with an open mind, just like when you first heard the manager and others talk about the benefits of joining MLMs.<br><br>Let me first touch on the legal aspects of MLM. ItÂ’s a fact: MLMs are illegal in Singapore. As long as you make any money from introducing a friend to buy a license or distributorship, you are a party in propagating an illegal scheme. The law unfortunately does not look upon kindly upon people who actively participate in such schemes, finding them as guilty of breaking the law as the original creators of the scheme.<br><br>Secondly, have you heard of the claims your Â“uplinesÂ” have told you about making loads of money? Is a car enough proof for you? How many of the distributors actually can get to that level? Why are the same people quoted over and over again as the ones who have made it? A recent research by the Consumer Awareness Institute has found that gambling has a higher chance of making you rich compared to participating in an MLM scheme with a 97% chance of losing when gambling and a 99% chance of losing money when participating in an MLM scheme. Unless they show you the statistics of how many people recruited actually make money and back it up with income tax reports, you should be wary of the claims. A cheque on the wall can be written anytime and pasted there.<br><br>Thirdly, what exactly are you selling? Do the prices of the products sold make any sense to you? How about their recognition and reliability? The biggest question you need to ask yourself is Â“Am I selling a product or am I selling distributorships?Â” Lets take a look at a normal honest business like a franchise, which is similar to a scheme you are participating in. Franchisee purchases a franchise from the main company. He sets up a shop and sells goods belonging to the company with help from the main company in the areas of supply, stocks, marketing and promotions, all with some commission taken by the main company. However, his main business and sales volume still comes from selling tangible items. What are you selling? You are sold an idea of a franchise and you are selling this very same idea to others while paying a large amount of money to the guy who originally sold you the idea of selling ideas. Confused? Lets say you Â“boughtÂ” a distributorship (idea) at $1000. Then you Â“sellÂ” this idea to a friend and he buys it too at $1000. However, you get only $50 out of this sale and the company takes the rest. This process can be repeated with people he sells to giving you a fraction of the money he spent. How much does the company earn compared to you?<br><br>If I were the boss of a MLM company, IÂ’d be a very happy man. All my employees would:<br>1)	Pay me to work for me.<br>2)	Work very hard for me for free and earn money for me at the same time.<br>3)	Feel lousy when they canÂ’t sell enough.<br>4)	Sack themselves and leave if they donÂ’t perform up to standard<br>5)	Find other equally silly people to do the above 4 points for me.<br><br>Are you starting to feel a little bit conned?<br><br>DonÂ’t worry, there are a lot of people IÂ’ve spoken to who have started doubting the moment they handed over their money. The smarter ones did some research on the internet and found disturbing information that what they are participating in might be a scam. Others found that it was terribly unprofitable to participate. Then suddenly, most realize that the deal seems shadier than what they had thought at first.<br><br>Firstly, the original agreement, the page with all the clauses that they signed was not given back to them. Do you remember that whenever you purchased something theyÂ’d always give you the invoice that you signed back? That is a legal requirement. Next, they realize that the document they signed is full of legal disclaimers and references to terms and conditions that are nowhere in the contract. A sick feeling comes to the stomach as they realized that they have signed away their 7 day cooling off period and 60 day refund time and placed the fate of their ill-spent monies in the hands of the company. Best of all, the company does not recognize you as their employee or agent or representative. How about a proper official receipt that was supposed to be given to you when you make a purchase? Have you gotten one?<br><br>But the most devastating effect of participating in MLM does not lie in the monetary loss.<br><br>It lies in the network of friends you have harvested and dried up. Some have lost faith in you after you sold them a package and they lost their money. Some have heard about the truth in MLM and have kept their distance. How about the family members, cousins, friends, colleagues, school mates that you have listed down as your potential targets? Slowly your friends will notice your change as you see them as money-making opportunities instead. Some will feel betrayed by you. Some will oblige your request in the sheer goodwill of their nature, only to feel cheated and stupid for their moment of weakness. You are trading your social network for money. IÂ’m sure your friends, buddies, relatives and family are worth more than the money that you earn by recruiting them.<br><br>Suddenly, its not just only about you anymore is it?<br><br>You are young and have a bright future ahead of you. Do you know that the law does not differentiate between a distributor selling and promoting the scheme from the mastermind who created the scheme in the first placed? You are equally liable to be charged in court once it has been exposed. That will definitely throw a spanner in the works for your university studies. On top of that, if you are a NSF or a regular in the army, propagating or even being part of such a scheme will result in you being court martialled. Trust me, I studied Military Law and represented people before in a court martial.<br><br>IÂ’ve much more information regarding MLM that you might find useful. I feel that you have been kind and tolerant enough to read three pages worth and its best for me to stop here and let you reflect. Do PM me for more information and perhaps we could have an exchange of ideas regarding your MLM scheme.<br><br>Your Friend,<br>Eikei<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Mr X gets enticed into joining MLM.<br>He persuades people around him (including YOU) to join him in a new business opportunity,quoting the need to have dual income, need to have entrepreneur spirit, need to change mindset..... He will also quote big and prominent names and corporations and say they are into MLM also...names like Bill Gates, IBM, Microsoft, Nike etc.....<br><br>He also claims that his MLM company is the best, with the best product, best mgmt, best team, best remuneration structure.<br>bankers, lawyers, heart surgeons and 747 pilots have joined this company.<br>top men in this company drives Porsche, lives in 2 bungalows etc....<br><br>He also mentions why things like why work for 40 years and retire for 10years. why not work for 10 years and retire for 40 years.<br><br>2) Mr X stops bothering you, taking it that you are hopeless and stubborn and ignorant.<br>Off he goes on his new "business" venture.<br><br>typical paraniod questions thrown at you in the heat of frustration trying to<br>convince you includes:<br><br>i) pyramid selling? can you explain to me what exactly is pyramid selling and the difference between pyramid selling and MLM????????<br><br>ii) you not interested then you ask so many questions for what???!!!!!<br>iii) if I answer this question of yours, you agree to buy and join???, then???!!!!<br><br>You will see him approaching people in all scenarios from a wedding banquet, a drinking session, a mahjong session, lunch, Incamp training etc.....<br><br>3) Mr X having been rejected by the numerous people that he approaches, now complains to you, and starts to bad-mouth those who reject him, labelling them as no ambition, kiasi, no entrepreneurship and so on. But notice that he will not mention a slight hint of the MLM business he is involved in to you, even if you ask him. Vague answers will be given like new way, new business, new concept of selling.<br><br>4) Mr X now having failed considerably to make good on his MLM business, now makes a call to you, asking casually if you are interested in joining his business venture. at most, he will mention the product itself,(magnetic mattress, health food, gold coin) but not the MLM company name itself.<br><br>5) Mr X could have approach his MLM upline trying to refund the product, but this will not be made known to people whom he had approached. Whether the refund is successful or not, only Mr X knows, (I would see this as something being done BACKSTAGE, away from the audience)<br><br>6) Mr X now still stuck, keeps to himself and stop mentioning the business. this is where the embarassment part comes into play. Extreme embarassment meaning he has shown to you so much faith, hope and promise in the thing at the very beginning and now it has failed him entirely and make him so lost. still he presists and refuses to admit its not working, for saving face sake,<br><br>7) so once in a while Mr X unleashes it again,"how would you like to join me in my business."<br>and the name Robert Kiyosaki is probably a standard dish being served in this whole banquet.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i am neutral on this, i do support MLM as a mean of distribution in a business sense, but its the damned people i hate<br><br>Some dont price their stuff competitively with the market of similar goods, charge damn high registration fees, focused on recruiting instead of selling, and a lot of companies which focused on youngsters train a bunch of hooligans than professional distributors.<br><br>It defeats the aim of distributing products to the masses.<br><br>Worst of all, Singapore's laws on MLM is damn flawed<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with MLM is MLM is not the future, its the past! With internet, who needs to direct sell anymore? MLM was invented to bring products to far flung, remote towns in America where there aren't any large departmental stores or malls nearby, giving the buyer the benefit of the convenience of not needing to travel and giving the seller a little incentive for carrying the product. In this age of Ebay and other online malls, auction sites with free delivery, is there a need for a MLM network, especially in Singapore where the malls selling such stuff are less than an hour's ride away? (And most stuff are cheaper at the malls.)<br><br>Dell is the world's largest Direct Seller and they don't have distributors and so on, all their buisness is done on the internet and through telemarketing. No commissions and no promoters pushing stuff, except at roadshows. And the Dell family ranks amongst the top 5 richest people in the world.<br><br>MLM is such a misnomer as they aren't really doing marketing. I know a bit about sales and marketing/product branding and this is absolutely not the way to push a product.<br><br>Forcing or coercing a friend to buy into a plan is like forced marriage. Some work out, some don't but there is sure alot of misery involved in the process.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Eikei:<br>To: A friend that I have not yet made<br><br>I regret that I have to be the one who has to remove the blindfold that has been masking you. The world is a harsh and cruel place and we all have experienced some form of bad luck in the hands of fate. IÂ’m afraid that your participation in MLM might be a very painful experience indeed. I know you are thinking that IÂ’m trying to disillusion you or spoil your chances of succeeding but do hear me out, with an open mind, just like when you first heard the manager and others talk about the benefits of joining MLMs.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Yes,we live a broken down world. But only those w/o faith will use bad luck and fate as an excuse to be responsible for their bad encounter, which was a result of their own choice made. What we choose today will determine our future.</strong></span><br><br>Let me first touch on the legal aspects of MLM. ItÂ’s a fact: MLMs are illegal in Singapore. As long as you make any money from introducing a friend to buy a license or distributorship, you are a party in propagating an illegal scheme. The law unfortunately does not look upon kindly upon people who actively participate in such schemes, finding them as guilty of breaking the law as the original creators of the scheme.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>FYI, commission is paid only when there is product purchased by the new distributor. Entrance fee is normally for starter kits and does not involve any products and hence no commission earned from here. However, new distributors are normally advised to purchase some products for own usage and from there gain knowledge of the products. But ultimately it is still up to individual to decide if he/she wants to buy once becoming a member/distributor.</strong></span><br><br>Secondly, have you heard of the claims your Â“uplinesÂ” have told you about making loads of money? Is a car enough proof for you? How many of the distributors actually can get to that level? Why are the same people quoted over and over again as the ones who have made it? A recent research by the Consumer Awareness Institute has found that gambling has a higher chance of making you rich compared to participating in an MLM scheme with a 97% chance of losing when gambling and a 99% chance of losing money when participating in an MLM scheme. Unless they show you the statistics of how many people recruited actually make money and back it up with income tax reports, you should be wary of the claims. A cheque on the wall can be written anytime and pasted there.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Well, it is true that earning huge income is possible in Network Marketing. All because of the leverage effect and the residual income generated through the network. It is also true tat not everyone can make it to the top. Can every student in a class make it to the top? No, simply because all of us have different perspective and focus. Not able to rise to the top doesn't mean tat you loose everything. Do you quit if you are not at the top level mgt in your company after working for a number of yrs?<br>We r talking abt doing business and not playing with chance.<br>Do you ask for any statistic when you go interview for job to assure you tat the company still have the capacity to grow and will not collapse after you join them? If you understand MLM, you should know tat every distributor is an independent business partner. There is risk to be taken. Thus it is not for the faint hearted and impatience. If you have doubts, don't join.</strong></span><br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
