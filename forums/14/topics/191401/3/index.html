Euphemisms everywhere for topics they avoid, it just seems like the prefer to use Network Marketing to replace the term Recruiting MLM or to say in a worse way, a Product Based Pyramid Scheme.<br><br>Anyway accusing me of not caring is one of the most untrue statements you can make for it is out of this concern I have for the young people who are easily swayed by pressure tactics and deceitful marketing that I post this topic. I don't need to say anything but the forumers who are here long enough know what I have done to help others here.<br><br>I'm throughly amused that I have become the dark side. I was telling some people its so easy to be angry with people like you but its even easier to feel sad for you. I guess when you have failed through and through, you will not come back to say that you regret all the things you have done. One off posters like you will go on and live your own misguided lives and when one day you give up, SGFORUMs will become such a bad memory of a life that was wasted chasing the end of a rainbow for the illusive pot of gold that you will not want to come back again.</div></blockquote>Pls be clear tat my response is directed to u only. And whichever way u felt is appropriate to term MLM, pls do so.<br><br>I guess my words are quite simple to understd. Tat was a piece of advise. If u think it profits u then take it otherwise forget it.<br><br>Whichever side, just remember our context is purely abt MLM. I choose to respond to ur post becoz I felt the need to do so. Every statement I cast into tis thread doesn't contains anger or any -ve feelings on u. If I can't accept certain words in forumers replies, then I will choose to refrain myself from participating. Like u'd mentioned previously, don't just listen to wat u like to hear.<br>FYI, I am not afraid of failure for a champion is not one tat afraid of failures but one tat doesn't gif up. There is nothing for me to regret of even if I don't make it in MLM. My focus in life is walking right wif God and not the wealth in the world.<br>Misguided or not, I guess it is not up to u to say. And unless u can futurecast or prophesy, otherwise refrain urself from boasting abt tomorrow. Pls stick to the topic and donÂ’t go off key.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is counting that the products sold by MLMs are as popular as those sold by normal companies. Personally, I don't feel that items sold by MLMs are in great demand and you'd get a much better sales volume selling other things instead. When I worked part time selling laptops some time back, I could close over 10 deals in less than 8 hours, works out to approx $150 to $200 a day as a part timer. Imagine if you worked full time instead. For MLMs, how many people must you close and how much effort does it take to earn this amount of money? Is working as a one man industry creating your own demand by convincing others better than already tapping into the current demand?</div>
