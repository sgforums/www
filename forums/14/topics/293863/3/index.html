              <p> In MLM, you can earn $100k per month. You can but not in short period. Maybe 5 to 7 years. Provided people work your system.</p>
              <p>Haha.. not say God like. They just want to tell you about their coach and hold them in high posture. I don't think it is necessary. No need to edify till too high up till they look like God.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure about their system cause my group never hold people back. When you promised 1 hour presentation, it has to be just 1 hour. I experienced what you had experienced before. They didn't managed to sign you up then they find another person. then another person right? That's hard selling. I feel it's wrong doing.</p>
              <p>As for this case, it has to do with their system. NEVER TRICK PEOPLE DOWN. That what I always tell my people. What is the rationale behind it to trick people down? This shows you cant be trusted. In business, we need trustworthy people right? They just shot themselves on their on foot.</p>
              <p>I think they should not criticise anyone's job. They should first do fact finding. They should always respect their prospect. :)</p>

              <p>Self employed? Maybe not now. In the long term maybe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Too bad Enyouth is an unethical and despicable company which teaches, and I mean teaches agents to trick people down and insult their future to break their morale and then they would "come to their rescue" by offering MLM as a way out. They are also the ones which hide their identity as MLM even til the last minute by claiming itself as a SLM company or even agents are "starting own business". It is a shame to the sales line. In sales, first thing, on the surface would be, customer service. Never insult customers, always put him first, etc. Then, ethics, which Enyouth has none.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not against the system of MLM, but rather the unethical ways how it is run. Telling half truths, whole lies, tricking people down, using underhand tactics, hard persuasion, etc. Organisations like EY, VE and SE deserve to be condemned for such actions.</p>

              <p>That's disturbing... it seems the Phangs are one unethical bunch. I thought is this Raymond Lim guy (not transport minister)?</p>

              <p>speaking of unethical.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my fren wanted to join this Lamp Berger. He gave the money to his best fren. B4 his best fren gave it to management, he decided to quit. His best fren agreed wont give it to management and will return the money to him. Suddenly, his best fren said what if he wanted to give the money to management, what will my fren do? My fren cursed this and that. his best fren finally agreed to not give the money to management..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guess what. Next day, my fren is a member. And all the talks bout he already gave money and need to be responsible. Best fren betraying best fren.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What u guys think bout this? I feel that my fren did a mistake but his best fren did a terrible mistake after knowing my fren doesnt want to join and he's holding my frens money and yet, he gave it to management after all bullshit promises. Left my fren stranded but he never do anything even if paid. Who wanted to be sub-line of your up-line that is a fucktard?</p>

              <p>it depends on how much they invest in this kind of mlm.. the more they invest, the more probability to trick and lie to ppl no matter what.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A good mlm wont use tricks to lie to ppl. but they will use different approching  method. Some are professional approach. A good mlm will not teach u to reveal product or name of company when u go and get ur fren to know more bout this stuff. the one who ask u to reveal company and products name are a loser one. so better quit early</p>
