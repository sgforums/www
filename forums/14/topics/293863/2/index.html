But my case is that I ownself walk into the lion's den<br><br>I ask my friend got job anot cos I holiday, then he say his friend got ask him about this job but since he studying, he didnt take that offer. Then he tell me about this job so a go go join lor......<br><br>I never heard of MLM or saleman stuff before, so my getting conned difficulty level was rather easy<br><br>At first I thought they are good, treat them like good friends, like 2nd home like that..... until the part when the manager ask me to write the all my friends contact details then a fear start to struck me...... I thought I am going to sell to other people like big coporation, but the fact is I am going to sell to my friends<br><br>After a while I think a was thinking too much about it and think it is ok to sell to my friends (I was crazy then)<br><br>So I just sms around to ask those close ppl for sales appointment.....<br><br>Mentality at this point : MLM is GOOD!!!!! (Obviously after I went through their   propaganda training)<br><br>After I ran out of close friend to sms.... Time to kick in the phone tactic I learn to ask the not so close friend for appointment.... So I go the phone area to make calls. While finding my contacts, I heard a nearby guy calling. He is doing recruitment, and I heard he said a whole lots of stuff which are not true, obviously lying to get recruits in. Then I start to realised EVERYONE IS USING THE SAME TACTIC to recruit, including their friends......<br><br>How can they resort to such unmoral and unethical ways to recruit people? I know after my first sales, I will be able to recruit and I am definetly not going to lie to get people in. So I left......<br><br>Mentality at this point : MLM is still good, just that some black sheep company is destroying it using unethical ways<br><br>Few weeks later, someone call saying he is from XX group (Tink Tink) and say there is this job offer, mass recruitment for those ppl waiting for o level results. I play on with him and recorded the conversation. He didnt realised I used to be inside and know all the inside stuff. He lied about the pay and keep insisting that he wants to meet me at his company (which is the lion's den)<br><br>Mentality of MLM at this point : Fck-CARE!!!!<br></p></div>

              <p>Isn't the whole point of MLM to get passive income? Isn't that the whole pitch for MLM? That you can earn heaps of money and retire early?</p>
              <p>Isn't the only way to earn passive income is to recruit? If you just sell the product, that's not passive income is it?</p>

              <p>Ok.. I see your problems. You dont really have to persuade people to buy. If they dont like it, then it's alright. You just share with them about the product. If they like it, they will buy it. Have you read "The Next Trillion" by Paul Zane Pilzer?</p>
              <p>Yes.. You are right. MLM is to leverage on the power of mass number of people. But you don't have to recruit every single one of them. For me.. I just need 6.</p>

              <p>Ahh... but it only seems like you just need 6. But you really need many more than that because many drop out.</p>
              <p>Assuming that the commission scheme is 4 levels deep and cuts off after that, the problem is you need 6 who are able to recruit and sell. And those 6 need to find 36 who can recruit and sell. And those 36 need to find 216 who are able to recruit and sell.</p>
              <p>Let's also not forget that you're not the only one recruiting.</p>
