              <p>normally , from what i know, if a company has a policy for members who want to get to higher level by investing more money (eg, a few 10K more), it means their company are not getting much money from members and are trying to get more income by doin that. Roughly means they are getting loss..</p>

              <p>best pick them up to the place instead of them going to the meeting place by themself. and do not try to trick them that you're just goin for lunch or u want them to meet some pretty gals and then suddenly they are in your company. They will hate u forever. Be cool and dont reveil wat your doin ( just say your doin some business) and company's name and product no matter what.( This is very important )(cus if they heard of your product and company, they wont think twice to reject u, especially if they have been to the company b4)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>most important , Team Up with your advisor.</p>
              <p>U sit middle, fren sit on ur left. advisor on ur right. all of u must not facing company entrance.</p>
              <p>intro advisor, how long hes exp in this business, and let advisor do the talking. after advisor finish, u continue ur talk, let him think how is this and that. if ur fren have doubt try to answer all of them, never easily accept their excuse of parents or no money, try and try to get them into benefit of joining company , of course u must let them know the marketing plan and the benefit or they don know  wat benefit are u talking and they will say u bullshit without anything to show. Conversation must not be longer than 10 mins. At last minute, show the form or anything for ur fren to sign.</p>

              <p>Please, it still does not justify tricking people down. Yes, if you say up front "its MLM" maybe 90% of people will reject, at least they will not have bad impression of the organisation. Lets say you trick people down, hiding truth about business, giving excuses like meeting up, etc etc and finally the poor victim is at your office. Your uplines try to persuade them in. Lets take it that 90% of people will reject...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok nvm... lets say your upline is really good and only 75% will reject. These 75% would be the angry ones, being tricked down to company, etc. Tell me what's worse. 90% of people rejected, but rejected 'happily' or 75% rejected, very angry for being tricked down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think about it. Ask yourself. If I were to trick you down... Say I were to say "hey bro, long time no see, I buy u dinner"... Then at dinner I say, hey i wanna show u something. Dont ask too much you'll know when u get there. Then I show u a "miracle product". Tell me. Would you be happy being tricked down to listen to something you're not interested or already hate? Think about it and tell me.</p>

              <p>Please, it still does not justify tricking people down. Yes, if
              you say up front "its MLM" maybe 90% of people will reject, at
              least they will not have bad impression of the organisation. Lets
              say you trick people down, hiding truth about business, giving
              excuses like meeting up, etc etc and finally the poor victim is at
              your office. Your uplines try to persuade them in. Lets take it
              that 90% of people will reject...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok nvm... lets say your upline is really good and only 75% will
              reject. These 75% would be the angry ones, being tricked down to
              company, etc. Tell me what's worse. 90% of people rejected, but
              rejected 'happily' or 75% rejected, very angry for being tricked
              down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think about it. Ask yourself. If I were to trick you down... Say
              I were to say "hey bro, long time no see, I buy u dinner"... Then
              at dinner I say, hey i wanna show u something. Dont ask too much
              you'll know when u get there. Then I show u a "miracle product".
              Tell me. Would you be happy being tricked down to listen to
              something you're not interested or already hate? Think about it and
              tell me.</p>

              <p>elementalangel, are u in the mlm b4? if your not, perhaps you shouldnt really tell how how much ppl might join if they know your doin mlm. perhaps u r thinking if your the person who are invited by mlm person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and its not 100% that ppl will join no matter how u tell them its mlm b4 u bring them in. People who are experienced enough will know reveiling company and product and what ur doin will not work. but u guys can try and experiment this yourself but bear in mind, any fren has possibility to be a down-line, worth it to sacrifice few potentials just for experiment?</p>

              <p>there are always rules in MLM company, Some unprofessional MLM company would just ask u to cheat ur fren and straight away ask them to come in the company. Experienced company wont do that unless u urself did the opposite way or to experiment your own way.</p>
              <p>bout buying dinner and saying wanna show something doesnt mean your tricking your fren. like u said, Hey, i wanna show u something. That is not tricking but thats the truth ? Why wanna bring fren to company? Cuz there are more products to be shown than just simply talking bullshit or just by giving brochure without having them see the real product.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IT depends on ppl. some ppl just hate this MLM stuff but some who wanna earn more money and have the same passion might have interested. Its too one-sided to think how ppl will hate it and forgetting some1 who might be interested in it.</p>

              <p>all MLM plans are actually very very enticing... it would even lure someone who is really skeptical about mlms by tricking them down and making them listen to ur advisor... dont u agree? thats y even though people hate mlm now... there would always be some of those people who have been tricked before to fall into the same trap once again...</p>
              <p><br>however if some one is already open to the mlm concept... he is not against it... and you tell him about it... he readily agrees to listen to your talk... which could even lure in people who actually hate mlm.. what is the probility that the person would be lured in???</p>

              <p>if its just about listening MLM plan or anything about MLM products, it doesnt mean MLM need to trick them into this. As i said, there are many unethical ppl who lure anyone with bullshit promises and even tricked them into dinner but straight away to company. Some ppl will do anything just to get them into this, but proffesional ones wont do this kind of thing. They just bring them, show them, and last decision is still yours. and that's it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ppl hate MLM bcuz of the ppl. Unethical ppl will only make more ppl hate them due to stupid promises. It always depend on how MLM ppl wanna do their job. MLM itself is a good business, just the unethical ppl in it will do anything to get members.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No matter what, its still depend if u wanna join or not. Last decision still yours. Anyone can straight away leave if they find themselves in a company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Plus is it because ppl are telling us MLM is bad, and that opinion alone affect some1 whos interested? Why not if a person really interested to know and just go and get more knowledge. Last decision is still yours wat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont know how many of u here get tricked in a bad way. Too bad nowadays there are just too many unethical MLM person.</p>

              <p>Yes, I've seen people say "I treat u dinner, long time no see liao"... Just "dinner", and last min only after they meet they say "since my office is nearby i show u something". Or worst still like Enyouth, teaching agents how to trick people down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Okay, nevermind the baskets at Enyouth. Personally I feel as long as you hide the truth about the nature of biz from your potential recruits, I count it as cheating. Like... Another scenario:</p>
              <p>Agent: Hey u free this fri? I show u something</p>
              <p>B: What thing?</p>
              <p>Agent: Aiyah very interesting one, hey long time no see too, I buy u dinner want?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2 yrs ago VE used the tactic of hiding truth about nature of biz til the very last moment, after all the crap presentations. They'll say "hey help me out, let me present to u". Using hard persuasion, and not letting you leave the office.... for 2 hours!!! Be truthful. I can't accept earning money from trickery.</p>
