U mean Donald Trump and Vince Mcmahon Mentality diff???? They all share the same vision that its to be rich and famous....<br><br>If ABC company going for listings... the management muz be inline and think inline and do inline with the target set....<br><br>Honestly if u ask me $$ is impt but pdt impt also.... Company support or marketing awarenes campaign also impt.... so everyone will say their pdt is the best.... "Carlsberg.... PROBABLY the best beer in the world" i guess the CEO of Carlsberg muz be mad.... but dose not mean working in Carlsberg u canot drink Baron isn it....<br><br>Only kiddos MLM company like to tell ppl they are the best.... all others SUxx... kiddos out there u know who u are.... Have u heard Panansonic insult Sony or SEGA says that SONY PS2 is lousy???? healthy comparisions and ugly insults is 2 diff issues.... Kiddo MLM company will tell u ..... QUOTE: "If u dun join me.... u are finished in ur life.... u wana work till u are old??? U wana leave no legacy behind???" UNQUOTE.... These kinda company free to join also i say waste time.... no comparison in the whole quote.... its either u join them or u die.... simple...<br><br>I been to 1 who dun even want u to join immediately.... if i am not prepared he will just ask me go home and think abt it..... no hard sell no emotional closing.... simply u believe then u try u dun believe done.... Normal MLM is u dun buy a pdt u dun even need to think of going home.... so winners dont diff things they do it diffrently....<br><br>Rememeber......company who need u to shout lah cry lah follow bossess ass like UNDERWORLD GANGS.... these are not culture... these are CULTS...... they manage MLM groups or company like GANGS.... Well EY is one of them.... their boss can go and crash ppl competitor car and fight.... wats the point of him going on TV to say he is such a wonderful man..... Imagine Donald Trump 1 Day beat up Anthony Robbins bcos he recruited his ppl over to his own side.... Big Company CEO will never resort to violence in PUBLIC... But his is no BIG BOSS.... company car achievers cars all rented... SIANZ.... no choice they come from the same roots spo got inherited genes.....<br><br>Always ask for a free look period.......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey the_fallen, haven't seen you post much recently and especially in the furore of the SE news. You have anything to contribute? Your views are quite a read.<br><br>as for the mentality, aiyah... who don't want to earn money? especially when the concept is that now you make money through making networks. i think mlm has a great share of flaks but it is also because traditional businesses do not treat their employees well and thus more people are pront to finding alternatives.<br><br>imagine if your big boss in some mnc gives you a cut of profit-sharing of the annual turnover plus group share etc etc then maybe all these mlm will not seem as attractive.<br><br>the fact is that big corporations do gain masses of profits and they keep it for themselves, paying only the original baord of directors, sleeping partners, owners, shareholders profits and such.. and the hardworking lower-class worker or middle-class worker who actually on-the-job made the contribution to the bottom-line is not as beautifully remunerated. therefore the desire to "become" your own boss and tell these "oppessors" GOOD BYE etc etc...<br><br>anyway, this is one way of looking at it only, not the only way.<br><br>so the concept of pyramid game, mlm will always appeal to people no matter what. there are always "underdogs" in our society....</div>
