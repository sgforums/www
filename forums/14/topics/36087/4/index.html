            <div class='col-md body'>Truthfully I do not know anything about VE.<br><br>As I said b4, if anyone join an unsuccessful company, I emphathise with him.<br><br>However, if you join a company which seems workable to me, I will ask two questions. Do you really follow the company system when selling products and sponsoring people? Secondly, did you put in the effort at your work as well as examine what goes wrong?<br><br>Many people proclaimed they have worked hard and earned peanuts, even if I found the company to be A OK.  Of course, being human, who would have admit they were lazy, or they had gone wrong somewhere. It is always easier to blame company or industry.<br><br>Note, when Neontetra posted a thread on MLM destroying family life, everyone please go read what I posted. No use flogging a dead horse. Tendency is for everyone to blame others and act 'holier than thou'. Worse, people blame on MLM as business strategy. My friend used to say "people are alive, words are dead". We all can sit all day and flog dead horses (MLM), but lets self examine first before putting our foot in our mouth.</div>

They even promised to provide transportation, in the end we have to pay for our transportation fare (mrt).<br><br>Nearly everybody has done their part, advertising for the company and getting people to join in. I cannot say we put in alot of effort, but that's at least some effort put in. I am angry for the things we did and getting nothing in return. I just don't feel justified for all these.<br><br>We have done our part for the company, furthermore it's an attachment we are just asking for transportation fare back and nothing more, if that's too much to ask, then I have nothing more to say. Not everybody comes from a well off family, some people need every cent to survive.<br><br></div>

Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies. Jus take a look at the newspaper for the past one month, alot of articles is focusing on NETWORK MARKETING, and they also teaches us how to prevent from bad companies. if u wan to know, read the straits times forum on MLM and chinese lianhezhaobao on last sunday 18/01/04.<br><br>Most imptly, its not the money that counts. Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>
