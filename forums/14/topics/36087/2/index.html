            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, hold your horses......and apple pies too<br><br>For appie, you need to clarify your statements. Cos people either think these companies are in conspiracy because of your statement, or you are just marginalising the industry as whole.<br><br>If you are marginalising the industry, I am afraid I wont be standing on your side cos......<br><br>While MLM is a good industry, for every one good company, there is ten lousy ones, and hundred scams. I have been down to few companies, and one problem with this industry, like many others, is that people dont get the formula right. Many people ( like 1000 companies in KL ) tried to build one MLM company but unsuccessful., ending up that chances when you enter one company, the company, seemingly promising, may fall.I will emphathise with you.<br><br>But,if you work in a good one, my questions are, have you follow the company system closely? Have you follow what your upline advise you to do? Even after all these, have you been diligently doing field work, reading up, contacting people. I am not surprised,that some people proclaim they have been working their ass off but got little. But when the problems are examined, it was found they might been doing some steps wrong without realising it.<br>Worse off, many just gave up and left, proclaiming (unjustifiably) that the company doesnt work, or the industry is a hoax. I am used to it,coz we are humans, and self denial, thy name is human beanz.<br><br>Haha, guys, just kiss and make up.Friends (even on net) on one hand is worth more than many enemies in the bush.<br><br>Cheers</div>

By the time complaints are received and an investigation is initiated, the program has already collapsed, the web sites are deleted, the money is moved offshore, and the founders have launched another program with a new variation on the same old scam.<br><br>With all of the problems facing the American people and the law enforcement agencies these days, a $25 investment in Going Platinum will never even show up on their radar. And with established rights of due process (which we fully support) the time frame from complaint to conviction is usually measured in years'<br><br>It says American Justice System moving slower than Pony Express bwahahahaha........<br><br>Ok, enough of that.

Btw, many Ivy League uni in US started course on MLM already, like Harvard. Even a superskeptic prof research MLM and declares it to be the 21st century biz after shares and insurance in 90s.<br><br>However, it need not to be school sending people. The school could openly invites biz to come in, and they didnt know VE background. Hope its not SIM..........</div>
