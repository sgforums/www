            <div class='col-md body'>I read it with much interest and I think the author was being very concerned and objective. I love the part where he mentioned about Authority should relook/re-evaluate the guidelines and laws pertaining to MLM which I tend to agree.<br><br>There are, I think, one or two other articles about MLM. Also mentioning about time-share. I had a great time reading his other personal and non-business like articles too.<br><br>Have a great weekend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Concerned Man<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Personally, I have known many new friends as a result of joining the business, esp pple who share the same mindset and thought about the business. The people from my training centre are all helpful and willing to help one another out in any way, even though from the organisation is different as we all understand that helping pple and giving pple the recognition is truly something great... these are the friends i have gained as a result of the business...we meet a lot of like-minded pple <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For all my frens that i have approached...even when they are not interested in the business etc, they never felt being coaxed or cheated..as i only present the business in the true fashion. At the end of the day, they understand and agree that i am presenting to them a true business... and my concerns etc..and we are still friends after that..none lost so far....some pple may feel that it is faster to recruit pple by using some form of deception or promises of wealth to lure them in..but i am looking for pple who sincerely wishes to do the busines with an open heart..thus even though it may be slower...it doesn't matter..as i will only get the serious pple as well as keep my frens and maintain my company and my image. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway, this is a long-term business...it is to help me for my future, my family etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for my business, I am sorry to say that I cannot reveal the actual sum i am getting...i hope u understand...we also do not go around shops to ask pple how much they making right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But i can tell u is that my business is on the right track and i am making an extra income every month from the business in addition to my day-time job..and this income never dropped <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway there is no loss in getting an extra income no matter how big or small right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I am still young and I will continue to work hard in the business to build a strong stable business, whereby in the next 5 years, i hopefully will be able to leave my day-time job. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers<br><br></div>
