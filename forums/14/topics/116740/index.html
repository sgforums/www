Skepticism is not a bad thing.  After all, we all want to protect ourselves.  But skepticism without investigation is stupidity.  Everyday, there are so many new things and changes around us and we stop finding out just because of skepticism.  That is so unfair to ourselves, isn't it?<br><br>However, I do believe that there are some of you (non MLMers &amp; anti MLM) who want to find out, but not sure where to start.  Hence, I am pasting this article for your reading.  Hope this will clear some doubts and misunderstandings, which very much exists in this forum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By Paul M<br><br>Many people question the ethics of MLM. They claim that the people on the top get all the benefit from the people working below them, while the people below don't get much if anything at all. Nothing could be further from the truth!<br><br>Think about where you work. Isn't it true that the boss is raking in the big bucks out of the money YOU are making for the company? And if there is cutbacks who is the first to go? Definitely not the boss and probably not his bonus.<br><br>With an honest MLM, you can easily make more than the boss if you put the effort into it. He gets a little bit from your sales, but you get the lion's share.<br><br>But isn't this just a big 'pyramid scheme'? Yes and no. Anyone who works a conventional job is in a pyramid scheme. Every company, army, and government in the world is built on the pyramid concept. However, with multilevel marketing, you aren't held back by the people above you like you are in a conventional job.<br><br>With an MLM, you can build your business as large and as profitable as you want it to be.<br><br>So, what is a Pyramid scheme?<br><br>These illegal scams involve a large number of people at the bottom of the pyramid, all of them paying money to a few people at the top. Each new participant pays for the chance to advance to the top and profit from cash paid by others who join down the line. Pyramids resemble a legal MLM in structure, but there is an important difference. Pyramid schemes seek to make money from you, while multi-level marketing seeks to make money with you. The Direct Selling Education Foundation suggests that, before you sign up with a company, you ask yourself these three questions:<br><br>1) How much am I required to pay to become a distributor? An MLM company will generally charge a small start-up fee. Pyramid schemes make most of their money from signing up new distributors, so their start-up charges are often very high. These start-up fees may be called many things and you may be told they are required or are recommended purchases for training, computer services and product inventory.<br><br>2) Will the company buy back unsold inventory? Honest companies will usually buy back any products that you fail to sell. Bogus companies will stick you with the inventory.<br><br>3) Are the company's products sold to customers? Pyramid schemes<br><br>gain nothing by actually selling a product, and often don't sell anything at all. They focus only on gaining new investors. Be wary if you must start by buying a large amount of product. Also, take a good look at the product itself. Multi-level marketing depends on quality products that are well-priced; pyramid schemes do not. Pyramid schemes are much like chain letters; they require mathematical gymnastics that cannot possibly work. Pyramids always collapse in the end, and only a very few (usually the con artists themselves) make any money on them at all.<br><br>As with any other investment, before you commit ask questions about the company, its products, start-up fees, buy-back policies and its earnings. Take your time and investigate any information you're given. Talk to other investors and research the company. Don't act hastily!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>many reasons why i dont step in much nowadays to comment, and i presented the same reasons on the anti mlm forum..is that there is lack of awareness or knowledge on how direct selling, network marketing, mlm, pyramids really work...and many fruitless discussion in this forum, and by both sides<br><br>for example on technicalities, Asayo and DW are two commonly used examples by anti-mlmers to bash MLM..but the truth is that these two cannot be simply considered having MLM structure. They do not posses many features of MLM, for example, having total residual and long term network, Their distributors are actually employees, for goodness sake, former employees have mentioned before that they receive reimbursement on expenses. Two years ago, three out of thirteen DSAS members are strictly considered MLM coys.<br><br>which leads to second question, what is the structure and marketing plan of these coys? again, i never seen this discussed much..<br><br>there are hosts of other questions, like how do u see whether a company act in pyramidlike, and i must do commend many forumers who actually are able to point out how it look like - very, and i mean very little emphasis on products, many crappy motivation seminars, aggressive recruitment methods...<br><br>the downside is that, many simply ride on the waves of emotions and blatant url linking - discussing how they feel their friend seems to be cheating them, how hypocritical people can be blah blah...and one guy cleverly post one article on why mlm coys arent bigger than other coys, i have to point out he is making many unfair comparisons, which even businessmen would not do..gotta refer to the topic, it was long time ago...<br><br>the worst sin of them all is try to mix mash business ethics and subsume it totally under common views on moral and ethics - this is committed by both sides, mlmers who discuss sunday gatherings as church like (discussing spirituality with profiteering is a big no no to me), and non mlmers who perceive anything which looks like inferor products as scams, and business shouldnt profit much from people...i gotta laugh at this..why shouldnt the coy make as much profits as they like as long as they can command market share or achieve target sales with that competitive price?<br><br>other misconceptions is that DSAS and CASE are two powerful org which can solve ur case..a big no. They are as powerful as babies trying to snatch ur candy. Not any organisation which are DSAS members can be straightaway counted as a legal or an ethical company. Lux and Enrich (formerly DW and AMH) are two good examples. It was reported last year Lux has 35 (or 75?) police reports made against it.<br><br>I think both sides  seriously need to sit down and research some more b4 shooting off remarks, and i dont mean just linking urls from webbies.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of the MLM companies mentioned in this forum are quite good and reputable.  (Only the fly by night kind of companies that we really have to be careful cuz every month there are so many MLM companies that  close down).  The payout plan is also quite reasonable -- each company has a plan that suits different ppl.  But somehow there will be some black sheep in every company.  Today, I just heard my friend telling me her bad experience with one very reputable MLM company which I almost joined two years ago.  I explained to her that the company is a very good and established one.  It's her friends doing the business that spoil the market.<br><br>So the best thing is to deal with the black sheep by making complaints to the companies directly.  You see... if we allow the black sheep to continue doing what they are not supposed to do (eg. make all kinds of promises to excite new prospects, very hard sell etc), very soon our govt might receive such complaints and ban the MLM altogether.  This is not going to benefit anybody (consumers will have less choice , MLMers will lose the business &amp; it's definitely not going to do our economy any good).<br><br>I know one company that sends out warning letters and even suspends the distributorship when a distributor breaks certain rules in the business.  I am sure many other companies do the same.</div>

I see that you are assuming that products are only sold to members, which means that the main focus of every company is recruitment.  This is not the case in a true MLM company.<br><br>A true MLM company will require the distributors to do retails (ie. actual selling of products to consumers who are not members).  There is no need for selling to members since they are already signed up as distributors.<br><br>Eg.  Nuskin requires a min. of 150 VP every month to maintain the level (correct me if I'm wrong.  This is as far as I can recall).  This min requirement is not to force the distributors to buy products.  But rather to ensure they are actively doing the retailing every month, instead of just sitting there enjoying residual income from the downlines.  (if this happens, it will be what you call pyramid).<br><br>Another Eg. Herbalife requires distributors to submit Sales report of Retailing every month, otherwise their incentives will be forfeited.<br><br>Also many companies set very high profit margin for retailing.  Eg.  Herbalife SV gets 50% Net Profit from retailing their products to non-member consumers, while they only make 0 - 25% from the order made by their immediate downline.<br><br>I don't care about the Pyramid, cuz you can only find them in Egypt..haha.  But every MLM companies that you can read about or find out, the objective is to bring the product to the users.  If this is not the objective, why would these companies spend so much money on the Research and Development of products.<br><br>You may wonder why the consumers choose to buy from Retailing when they can buy at a discount when they sign up as members.  You may be amazed that many consumers wanted to be serviced by the individual distributors -- eg. delivery of the products to the cust's door step, personal update of any latest products, personal followup by the distributors etc.  If the consumers choose to sign up as a member, they will be "on their own".  They may not get any help if they encounter problems using certain products.<br><br>PS.  Is that ric-rats?</div>
