But I'm getting more and more lost. Wat exactly is your point? Has it got anything to do with the validity of the project? Whatever you have said was in fact wat alot of us did. I mean who would invest without checking things out? And wat makes you think that people who invested in emcom dumped all their eggs into one basket?? Is that a presumed sweeping statement? The fact that out of so many investements that me and a couple of friends can find, emcom gives one of the highest returns, and isn't returns one of the basis of choosing an investment? Even financial planners do not have plans that provide such returns. Some that i know of even invested in emcom as well. And of course, in terms of risk, the manager who spoke to me is able to produce all relevant documents to prove the existance and validity of emcom taking part in the proj. And a trip to Taichung personally proved everything.<br><br>And talking abt products... my queries abt the redmeption of products still has not been answered. Will someone pls clarify?? I certianly do not wish to redeem any unredeemable products!<br><br>Anyway bro fallen, you seem to know alot about investments. You've got any lobang to share? I'll be more than willing to listen to investment plans.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
