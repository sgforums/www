There's already so many proven Newspaper Articles on Scams etc every frequent. So I don't think I need to comment and explain my knowledge and observations to rookies who don't even seem interested in helping themselves.<br><br>That's all I can say.<br><br>Neither do I want to continue to reply to every single thread, as there's still people who choose not to believe, so I will only reply to selective comments with regards to this thread or this topic from this point onwards.<br><br>Either those who are keen, PM me, or product Quality Comments than I'll reply accordingly.<br><br>I will still continue to read, but less of replying.<br><br>Advices are often doubt and ignore.<br>Only when it happens, than the usual reactions :Haiyo, if Only I had believe/done this blah blah blah..<br><br>Sigh..<br><br>I'll post helpful articles within this few days, but not in MLM thread anymore, if you read the thread, it's a bonus to increase your logic and analysis to do business. If you don't get to read, than better luck in future.<br><br>All the best.<br><br>I'll concentrate on helping my friends who trust me to build their residual incomes first ba..<br><br>Since there's quite a lot of Rookies, thus I think it's time I 'wash' my hands off, let them learn by falling down, than see if they can stand up on their own in future.<br><br>Which I really doubt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
