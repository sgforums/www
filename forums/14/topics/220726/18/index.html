You are NOT an agent of Sunshine. Go read the T&amp;C on their website. If you are not an agent, you cannot represent the company that you are 'working' for.<br><br>Previously in NOP/NTI, all the people are agents. Agents' words are words of the companies.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mrleech:</div><div class="quote_body">Been reading the few replies. Found out something that most of you guys are unaware.<br><br>If you sign up with Sunshine, you are an independent distributor. You are NOT an agent of Sunshine. Go read the T&amp;C on their website. If you are not an agent, you cannot represent the company that you are 'working' for.<br><br>Previously in NOP/NTI, all the people are agents. Agents' words are words of the companies. Thats why people who sell insurance are agents. Do take note of that.</div></blockquote>thanks for highlighting this issue.<br><br>that leaves me with another <strong>suspicion</strong> again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>New Suspicion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> #1<br><span style="color: red;">This is a Loud &amp; Clear Message that this company isn't held responsible of whatever they (indenpendent distributors) promised verbally (EMPTY PROMISES) in case they fail to earn the income or in the event the company collaspe, and they have no one to turn to get back their money.<br><br><strong>Now you guys and girls know all the distributors of the company are just MAKING EMPTY PROMISES as they assure their friends that they will earn the money. LOL</strong><br><br>Thus when you join this company, you are alone, what ever you say, you need to have the MONEY to return back to the people who join and if they can't get the profits, than you have to fork out on your own. The company will not give you a single penny to compenstate for your LOST!!<br><br>Thus there isn't any assurance from the company.<br>A company that doesn't hold responsibility for their distributors, well what more can I say?</span><br><br>They are pushing all the blame to the so-call 'independent distributors' so their hands are clean, and in the event should this scheme fails, I forsee many lawsuits against those people who recommend their friends and relatives into this company fighting against one another just over their investments.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>New Suspicion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> #2<br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;">Now it make sense, the other day why the fren of mine refuse to let me take the form back to consider, so this is the reason why they don't want us to fully go through the form. And they just keep using money and greed to push people to sign without them knowing what they are signing. (Although they said they can take the form go HDB Hub and ask lawyer, but they don't even allow the people to take it out of the office how to verify it? HAHA, another Suspicion Noted - That's 2nd new pointer of suspicion already)</span></span></span><br><br>Do take note: Money is a dangerous tool, a lot of people can sue each other in court just over a few grands of money.<br><br>So all along, those 'agents' are just poor souls on their own without them knowing it.  And the company didn't even accept the people as their agents, now this is worse than a normal sales job, at least they still can have the company to fall back on, but these poor souls in this company, they have no one to depend on and only on themselves yet they are so happy to be in the office. LOL.<br><br>Now girls and guys, for those who undertstand what I mean in this thread reply, than get out of the company asap. If you need reasons, meet up with me, I can give you more than enough reasons why you should GET OUT OF THIS COMPANY ASAP!!</div>
