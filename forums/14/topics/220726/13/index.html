            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This is my 1st post here. I came to this website after typing "JP" on "Google" (while waiting for the server maintenance to be over for the mmorpg "World of Warcraft")<br><br>I am just your average Joe with kids and all, hoping to strike the "CNY ToTo" on 020307. This being CNY, I started  thinking of 2 good friends of mine and how "NOP", led by the so called "Mr" JP, changed their lives and that of their families, not for the better, but for the worse.<br><br>I wanted to find out more about JP's latest movements, and the internet proved to be my best bet. Before I know it, a full 30 mins flashed by and I was skimming through all the pages of this thread... and the emotional part of me decided to post a reply.<br><br>I have no proof, no "facts"... I just want to warn anybody who happen to come across this particular thread like I did, to stay away from JP and his gang. Hopefully, some divine presence will tell you to heed my advice.<br><br>To those that have emerged with only a lighter wallet after their encounter with JP &amp; Gang, and to those who are going to ... always remember 2 priceless possessions in your life...your family &amp; your health. Money lost can be very painful but it is after all something that can be recovered over time, and the lesson learnt will not be easily forgotten.<br><br>My  2 friends are not so fortunate. they lost many friends and even their families. Both have kids. One is now divorced and I feel very sorry for their parents who had forked out a lot of money to support them. They have no money ...no sustainable income, but they still drive around in their BMWs.  They used to be friends whom I can call up anytime for a chat but whom I now prefer to stay away from, because I know I am incapable to persuade them to get a non-MLM job. So deeply entrenched are they in the uppermost echelons of JP's organization that an alternative lifestyle is near impossible. I even have a nagging intuition that the laptop I loaned to one of them, and which was claimed to be subsequently stolen from his BMW on the day when it was supposed to be returned, was a desperate measure to pay off his creditors by pawning away the laptop. I simply cannot understand why can't he just be honest with me? It is a sad thing to happen between "bros".  I know the 2 of them are strong willed men with the resolve and talent to reach their goals in life. Maybe , they will see their pot of gold very soon, but I will never be envious because I know they have paid dearly for it. I only pray that they get to keep their pot of gold for a long time, and not use it to become JP number2 and ultimately lose all their money.<br><br>All the negative issues about JP &amp; Gang are pretty well covered in this thread.<br>In all honesty, I really like some of their products like "LU MI Mi". Although it was way overpriced despite it being an quality product, with a lot of creative marketing through beauty pageants, testimonials...etc. But it is no secret that whenever JP decides to launch a mega project, it results in a flop. Eg:  "Magic Kingdom"  &amp; "China Dream" (Club Empire) etc...<br><br>Some points against JP &amp; Gang and why they fail and will continue to fail ...<br>1) Poorly trained, overly enthusiastic young sales personnel who don't look beyond closing the sale, often employing hard-core sales tactics (imagine following the potential customer to the atm to get an initial downpayment)<br><br>2) Screwed up, FxCKED up management team who don't bother about details. Once they think they have a good product &amp; marketing plan. it is "cheong ah" all the way. Then it is too late when they realized that the brochures are printed incorrectly, with embarrassing mistakes in the grammar<br>for example, or the video presentation ended up looking like a rushed job. Believe it or not, JP will spend hours drafting up an "invincible" marketing slogan &amp; Sales Kit in Mandarin, pass it on to his PA to insert a lot of "Ang Mo" pictures, then its off to the printer. As an afterthought, the draft is also sent to the poor chap who is tasked to translate everything into English. More often than not, it is at best a poor attempt at direct translation. How the FxCK could one launch a "luxury" product yet fail to take care of the essentials of marketing?<br><br>3) First impressions last... it is the company culture to follow JP's fashion sense.  weird hairstyles, colored hair, business suits and branded watches that looked suspiciously like fakes from China. I mean, even if some of them are wearing the genuine stuff, people will tend to pass them off as fakes because some of these sales agents are simply too young to carry it off.<br><br>4) I read somewhere in this thread that a Mr "Jackie" claimed that JP refunded the "Magic Kingdom" victims their money??  That is total B.S. Shame on you "Mr" Jackie for making that statement. I hope you sleep well at night waiting for retribution to come knocking on your door. What kind of role model are you as a husband to your wife and a father to your kids?<br><br>5) I could go on and on but I think my "World Of Warcraft" maintenance time is over now. To "Mr" JP, Happy CNY, GrATZ on your latest scam (I am sorry, you may be doing the right thing for once in your life, but then again, how can I trust that 0.1% probability? I'd rather buy more Toto). Thanks to you "Mr" JP, I lost 2 good friends who ended up with broken families. I am not a Christian yet so I guess I will be forgiven for wishing that you too will get to experience what's it like to go through a divorce. Hmmm..maybe you won't even feel a thing...  Oh! before I forget, may I suggest for your next "Success Philosophy" training program, that you refrain from using the same old "sad music with the lights dimmed down" strategy while you relate to your young audience how you lost your eyesight. Its not even funny anymore!<br><br>PS: I sincerely hope that there won't be too much flaming in reaction to my post by those who are "Pro-JP" Just take it as crap if you will. As for the rest, please STAY AWAY FROM "JP" &amp; GANG" Peace out<br><br></div>

I think this is the only method where they dont charge the admin fee only.</div>
