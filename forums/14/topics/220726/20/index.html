Which means no garantee that your money may take back 8mths to 1yr, might more than a yr or even longer than that.<br><br>I did asked them how their company earn money since the company need to give merchant aka member every mths a certain amount of money plus profit. They told me their earning is from the advertisement emcom, emall, lumimi etc put the ads onto sunshine website and earn it by ppl click on the website, i find it that even is true also cannot earn so much. Moreover that amount of money to pay out to merchant aka member is alot which i dun think is by the advertisement, so i roughly conclude that is from merchant aka member own money and also their downline money whom they recruit.<br><br>After hearing the presentation, somehow what i felt was, they are using merchant aka member money to invest the wireless project. Which means even the project failed, is none of the company business as they are not using their company money at all. If lucky for them that the wireless project succeed, the company will still earn from the interest and gives part of the profit to their investors.

            <div class='col-md body'>to add on a bit more, the law of agency applies in this case<br><br>most of the time, when you sign up for a MLM scheme, the form usually will state something like 'an independent distributor is not an employee, representative nor an agent of the company'<br><br>meaning distributors words are not legally binding, if they say something wrong, you cannot hold the company responsible<br><br>which give rises to many cases of misrepresentations and inconsistent remarks<br><br>thats why i dont always suggest distributors, especially errant ones, to speak up especially if they are not backed up by evidences<br><br>another issue to look at is conflict of interest<br><br>an analogy i found in an investment book is that of a stock analyst who gave positive reports about certain companies through the media, and its later found out that he invested in those shares as well<br><br>a distributor already has an interest in whatever scheme he is promoting, and that should be taken into account whenever you invest into any scheme, same when we see distributors speaking through publicly available medium such as sgforums, we should take note too</div>

Nothing bad about the management and stuff.<br><br>But you shouldn't say you can show cheques of the company payout because having a significant amount in my bank. I can also give you cheques with big numbers to it, but whether is it creditable?
