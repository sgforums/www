            <div class='col-md body'>A Network Marketing company is the same as any other conventional company.<br><br>It must create profits by producing and distributing products or services. It must strive to get and keep customers through sales.<br>The difference is Network Marketing which allows satisfied customers to profit by creating an endless stream of referrals for the company. Referrals are prized, gold plated assets.<br><br>In a traditional business, a referral is a happy accident to be hoped for, to be sure, but still, an unpredictable accident which rarely can be created dependably.<br><br>Sunshine empire One fast-moving new trend in Network Marketing compensation plans is to quickly reward productive behavior and eliminate any restrictive requirements which effectively and unfairly prevent distributors from qualifying for earned commissions on their volume.<br><br>The most successful MLM companies are making it easy for people to join, easy to stay in, and easy to earn commissions...this is what happening in sunshine.<br><br>Sunshine is using the Binary plan, It's reliability (and legality) has not been serious challenged, yet.<br><br>From the distributor's point of view, the Binary is attractive because it appears to be simple and easy. It looks like your upline will place people in your downline. And it pays weekly instead of monthly.<br><br>Some spectacularly successful, Network Marketing companies have chosen the Binary plan. Alliance, USANA, Longevity, Destiny Telecom, Travelmax, and Envirotech are just a few. Would they have been just as successful with a Break Away plan (eg amway, Watkins)?<br><br>For sunshine, however mathematically intriguing the Binary may be, administering it can be a nightmare that complicates planning and budgeting.<br><br>Its commission payout can be erratic and unpredictable, varying from 30 - 70 percent from one week to the next from the ideal 38 - 42 percent average commission payout.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  A profitable Network Marketing company should budget 40 percent for commissions, 20 percent for overhead expenses, 20 percent for cost of goods, and 20 percent for profit. it also depends on what kind of products or services..to sustain the business..<br><br>Sunshine run an honest, ethical Network Marketing business. with proper legal documents.<br>But the best policy in any  MLM company is to deliver on promises, because otherwise people complain of fraud, and no attorney can save the company in that case, before or after.<br><br>New Network Marketing companies like sunshine will succeed wildly when they have a compensation plan that makes it easy for people to join, easy to stay in, and easy to get paid.<br><br>They succeed because they have valuable products and services. Network Marketing is not just for tupperware and vitamins anymore! What is next?<br><br>Sunshine will keep their distributors because they pay generous commissions on time and offer great training and excellent service all around. with excellence online products and service plans.<br><br>Welcome to the new era...Network Marketing is successfully market and sell travel packages, tools, legal services, jewelry, insurance, satellite programming, long distance telephone service, property and intenet services.<br><br>seems like sunshine have almost all of this above..JP a genius i would say!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>network marketing is all about confidence..sometimes could be blind over greed..in fact most are blind by greed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>all network company is about money game roll, roll and roll...think about it if money dont roll then the economics will be down..<br><br>you just have to find out yourself if your money is rolling into an empty shell....or a real thing with proper legal document!<br><br>goodluck to all networkers from diff company..a new ERA have begun! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>hear no evil see no evil say no evil..thts me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>wana know more dig your own treasure box or dig your own grave!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but, i invested around more than 20000k and i was not asked to sign any legal document, and i was not given any legal receipt, and so, logically, how can they pay me when they do not have any way at all to pay me, not even my bank account number and such. and sunshine empire itself is listed in http://www.sc.com.my/eng/html/licensing/investors/Alert_list.html#s. So how trustworthy is it?? it's not a small amount. That is why i'm so worried right now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey idiot i was in ur situation 5 mths ago. I invested based on belief that the project was workable and had great prospects. However, it was to my horror what i saw on this forum-a lot of negativity about the company and bad reputation.<br><br>Since you are already in it, i do not think there is any way you can get your money back. Either do up more research or maintain close contact with your agent. Knowing more will make you feel better and be able to judge if the company is authentic. As of now, my judgement is that the methods are unethical, certain information are concealed and new rules keep coming up. Recently when i went up, i saw a large group of old folks.<br><br>Other than all these, payment has been prompt and i should recoup 100% capital in 4 months' time. I would not advise any to invest in this, but for those already in it...sit tight, find out more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I still don't, but there's nothing i can do about it. In the short run my feel is that the company is still expanding. Other than a lawsuit, the company should not be winding up overnight.<br><br>I speak as an investor. Agents will have an extremely positive stand on the company because they are selling based on the company, and they are very much influenced by the success culture of the company, and the philosophy that their International president preaches.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Razorsharp, they also claim that i will recoup my capital in eight months time, for the rm24000 i paid, every month i will get usd800. However i find it suspicious that i have no legal document, none to say that i have paid this sum and that, even when i queried, they say i don't have to fill in any forms.SumOne, you seem to know more bout this sort of investment, mind telling us more?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>then you are wrong on one point, if nobody ever said what they think and such, where do you think you get random ideas from, solid theory are always from flying ideas if that's what you like to call it, well, i like looking around to search for basis of truth. if you like going to the headquarters and slamming their table and demanding from them your money, then it's not really sophisticated isn't it. Well, i can't say speculating whether a company is a bad piece of fish or not is really sophisticated as well, but it's way better than outright brutality now isn't it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
