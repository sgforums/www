Are they going to announce anything of great importance? (like the progress of project,funds management?) I am really very interested in this investment and I cant really wait till Jan 07.<br><br>2ndly, i was told tat Emcom get the right to be the 1st service provider in Taichung. But after seeing some of the posts, i dont know y Proxim Tsunami(TM) get into the picture.<br><br>I hope to get some reliable reply soon, even though this is not the really right place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Took me about 15mins to get this post done.......I guess practice make perfect <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>Well everyone is saying this project is a scam and its not a real project just a money game.  When Emcom is officially launched in Taichung, at least everyone will know that there is truly such a project and its working good.  About the fund and management all that i am not too sure.<br><br>Who told you about the 1st service provide ?  So far i know we are the current company building the infrastrasture as APTG has not started yet.</div>

But still I am very confirmed this this project in NTI is not going to last. I really hope you won't kena a forth time. There has to be a limit. Don't waste all your time, money, energy in a place where they treat you as expendable and dont appreciate your efforts at all. There are many reputable and better MLM companies out there. At least you can answer to the people you bring in to the other companies. NTI... sometimes you don't know how to answer to the people you recruit. And its not your fault also.<br><br>Just keep your eyes open, bro.</div></blockquote>Ya thanks i will surly open my eyes and see what emcom is going.</div>
