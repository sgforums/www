I have experienced MLM personally. I am not an agent like NUS_Superst@r or a neutral like Jonzibonzi. I know about the inner mechanics of the higher echelons of those in MLM. The way they work. They have many things to hide...<br><br>Here, we are not trying to say it is a scam. What we would like to do is to tell people not to take things at the surface level. Pry beneath, ask questions, analyse. PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW IF THEY ARE GOING TO INVEST!<br><br>If emcom and their agents have NOTHING to hide, they should not be afraid of questions, but instead seek to answer our queries.<br><br>Regards,<br>BKKboy</div>

Pyramid scams are now running under the thin veil of being an MLM company. Thousands have been tricked, but they remain powerless because they have an undertaking between them and the company. They Ã¤re so called "partners".<br><br>It is viewed as a business agreement in the eyes of the law. If the company closes, there is nothing CASE can do for you as you are NOT a consumer, this is a business agreement remember? You can try CAD but I can assure you they already have many reports, but I've yet to see any actions taken. WHY? Ask them lor.</div>

Pyramid scams are now running under the thin veil of being an MLM company. Thousands have been tricked, but they remain powerless because they have an undertaking between them and the company. They Ã¤re so called "partners".<br><br>It is viewed as a business agreement in the eyes of the law. If the company closes, there is nothing CASE can do for you as you are NOT a consumer, this is a business agreement remember? You can try CAD but I can assure you they already have many reports, but I've yet to see any actions taken. WHY? Ask them lor.</div></blockquote>CASE made it clear last year, without the participation of a the company, the consumer and CASE would be hard driven to make a mediation.<br><br>I know the difficulty of this case, because some of our forumers did make police reports, and even got referred to the AG chambers. Technically, its difficult to charge them with anything, except for some minor offences at most. This issue was dicussed at length here before, around June this year.<br><br>Meaning all in all, simply said, any scam or fraudalent scheme can get away with it because the law is unclear. Well, like i said, too bad for consumers and all.<br><br></div>
