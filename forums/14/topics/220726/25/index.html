            <div class='col-md body'>I am speaking at a point of an investor who have bought several GPs from this company.<br><br>If this whole sunshine empire thingy is a scam. I would say that this is the best ever planned scam in the world that i had heard of. Its so much better off than SCAM (Swiss cash asset management). I mean, there is really a wireless network company going on in Taiwan. I went there personally to use the network to log on to the internet and it worked. And definitely the recent news on the ground breaking ceremony in Malacca. Look at the huge effort put in by S.E to make this scam looks reliable. They even invited so many guest to the ceremony like the head of malacca, ex deputy prime minister of China and a chairperson of a commitee in U.N.<br><br>When was the last time when your friend asked you to bet on a soccer match where he says that it is a garanteed win. Or our ex PM Mr Lee encouraged so much in the Su Zhou industrial park investment, and now look what it has become. There is no such thing as a garanteed return. Projects can fail, companies no matter how huge and established it is can close down. I view S.E just like buying 4D or TOTO from Singapore pools. (probably the largest legal money game company in Singapore) I find buying GPs more like gambling rather than investing in lay mans term. At least i find the chances of winning higher than buying 4D with random numbers.<br><br>This is my personal view and does not have concrete proof.<br>Look at the structure of Singapore Pools. They divert all money of people who lose their bets to people who win in ToTo... Its just like people who joined in S.E later whose money will go to the people who joined in earlier. And the loophole in the money will then be later compensated slowly by the revenues of the project. I personally do recommend this plan to my friends, but i dare not garantee them their so called garanteed returns and i would say its up to their own risk.<br><br>Some people might think of me as selfish. Gaining off other people's lost. Well, try giving back Singapore Pools your winnings after you won ToTo. Because the winnings you recieved are all bets lost from Singaporean!!! Meaning to say, you are taking what they lost. Well, u may say that they are willing bettors. But people who put their money in S.E are willing parties as well.<br><br>This whole world is a money game. If you are working, your very own pay comes from profits of the company, which comes from the marking up of products. Which usually is so much higher than the original product. Developed countries are setting up so much trade barriers against developing countries, taking advantage of them. Riches of developed country comes from the lost of developing countries. This is the way the world works. Its up to you to choose which side.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When in doubt always ask people in the finance industry. Like financial advisers, NOT those "advisers" from the MLM/Investment company itself. Ask a neutral party.<br><br>On overseas investments, always ask the locals. Ask the people living there.<br><br>SE is certainlly very dubious, and some people are too brainwashed by the personality cults of the founders or by money to apply logic into it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by IlRoEvNeE:</div><div class="quote_body">I am speaking at a point of an investor who have bought several GPs from this company.<br><br>If this whole sunshine empire thingy is a scam. I would say that this is the best ever planned scam in the world that i had heard of. Its so much better off than SCAM (Swiss cash asset management). I mean, there is really a wireless network company going on in Taiwan. I went there personally to use the network to log on to the internet and it worked. And definitely the recent news on the ground breaking ceremony in Malacca. Look at the huge effort put in by S.E to make this scam looks reliable. They even invited so many guest to the ceremony like the head of malacca, ex deputy prime minister of China and a chairperson of a commitee in U.N.<br><br>When was the last time when your friend asked you to bet on a soccer match where he says that it is a garanteed win. Or our ex PM Mr Lee encouraged so much in the Su Zhou industrial park investment, and now look what it has become. There is no such thing as a garanteed return. Projects can fail, companies no matter how huge and established it is can close down. I view S.E just like buying 4D or TOTO from Singapore pools. (probably the largest legal money game company in Singapore) I find buying GPs more like gambling rather than investing in lay mans term. At least i find the chances of winning higher than buying 4D with random numbers.<br><br>This is my personal view and does not have concrete proof.<br>Look at the structure of Singapore Pools. They divert all money of people who lose their bets to people who win in ToTo... Its just like people who joined in S.E later whose money will go to the people who joined in earlier. And the loophole in the money will then be later compensated slowly by the revenues of the project. I personally do recommend this plan to my friends, but i dare not garantee them their so called garanteed returns and i would say its up to their own risk.<br><br>Some people might think of me as selfish. Gaining off other people's lost. Well, try giving back Singapore Pools your winnings after you won ToTo. Because the winnings you recieved are all bets lost from Singaporean!!! Meaning to say, you are taking what they lost. Well, u may say that they are willing bettors. But people who put their money in S.E are willing parties as well.<br><br>This whole world is a money game. If you are working, your very own pay comes from profits of the company, which comes from the marking up of products. Which usually is so much higher than the original product. Developed countries are setting up so much trade barriers against developing countries, taking advantage of them. Riches of developed country comes from the lost of developing countries. This is the way the world works. Its up to you to choose which side.</div></blockquote>How hard is it to set up a wireless base station so you can surf on wireless? I just set up a temporary wireless wifi network with 5 meshed access points. Plus line it costs less than 5K. Besides, spending money on setting up wireless is easy. Making money off wireless is another matter.<br><br>Have you wondered why none of the WIMAX license holders except for Qala commercially launched a WIMAX service? Have you heard of any plans to launch? WIMAX licensees spent millions on spectrum licenses. You only don't launch if you think you will lose even more money doing so.<br><br>Have you wondered why wireless@sg had to be govt subsidized? If ISPs thought they could make a profit off wireless, wouldn't they jump at the chance? Did you buy the premium wireless@sg service? How many other people do you think bought it?<br><br>Also, don't try to justify your behavior. In a lottery, people buy a ticket knowing that there is a very slim, almost infinitesimally small chance to win. Also, everyone has a fair chance of winning.<br><br>In an MLM like SE, the actual risk is hidden from the new prospects. Once you fool them and get them in, they then have to fool others to make sure they are not the victims.</div>
