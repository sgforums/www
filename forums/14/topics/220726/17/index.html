            <div class='col-md body'>By nature of being included in the Alert list, Malaysia Security Commission clearly identified Sunshine Empire as a party carrying out capital market activities, the only distinction is without license. Meaning anyone else who said SE is carrying out a non financial service related activity is clearly lying<br><br><strong>INVESTOR ALERT </strong><br>Pursuant to Section 15(g) of Securities Commission Act 1993 it is the responsibility of the Securities Commission (SC) to take reasonable measures to maintain the confidence of investors in the capital market by ensuring adequate protection for investors.<br><br>Licensing of capital market intermediaries is one of the measures undertaken by the SC to fulfill this responsibility and this is put into effect through the securities laws which require all persons carrying out regulated activities to be licensed by the SC. It is important for investors to deal only with licensed parties in order to be accorded the protection of the securities laws.<br><br><strong>In line with this, the SC alerts and warns the public on parties carrying out capital market activities without a licence as well as possible scams</strong><br><br>Above is from the link helpdesk provided.<br><br>What does it mean to be licensed?<br><br><a href="http://www.sc.com.my/eng/html/licensing/licensingmain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sc.com.my/eng/html/licensing/licensingmain.html</a><br><br>Licensing ensures an adequate level of investor protection, including the provision of sufficient safeguards to protect investors from default by market intermediaries or problems arising from the insolvency of such intermediaries. More importantly, it instills confidence among investors that the organisations and people they deal with, will treat them fairly and are efficient, honest and financially sound.<br><br>Through its authority to issue licences, the SC regulates the market by ascertaining the fitness and propriety of companies and individuals applying for licences. In considering whether an applicant is fit and proper to hold a licence, the SC takes into account the following factors:<br><br>Probity<br>Ability to perform such functions efficiently, honestly and fairly<br>Financial status<br>Reputation, character, financial integrity and reliability<br><br>Without license, no SE agent could represent their investments as certified financially sound.<br><br></div>

That is WHY MAS regulates the financial services industry which includes FD, UT, ILP, Insurance, Shares, Warrants, Bonds etc etc......<br><br>Every agent and company that is involved in such industry MUST be licenced. All your insurance agents are licenced, all your "relationship managers" are licenced and all your brokers have a licence....<br><br>Ever wonder why your bank teller will firstly put the idea of the insurance plan into your head but she'll not market it to you? Nope, it is not that she does not have the time.... she simply does not have the professional qualification required. She'll initae the idea nad her colleagues like the personal banker, relationship managers will market the products to you instead... These are people who have to be licenced....<br><br>What do you think these professionals have a licence for and give out proper documentations for if not to protect the industry and consumers so to speak? Do you know how many tests are there that these professionals have to pass first and gain certification before being allowed to market products?<br><br>It is NOT necessary to have properly licenced agents or company to operate an investment scheme, it is just that it is likely to be a SCAM and the MAS states very clearly:-<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why should you deal with a person regulated by the MAS?</span><br><br>MAS' regulatory regime aims to <strong>safeguard the interests of consumers </strong>by ensuring that <strong>only competent and professional persons who meet appropriate standards of business conduct can provide financial  products and services </strong>in Singapore. The laws administered by <strong>MAS also require disclosure of information on investment products</strong> being recommended to consumers.<br><br>If you deal with a person not regulated by MAS, <strong>you will not enjoy the protection provided </strong>by the laws administered by MAS. In addition, <strong>if the person does not have a physical presence in Singapore or cannot be traced, you may not be able to take action against him should you lose money</strong>.<br><br>So maybe agents of this Sunshine Empire are like the "bank tellers" - no licence, and yet they doing the job of the "relationship managers" - sell investments.... well, well....<br><br>If you were a bona fide company, with bona fide investments to market, you'll want to be regulated so as to be properly represented. You'll want properly trained agents to market your products. You'll want more market exposure, more marketing activities. I tell you: any bona fide company right now that can guarantee such returns like 30% ROI in 1 year, you'll very soon find that company closing doors early.... as many kiasu Singaporeans and Foreign Investors will definitely queue up all over the place to buy into that investment. The agents won't need to do so much hardwork and yet the money keeps rolling in..... because people WILL WANT to invest.<br><br>Moreover, when we buy items from supermarket, we get a receipt. When we buy shares from our broker, we get an acknowledgement form to show the credit/ debit of the shares bought, we buy insurance, there is a policy, we place a FD, there is a certificate etc etc....<br><br>How can anyone place money into a company and receive NO documentation? How can any company promise such beautiful returns on investment of up tp 70% within 1 year when the general climate is nowhere near that figure? THERE IS NO GUARANTEE people. Please be very cautious.<br><br>I may have misundertood the figures as shared by human traffic. If that is the case that leads to my misunderstanding of this issue then I apologize. But I doubt it. I think generally even if my figures quoted from human traffic are wrong, the overriding sentiments of lawful regulation and market conditions still holds firm.<br><br>So for any potential "investor", just beware.<br><br>Also, a good link below for PITFALLS OF DEALING WITH UNREGULATED PERSONS by Moneysense:-<br><br>http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/publications/quick_tips/Consumer_Portal_Dealing_With_Unregulated_Persons.html<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh ya... since MAS required disclosure of information of the investment product, maybe that's why non bona fide companies choose not to be regulated....<br><br>by being unregulated, they can skip the steps and probably the law and avoid bearing any responsibilities to their investors when they lose their investors' money.<br><br>by being unregulated, any investment company can claim sky-high returns on investment... since no MAS steps in to say they cannot....<br><br>Investors... buy at your own risk.

Watching out for these signs could save you from problems later on:<br><br>Investors are usually contacted by telephone or by unsolicited emails or facsimile. All subsequent contact is usually through the same medium. There is seldom any face-to-face meeting.  Even if there is, the meeting is usually conducted in a location other than a proper office.<br><br>High-pressure sales tactics are used to persuade you to invest before you have the opportunity to think about the investment product or to conduct checks on the person offering it. Claims of a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" or a "limited time offer" are common.<br><br>The sales representatives will claim to have inside or confidential information that will generate a windfall from investing. There will usually be promises of high returns, "guaranteed" profits and quick gains. More often than not, these sales representatives are smooth-talkers who give the impression that they are very knowledgeable about investments.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Find out as much as you can about the firm and its staff</span><br><br>Ensure that you do all necessary checks before dealing with any person offering financial products and services. Find out more about the firm, its track record and the background of the key people running the operation.  Make it a point to meet with the representatives.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understand what you are buying</span><br><br>Do not get carried away by a good sales pitch or promise of high returns. Always ask for brochures and documents to be sent to you so that you have sufficient time to establish the facts, review the product and make an informed decision.  Do not sign on blank forms without understanding what you are signing.  Never give your identity card to someone you do not know or without first clarifying why it is needed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Make sure that the investment fits in with your financial goals</span><br><br>Before you make an investment, consider if it matches your financial goals, risk profile and personal circumstances.  You should not make a hasty decision when it comes to investments.  Remember that all investments have an element of risk, and a higher return is almost always accompanied by higher risks.<br><br>Just for further info about other scams......
