            <div class='col-md body'>actually how much is the rate of return stated on the investment sheet? banks are paying a fixed dep rate of what 2 - 3%? and it's the big banks... UT and SP not even projecting 10%, let alone guaranteeing anything remotely there....<br><br>so if this emcom project is full of promises that it can fulfil, two things then:-<br><br>1. regulated by MAS - all financial services that are legit must be approved, however in this case, i believe the MAS ALert List has flagged it.<br><br>2. it would have sold out like mad long ago and it probably should be accompanied by big publicity and advertising blitz.... I didn't see any.<br><br>So I think consumer beware as there might be some truth to what's being dished out here.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Depo, I would love to give you a hind sight of my daily job but currently this is only my side line. Reason being i'm contract bound by my current company for a 6 years and I can't afford to quit now cos I will have to pay back all my salaries for the past 4 years.  Next year will be my end of contract and I am building up my foundation now to go full time next year.<br><br>I'll try to stay around for as long as I can, even if I succeed, or fail, just for the pure sake of sharing. Base on my current perception, most people who post here are people whom have suffered losses or failed in the line, but you don't see people posting alot of success stories here. The fact is, all networking companies definately have a whole bunch of success people, but very often you don't see them post in the forums of their success. Either they can't be bothered cos they are already earning so much, or they see no point to fight.<br><br>But of course, that is just MY perception. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I had heard of all those past projects he has before and had no confidence in them, thus I did not join any of them in the past.<br><br>I admit that when I first join the company, I was taking a big gamble due to their past records and wasn't expecting much. But with my buddy in it and making up to the management level in recent months, and also a close friend whom both of them had follow James Phang through all his past projects,  I got to know why their past projects failed and why the 2 of them are still following him. They were not earning much and neither were they of any high position before this event was launched. But they respected him for something he did for them which most people in or out of the company do not know. I do see the potential in the current event base on the positive updates and seeing results of the company for the past few months.<br><br>Like you, this is also only my personal opinion and just for people reference. Regardless, I'll continue to keep this forum update of any good and bad news of this event. Cheers~!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh..   please read my previous posting regarding your claim on the missing link....  Emcom and Sunshine Empire is under EGA, where Emcom is the telco company and Sunshine is the network marketing company all under EGA. Company uses earning from Sunshine to invest in Emcom where Emcom succeed, we will benefit too. Cos EGA earns money, Sunshine earns money and thus able to payout to merchants in Sunshine. Similarly, Sunshine users buy products from Emall, EGA also earns and thus able to payout also.<br><br>Regarding the misrepresentation I've already mentioned earlier in another post where I admit that there is alot of people in the company still misrepresenting the concept, especially when it first started and people dunno much, just want to chiong.

Base on my current perception, most people who post here are people whom have suffered losses or failed in the line, but you don't see people posting alot of success stories here. The fact is, all networking companies definately have a whole bunch of success people, but very often you don't see them post in the forums of their success. Either they can't be bothered cos they are already earning so much, or they see no point to fight.<br><br>But of course, that is just MY perception. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>Thanks Blue_jamzz,<br><br>I think we have seen enough of the MLM bish-bash in this forum.

But what I know of your company is that they got the products, and the suppliers allowed your company to change. Strange?<br><br>1- IF the products are really good, than why the need to change?<br><br>2- Repackaging into a new product, give the products a new life, but there's more disadvantages rather than advantages. You don't know the supplier and manufacturer is from who and what ingredients it's made of (in case there's some people who are sensitive to certain substance)<br><br>3- When the supplier allows the product to be sold under another name, than it shows that the product is already not of quality products (thus they need a new image)<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Do you see any authorised dealers of handphones changing the HP model and design to sell it under their own name?<br>M1, Star-Hub, SingTel doesn't even allow the retailers to change anything.<br>That is an assurance and trust of creditablilty from the suppliers.<br><br>4- When the clients go into the company, do they show you the products or do they just talk to you about the plan, concept, without showing and telling of products, everything is just considered a Pyramid if there's no Products involved. So the reason why there's products is just to mask the money scheme concept which has being put in place all along ever since the start of LPS<br><br>5- Value for Money?<br>Ask yourself, how valuable are the products?<br>I took the aromatherapy and skin care to sell off, guess what the offered price was - less than $10 (this is for the bottle of the aroma-therapy) they don't accept esscence oil nor skin care.<br><br>So if you buy in, you can slowly redeem like what they say..but think...I am foolish to trust them once in the past of this Take Products Slowly Idea for our convenience. Than change another marketing plan, they didn't even remind us on the products left un-claimed...hopping silently that the customers will forget..<br><br>We have to BUG PESTER them inorder to get them to return us the products..<br>Note: They aren't even professional enough to have a past database records of the old orders and consumers...They don't look at current consumers and neither do they update us. The only way the earn is Recruiting MORE NEW PEOPLE.<br><br>As complaint get more and more, who can you guys recruit again?<br>Since there's no other way, than of course your person in-charge used the Greed Factor to make people trust them, since the products fail to attract consumers in. Thus they play the human head count to recruit people.<br><br>Do sales in your company is a gone case, I've tried it, and it like, don't even want to think about it. If there's no Sales in a Business, is that a real business. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recruitment is afterall a Human Head Game (without any sharing of products effectiveness) = Pyramid = Illegeal</span></strong><br><br>Go think about it, and see if you can see it from another angle, only when you can see this from different perspective, than you will know what's really happening instead of foolishly following the crowd. If you follow you die (that's if you're in the industry of being a business - thumb of rule = Never Copy, be the leader)<br><br>This is what I learnt from PSC which other agents obviously didn't learnt, coz I walk in with a motive, I don't foolishly buy their ideas and trusting everythng.<br>Trust NoOne but yourself. In the business arena, its yourself and yourself, depending on others, you collaspe in no time. Use facts and observations to backup your views from different angles.<br><br>Why I'm able to know so much, coz I use different angles to think.<br>Did you?<br>Or did you just blindly follow the crowd in your company just like a Blind Rat going after the Cheese?<br><br>Summary (I'll give you a Short Simple Example)<br>Look around the WHOLE EARTH in every single different countries/states/cities.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Which Business Don't Make Profits Based on Physical Products which is Value for Money / Value for Service </span>(Hotel Service and those similar services)<br><br>Are you paying for any services when you Invest?<br>No you're not!!
