As well as the Book and VCDs of the international president, than now the products online are what?<br><br>The other product which i know of are of FengShui products (president's brother products located at Chinatown) which no doubt are nice, but the to change the mall points back to get products, the ratio of exchange rate doens't tally nor are the products value for money.<br><br>If you tell me the wireless project, i'll say it's a gimmick based on the method and approach that your company handle it, but the technology itself is good, but too bad, used in the wrong hands, it's being termed as Bad/Money Game.<br><br>The only product that's value for money is Lumimi, but due to the troublesome  discipline needed to have a better contour and body line, many ladies give up after a few weeks, + it's a bit expensive..<br><br>Pump in money and exchange for money dividends?<br><br>Property products? (I doubt so, since i can't even click on the link, it's just up there for display purpose only - based on personal opinion - subjective.<br><br>I'll get my updates on your company soon enough...so by than maybe i can give you a better and up to date analysis of what i feel about your company..but of course, it's subjected to only meeting up, than i'll share with you..coz those are advance stuffs, which are not suitable to be posted here.</div>
