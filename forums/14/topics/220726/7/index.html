I do personally know of towkays who drives BMWs and yet kindly offer to drive you home when it's pouring cats and dogs.<br><br>It's the personal touch. It doesn't mean that you have to pretend to be meek and inferior, because you know you are not. Pretending is always the hardest thing to do. Do not seek to make others feel inferior. Do not even try to imply that others are inferior. That is the true meaning of being humble.<br><br>Regards,<br>BKKboy<br></div>
