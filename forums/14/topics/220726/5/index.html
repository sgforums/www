And why he can't change name too ?  Funny question.<br><br>When did NTI change name ?  Its still call Niutrend International, NTI is shortform.  EGA is the Group name of all James Phang companies not NTI name, Sunshine Empire is malaysia MLM company not NTI.

So in short - they are just plain sellers trying to sell off a product with no proper knowledge on investments.</strong><br><br>If you were saying a VISIT to that city proofs the risk is zero, but you might want to reconsider.<br><br>My friend went to the 3rd project - the resort of NTI, but less than 1 month after the official opening it also closed. How safe is a visit?<br>Even in normal investments, a visit doesn't proof that a investment is safe and sound. You need to know how to access the level of RISK in a investment.<br><br>I'm not saying Emcom will shut off, but in another way in terms of how NTI is marketing it, it's a failing project due to some reasons.<br><br>If you are asking about redeemption of product, than you might want to know that what you sign up for is a investment product, there is no product which you can redeem as a matter of fact, BUT due to the merchant points of the Ting Dongs you have, you get very little merchant points are of little if not no value. So your product is just the investment, the only way you can redeem your product is to 'sit and wait' for the returns every month.<br><br>if you are interested in other investments, i can intro you to a agent,<span style="color: green;"> <strong>NOT MLM, but it's investments in plots of land</strong>.</span> there's a 90 mins seminar, cakes and drinks provided. if you interested than let me know, i can inform the agent.<br><br>Disclaimer : I don't earn anything by refering coz I'm not a client of theirs.<br><br>Why I know this is because I like to find out more on Investment opportunities so as to choose the right channel to invest in future.<br><br>Shopping around, knowing more - sharpens my mind and thinking in accessing if whether a investment is worthy or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by perrification:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm... actually I too am part of the NTI-Emcom programme.<br>And I did collect my approx. 10% of what i put in, $2880. I had a Bronze Merchant acct from earlier this yr but i was too busy with my ATEC and everything so i didnt have time to do anything.<br><br>Other than my 10% from the returns, I earned around 800+ from my networking side. Also due to the fact that due to how the networking plan runs, i balance my BC easily as i have a resevoir on my other "leg".<br><br>I'm not saying everyone is as lucky as me. but making my point... i guess if you are not interested in it... becos maybe its just not for you... or you are anti mlm or whatever your reason is... stop defaming the company. if you are unable to risk that 3000 dollars or more or even your 500 dollars... then dont. please dont. you will just make yourself unhappy. Nothing in this world with returns comes without risk. but are you going to just not risk anything? maybe its just me, but i am someone who take calculated risk...<br><br>So far maybe its a scam that i can earn back 1/3 of what i have already put in. For me... rather than just standing outside the arena and see if its a scam i rather take what i can afford. NOTE: AFFORD. not money which u cannot part with, and see if it really is a scam. if not i win the gamble if it is... well as of now i only lost at most by my next pay out, about 1k plus. An affordable lesson. If it works out... well i guess... IT Does work then.<br><br>For people who cannot afford it dont try. The company never hard sells... if u are a victim of it... i guess ur friend or ur associate is just a black sheep. For me, if you are not interested, i'm okay. After all when i bring a 3k client in... what he will get in return is more than my 100USD if i do balance both sides. Its really up to that person if this is something he can afford to risk and see for himself if its a scam.<br><br>I myself did alot of research into Emcom partnership. Well maybe to some i may be a fool for signing up. but i guess when i earn from this... at least i profitted instead of people who just flame and keep their money at home. Btw... risk are always involved in 'investments'. Do your homework yourself, raise ur questions and if u are unsatisfied or feel insecured. dont do it. PLEASE DONT DO IT. because you only give everyone problems.<br><br>If you all really dont believe how much i earn, i will check with my superiors and see if its okay if i tag my payout slip and my returns slip here.<br><br>I'm just saying... flaming here wont earn u money. use your time wisely. go work or something. flaming here wont conclude anything. I suggest you try to learn more if your purpose here is to educate people who are green horn investors. i'm not sure if defaming another company here can land u in a lawsuit, but i doubt EGA is interested in you flaming here. but i guess its never nice to bad-mouth people if you got no solid proof.<br><br>Sure James Pang suffered alot of bad media. But to digress abit you all talk about singapore self investment values... you all talk so big... but yet you all dont even give James pang a chance to redeem himself, talk about yellow ribbon project... sure its about prisoners giving them a second chance.... but essentially its about the fomer part isnt it? giving people a second chance.<br><br>To end off, i came into this forum becos my superior joke to me about how you people act in here. reading ur flames has been amusing initially. but you all are just too much actually... esp some members who are just plain childish.<br><br>A forum is about information spreading and education... not just lashing out at someone... how different are you from those rioters who hide in the crowd as the same as you behind the screen. sure u may say i am doing the same. behind a screen. but i guess you know what i am getting at. if u really got some queries i believe you can come down to the company and ask them... if you wan to, u can pm me i can give u my contact number if u are so miser i can even pay for your transport fee. yes this is a sarcastic remark. but well i hope u can see it with that narrow mindset of yours.<br><br>Sorry i was alil angry there. anyway, please if u are unsure of how the partnership works do ask more. not just flame... and start calling people names. if you dont believe dont post. if u feel that people in here dont know what they are doing, share and educate. please for goodness sake dont call them stupid dont tell them that we are conning them. when we dont do it. give us some justice and alil respect if that is even possible from you.<br><br>Thank you for reading. You can flame me anyway you want to, but i guess the 3rd party reading ur replies can decide who has a moral high ground here. thats for him to decide himself. Thank You Again.<br></div></blockquote>A company full of young teenagers and young undergrads trying to persuade ppl to invest in their company??? I dont tink is wise to invest in such a company. Of course, some forumers are pretty babaric here but I tink Lau here is pretty refined in his use of language so i tink it is still wise to see many point of views b4 u invest. For students out there, I would strongly urge u to stay away from this company. It just take up too much of ur time and money. Not that I would say u will get no returns and benefits but the time needed to earn back ur money is just too long, hence for students who just need fast cash to pay off ur hostel bills or watever, dun join this company or thou wilt regret later for sure. Not that I am trying to say young undergrads should not develop their entrepeunership but Nti is not the place for u to take big risk...u will regret later. Learn to do things step by step, dont siao siao invest just because ppl say so. I believe there are many brilliant and young businessman and investors out in the world, but in spore u can 4 get abt finding one. That is why i dun want to waste mi money investing in Nti. Talking abt em com and trying to get a large portion of the pie in spore...cmon spore pop is just to small to support so many telecommuniction company. In all countries, the largest share of telecommunication pie will most likely to be given to gov based company not foreign company so talking abt how lucrative it is to join em com....it is crap...only the 1 st few get to earn big bucks.<br>To give James Phang a chance?? cmon perrification u sound so mature talking abt investment yet u even fail to realize we , in fact , live in a very harsh world. The yellow ribbon project is there bcause it is human nature to be suspicious of others esp those who hav done grave mistakes in the past. Dont tell mi that u will hire an ex-rapist as a chauffeur to fetch ur wife and daughter up and down. Forgiveness is not granted free by others, it is obtain by working hard for it. If JP wants to redeem his own sinful act, then he has to prove it to us and he must accept ppl looking at him thru tinted glasses because he did do wrong things in the past. Wu feng bu qi lang, i guess when many many ppl "flamming" Nti, there must be a reason for it. The same as why u joined this forum and post such a politically correct post, trying to portray a better image of ur company so that u can earn big bucks...cmon that for your vested interest.<br>Of course, I do agree wif u holeheartedly that some forumers are pure babaric in nature wif sickening characters but that is life as well, we hav to accept the fact that babarians do exist in our world(sadly). In short, if ya wish to gain public acceptance u have become rich and succesful using the right path. If not, yelling at others and using sacarsm on babaric ppl will not work.They are not called babarians for nothing. Ppl will onli look upon u if u are rich and powerful. That is life.</div>

The Taichung wireless project is even reported in the news and when Taichung is fully supported by this wireless thing, those money earned by subscription will keep flowing in. Somemore, they even have members going down to Taichung to see for themselves the technology. If it is a scam, will they dare to do it? I just hope you guys be more fair, haven't see anything yet already say it's scam.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Ist mth got the cash rebate and dividends so shld add up to 400 plus. then every mth on 10th, you get back your dividends which is abt 200 plus sing. However, the returns for gold partner is very much higher, dividend for each mth is 800+ usd. If you recommend more ppl, you also get to earn. That's the binary system.</div>
