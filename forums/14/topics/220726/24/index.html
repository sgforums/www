Laos traces its history to the Kingdom of Lan Xang or Land of a Million Elephants, which existed from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century. After a period as a French colony, it gained independence in 1949. A long civil war ended when the communist Pathet Lao came to power in 1975.<br><br>Private enterprise has increased since the mid-1980s. Laos has been ranked among the lowest countries in terms of economic and political freedom.[1] Despite this, the economy of Laos grew at 7.2% in 2006,[2] 35th fastest in the world. Eighty percent of the employed practice subsistence agriculture.[3] The country's ethnic make-up is extremely diverse, with only around 70% belonging to the largest ethnic group, the Lao<br><br>Terminology<br>The country name in the Lao language is "Muang Lao". The French, who made the country part of French Indochina in 1893, spelled it with the "s" which is usually retained in the spelling but rarely pronounced in the English name (pronounced as one syllable). The usual adjectival form is "Lao" (as in "the Lao economy"), not "Laotian", although the latter is commonly used to describe the people of Laos (to avoid confusion with the Lao ethnic group).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went to attend the BIP conducted by SE. Gathered the following personal findings. I hope someone can help clear my doubts.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Doubt 1</span></strong><br>Why is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Independent Affiliate</span> (Business Regional Manager) presenting the BIP? Can I take his word to represent the company's?<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Doubt 2</span></strong><br>Why is the presentation geared at recruitment? By explaining the e-points earnings by bringing in more BC. No concern over product?<br><br>At the same time, I hope someone still remembered my previous posts of the various facts. Till date, no one has answered or rebutted them. I hope by getting a proper explanation, the mysteries regarding SE would be solved.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fact 1 </strong></span><br>NTI has been renamed Sunshine Empire.<br>HBCI has been renamed EGA<br>Thus, both NTI and HBCI should not be reflected under the group of companies under EGA.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fact 2 </strong></span><br>As of the last check, EGA's shareholders are not shareholders in Emcom or SE. Thus the claim of EGA having SE and Emcom as subsidiaries are baseless. How to check? Go ACRA and do an enquiry. Pay $5.20 and you have your answer. Want more information? Pay more and you can see more.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fact 3 </strong></span><br>EGA's paid up capital is $100k. Emcom's paid up is $2m. SE's paid up is $150k. Don't you find it interesting that a company with $100k paid up should be an owner of a $2m paid up company?<br><br>I shall leave out Fact 4 as it would be another story if the discussion were to start. And I shall include a Fact 5.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 5</span></strong><br>There has been no concrete evidence of the fair and accurate records of the maximum, minimum, median, average and mode benefits that have accrued to the promoter and participants in the scheme or arrangement, duly audited by an auditor for each financial year. My only guess is that the financial year has not been closed. Are we that unlucky from October 2006 to June 2007, it has not been the year end closing?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fact 6</strong></span><br>It has been announced that InterVoice Media and Surge Global have been acquired by Emcom. However, there is no clear change of shareholdership for both companies. What is going on?<br><br>No point going on and on and on flaming/discussing. I just realised something stupid. How worthy would an independent affiliate's words be in such a situation, since they do not represent the company?<br><br></div>

From what i know, BRMs have a weekly meeting from Our Asia Pacific President... So their info release out should be accurate...<br><br>JUST like today u work in an company.. Your manager told u to do something before a offical memo is out... Does that mean u can say what your manger say is bullcrap..?<br><br>Based on what i know about the law..Mayb what i say is wrong...Sorry for anything wrong i say...[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Urm, do you seriously know what is the law of agency?<br><br>In fact, in most MLM companies, an independent distributor, or affliate as its called in SE, is not an agent, representative or employee of the company. Most legally sound MLM companies will write this into their contracts when an distributor sign up for the scheme.<br><br>In the eyes of the law, you cannot sign contract, make transactions, approve fundings etc in the name of the company. Most of the time, an agent is really the employee if the company, and independent affliates do not fall under this category. This is why mrleech is harping on this fact, this is why he said words from an independent affliates do not represent the company, hence you can simply say, whoever the SE affliate here is and what they said, is simply crap, no matter how high their rank or whether they have countless meeting with the president. and bear in mind, they are usually used  for disemmination of information, i am surprised you call their info 'accurate', how do you know they havent been lied to?<br><br>I find that in MLM companies, they dont really bother about technical terms, freely giving out positions which mirrors the corporate world, like managers and whatnot . I am afraid such terms are actually abused.<br><br>As long as you are an indepedent distributor, no matter how high you are up the in the hierarchy, your words do not count, simply because the powers are not given to you. In fact, words of the lowly paid counter staff at SE who is employed by the company holds more weight than even any highly paid independent distributors. Only he can make transactions and make representations on behalf of the company, and distributors can even hold his words as the company's words.<br><br>No management of sound mind would dare make their tens, hundreds or thousands of distributors 'agents' of the company, and unleash them upon the public and letting them spout rubbish all over the places.<br><br></div>
