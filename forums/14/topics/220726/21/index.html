The early birds get the $$ but late-comers suffer. Very high risk yet very profitable. Now it's not the time to put in money anymore. Too late. It will be officially reported to be a scam only when the latecomers don't get their returns or capital back and report their case to the authorities.</div>

I cant force you to believe every word I say anyway. However, there are facts that to be believed as they can be proven. For example, the directors of EGA. None of them owns SE or Emcom. How can that be if SE and Emcom are subsidiaries of EGA?<br><br>Promoting of products and earning a commission when I buy is fine. Not when you recruit someone and get a commission.</div>
