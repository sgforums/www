I only paid for the mimimum sum to enter.<br><br>I only went recently and as mention I don't think that my account has been created as my friend has not given me any account to log in, yet told me that I can't opt out , account cannot be closed.<br><br>As for other details especially my personal details, I'm sorry that I cant divulge any.<br><br>If you cannot help, then I think it's all right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>min sum means you open a BM/BP or BM/SP ?  Did you give the full sum ? If you have paid then your account should be create.<br><br>If your account is not create ask for your fren to find a replacement for you.  Its much faster than refund, when you join ?<br><br>I need more info to help you.</div>

Maybe you should talk to the manager instead to find a better solution or ask your fren to find someone to take over your accounts.

            <div class='col-md body'>My advise do not be afraid of them.<br><br>You do not need experience to reject something.  If you are undecisive means you also have some interest to stay on.<br><br>Anyway you should find the top manager to know more about the policy at least BDM.<br><br>I will update you with any info.</div>
