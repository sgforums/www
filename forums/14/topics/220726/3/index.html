            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... actually I too am part of the NTI-Emcom programme.<br>And I did collect my approx. 10% of what i put in, $2880. I had a Bronze Merchant acct from earlier this yr but i was too busy with my ATEC and everything so i didnt have time to do anything.<br><br>Other than my 10% from the returns, I earned around 800+ from my networking side. Also due to the fact that due to how the networking plan runs, i balance my BC easily as i have a resevoir on my other "leg".<br><br>I'm not saying everyone is as lucky as me. but making my point... i guess if you are not interested in it... becos maybe its just not for you... or you are anti mlm or whatever your reason is... stop defaming the company. if you are unable to risk that 3000 dollars or more or even your 500 dollars... then dont. please dont. you will just make yourself unhappy. Nothing in this world with returns comes without risk. but are you going to just not risk anything? maybe its just me, but i am someone who take calculated risk...<br><br>So far maybe its a scam that i can earn back 1/3 of what i have already put in. For me... rather than just standing outside the arena and see if its a scam i rather take what i can afford. NOTE: AFFORD. not money which u cannot part with, and see if it really is a scam. if not i win the gamble if it is... well as of now i only lost at most by my next pay out, about 1k plus. An affordable lesson. If it works out... well i guess... IT Does work then.<br><br>For people who cannot afford it dont try. The company never hard sells... if u are a victim of it... i guess ur friend or ur associate is just a black sheep. For me, if you are not interested, i'm okay. After all when i bring a 3k client in... what he will get in return is more than my 100USD if i do balance both sides. Its really up to that person if this is something he can afford to risk and see for himself if its a scam.<br><br>I myself did alot of research into Emcom partnership. Well maybe to some i may be a fool for signing up. but i guess when i earn from this... at least i profitted instead of people who just flame and keep their money at home. Btw... risk are always involved in 'investments'. Do your homework yourself, raise ur questions and if u are unsatisfied or feel insecured. dont do it. PLEASE DONT DO IT. because you only give everyone problems.<br><br>If you all really dont believe how much i earn, i will check with my superiors and see if its okay if i tag my payout slip and my returns slip here.<br><br>I'm just saying... flaming here wont earn u money. use your time wisely. go work or something. flaming here wont conclude anything. I suggest you try to learn more if your purpose here is to educate people who are green horn investors. i'm not sure if defaming another company here can land u in a lawsuit, but i doubt EGA is interested in you flaming here. but i guess its never nice to bad-mouth people if you got no solid proof.<br><br>Sure James Pang suffered alot of bad media. But to digress abit you all talk about singapore self investment values... you all talk so big... but yet you all dont even give James pang a chance to redeem himself, talk about yellow ribbon project... sure its about prisoners giving them a second chance.... but essentially its about the fomer part isnt it? giving people a second chance.<br><br>To end off, i came into this forum becos my superior joke to me about how you people act in here. reading ur flames has been amusing initially. but you all are just too much actually... esp some members who are just plain childish.<br><br>A forum is about information spreading and education... not just lashing out at someone... how different are you from those rioters who hide in the crowd as the same as you behind the screen. sure u may say i am doing the same. behind a screen. but i guess you know what i am getting at. if u really got some queries i believe you can come down to the company and ask them... if you wan to, u can pm me i can give u my contact number if u are so miser i can even pay for your transport fee. yes this is a sarcastic remark. but well i hope u can see it with that narrow mindset of yours.<br><br>Sorry i was alil angry there. anyway, please if u are unsure of how the partnership works do ask more. not just flame... and start calling people names. if you dont believe dont post. if u feel that people in here dont know what they are doing, share and educate. please for goodness sake dont call them stupid dont tell them that we are conning them. when we dont do it. give us some justice and alil respect if that is even possible from you.<br><br>Thank you for reading. You can flame me anyway you want to, but i guess the 3rd party reading ur replies can decide who has a moral high ground here. thats for him to decide himself. Thank You Again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Re: the refunds, there are ways to do it for this project/plan as far as i am concern. if you read the agreement properly, refer to Section 6 point a and b, of the Joint Partnership Agreement on Page 3. Your so called "upline" or his superior can do something about it. I hope this help the guy who wants to back out for whatever reasons he has.<br><br>I believe your agent wasn't very collaborative in going through the terms and conditions of the agreement with you. Yes this maybe his fault but as a client you yourself should read it as a first line of defense against after thoughts. The agreement is there to protect you and the company. Which is only natural.<br><br>As for forthcoming, well maybe laurence if you have the time and if its possible, ask someone who knows the project/plan well and let him show you the information which i believe is more than forthcoming.</div>
