I had heard of all those past projects he has before and had no confidence in them, thus I did not join any of them in the past.<br><br>I admit that when I first join the company, I was taking a big gamble due to their past records and wasn't expecting much. But with my buddy in it and making up to the management level in recent months, and also a close friend whom both of them had follow James Phang through all his past projects,  I got to know why their past projects failed and why the <span style="color: red;">2 of them are still following him. They were not earning much and neither were they of any high position before this event</span> was launched. But they respected him for something he did for them which most people in or out of the company do not know. I do see the potential in the current event base on the positive updates and seeing results of the company for the past few months.<br><br>Like you, this is also only my personal opinion and just for people reference. Regardless, I'll continue to keep this forum update of any good and bad news of this event. Cheers~!</div></blockquote>I know this reply is a bit late, but anyway, i just take a 3rd look and found this comment with some important points which maybe you can pick up something here. Here goes.<br><br>Now he only have 2 left from the previous large group of followers.<br>And you said, none are being respected back in the past, so they of course didn't know the REAL TOP SECRETS, if they found out the real reasons, then they would already have left already. (Listening to a 1-sided story is just bias, u need to listen to 2 sides; but I doubt u have the chance)<br><br>Back in his prime, he's followers goes as high as more than 2 handful of people in case you don't know. But when now he only is left with 2?  Take note that all those who left; they were all at least a meddium 5-digit income earners years back when they are still selling Products!!<br><br>Why can't he change back to the practical way of selling products?<br>Coz all businesses will conduct a background profile check on the partner first before co-operating with the partner. Thus he can only take the low-end products. (Businesses by which I mean those large enterprises with millions nearing billlions' revenue generated from the sales.<br><br>Just look at the products, not keeping up to trend, in business wise, it's lacks an appeal to attract customers.<br><br>Even he's right hand man, the person (course instructor) who taught PSC is with another company.  He already left in 2005, and took a long break to recover from his health conditions.<br><br>If you know James.P background, then you would already have noticed, all his top leaders, those right &amp; left hand man before 2005 in NTI have already left him. I'm talking about those people who really know their stuffs.<br>I'm not taking Jackie into consideration since he only start to gain his recognition in 05 when he became RSD, I'm talking about all his Uplines above.<br><br>You know why I'm able to know so much, and you guys can't even win me in terms of knowledge? Because I know the weakness in the education being taught inside. -Brush up on the foundation; if you know what i mean.<br><br>BTW: I highlighted the <span style="color: red;">key point</span> I hope u still is around to read this comment.</div>
