            <div class='col-md body'>Economists predict that we are living in the era of health and wellness and this next decade will give birth to the next trillion dollar industry. If we want to capitalize on this exciting new industry, not only must we get behind the trend before it booms, but we must have the best product in the market place. Usana offers a complete state of the art nutritional program that leaves all others behind.<br><br>With the concept of wholeness and balance, this number one company is not only at the forefront in the area of cellular nutrition, but it also creates an opportunity for financial freedom. Usana headquarters are located at Salt Lake City, Utah, and the company is publicly listed under Nasdaq.<br><br>Usana was founded in 1992 by Dr Myron Wentz, a renowned microbiologist and immunologist with over 30 years experience. Dr Wentz is best known for his work in the area of diagnostics, and is the pioneer behind the invention of the diagnostic test for ebsteen-bar virus glandular fever. From 1972 Gull Laboratories has been developing various diagnostic tests that up to today are used by hospitals and laboratories worldwide.<br><br>A leader in his field, Dr Wentz perfected human cell culture technology, and over the years he was responsible for growing billions of human cells in the lab in order to carry out his diagnostic work. One of the challenges faced by Dr Wentz was to keep the human cells from degeneration, and this led him to his work in cellular nutrition.<br><br>Dr Wentz found that in order to keep a human cell healthy and free of degeneration, the cell had to be fed with 59 essential nutrients. This ground breaking work led to a shift in Dr WentzÂ’s focus from diagnostics to human nutrition. Thus, Usana was born. Usana derives from a Greek Latin word meaning true health, and this is the vision that Dr Wentz has brought to the world today.<br><br>Since the inception of Usana in 1992, the company has enjoyed immense growth due to the superior quality of its nutritional products. In 1996, Usana established its first operation outside the US by opening in Canada, and this was followed by the Caribbean in 1997, Australia, New Zealand and the UK in 1998, the Netherlands and Hong Kong in 1999, Japan in 2001, and itÂ’s most recent opening, Taiwan in 2002.<br><br>Aside from UsanaÂ’s superior products, the growth of the company follows todayÂ’s trend, that of health and wellness. It is indeed an alarming fact that degenerative diseases are on the increase in modern times. It is interesting to note that prior to the 1900Â’s, most of the diseases causing premature death were of an infectious nature. However, with the advent of penicillin, these killer diseases were brought under control and they were no longer life threatening<br><br>Aside from UsanaÂ’s superior products, the growth of the company follows todayÂ’s trend, that of health and wellness. It is indeed an alarming fact that degenerative diseases are on the increase in modern times. It is interesting to note that prior to the 1900Â’s, most of the diseases causing premature death were of an infectious nature. However, with the advent of penicillin, these killer diseases were brought under control and they were no longer life threatening.<br><br>Why we can trust USANA? USANA is not headed by a business person, but by a prominent scientist who is an expert in cellular nutrition. USANA follows USP guidelines for potency, uniformity and disintegration. This ensures that any USANA product is potency guaranteed, in the right ratios for optimal nutrition, and with highest bio-availability. USANA is a scientific nutritional program designed by a scientist along with an expert team of scientists specializing in all facets of cellular nutrition.<br><br>USANA utilizes natural, superior ingredients in balanced formulas to ensure cell function integrity. Furthermore, all products follow GMP standards for pharmaceutical grade manufacturing. Most of the vitamins are designed to food manufacturing standards which are not exact. Therefore, USANA can claim the potency and ethicacy of its products as number one. Additionally, all products are manufactured in-house, in state of the art facilities<br><br>The main product in USANAÂ’s nutritional program is its multi-antioxidant multi-mineral formula called Essentials. The Essentials are an advanced nutritional supplement that provides daily supplementation for optimal health. Compared to other brands in the market place, the USANA essentials rates number one in the number of oxidation defense agents. Equivalent to the Essentials are Body Rox for teenagers, and Usanimals for children under 12. These products are balanced to meet the needs of growing children and teens.<br><br>USANAÂ’s revolutionary binary plan leaves all other network marketing companyÂ’s compensation plans far behind. If we look at some of the differences between USANAÂ’s binary plan and the more traditional multi-level marketing plans, it can easily be seen why USANA is voted number one.<br><br>USANA pays commission checks on a weekly basis, whereas other multi-level marketing companyÂ’s pay their commissions on a monthly basis. This is a long time to wait for a payment. In USANA, when a person does not qualify for a check, any unpaid volume is simply carried over to the following week, and the points never expire.<br><br>In other companyÂ’s there is no carried over volume. Therefore, if a person does not qualify for a check at the end of the month, they either lose all their points or they find themselves forced to buy extra stock to make up points to qualify. This is a costly exercise for someone trying to build up their business.<br><br>The USANA binary compensation plan is simple to explain and easy to understand. Other plans are complicated by having to hybrid and breakaway methods, and different commission percentage levels. USANA pays on volume accumulated by weekend. Other plans pay on percentages based on different levels. Most importantly of all however, USANA work on the power of two. A person introduces 2 people and they in turn introduce another 2 people, and so on. Because of the binary structure, when 2 people have already been introduced, the next person will be placed under one of the 2 people. This enables the upline to help the downline help to build their business. In other words, a strong bond is formed.<br><br>In other plans, a person can have many down-lines, none of which are linked to each other. This makes it difficult to build their own business, and there is no team work involved as each person must work individually to build their own business.<br><br>Company: Usana Health Science<br>http://www.usana.com<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br>Business Week Top 10 Hot Growth Companies 2004<br>http://bwnt.businessweek.com/hot_growth/2004/index.asp<br><br>USANA Shares<br>http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=USNA&amp;t=2y&amp;l=on&amp;z=m&amp;q=l&amp;c=<br><br>Best nutrition products<br>http://www.humannutrition.com/BestNutritionProducts.php<br><br>Products information<br>http://www.usana.com/products/<br><br>Business Plan<br>http://www.usana.com/USMAINPAGE_11940.html<br>http://www.unisuccess.com/usana/binary_en.html<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>Unisuccess Team:<br>We are most successful team in Usana business from Australia.
