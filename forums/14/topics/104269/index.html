            <div class='col-md body'>I have been in DW for quite some time. Recently i decided to quit, but before that i want to let ppl know that this company is a cheat. I was duped into joining this company by my friend. He told me many things, that he was earning alot of money..this that....all turned out to be bullshit. I joined, and asked my dad to buy the products, costing my family a few thousand dollars. I thought that i can actually earn the money back, but the fact is that even the directors of this company earn very little. mostly they earn 1 or 2 thousand dollars, but they brag and lie that they earn 10,000 dollars. They all drive mercedes cars and wear good clothes, but they dont have a single buck in their bank. I heard that many of them owe alot of money, to banks and their friends. I sincerely felt that it was a good company when i joined, so i recruited quite a few of my friends. At that time i didnt feel that there was anything wrong. But even after a few months there was no progress. I still was earning very little money, just 100 - 400 a month. Still i kept on trying but when i realised that even the directors earn so little money i decided to quit. I feel i did not make a mistake in buying the product because my parents notice the difference. But this company tries to make use of young teenagers to feed their own greed. There are many ppl who quit their school and their jobs to be part of this company. The management at DW condemn education and keep asking students to quit their schools to join this company. It is for this reason i really feel that we should warn as many ppl as possible to think before joining this company.</div>
