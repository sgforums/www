            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys,<br>im here too to share my experience i had in a XXXX company. well, like many of you guys said, they target young guillable teenager, which i was then.I believe this is post would be a more detailed post. Hope u guys will benefit from this.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Job Level</strong></span>*i wont post e exact names.<br><br><strong>Non-Management</strong><br><br>Recruits. They mainly supply networks for the company since they are new and they cant promote any products yet and so they would be "Accompanied" to their family,relatives,friends houses to promote their products.They earn 6.4% of Personal Sales.<br><br>Privates. The "Boss" will start to give orders for him/her to CONVINCE friends to come down for interview. Recruits who join the company under the name of XXXX Private would contribute to his group sales since they are directly under him/her. Him/her can start learning how to do the PRESENTATION, bring the recruits out for appointment and handle interview stuffs. Privates earn 6.8% of Personal Sales and<br>6% of Group Sales.<br><br><strong>Management</strong><br><br>Lance-Coporals( &lt; ). They are so called the incharge of Privates and Recruits. They are previllage to things since they are so called one of the "Old Birds" or "Lao Jiao". Their job is to bring Recruits to appointments, teach Privates Presentation, handle simple management in the office and handle interview stuffs. Lance-Coporals earn 7% Personal Sales and 7.2% of Group Sales.<br><br>Coporals( &lt;&lt; ). They are the just one rank below the "Boss". They mainly handle management in the office, bring Recruits to appointments, teach Privates Presentation, does First Interview and informant of the "Boss" also known as Secret Police(they will report EVERYTHING to the "Boss". they make very good friends with you.) They earn 7% Personal Sales and 7.6% of Group Sales.<br><br>Sergeant( &lt;&lt;&lt; ). He/she is the "Boss". Not the CEO of the whote company, just a JointVenture Company. He mainly does Final Interviews, encourage his downlines, handle management of course, give lectures and issue PAYCHECKS. Sergeant/the "Boss" earns 10% of JointVenture Company sales and his Direct downline Group Sales. In other words he's earning every appointment closed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interviews</strong></span><br><br>The people they recruit mostly are in the network of their downline of course since its network marketing and there are two parts of interview.<br><br><strong>First Interview</strong><br>People upon reaching the JointVenture office would be given a piece of application form which looks like any job application form. upon completion of the form, they would be "Guided" by a Private or any rank above except the "Boss" showing them around the company grounds and watch a DOCUMENTARY named "Healing Power of Biomagnetism", a Company's Profile and JointVenture Company's Profile. After all these, they will again be brought back to the office for the First Interview done by the Coporals.<br><br><strong>Final Interview</strong><br><br>The "Boss" would do an icebreaking session followed by asking those who is being interviewed with Qns like " ways to make money or get rich". Thereafter he would shatter your dreams, hopes and future with his REASONS, commonly used is "I've got three ways to become RICH. First way, STRIKE 4D and then he/she would say its hardly any chance so drop that idea. Second way, Have a RICH father and continue his business. But unfortunately most of us come from middle income families. Last way, Start your own BUSINESS, he would tell you that you'll need 100k to start a business and most of us dont have it and again drop the idea. Now he/she will Rebuild your CONFIDENCE with his GREAT IDEA. He/she will ask them if they want to JointVenture with him/her without paying a single cent and he/she will also guide them throught this business until they are ready to be their own and they only need to "Find Business" and he/she would tell them that they don't need to pay rent and buy stocks eg. And this is the part many people fell for. After the interview, the interviewees would be ACCOMPANIED by their friend(s) who INTRODUCED them. And under the orders of the "Boss" the INTRODUCER will do "FULL PROTECTION" which is telling the interviewee not to tell anyone about this job or what is it about. And henceforth they can SECURE this person would come back tomorrow. For your info, most of the interviewees are required to return tomorrow is because the RISK of them "LEAKING OUT" info of the job is LOWER. Now you guys can see they are pretty clever as such its a FULLY FLEDGE PROTECTION.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personal Experiences and Comments</strong></span><br><br>Personally i feel in the company many things are been kept from me. If XXXX person didnt tell me how much PERCENTAGE i should get, till the day i die, i wouldnt even know the real sum. During i was a Recruit, <strong>I DIDNT EVEN GET MY PERCENTAGE OF GROUP SALES</strong>, i didnt even know i was being cheat out of it and <strong>thou its only 6%.</strong> The "Boss" frequently boasts that he earns more than 10k a month and i did believe him/her then. <strong>Not untill i know he/she earns only 10% OF TOTAL JOINTVENTURE COMPANY SALES.</strong> When i was still in the company, the <strong>JOINTVENTURE COMPANY SALES DIDNT EVENT HIT AN AMOUNT THAT HE/SHE COULD EARN 10K MAINLY FROM TOTAL COMPANY SALES.</strong> Now i say its all <span style="font-style: italic;">BULLSH*T</span>! He/she often boasts his/her <strong>GOLD CREDIT CARDS</strong> which may actually be SUBCARDS because there's no visual differences. Its true that he/she says himself/herself earn <strong>"BIG BUCKS"</strong> everymonth. At his/her stage, YES. Others NO. And for a closing for my post, i would like to <strong>WARN</strong> you guys out there not to be swindled by MLM Companies althought not all are SWINDLERS.<br><br>Here are more reasons they tell you why you should join.Credit to Scarletfever.(GreatJob!)I left these out since Scarletfever did a greatjob.<br>http://bar.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=115236<br><br>Care n Concerned<br>ScrewedUpVictimOfMLM</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Long time since i never vist this forum. Still alot of gossip whether is true or fake. Don't think high society or successful people have time to gossip around. Haha. I love coming in to this forum as able to see alot of comments that people not happy, grumble or being both director and actors here. How true all this can be? Think mature enough people will understand. Why let your fingers do the talking, do direct approach to them! Slap them hard on the face and demand for an explaination. If it's true! No point telling stories or invent new stories.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
