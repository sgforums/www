            <div class='col-md body'>Who is the loser and who is not a loser, that i shall not debate about. What i want to say is that, through countless encounters with people doing MLM, they always seem to ride a wave of "Euphoria". It seemingly sucks them in and makes them think they are earning big bucks. Somehow MLMers always want to get BMWs, Ferraris, Big houses. Well something that you MLMers lack is being practical. I wouldn't even want to take FORBES to see how successful MLM companies are doing. Just take our local markets for instances. The top entrepeneurs? who are they? MLMers? Top companies ? MLM firms ? the answer is simply NO. In my life, i have see people come and go from MLM firms and they NEVER seem to get a car with "FULL PAYMENT IN CASH" thats one of their favourite lines it seem.<br>The worst thing isn't seeing my friend not fulfilling his dream to be rich and achieving financial stability but what hurts me the most is to see my friends fall apart socially. Hope you guys heavily involved in MLMS understand.<br>If i agitated any individual thru this post, it is truely unintentional and this is just my personal views and experience. =)<br>While you build business Networks thru MLM, you lose other networks like friendship.</div>
