At first I thought only need to pay one time registration fee, that's it.  cuz Nuskin is like that (I dun have Nuskin though).  Pay one time $65 of life membership, that's all.  Then for the rest of your life, you can use the membership to purchase the product/service only as and when you need.<br><br>But this telco one needs me to pay this money every month.  I don't even need it.  The service is supposed to help me save on my phone bill.  But hor... I checked the starhub bill.  I hardly exceed $35 every month.<br><br>At first I thought of sarporting my friend who invited me there.  But the monthly thing is a turnoff.  I definitely won't sign up to do business... not so into telco business.  But sign up as a user, I will put it on hold for the time being.  If my phone bill ever exceeds $150, then I consider.  If not, bo hua.<br><br>Very new company.  Yesterday was the very first meeting.</div>

One off retail profit for purchasing the IP Phone<br>and A company uses $2000/month worth of calls thru the Hyperfone, you receive 5-10% of their usage per month =US$100 to US$200.<br><br>That's about it.<br>Need more clarifications?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nightzip:</div><div class="quote_body">becareful of the MLM bubble, or more so, the telco bubble...cuz as many more companies come in, then some may collapse and fail....bubble burst.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </div></blockquote>NightZip is totally correct on this point.<br><br>There is no guarantee of success in any company.<br>Totally dependent on your own research and also knowledge of the market demand and supplies.<br><br><strong>Just a few reasons why I think Hyperfone stands a good chance.</strong><br><br>1) I've been studying and participated some of the Telco-based MLM companies for the past 12months - some have 'wound up' while some have 'stagnated' while some are 'gaining success'....<br><br>The reality is, Telco-based MLM in sg and in the region is still <strong>relatively new.</strong><br>Which means Hyperfone is in a relatively new market, ie. more opportunities of gaining market share.<br><br>2) The companies that have so far survived the stiff competition and gaining success are the bigger companies with <strong>strong financial and technical backup.</strong><br>PLUS most importantly, with <strong>good company management and distributor servicing.</strong><br><br>Hyperfone is run by IBN- International Business Network - Professionals!<br>(please visit the website by clicking on my signature below and read about them and who are the people in the management team)<br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Test the IBN Training System!</strong></span><br><span style="color: blue;">Go to <strong>Distributor Login</strong> at top right hand corner of the webpage and enter <strong>'demo'</strong> for both username and password. See what they have to offer distributors.</span><br><br>3) Most of the Telco-based MLM companies that are around are <strong>Resellers</strong> of the manufacturer's products and technology. This posed a very big issue with one of the companies when the manufacturer decided to market the products with their own MLM plan! The Reseller had practically no product to sell for a period of time...<br><br>Hyperfone owns its propriety technologies and products!<br>It even has a patented technology that so far no other companies have.<br><br>4) All the telco-based MLM companies are <strong>heading towards marketing VoIP technology.</strong> Why?<br><br><blockquote>About 13% of the worlds long distance calls already go through VOIP and industry experts Frost &amp; Sullivan say, "VOIP traffic is projected to account for approximately 75 percent of the worlds voice traffic by 2007."<br><br>And the prestigious Forester Research Group says that by the year 2020 virtually all regular and cellular calls will go through the Internet.<br><br>This means that the growth of this new technology over the next several years is going to be like nothing we've ever seen, and this phenomenal growth will continue for many years to come.</blockquote>- Hyperfone is all about VoIP! Basically its one of the most popular VoIP service providers inthe US..<br><br>5) So far all VoIP services <strong>can work ONLY on hi-speed and broadband connection.</strong> (Do a search on most popular VoIP providers)<br><br>- ONLY Hyperfone owns <strong>patented technology that allows its VoIP service to work on dial-up connection as slow as 28kbps!</strong><br><br>Now think of the huge advantage we have thanks to this patented technology, especially when marketing to the Asian countries who are mostly still using Dial-up connection!<br><br>VoIP <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> the biggest shift in communications since Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.<br><br>These are just my views.<br>As I always tell everyone, do your due diligence before getting into any biz opportunities.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I attended a talk by a Telco recently.  This is the system.<br><br>Buy the membership at $75, out of which $60 is the airtime and the membership fee is only $15.  When you sign up, it is compulsory to buy the product -- $60 worth of airtime.  You cannot pay anything less than $75.<br><br>When you recruit, your downline pays $75 and you get a commission out of it.  Isn't this like pyramid, where you earn from recruiting new members?  But they were very smart.  They say that the commission is not from the recruitment.  It is on the $60 worth of air time that your downline has purchase upon signing up.<br><br>In other words, pyramid still exists.  But they cleverly do it under the pretext of MLM.  During the talk, they emphasise so much on recruitment and little on the product itself.  Come on lah.  I have been to other talks.  Most of them emphasise on how good and how great is the product, but this company doesn't.  And guess what?  The speaker, Andrew, was actually previously from another Telco MLM called the 1CellNet.  My friend signed up for that one before and the company shut down for a period of time.  Andrew is a very inspiring speaker.  But too bad.  The very fact that I know he was from another company has already discredited his name.<br><br>My friend who invited me kept wanting to recruit me.  He is my friend, and he needs money.  So I told him that I will buy the membership, but I won't do the business.  Isn't this very clear that I just want to give him a little support?  I told him that I will just want to use the airtime and that's it.  I don't want to do any recruitment or sales of airtime.  But my friend kept asking me, why not do the business since day in day out I am meeting people.  I told him that I can help him meet these ppl that I see every day, who can be converted to his customers.  He kept insisting me doing the business and help recruit these people.  I told him that I am busy.  Maybe later when I am more free from my workload.  He would say "Why not now?"<br><br>What is wrong with him?  Does he need me to tell him straight that I am talking to him just because I am feeling sorry for him???  Thank God after the last conversation, he hasn't been calling me.</div>
