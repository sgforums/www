            <div class='col-md body'>oh and i've read e article...bt still, it has failed to prove anything.<br><br>firstly, you are under e implicit assumption that i have failed in mlm, as the article is directed towards pple of this strata. wrong. i have nt failed, neither have i succeeded. i left cos of the inherent flaws present in the system. But when i was still there, i guess i must have made quite abit for e company... my up-upline still calls me now and then, asking me when will i be back.<br><br>Also, i call into question the credibility of this article. this article is essentially written by a person who has succeeded in mlm. It is therefore a one-sided persective altogether and a rather limited source in that sense.  i suggest you go read articles pointing out e flaws and fallacies to get a more balanced view.<br><br>This article cannot be taken into account because it is totally irrelevant and out of context. It talks abt mlm in e states. How many times have i reiterated  that mlm is a good way to make money. When did i enunciate it was not?? But in e singaporean context, i'm afraid this is only but an unachievable dream for many, simply cos of our overwhelmingly small population. In china, the business is booming like crazy and e money keeps rolling in. Not so here in singapore -- only 2% of mlmers are making money, according to a recent straits times report.<br><br>Still, you have yet to address my concerns abt e moral aspects of e trade. MLM thrives by feeding on mutual friendship and trust as mlmers have no qualms abt capitalising on friendships without e least compunction. That's e last thing i would want to do in my whole entire existence as a human being. read my earlier posts in this forum.<br><br>Why show me this article?? i am just wasting my time reading it. This is totally irrelevant to me, addressing issues such as mlm being a loosely disguised pyramid. You can't just put up any website you like -- it has to apply to the case. Like all mlmers (especially those at the top), you seek to affirm e faith in e trade by talking abt mlm elsewhere.. but remember, its never about elsewhere, its Singapore that we are discussing here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems to me u think that networking means damaging relationships or even destroying it so dat's you are probably so against it. You see, dat's wat i call self-discovery becos u actually question yourself whethery the biz is morally wrong. That is wat most networkers shld do now and then. It means that at least networkers have a conscience after all.  I understand dat it is probably your primary concern regarding feeding on relationships that has probably made u reconsider doin mlm as a viable way of earning money. But isn't dat the basis of all biz,even in your workplace? To me, mlm is a also a test of ur handling relationships which is why many ppl fail dat's y they fail to see the point of not pestering their families and friends. If u genuinely see, i mean genuinely, a product or service that is really beneficial to your friends why not tell them about it? Sure it's about making money in ur mind ur face can show but if u know that it's really good so ur passion for it is strong Im sure ur fren can tell rite? It's such a good thing that they reward u abt the good thing u told them so much so that it is a mutually beneficial thing. Ur true frens shld be the one supporting and believing in u and u shld not abuse their trust either. However if he doesn't see that it benefits him y bother to pester him? If ur opp or product or service is so gd then y have to pester unless the distributor himself cannot sincerely believe in the product or service and enjoy its benefits. The article itself may be in the context of America but is still related becos of its similar responses to mlm in America.  U said it's a one-sided view? Maybe. But the writer is a US court-recognised expert and has written a book called "Inside Network Marketing" showin objectivity and he does lashes out at the way mlmers conduct their biz. The way mlmers put it is to shove down the throat of their friends the products or services or opp, whereby they may not need at all. That shld not be the way. That's sales. But being a true communicator shld be like a nurse listenin to ppl's needs and giving them what they want-that's networking, i believe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Devoid05, abt the part where u said that Singapore market is too small i would have to agree wif that. But dat does not mean u still cannot be successful at mlm in S'pore. y? Becos u do not have to be a superstar in mlm to be successful. According to my own experiences, some ppl merely wants to use the products or services to enjoy the discount benefits at distributor prices. Some wants to earn extra few hundred dollars a month to build their retirement nest egg. Some wants some pocket money. Finally some may want to earn the big income type as in 4-5 figure income type. Even if u are a superstar in mlm dat does not mean u are still financially-free becos the world is not perfect. As the chance of your company in peril is always there even though it can be as big as Amway. Amway can collapse as history has proven dat big corporations had collapsed b4. So we got to be realistic here. Some of us mlmers may feel dat a few hundred dollars per month is enough to achieving financial freedom. For example, if u accumulate a few hundred dollars a month without spending it from networking, after a few years you could buy some stocks and invest or you could jus save up for your retirement and invest in the bank and earn the interest rates. Isn't that a good and feasible way? And you do not need to have a huge network to earn a few hundred dollars rite?</div>

When i started to question e moral aspects of e business, it does not mean that i have self-discovery... it simply means that i have e wisdom to discern whats right from wrong... and network marketeer's have demonstrated a severe lack of self-discovery, according to your definition of e word, as they have failed to question e flaws in e system. or izzt they simply refuse to look at it? You are contradicting yourself in this case. firstly you said that network marketing embarks one on e road to self-discovery. Next you said that discovering e moral flaws of e system is self-discovery... which isn't evident in many network marketeers, as they have gone from bad to worse, thus going against your first argument. what are you exactly driving at???<br><br>network marketing being a test of handling relationship? This argument sounds so good... but don't forget -- it just doesn't apply to mlm alone. Even in e workplace or in school, you face many hurdles in your relationships that you have to look for ways and means to overcome them. You say that network marketing is a test of handling relationships... i say it destroys relationships. see my earlier posts. Hw can one test out relationships by spending all day long in an mlm company and using friends as a money making tool? "destroy" would be a better word, although "test" sounds pleasing to e ears.<br><br>i didn't say that i did not believe in e product. I believed in it, and that's why i joined.<br><br>yeah... i believe you truly wanna benefit your friend cos your belief in e product is as staunch as a muslim's or a christian's belief in his or her faith. But above all, your primary motive is to garner as much points as possible so as to climb to e next rung of e mlm ladder. benefitting your friend is not unimportant, but it's secondary. I can't possibly coincide e aggressive behaviour of many network marketeer's here with the word benefit. Human beings are sensitive creatures, and whether you truly wanna benefit them, they can see for themselves.<br><br>My true friends should be e ones supporting me?? your definition of true friend, very much like your definition of self-discovery, is pretty screwed up. If that is what you make your true friend out to be, i believe you would expect your true friend to give you money to satisfy your cravings for drugs, shld you become a drug addict one day. Personally, i wouldn't want my friend to condone my misdeeds. When i first joined, many of my friends strongly advised me against it, citing various reasons. Despite their warnings, i still went ahead with it. It was only later upon attaining enlightenment that i realised how mlm had pricked my conscience, i quit without any hesistation. You know what they said? they went like "we are so happy for you... we were so worried about you all e time you were in that company..." that's what i mean by true friends, get the picture?<br><br>And you admitted that you haboured thoughts of "making money in your mind". see what i mean? By doing so, you are reducing your friends to no more than money-spinning machines. You very well knew that you were someone they could trust, therefore you sold e product to them, knowing full well they would find it hard to oblige. this is what i mean by capitalising on relationships. Never mind abt the benefitting part, as i have said... it's only secondary, something you consistently tell yourself just to ease your conscience.<br><br>And you said that if our friends didn't want to buy e product, we shld not force it down their throats. I fully agree with you, and as i have said... many network marketeers have adopted such a hardselling attitude, simply by refusing to take no for an answer. Why are you promulgating your values abt mlm here?? You shouldn't do that, because you will just reinforce the points which i made. can't you see the scenario which i am trying to paint? For network marketing to work, certain assumptions must hold, ceteris paribus. these assumptions include a wide market with majority of e population being receptive to mlm, companies being ethically run and mlmers having a correct attitude. But we know that in reality, all these assumptions do not hold water, esp in sg. And because of this, mlm has failed. So by promulgating your marketing ethnics, it only reminds us how doomed mlm is in sg, simply cos it has failed to meet these criteria.<br><br><strong><blockquote>U said it's a one-sided view? Maybe. But the writer is a US court-recognised expert and has written a book called "Inside Network Marketing" showin objectivity and he does lashes out at the way mlmers conduct their biz. </blockquote></strong><br><br>So you agree with me that's its a one sided view... then stop defending e article... for heaven's sake... go get another negative article to get a more balanced view.<br><br><strong><blockquote>The way mlmers put it is to shove down the throat of their friends the products or services or opp, whereby they may not need at all. That shld not be the way. That's sales. But being a true communicator shld be like a nurse listenin to ppl's needs and giving them what they want-that's networking</blockquote></strong><br><br>See what i mean?? you try to tell me what network marketeers should do and how they should behave. But that's not the point here. My point is that network marketeers CAN'T behave...not how SHOULD they behave. i am not here to set guidelines for their behaviours you know. You are supposed to refute my claim otherwise by proving that they are an ethical bunch. If they could conduct their business in such a proper and professional manner, i wouldn't have advised pple to stay away from e industry. Again, you are just enforcing e points which i have made.<br><br><strong><blockquote>The article itself may be in the context of America but is still related becos of its similar responses to mlm in America. </blockquote></strong><br><br>it's not similar... Just because there were similar responses in America, you can't say that it is similar to singapore's case. Like i said, what works for USA may not work for singapore. This article is by all means, a totally irrelevant and biased one to me. It's cannot be applied to singapore. For one, this article adressess issues such as mlm being a loosely disguised pyramid...now now... where on earth did i say that it was?? And many more issues which are not pertaining to my reasons for being against this trade. So by simply posting the website, you are not answering my questions. You are just trying to throw a whole bunch of irrelevant answers in my face. Also, this article is irrelevant because the population size in sg cannot be compared to that of the states. You know very well that above all the preconditions for a thriving mlm business, one of them must include a large enough population to sustain the trade. mlm in singapore faces lots of constraints because of our small population, unlike the USA. And how do you dispute my claim that only 2% of mlmers are earning, according to a straits times report?? I believe that the proportion is much higher in the states for mlm to work. Moreover, e way companies are being run in e states are totally different from e ways companies in sg are being run. So how can that article be relevant??? In e first place, this article does not directly address my genuine concerns about the trade!<br><br><strong><blockquote>However if he doesn't see that it benefits him y bother to pester him? If ur opp or product or service is so gd then y have to pester unless the distributor himself cannot sincerely believe in the product or service and enjoy its benefits.</blockquote></strong><br><br>Again, why are you narrating a whole chapter of marketing ethnics??? It is not i, but those in e trade, at whom e preaching should be directed at.</div>

So now you are agreeing with me that mlm does not promise financial freedom, according to the true definition of the word.

And how do you earn that hundred bucks? simply by coercing your relatives and friends into supporting you.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>First and foremost I would like to make it clear that Im not on whose side or wat. I would like to be as objective as much as possible. My stand is that u can earn money from MLM as much as u want and as ethically and professionally as possible. It's true many has regarded MLM as a full time career, especially in sg. However this is not realistic. As an independent distributor u determine ur own income. Nobody is goin to pay u anything. So it's rather naive to go full time unless u have substantiate savings.<br><br>Let's start out by ur commenting on the moral values of the system. What's the definition of network marketing? It's recommending a product or service or opp that u believe in to someone u care abt. Is there anything immoral here? Yes and no. U can believe in drugs and asking ur frens to take it. U can believe in scams and con ur frens or relatives. But will u? On the other hand u can believe in a great product or service that can help ur frens and refer it them and earn a referal fee. After they find the product is gd u can ask if they are interested in the biz. Is there a tinge of immorality here, not to mention they are earnin all the discounts? I dun think so. Yes it's true that we want to earn money. Consider this: If ur fren sets up a biz and u are asked to help after a few mths will u take his money? Will u say I dun want to make ur money even though u put in effort? If u open a shop will u want to give everything to ur frens for free? In mlm as distributors if ur fren wants to get a product will u pay for him? We are all earning money frm one another. My fren it's not a matter of making money frm him,  it's a matter of the u gettin a reward for providin a value of service for him and he gettin the benefits.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by excused:<br><br>[quote]<strong>Let's start out by ur commenting on the moral values of the system. What's the definition of network marketing? It's recommending a product or service or opp that u believe in to someone u care abt. Is there anything immoral here? Yes and no.</strong></blockquote>sigh...as i have said thrice over... the main purpose of many mlmers is not to benefit friends. the main purpose is money, and money is the source that drives the hearts and souls of you guys. If you really wanted to benefit your friends, then for heaven's sake, forgo whatever commission you are entitled to absorb from your downlines and customers. only then can you genuinely say that you truly have the intention to benefit your friends. As i have said and i shall repeat myself again... you are just using the excuse of benefitting people to make yourselves feel better, as this has the effect of easing the smeared conscience of you guys.<br><br><strong><blockquote>U can believe in drugs and asking ur frens to take it. U can believe in scams and con ur frens or relatives. But will u? On the other hand u can believe in a great product or service that can help ur frens and refer it them and earn a referal fee. After they find the product is gd u can ask if they are interested in the biz. Is there a tinge of immorality here, not to mention they are earnin all the discounts? I dun think so. Yes it's true that we want to earn money. Consider this: If ur fren sets up a biz and u are asked to help after a few mths will u take his money? </blockquote></strong><br><br>my answer is a definite NO.... common' i don't believe in taking my friends' money. Then you are not helping your friend anymore... its more like a case of mutual benefit. IMagine a world where after receiving such great help from someone, your friend stretches out a hand for a referral fee. it hurts huh?? mlm just makes it sound like a good idea... but bullshit... it was never a good idea right from e start and it never will be. If i help my friend, i jolly well help him to the best of my ability without receiving any benefits from him.<br><br><strong><blockquote>Will u say I dun want to make ur money even though u put in effort?</blockquote></strong><br><br>i wouldn't want the money as the joy and the satisfaction i derive from helping a friend is something that money can't buy. Your morals are screwed up man... u ought to do some reflection. Why are you so calculative?? It's precisely cos you have put in so much effort in helping someone, you derive even more joy from it. Haven't you heard of the saying "its more blessed to give than to receive"? That's what i mean when i say mlm has redefined and shaped a person's values in a negative sense. The word "help" no longer holds any meaning anymore, simply cos i'm expected to give the person a fair share of monetary benefits for the help he has rendered to me!!<br><br><strong><blockquote>If u open a shop will u want to give everything to ur frens for free?</blockquote></strong><br><br>i wouldn't wanna give everything to my friends for free in this case cos i'm doing a business... But how i hate the idea of a doing a business that thrives on e trust and friendship between two parties. If i open a shop, i will not be capitalising on any friendships or family relations. Bulk of my customers will be the general public... however, in mlm you can't possibly sell it to total strangers!!<br><br><strong><blockquote>In mlm as distributors if ur fren wants to get a product will u pay for him? We are all earning money frm one another. My fren it's not a matter of making money frm him,  it's a matter of the u gettin a reward for providin a value of service for him and he gettin the benefits. As a true fren as u shld be, u shld oso be concerned abt his well-being after usin the products or services. This is being mutually beneficial. I guess as singaporeans in a conservative society, we care too much abt our face abt making frens' money or wat. </blockquote></strong><br><br>again... this sounds so good and yet sucks so bad. As a matter of fact, wouldn't it be better if you had provided your friend e service for free??? If you truly poccessed the intention to benefit him, you would have done it for free. If not, you are just capitalising on relationships, simple as that. As long as you are reaping a share of profits from your friends, your friends are no more than your money-making tools. And i'm not the least happy with the way mlmers conduct their business over here. The mindset you just mentioned is evidently lacking in many of them. They go to the extent of pestering their friends relentlessly, till their friends feel so harassed, telling them that they are doing all this for the "benefit of their friends"... see the irony??<br><br><strong><blockquote>And if he doesnt want it let it be. And who says we have to make money frm frens? There are other ways to find ppl who are interested. And as a mlmer our job is to teach leadership skills to ppl who in turn teach their own grps. It's learning abt how to fish, not being given the fish.</blockquote></strong><br><br>yeah... teach leadership skills... how on earth do you get such a golden opportunity?? by rising to the top of the ladder of course. and how do you do that?? again, by capitalising on friendships. duh... it all boils down to square number one. You can't possibly sell a product to a total stranger... i mean with all e intense competition from established pharmacies like guardian, many of us would just perfer a walk-in.<br><br><strong><blockquote>If u see ur frens as tools for making money they can tell as u said, humans are sensitive and intelligent beings.

Isn't that better?</blockquote></strong><br><br>communication is the key of life... this is so very true... but you are quite slow aren't you??? you mean throughout your existence on this earth for ten years and more, you have never learnt how to communicate with pple??? Nor as a friend, you've never tried to understand the problems and difficulties your counterparts are going through? you really blow me off. when you were in school, didn't you learn how to connect with pple? And frankly, i don't see how mlmers can connect with pple. they are a pretty hated bunch... spending all their time in their companies. Why, the only pple they ever connect on a personal basis would be their fellow network marketeers themselves! in fact, they should get out of their shell -- the only world that revolves around them is e world of mlm. What do they know other than mlm and business? i've seen so many mlmers who are no better than stay-at-home mums and housewives, they know nothing about the world! Their definitions of life are all the same and just as shallow - to make money, more money and even more money.<br><br>MOreover, Isn't that so true for every job?? you learn how to communicate in every job that you undertake in e coporate world.<br><br><strong><blockquote>Yes ur true frens are those who would advise u to stay away frm unethical companies and distributors but not those ethical ones.

They may not join or buy but still wish u the best in ur endeavours whole-heartedly. </blockquote></strong><br><br>i wouldn't want such friends. if they just believe in whatever you believe in, it will merely be a case of the blind leading the blind. Friends are supposed to uphold you and enlighten you with their unique views and perspectives. Again, you seriously need to reevaluate your definition of friendship.<br><br>The problem with the local network marketing scene is that majority of mlm companies are found to be unethical and their reputations, severely tarnished. The reputation of the industry is so smeared that out of 100 companies you join, chances are almost everyone of them have blemished records, with the exception of one or two. It's highly impossibly to differentiate the good and the bad ones as they have been all identified under a single banner of mlm.<br><br><strong><blockquote>MLM does work for sg. As for the 2 % report it's not really accurate. </blockquote></strong><br>Not accurate?? If only you would open your eyes to see, you would find that majority of your colleagues are facing problems getting downlines and all that stuff. Not accurate?? hello, this is from the straits times, mind you. are you implying that a reputable paper like theirs would conjure up facts and figures without any substantial evidence? If that is so, why aren't they sued for defamatory? Not unless the top pple in mlm are well aware of it themselves. ON what basis are you making such a statement?? where are your facts to prove otherwise? Even other networkers in this forum agree with this point! And aft so many months of doing business, haven't you realise that the sheer magnitude of the customer base is just so crucial to its success?? Sg's population is so small and with such intense rivalry among companies, you are saying that more than 2% are earning? that's being a little too idealistic huh? It does work for 2% of them, but definitely not for the majority.<br><br><strong><blockquote>Many ppl have, as i have said starts to put network marketing as another side income b4 realising that it can help them earn a substantial monthly income b4 launching into full time.

When they find that they are unable to make the kind of money they previously earned, huge debts start to mount and before you know it, the bank is hot at their heels...<br><br>earn a substantial income??? again, 98% of mlmers are not earning! it's so true! if you have done a random survey... you would have many pple telling you that mlm cannot give you a substantial income.<br><br><strong>[b]<blockquote>Who says that earnin a few hundred dollars is not enough to have financial freedom?

It's stupid to dabble in shares and here you are telling pple to play with the stock market... have you any realization what this may lead to?? and please, all these skills abt investing are so self-explanatory, i believe that even if you do not tell them, pple would have done that long ago.<br><br><strong><blockquote>My point is this network marketing can be done in sg ethically sideline or full time.

What can we conclude from all this? companies have folded up one after another, mlmers have not changed their attitudes...<br><br>And mlm cannot be done as a full time. okok...so your statement applies to the selected 2%, but what about the remaining 98%? Do not attempt to bring them to any further harm by telling them that they can launch into it full-scale when they are not even seeing the money! and the idea about you making money out of your friends is certainly never rewarding?? why not find a coporate job?? its just as rewarding!!!<br></div>

So now you are agreeing with me that mlm does not promise financial freedom, according to the true definition of the word.

I have sort of resigned to fate that MLM will always be a business model used by some companies, and MLM will not cease to exist as long as we humans do.

List down its flaws and its fallacies as well as the benefits it brings. Do some research in the library and over the net to aide in your listing. in this way you get a more balanced view of the pros and the cons of the system. be true to yourself... asked yourself whether it has gone against your conscience.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is no point in arguing over mlm anymore. The result will be endless and still lead to nowhere.  Anti mlm ppl will find all sorts of reasons to tell ppl not to do mlm. Mlmers of course will do otherwise. The fact is mlm is already here. And I still firmly believe in certain mlm's products and opportunity becos it has worked to improve my family's lives as well as others. Still let us continue with our endeavours.
