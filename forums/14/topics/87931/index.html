            <div class='col-md body'>Heard from some of my friends that they were conned into listening the MLM plans by their friends.Usually what happen is that this XXX friend of theirs whom they have not met for sometime call them out for an old time gathering. When they meet, XXX will talk to them for a while before telling them he know of this great biz opportunity and is working with this YYY guy whois very 'powerful'. Then XXX will say he is meeting YYY later and ask my friends to accompany them to meet YYY. So when they meet YYY, YYY explains the compensation plan and the company they are in for at least 1-2 hrs .Then after which all my friends go home feeling more 'ANTI-MLM' and angry.<br><br>Therefore for the current MLMers, wat do you think is the correct attitude and ways to do things in MLMs. Should we holdback information when inviting prospects or openly tell them certain things..Should we share information and experiences like how to recruit with people not in your group, even if they are from a different company?<br><br>Different people have different styles so hope we hear different views. Some dun think we should help other people from other companies as it will indirectly result in themselves losing possible prospects but some really will help.<br><br>MLMs is about sharing, so hope we can help each other, because 'only when you are earning money, then I can earn money out of you'. This is something I heard from a traditional businessman which I think is very true in MLM.</div>

If you know that your friends are beginning to stay away from you because you reject their offers, it's time for you to relook into the relationships.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>the concept of network marketing is morally wrong... and of course i have my reasons for saying so<br><br>firstly, network marketing is too much of a "friendship-based" kind of thing... getting your friend to join under you and the latter pulling his friends in and so on and so forth...the cycle is endless and infinite. This itself undermines the concept of a genuine friendship, as your friends have become no more than money making tools to you. From a network marketeer's perspective, as they are called ( to me, its just another classy term for a salesperson), they are merely trying to help their friends make "easy money", thus enabling them to get out of the so-called rat race. While it is easy to bring in these set of good intentions to cover up their hidden agendas, i think it is impossible for these people to deny that they have never harboured thoughts of using their friends as money-spinning machines or as stepping stones to climb to the next rung of the marketing ladder.<br><br>contrary to the popular belief held by so many network marketeers, the belief that network marketing empowers one to gain a mastery over his finances, many actually find themselves fast becoming slaves to money. The problem is that these people are so blinded by greed and wealth, they fail to realise that they have neglected their families and friends - their relentless pursuit of wealth being fuelled by the incessant brainwashing that many mlms resort to. A perfect life example would be my aunt, whose stint with a network marketing company has not left us unscathed. It's been a long time, ever since she joined that company (which i reserve the right not to name), that she has come home before 10pm, often leaving the house at 9 am in the morning. Now, she hardly talks to family members and even when she does, it is in a rather business like manner, asking for referrals.<br><br>a world dominated by network marketing would surely see many more parents left "childless", figuratively speaking... many virtual orphans surfacing... and many long-time friendships broken... surely i believe that many of us would not like to see that happening?<br><br>To sum it all up, network marketing is an insidious virus that has infected the local business scene, hell bent on shaking loose the foundations of friendships and family ties. For those out there who are considering joining the trade... think about it: Am i prepared to sacrifice many friendships and time with my family for the sake of momentary financial gain? will i be doing my friends a wrong by making money out of their families and friends? If this is not enough to hurt your conscience, then you have my blessings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mlm doesn't suck. their products suck. that is why they cost much more than similar products of better quality. another reason for the high price is because they wanna hit and run. because everyone knows, after they con you into buying 1 of their samples to try, you will never want to step into their shop again. i'm talking about products only. however, if you are an opportunistic pyramid scam junkie who wants to get rich quick by cheating downlines' money and teaching them how to cheat downlines' money and so on...... voila, mlm is just the right job for you. just make sure that all your friends are either fools, rich kids or scammers just like you</div>
