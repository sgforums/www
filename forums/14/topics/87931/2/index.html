Thus, i'm not e least assured of your convincing prowess. Neither do i trust that you would come down alone. Most probably, you would resort to intimidation by bringing a whole bunch of colleagues down. (i'm sorry if i'm mistaken abt you, but i wouldn't want to repeat e same mistake aft a bad experience... once bitten, twice shy.) if you think that a discussion on this forum is a waste of time, then why are you here in e first place? Not unless you came with a partisan mind, in the light to assess e pros of network marketing, rather than getting a factual overview of e entire situation.</div>

Boy, you surely are thick skinned when it comes to sales, but when it boils down to criticisms and cynical remarks, you are rather thin-skinned and you lack e capacity to take it in your own stride. Now tell me, when have i ever insulted you? And even if i did sound abit rude, which of these claims were false? state em here for everyone to see.<br><br>and hey, have you ever asked yourself why these pple support e claims that i'm making? why aren't there any networkers coming to your rescue here? simply cos your arguments are weak and pervaded with fallacies, devoid of any evidence. these pple have their fair share of bad experiences too, and instead of clearing their doubts and reaffirming their faith in this trade, you simply scorn it off. don't you forget this -- You are supposed to be e one who's better at convincing, not me. aft all, you have all e training and convincing lessons you can ever get from your company.<br><br>Network marketing is a relatively new industry in singapore. Altho it has been ard fer ten years or so, pple have not fully come to terms with it yet. Despite being officially recognised by e govt, this trade would have to defend its rights to exist time and time again, just as when e concept of mlm was first introduced in e market, amway had to defend her rights to exist by fending off her critics and federal court rulings not with groundless remarks, but solid evidences and claims.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wish to state that MLM works. History has proven it. It is simply just another form of distribution. It's legality is sound and concept well-defined. I would like to correct devoid05 that MLM's history is more than 50 yrs, not 10 plus yrs. It's idea is not new. According to Multiple Streams Of Income author Robert G. Allen, it is nothing more than another stream of income, whose income potential is virtually unlimited. Sure, in any other industry there would surely be the bad sheep and the good sheep. However, the majority of mlmers around the world have done the biz correctly and ethically. If your fren says no, Im sure most ethical companies would have told their distributors to say "next". Until they find someone interested in the biz or product. That would surely take patience and dedicaiton and hard work. It's not about convincing someone but finding the person who's interested. And it's uncool to bug your relatives and friends continuosly! It's not wat u do but how u do it. Many mlmers have done their biz correctly and professionally. If your fren wants to recruit you, he will be doing the industry a disservice if he just leaves you alone to survive in the mlm world. He has every responsibility to make sure you succeed in this biz. MLM is about discovering your values as a person and personal growth in disguise as a way of moving products. Please be open-minded.

In fact, the mlm business is flourishing elsewhere in e world. But NOT in singapore. why? simply cos our population is too small to sustain such a trade. That probably sums up e rationale behind  the aggressive tendencies of many mlmers here.<br><br>i did nt say that mlm CANNOT be a stream of income. i said that in singapore, it can only be done as a sideline. Pls read "do you hate mlmers"... However, many tend to treat mlm as a career in sg, rather than a sideline. The consequences are only too conceivable -- some of them end up quitting their jobs in a drastic move to make more money, only to find themselves head over heels in debt.<br><br>In e first place, i have never questioned e legality abt this trade. i only said it had to defend its rights to exist, legal as it may be. And what may apply for e rest of e world may not apply here in singapore. You can't possibly use world mlm history to prove that mlm in singapore works. They are two paralleled courses altogether. Communism may work for Vietnam, bt it doesn't work for USSR. MLM companies in singapore are unethical, too often a time adopting a hardselling stance. I say this based on my interaction with friends in this trade and my past experiences. It really puts pple off. For god's sake, save some dignity for yourselves. Which mlm company has emerged untainted by random complaints, be it fer cheating or lying? yupp... it's totally uncool to bug your relatives... but when e population in singapore is so small and when majority of singaporeans are still found unreceptive to such an industry, mlmers are left with no choice but to bug their closest of kin. You can't deny that they are unethical... it's proven that they are.<br><br>For all your rhetoric abt marketing ethnics, it is highly apparent that many of mlmers are unable to grasp that chapter fully. what do you define as professional??? i can name soo many examples where they have stood out as being an unethical bunch, nt only that -- what's even worse is that they strike me as fake. It doesn't matter how brilliantly they have expounded their beliefs in the trade. too often a time, i see mlmers bugging pple in a desperate bid to boost their sales and recruitment, luring pple with incentives like cars and five figure incomes.<br><br>it was precisely cos i was open minded in the trade that i joined in e first place. It's never abt me being open minded, its abt your arguments being sound. When i posted my arguments and doubts in this forum, networkers will occasionally respond here and then. But when i reply again, it seems that many of them have become speechless for words. In mlm, i did not discover my values. on e contrary, i found myself on e verge of compromising on them. read do you hate mlmers again... i have seen pple joining this trade never to become better, only to become more moneyminded and bad-tempered than ever. seriously, what have you learnt from this trade other than convincing techniques (which obviously doesn't work cos many networkers still lack convincing power), social skills and the likes of these? Personal growth?? haa... if you wanna develop socially and morally, i suggest you go join some community club or a school.<br><br>And when did i say that my friend left me alone?? he didn't leave me alone... i only saw our friendship festering away for what he has become...</div>
