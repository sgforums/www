            <div class='col-md body'>i too choose character and must have a bit of the looks.<br><br>i don't want to get a girl who is too pretty for me anyway. what if one day she hooks up with another guy behind my back? that would just be easy on her and hard for me. why should i sacrifice my heart just to most likely get betrayed? even if she had told me beforehand just to clear her guilty conscience it would still be hard on me. maybe i am a sensitive person but this to me is a most dangerous stage for a guy and it might change him. thing is, i don't want that to happen so that is why i wouldn't prefer much of their looks cos its something i can't trust. unless she stood up to me and told me that she really cared for me which is something i am not hoping for it to happen because in the third dimension it just won't! or in any other ways that shows her sincerity. (oh come on! stop kidding yourself! who on earth would actually do that?)<br><br>i've been hurt before (doesn't apply to anyone that i might know but just me)  so when i see a pretty girl in shopping malls, its just not the same anymore. instead, what i see is a knife and then i would feel my heartbeat. why a knife? because looks to me is nothing more of a weapon. just like a knife, it can be use but also to hurt people. it is not such a good thing because ppl USE it to manipulate others. it is a "talent for survival" - Maximus from Gladiator. it is the reason why we look at one person this way and another differently. it cannot be justified. but that doesn't mean i should be judgemental as they can't help how they look if they look pretty! (goes to guys too.) well let's just say that if you study them it all adds up to the way they dress, their hairstyle their gesture and how loud they are (how they present themself in their package). who better than anyone to know how a person behaves in public? when they do it, they don't realise it. obviously, the person who is watching them gets a point for this.<br><br>good looking people are mostly arrogant, maybe not in short-term (in front of you for the first few days, barely knows your name and wanting to make a good impression) but in all cases long term. (when they've known you for quite a long time, when they somehow get tired of you, when they know that you know he/she looks better than you and you have to show a little more respect to them for that, when they might finally show their true colours!)<br><br>So you're guessing that i don't go for looks right? WHAM! Right on! I must be a LIAR then! Well who says i don't go for looks? I only mentioned that i wouldn't prefer much of their looks. My ratio of looks to character is 40% to 60%. So at best their looks might just turn out to be 37% to me which doesn't kick in at all. It doesn't matter that much.<br><br>You think everything exists in two? Well you forgot the third. Girls tend to think that if they're not pretty, then they have to be ugly. But actually there are three things to looks.<br><br>1) Pretty (a heavenly fruit. something that you want but you don't necessarily need.)<br><br>2) Not pretty (fruit still looks edible (earthly) and its something that you still need, something you can depend on for survival)<br><br>3) Ugly (A bad fruit which is inedible and has changed its colour. Something you don't need at all.)<br><br>A person who looks ugly is obviously a person who doesn't want to attract attention and someone who doesn't believe in it. So nobody would go for ugly and we're all okay with thaT. But everyone goes for a reasonable standard in looks which doesn't have to be pretty all the time. So girls, if you're not that pretty, its just fine with us cos what matters most is your character.<br><br>Sorry i post them here, i can't seem to load the other page.<br><br>Oh yeah, anybody here watching Star Wars?<br><br>-Spy8reak, 2002</div>
