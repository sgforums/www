              <p>hey guys, take a look at this before u kena join  into the LFI company
              and thinking it can easily make money in a short period of time</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from another forum - their real personal encounter  , it is the truth</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First guy encounter</span></p>
              <p>Here
              is my situation in LFI. I was told by my good friend that he has a good
              business plan. I ask him wad plan is it..he told me don't ask. Good
              down and have a look. He den ask me whether u wanna go old trafford,
              stamforf bridge in 2 years time. When i reach there, i know it is
              something like venture ERA but then again i trust my good friend and
              give him face. He introduce a senior to me and he wanna show me the
              place. Ok, fine, i went in, listen to his crap and finally we went to a
              seat and continue to listen the products.</p>
              <p><br> After listening, i am not interested, he ask me y?? Then i said i just
              don"t like it..Then he keep showing me their product is legal blah blah
              blah..no fake product, a lot of celebrities andorse. But look, i am not
              saying your product illegal, i am juz not interested.. Then no matter
              wad, he die die keep using papers to ask me wad are ur worries about,
              and then eliminate those worries. Ok, next i say ket me consider, he
              den say u c ur worries is not a problem at all, no need to consider juz
              go sign this thing, i promised u will earn back ur $$. Ok, i den say i
              dun hav $$.<br> <br> Then here comes the crucial part. He say he gt a plan..he want me to
              sign a iphone from starhub. Sell the iphone and use the $$ topay the
              products. However, the plan is $82 but he say dun worry, i promised u
              will earn back the $82 at least. So, i was blur blur at tat time,
              thinking it was a good deal and i went to MS to sign the plan and sold
              it immediately to the starhub ppl at MS.<br> <br> However, upon reflection when i am at home, i felt i was damn stupid to
              give in to him although i was dead set that i will not sign anything
              when i left my home. So the next day, i told the senior i wanna quit
              can get refund. He say no probs. Ok, i met him there and i say i wanna
              to do my refund as soon as possible. Then he gave all sort of reason to
              say that his mentor is busy, Y not sit down and wait. During the
              waiting time, he kept trying to convinced me indirectly not to quit.
              Dilly dally for ard 90min until my mother call my hp and we have a
              quarrelled over the phone. I think he was afraid so after i end my
              conversation wif my mother, the straight away say we can proceed to the
              counter to do refund.<br> <br> Howver, eventhough i get my 100% refund, i have lost over 400 plus by
              quiting. The iphone plan need to use 3mths b4 can terminate..Plus my
              termination fee $1177.. my refund is oni $1000.. SO pls dun tell me LFI
              is DAMN GOOD.<br> <br> Although it is legal in some way..the majority of LFI agent are being
              taught this way to recruit ppl. I just do not like the way this agent
              conduct their business. Sure, they really earn $$, but the way they
              earn their $$ is not ethnical at all.<br> <br> Recently, i have another friend tell me gt lobang. He tell me go down to the company.<br> I ask him, wad company is it...again he say dun ask.. I ask until i say
              whether it is LFI den he finally say it is..i damn du lan, i say f***
              off</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second guy encounter</span></p>
              <p>So same thing happened to me too. Got invited by a friend to check out
              a business. He was mum about what it was all about, telling me that it
              was about "running a diamond shop and wellness sanctuary" and I thought
              he actually owned the business until I went to their office and
              realized what it was all about.</p>
              <p><br> I didn't know what MLM was at that time and I told them I was not
              interested because I felt that it's not something I'd do and I wanted
              to go online and do my own research on the products and company first
              before going into it. He also told me that I had to invest 4.3k in a
              stock of healthcare products first which is ludicrous for an NSF like
              me.<br> <br> But the biggest turn off for me was their whole corporate philosophy of
              money. Everything they thought of was to make money. They kept
              emphasizing the type of cars their "successful" people drive, 22 year
              olds making 5 figure sums a month, etc etc. Even though they were
              selling health products, they were never concerned about the health of
              others but only using it as a means to make money.<br> <br> Sure, it'll be a great way to spend time (making money on the sideline)
              and learn about business and stuff but after looking through all the
              criticisms of MLM (within the context of Singapore anyway), it seems
              like this whole marketing model is spurious. Or so I'm inclined to
              believe anyway.<br> <br> Thankfully I did my research first and realized that it's not as
              impressive as my friend claims it to be. I really feel sorry for my
              friend who's already in it.</p>

              <p>oh lucky you. about 5 five years ago, my friend called me and another friend to go listen to a "talk", i agreed but couldn't make it at the last minute coz of work. so my friends went, and the two of them got brainwashed into giving $60 for a bar of soap to "try", and told to come back and sell this stuff if it "works"!!</p>
              <p>($60 was a lot back then coz we just graduated)</p>
              <p>my friend called me two days later and told me he realized its a fucking mlm and i told him "huh you didnt know?"</p>
              <p>we met recently and were talking abt old times and reminiscing when he told me how he wished i was there right then so he wouldnt have gotten scammed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all i can say is, well, the bloody soap had no effect in the end, after being tested by all the people in the family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dun ever fall for mlm, they use the "foot in the door"</p>

              <p>to tee-down other companies and bring up your own company?</p>
              <p>you have no business to be here even..if you want to advertise your own company, start a new thread and see the response la..</p>
              <p>another un-trained distributor.. plus work on your english if you want to be understood.</p>

              <p>looks like you need to work on your english..and don't even know how to reply to my question on your objective of posting in a thread not related to you in anyway..</p>
              <p>composition and comprehension aspect..learn to understand what the topic is about before you comment..this is about topic A while your thread reply is about topic X which is not related in anyway..</p>
              <p>the other thing is, if you say this is a lame forum, than doesn't it makes you even lamer to post and be a forum user in this 'lame forum' which you said it yourself..</p>

              <p>yes.. much agreed with you (the_fallen.).... can't they understand the proper english? and to the rest, i believe the objective to this thread is to share more about the company and of course not to tarnish the reputation.. be it VE,Nyouth,LFI,Amway etc etc. I believe all MLM companies are like an organisation... do we say things like Starhub's line cheats people?? or Singtel came out with so many promotions and just to earn our money... the difference is only, in NM, the system is done in a different manner using networking and direct selling (NOT Pyramaid).</p>
              <p>BUT, sadly, the majority are still skeptics.. missing out on the opportunity. thinking that it is earning off their friends/relative money.. then if you were to set up a shop, the group of ppl who will come are ur friends, and u tell them its for free, cos u scared that u earning their money... sigh.</p>

              <p>hmm..</p>
              <p>thanks for agreeing with my post..but you too may not have realised that your post as quoted has got nothing about the company/ the thread topic too..</p>
              <p>so if you want to share your knowledge and clear any mis-conceptions of mlm which i read from your post and that's your agenda; start a new thread of your own..</p>
              <p>you don't need to ride onto the bandwagon and showcase your wisdom in a place where the focus is on the thread subject and not you or whatever you're trying to share..</p>

              <p>i would like to thank the people in this forum for making me prejudiced against MLM. i was invited by a friend to meet her at Aljunied to see if i was interested in a business deal.</p>
              <p>just plan out and others will execute the deal for you. she mentioned a work group of sorts.</p>
              <p>thankfully i declined her offer.</p>
