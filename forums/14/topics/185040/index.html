            <div class='col-md body'>Lampe Berger is from France. Just to set the record straight. And it's been around for over 100 years.<br><br>As to their management, I wouldn't be surprised they hired a CEO off another top MLM firm. Just like, DCHL's former top managers is presently Herbalife Singapore-Malaysia's CEO.<br><br>Anyone with thoughts on Lampe Berger should just go see DCHL's office showroom at Shaw Centre, near bugis. Whole of level 2.<br><br>A girl I used to date is a Baron in it. She's signed under a count who's in the midst of his Marquis challenge.<br><br>MONEY-WISE. The proj can be quite self-defeating. Too big capital investment. As I mentioned in another thread, though your stocks are transferrable, you can only sponsor out $1042 of your $16,667 stocks at a time. And supposing you brought on another Count at $16,667, he too as to find 14 other people to sponsor in order to clear his inventory. If you share a common pool of friends, that isn't easy.<br><br>I'd say I know the scheme quite well. I'm a big fan of MLM. Drop me a reply or pvt message if you wanna know anything else abt it.</div>
