Dynamic &amp;<br>young. Overseas incentives trip.<br>ORD welcome. Tel: 91816296<br>hr_dept_04@yahoo.com.sg</span><br><br>We arranged 2 mit ysterday eve at Shaw Towers. We sat outside dis semi-cafe &amp; restaurant jus located in front of d cinema's ticketin booth. I met his assistant 1st. Dats d guy who answered my cal when i responded 2 d ad. We x-changed sum small-tok  b4 he proceeded 2 intro me 2 his 'lao-ban'. Cant rem dis "head-man's "surname, probably cos i was tryin 2 hard 2 digest d turnover figures &amp; pics of himslf in a Japanese Mag. however i do knw his name is Raymond. Incidently, his other men (abt 5 of dem) sat in d table bhind us thru'out d interview. He even showed me his probable new coy logo design.<br><br>Raymond related some of his personal, past experiences 2 me. Dey included his early days of bein a carpenter (showed me his disfigured middle finger on his rite hand....i dink it was his rite), said i reminded him of 1 of his former 'generals' (who incidently 'betrayed' him......said he'll tel me d whole story in due time), told me he treats his colleagues s brothers (asked me 2 check wif anyone there in Asayo) &amp; dat loyalty was important 2 him. Sumwhere along d line he described how dis son of his father's fren, or old-neighbour betrayed him (yes, he used d term 'betrayed' again) after he 'took-care' of him. How his mos-abled man drove Mercedes 200 (1st hand) while he drove a Mercedes 220 (2nd hand) &amp; 5 of dem left him.<br><br>I asked insistently on d basic pay amount. He replied sumdin like:"one's thinkin is affected by his education......" ermmmm....can't recall evrydin he said but eventually it comes 1 loop &amp; ends wif:"......&amp; finally one's thinkin is affected by his experiences...." All very cheem stuff but ultimately, I stil nev found out how much he was gona pay me.<br><br>So I asked him d same ques again. Dis time d ans was slightly improved. He said sumdin like:"....in d old days, evryone was oni given a basic pay.....den it evolved in2 a basic-cum-commission pay structure &amp; finally.....it has evolved in2 a purely commission based wage.....for some coys 2 day"<br><br>Improved but not d ans I wanted. So bein d 'aggressive' man (dats wat he described me) i asked d same ques d 3rd time. WATS D PAY.<br><br>Dis time he ans:" How much do u dink u'r worth?" b4 i cud ans him he cont'd:" Commission is a more stable income den a basic salary although it defies common belief." den he changed his tone of voice (maybe d po piah stuck in throat?) &amp; proceeded:" Don't ask me how much i can pay u. Ask how much u can earn 4 me. I can pay u wateva amt u ask 4 but can u tel me how much can u earn?"<br><br>Den he cont'd;" I was approached by sumone 2 b a motivational speaker &amp; earn $500 an hr. Not bad 4 sum1 like me who stopped skoolin at sec 3. When dat guy left me (i dink he was tokin abt d son of his father's fren or neighbour) i made a loss of $2 million on d time i've spent on groomin him. I'm very glad i didn't suffer a heavier loss. $2 million I can stil 'tahan'. Same ding 2 day. I can guarantee u 2 show u d ropes if u'r eager 2 learn. I'm not afraid 2 fact dat theres no guarantee u won't do d same ding he did. So i'm actually d 1 at d losin end. Wat haf u got 2 lose? All u'v got 2 do is 2 find able men 4 urslf. I wil guide dem &amp; provide support &amp; instil in2 u d knowledge &amp; dat winnin 4mula from my experiences. &amp; in d end, if u dink we can't get along, u can set up ur own coy &amp; jus get d stocks frm me.

            <div class='col-md body'>I urge those victims of asayo whether it's the customer or ex-staff to file police reports agst asayo.<br><br>I've did mine. Let the police go handle the case if you really have doubts. In fact, many ex-employees whom have suffered from their policy of buying sales had reported this to the police from what I know. Though some of the comments here are that it seems that the police r not doing anything.<br><br>However, if the number of cases against this company is large enough, I'm sure they will take action.

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly MLM is now legal in Singapore and there are decent people in Singapore earning some income from it. This is better than being jobless. So the problem is not the 'MLM' companies per se. According to the regulating authorities, the crux of the matter is 'people must not be cheated of their money'. So for those of you who put down at 'face value' MLM, I think we need to relook at it from the standpoint of 'another job'. Just like in the old days when everyone considered the 'insurance man' as con man, but now the image has improved and all of us know the importance of being insured.<br><br>Having said all this, the industry is not without it 'black sheep'. Even reputable MLM companies have 'wolves' within, this is expected. LIke we have good cop and bad cop, too.<br><br>So everyone of us must protect ourselves, family and friends by being more informed and vigilant about opportunities thrown to us.<br>The test must always be:<br><br>The financial status of the firm and individual of the MLM companies<br><br>Their products and its efficacy<br><br>and their compensation plan if you are joining.<br><br>Every reputable firm has a financial report and nowadays you can check the web if they claim they are in the Stock Exchange.<br><br>Asayo is a strange breed and from the description here, I would say it smells trouble.<br>If you have committed money, it is pointless to gripe about it. File the necessary claims through lawyers or direct to small claims.<br><br>Psychology tactics is always used in recruitment but like brothers here have done, keep to the point and if it does not meet your requirement drop them.<br><br>Fair trading act is here so all of you must get your case to them and collectively it can be effectively be dispensed.<br><br>Going to CAD is only when there is an obvious case of cheating. This may not be so, especially when you, in your own accord have agreed to the delays in stock or compensation.<br><br>If we collectively strive to be informed, sharp and clear in our rights, you can eliminate to some extent such 'black sheep' of industry.<br><br>Just my thots.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm a ex-employee of asayo also. Once belong to the famous 'student group'...think those who work in asayo know which group i belong to. Time spent in this company was wasted and not even to say the effort and money spent too. Friends, relatives, family keep persuading to quit yet i keep on persisting on working for this company. I was being so called 'brained washed' by those managers. Quit the company 2 years ago because they keep delaying the goods that my relatives supposed to recieve after paying the full amt. Manager always tell me 'goods coming soon, goods coming soon'....so i also said that to my customer. In the end, waited for days, months until now become years......goods stil not recieved.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Feel so guilty of cheating my own relatives and friends. Finally quit that job but make me so stress, guilty...i even flunked my studies in the poly. Lastly, my bro bring me to for counselling session when he noticed me i very down.<br><br>Now, going to finish the final year of my course. Supposed to graduate earlier but because i flunk, so have to repeat. My advice to ppl is pls do not believe what they say...and also dun join this company. It's not a good company, their sales tactics are horrible. Those ppl who are still in Asayo, pls look at yourself...and think if it is worthwhile working for these company when so many ppl, ex Asayo employee are condemming it. It is not too late to quit so good luck to you.</div>
