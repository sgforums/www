            <div class='col-md body'>There can be only two reasons why Mozilla hasn't stated why he hates asayo so much, and they are 1)he is just a loudmouth seeking attention by insulting and tarnishing others people reputation and enjoys doing it. 2)He do have a reason for hating asayo but a very lousy one, that is to say a very presonal and childish one. And by saying it, he would show to everyone that he is indeed just a very subjective(unobjective), immature person.<br>And by the way, i am not in any way related to asayo. I am just a observer stating my point of view. But a subjective person will rather believe otherwise.<br><br>------------------<br>guan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a new user to this BB and this topic caught my attention by chance. I must say...<br>after reading all the articles posted,  feel that mozilla is extremely biased. There is no facts from him, YET, supporting his arguement. Hence, the topic is extremely misleading.<br><br>It kindda of amazes me that no one from the company actually attempted to press charges on that guy for deframation(since our IP are logged by this BB). If mozilla allegations are true then it would be fine but if not, I think that guy will really be in some hot soup if the company decided to take actions agst him!<br><br>Anyway, just like Wise, I am really interested to find out why is Mozilla so pissed off with Asayo. So Mozilla, if u have any prove to your allegation, please kindly post them on the BB, otherwise, I think it would be illogical for ppl to accept ur stand. I noticed that it usually doesn't take u very long to make a reply. But ever since Wise told you to prove your allegations, nothing was heard from you!<br><br>A personal advice: It is still not too late to apologise now, before any action is take against you. Or maybe u can check with the webmaster if u can request for your postings to be removed. I always believe in finding out the truth before pointing my fingers at anyone, cause I really don't know when that "3 fingers will start pointing back at me"<br><br>I will looking forward replies from both Mozilla &amp; employees of Asayo. Take care guys...<br><br>------------------<br>Japheth</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi friends,<br>I have a few relevant info which i feel may help tell a thousand tales about ASAYO.<br><br>1.This company is registered in May 94 as a PTE LTD with listed activities as sporting equipments and general trading.<br><br>2.The 3 shareholders r: Mdm Tan, Mr Ng and Mr Teo. Mr Teo may have left long ago, leaving the other 2 as the main directors.<br><br>3.Its true that many 'old birds' have left the 'nest'.<br><br>4.The China distributor for Japan-Life is rumored to have collapsed as the Gov bans 'pyramid selling'.<br><br>5.In Japan, the company owning Japan-Life is also rumored to have abandoned the 'magnet'<br>business.<br><br>6.Its hard to say much about the financial status of ASAYO since its a PTE LTD and their auditors r gagged by law.<br><br>7.Many independent accounts of unusual business strategy is gossipped at kopitiams.<br><br>*The above may or may not be true and i provide them in the spirit of liberty and human rights.

            <div class='col-md body'>WOW!!!  i was kinda surprised to c that Figo actually went to check up on Asayo and furthermore this is his first posting on SG Forums if i c correctly.<br>i tot that i was the only one that will go to the Registry Of Companies to check this kind of stuff but i guess that there is always other ppl who r juz as interested.<br><br>i will juz like to clear up some points that Figo hv not check in detail:<br><br>1) Asayo Pte Ltd registered in 1994 but the company in discussion here is Asayo Group Pte Ltd which was only registered in the period bet 1997-98.<br><br>2) Asayo Group Pte Ltd hv 5 shareholders and 2 of them also happen to b Mdm Tan and Mr Ng.<br><br>3) As for the rumours that the company in Japan has already forsaken the "magnet" business, i seriously find that hard to believe since their website is constantly changing and promoting the latest range of products.<br><br>4) As for the thing abt "old birds" leaving the company, i dun find anything disturbing abt that since that happens in all companies irregardless of the trade or line involved.<br><br>At this point, i m sure that there will b many that will question why i m "protecting" Asayo. i m not doing this to specially protect them but it is cause i hv seen my family members benefit from their products thus i feel that i shld set the facts straight and present all known facts to the public. a healthy discussion shld always involve proposition and opposition.<br>i will b glad to learn any other facts that can b shared among everyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi folks,<br><br>Its good to hear that at least somebody has benefitted from the product. Me wonders if the 'Lords' at the helm of the PTE LTD use the things themselves.<br><br>BTW does anybody (esp. Wise) want to know the actual cost price for the 'magical' bed pads? U may regret having bought it after u know the 'trade secrets'.<br><br>One last thing, becoming successful is everyone's dream at Asayo. But look carefully my dear friends, which manager there has actually found wealth?<br>The one and only one human being getting $$$ into his wallet there is anybody's guess.<br><br>*The above are to be treated like a casual conversation.

            <div class='col-md body'>to rome:<br>from a personal point of view, i think that u should not discuss your personal problems that are related to the comapny. it does not reflect well on yourself and even less on your company. u may not care about dragging your company image through the mud but i would think that u will fare better if u discussed your problems with your superiors. If u wanna find out how issac can survive at the company that u are working at then i will think that u will b able to get an answer more easily if u ask him in person.<br>it is not professional and respectful to discuss such stuff on the net especially if u are still working at the present company.<br>think about it carefully, how will u like it if your frens discuss about your debts and bad habits on the net allowing the whole to read about it but yet they hide behind the mask of a nickname that no one can identify. i dun think u will like it at all.<br>think about it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>the program said magnetic therapists claim their method works coz the magnets influence bloodflow into vital areas by attracting the iron in the blood.</blockquote>actually, magnethotherapy does NOT work this way.<br><br>the basic componenets of blood are the red blood cells that transport oxygen the whole body, the white blood cells that fight the bacteria, platelets that clot up the blood in wounds aka natural healing power of the body and the +ve and -ve ions that are the static energy that enable us to walk,jump,run etc.<br><br>when a medical magnet is placed near our body, the magnetic flux from the medical magnet charge up the +ve and -ve ions inside our body and cause them to be very vibrant. the vibrant ions cause a stir in blood and hence blood is able to flow to parts of the body with greater ease. when this happens, blood circulation is improved.<br><br>when blood circulation is enhanced, more oxygen, anti-bacteria, natural healing power and energy are transported to parts of the body. the body is then able to function  much better than before and thus becomes healthier.<br><br>this is how magnethotherapy works and helps in promoting better health.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow... never thought that this topic has developed so much since I last visited. Just came back from a business trip.<br>Anyway, thought that I wanna add something. I read wat Drose added to the this topic. I read wat he/she said about how the concept of magnetotherapy works. Well, I must must say that he/she is not wrong. In fact, the part about the magnetic field affecting the iron content of the hemoglobin of our red blood cells is not wrong either. I read this from a book titled "Magnet Therapy" from our National Library. This enables the red blood cells to carry more oxygen(a bit more, not to the extend of hyperventilation!) to all parts of our body....so...... better function! So isn't that better? Well, so I believe magnetotherapy affects both the ions AND the red blood cells. That's all folks....<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mozilla, what you have described is true, but it does not applies to ASAYO. It applies more to ASTRAL MAG HOLDINGS. I have visited both companies, and ASTRAL MAG HOLDINGS fit more closely into Mozilla discription. All the conmen are from ASTRAL MAG. Even the boss and No.2 man from ASTRAL MAG are conmen who formally worked in ASAYO and betrayed ASAYO badly. For those of you who think that I am bullshiting or spreading rumours, then go visited both companies and find out the truth yourself cause the most important factor is to find out the very truth.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I have just read the two pages of comments. I feel that there are some misconception about this thing, and I think it is unfair flaming anyone/organization without any solid proof. IÂ’m replying this as a neutral party and neither am I protecting the interest of anyone in here.<br><br>In general, I think most of you have not been down to the company itself or either not sure of what is MLM. They are many sales tactics use around the world to attract consumers, including Singapore. We are fortunate enough to have the government to protect the consumers in Singapore. In Singapore we have Â“CASEÂ”.<br>What do you think is the best way to promote something? 1) advertisement 2) word of mouth.<br>These are 2 potent tools that will help a business thrive.<br><br>Take an example, you have a friend who goes around spreading nonsense about you behind your back, and goes around till it reaches this person number 10. One fine day you are introduced to friend number 10. He/she would be wary of you before he/she wants to befriend you or even to do business with you. Reason is simple, you wonÂ’t even know what kinda rumors he would have heard from the 9th person. It doesnÂ’t matter if its not true only you know it, but he/she does not. The fact that the first impression he/she had about you is nothing good.<br><br>Involves a few factors, your judgment, perception that is when your brain starts to think.<br><br>Go to a hawker center and you see a long q for a noodle store. First thing that comes on to your mind, noodles must be good if not why such a long q? Guess what you be on the q, after eating you realise that it is only so so, not that great. It is the q that you are attracted to not the food. Agree?<br>Now comes to the company. It is not fair for Mr mozilla to criticize the company without any solid proof. All it need is one foul mouth guy to tarnish the image of the company. This spreads like wildfire. Next time your friend wants to invite you to join the company there will be thoughts on your mind about what you have heard about the company. Most importantly you are damped by what you had heard, and this make you think twice about joining the company. Next time when someone ask you about the company, you will not hesitate to tell them. Â“oh my friend told me the company no goodÂ…..Â”<br><br>As for Mr Figo  you made this commet Â“BTW does anybody (esp. Wise) want to know the actual cost price for the 'magical' bed pads? U may regret having bought it after u know the 'trade secrets'Â”<br><br>I believe that you donÂ’t know anything about the production, quality, etc. Neither do i. Before you made this statement, you ever actually think the things that you use in the daily life? Before I begin, this is not targeted at you, maybe after reading this you would like to take back your comments? IÂ’m sharing my views and if you do agree. Ever though of how much is cost price of the mee-pok that you had at the food court?  I can assure you that is cost less than 0.50, why are you still paying to had mee-pok then? They have to cover the overhead costs, workers etc. These are the factors that made the mee-pok expensive.<br><br>Even the cellular phone that you are using the cost could be less than $50.00. Even before the phone reaches you there are a few processes. A manufacture the phone, B has got the rights to distribute the phones, C is contracted to advertisement. B distribute the phones to the retailers by the time it reaches your hand think about the cost. A will make money by letting B have the rights distribute the phone, process goes on and think about how much you got to pay. You are actually paying for the cost of the phone, plus the profits of A, B and C.<br>As for the bed, there is a reason why it is expensive. This area is new and there are not many organization is this or have the experts/cash invest this. Think about the process it goes through, materials used? Product is from japan, what about the cost to export here.? All these contribute to the price of the product.<br><br>DonÂ’t malign the company/person unless you are sure. Singapore has a good legislative system. All these are sales/ trade that contribute to the Singapore economy, and make you stand proud on this dot on the world map. We work hard for what we are today, hold the Sing dollar in your hand. You will feel proud.<br><br>If is still up to one individual to judge a person/company. Word of mouth can either kill you or bloom. It is your own judgment or perception, the character of a company/person is decided by itself. Not anyone of us, it is the responsibility of the company to educate the staff and your good self to develop into a fine character.<br><br>For those who have read this, these are my views and with no intention of malign anyone or company in this passage.<br><br>regards<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>woah!~i never knew this topic would generate sucha response.firstly,i would like to thank all the ppl whu haf not condemned ASAYO and actually stated their point of view in a civilised manner.now,i would like to clarify some things.i have not stopped working or left ASAYO.its just that circumstances have forced me to adopt a freelance approach to this company and its products.my mothers company,which is a family run business and a rather small one at that,is experiencing a boom in clientele,therefore i am needed at her office.so to those ppl who think i have given up on ASAYO..sorry~<br>since my last reply i thought the matter had come to a rest therefore i didnt bother to come in here to check..but i must say i was pretty surprised to come in here and see so much correspondence.it was interesting to say the least reading everything.and i certainly did not expect anyone to be awaiting my reply..sorry about the delay.<br>anyway..anybody who actually wants to find out more about ASAYO..feel free to come down and ask away..do not worry..we arent conmen...hahaa</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To: ISAACLEE &amp; all ASAYO salesmen,<br><br>I was also pestered to go down to your Aliwal<br>St 4 an interview sometime ago(way back in Oct, 1999). Needless to say, I did not go back 4 the 2nd interview(believed every Tom,<br>Dick n Harry also will be shortlisted 4 the<br>2nd interview as long as they do not tell the<br>idiotic manager off in the 1st meeting) as I<br>have much better ways to earn a living.<br><br>1st of all, I do believe the products your co. selling is of certain health benefits 4 elderly based on the magnetic theory. As earlier postings hv shown in details, the magnetic theory is certainly not an easy concept to understand and definitely more<br>difficult for 1 to be fully convinced to buy it.<br><br>What amazes me is the lack of quality of you<br>salesmen or shall I say 'beggars' or conmen.<br>In order 2 convey the truth of the products' benefits, a well-dressed, good-mannered, adequately educated person with good presentation selling skills is needed to promote your products. But from what I hv encountered and observed, I dare say virtually all of you(or at least 95%)are uneducated, bad-mannered, ah-beng dressing and can't speak proper English at all. You know the so-called manager who trying 2 psycho me down 4 the 2nd interview - he pronounced 'a degree holder' as 'a degree shoulder'! I really wonder how he does his presentations in English - probably he converses in Hokkien or other dialects... If he can't speak such simple basic English, how on earth is he goin to convey the benefits of the magnetic theory across to his potential clients rite.<br><br>Any comments ?<br><br>[This message has been edited by MSL (edited 11 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well MSL..it appears u have a wrong concept of ASAYO.u mentioned that the manager whu interviewed you has a bad grasp of english..ok.what we are trying to do at this company..convey to you our belief in this therapy..conducting an english lesson.and by saying that..are you saying that insufficiently educated people arent allowed to tell you about their views or beliefs??so shld these ppl b left to rot??arent they allowed to earn a living or pursue their dreams??and everybody has their own way of dressing..dun tell me everybody dresses the same..dun u tink life wld b pretty monotone den??no doubt some ppl may look like ah bengs..but as de old saying goes.."never judge a book by its cover".anyway..i think u shld change de way u judge ppl or de way u see things..dats my opinion..but wad u do however is stil up to you..i cant force u..so good luck~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello People,<br><br>I used to work for Asayo group Pte Ltd. I used to be one of the SM with Japanlife badge recognition. I have been to Japan and Korea to learn about the products and attended JapanLife convention as well. I know the management staff during my period there well enough. So I can say that I know very well about the products and the company.<br><br>Therefore below are my comments:<br><br>1. Japanlife product is a good product and I have a good testimonials from some of my customers.<br><br>2. It doen't work for every illness. I do have costomers who use the product and did not see any improvement to their health.<br><br>3. The company is legal and does not practice pyramid or MLM system.<br><br>4. During my stay in the company, I received late commission payment very frequently. Late by 2 months was a norm.<br><br>5. At that time, the company had stock problem. My customers frequently received their products late.<br><br>6. I have cases where till now my customers have not received their products. How long it has been? Well..... over 3 years!!!<br><br>7. My customers have been requesting (verbally and written) for a refund for more that 1 year after waiting for the product for 2 years but again Asayo Group is delaying the matter.<br><br>8. With the situations explained in no. 5-7, I concluded that the company is either financially weak or out to 'play' with customers.<br><br>9. I am seriously thinking of getting a lawyer to sue the company on my customers behalf if the company maintain her 'arrogant' attitude.<br><br>10. If any one out there have the same problem, email me and we can legally sue the company.<br><br>11. Latest info is that Asayo is moving to another location. Downsizing? I don't know, but doing well is a stern NO!<br><br>12. Anyone not happy or have doubt over my comments, too bad! But I do have supporting documents for all my claims.<br><br>13. Lastly, the reason I left the company was due to disagreement with the management on their method of marketing the products and their ways of handling customers/staff.<br><br>Regards<br><br>KoolBruder<br>10 April 2002</div>
