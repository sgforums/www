"heard", so I assume that isn't a fact which you claim to be so? Another factless claim I suppose..<br><br>Regarding the BAE beds? Are you talking about those sold at Mustapha? I have seen their beds, true, they are made of tomaline fibre, but there ain't any magnets in them!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Another baseless fact is you claim that our company hires kids to work for us like DW. I can assure you that you are very and gravely wrong. You will never be able to find a 16 year old kid in our company. The youngest we have would be at 19 for girls.<br><br>I realised that you keep using the words "I HEARD". so if thats what you heard why do you still put the title facts and findings? Don't you think you are misleading people? *smiles* For a fact, Asayo has been around for 14 years! If there is really something wrong with our company, I think we don't need you to tell us what to do. *smiles* Why don't you try reporting our company to the newspapers? Instead of telling people what to do? Unless........ *laughs* you and everyone knows what I mean.<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jem05:</div><div class="quote_body">Seriously, I do not wish to get into a slugging match with you. *smiles* But I would like to make things clear, I did not SAY that Asayo has not taken any action, we actually did, but is there a need to publicise this? Sometimes, I do think your questions are very indepth but sometimes I do think that you are living in your 'own' world. You do make everything sound so simple.  "Just report it to the CAD." you say, what makes you think that we haven't. Even if we had, how would you know?<br><br>I think you haven't got our predicament right, when I said NO DOWNPAYMENT INSTALLMENTS, it meant that these people are actually fighting for positions, they would record the sales and just pay for the first installment. But in actual fact, there is never this sale in the first place. That is how Asayo suffered losses.<br><br>Another thing is when you sue a person, the best return would be collecting your damages. Am I right to say that? Somehow for a fact, we do know that the people do not have the money. What is the point of sueing until the person goes to jail, no one and I mean NO ONE benefits from this?</div></blockquote>First of all, I did not attack your personally, question or pre-judge your character. All I asked were questions relating to Asayo. Therefore, for you to claim that I'm living in my own world is uncalled for. Why do you think I'm interested to get into a SLAGGING (not slugging) match with you?<br><br>The idea of reporting this fraud to the CAD is to bring them to justice. So, can you clarify once and for all if Asayo ever reported it to the CAD? Do you know this information first hand or did you hear it from your team manager?<br><br><blockquote><strong>And your point about agents pulling off the same trick? Duh! Of course the comapny has taken measures to curb some rubbish from happening. There isn't any no downpayment installments anymore, installment goods must have at least a deposit before there is any follow up action. </strong></blockquote>So you are saying that there are still installment purchases but there's no need for any downpayment? Isn't a deposit the same as a downpayment??<br><br><blockquote><strong>And the part about Asayo making promises after promises. Did Asayo promise you anything? How do you know that there are many people angry? You say Asayo owes your relatives goods, I feel any Tom, Dick or Harry can just post this question to tarnish our name. To put it bluntly, I have this huge suspicion that you are from a rival company who wants to do more damage to Asayo. Your credibility is so different from Zabel, at least he can name me the agent who sold the goods. But you? You just keep harping on the fact that Asayo owes you goods. Well I can say that too. *smiles* </strong></blockquote>It was my relatives and close family friends that bought from Asayo. They made FULL PAYMENT for their goods and Asayo have not delivered in full for months. I am here to voice their concerns as they do not access the internet. Yes, Asayo promised them that their goods will be delivered several times but failed on every ocassion. They are all discussing what their next cause of action (legal, etc...) will be. I do not need to worry about my credibility here. It's Asayo that's worried about their credibility now. If not, all these won't exist. I also do not have to name names here. You know for a fact that Asayo still owes its customers goods and also their sales staff their commission. Is this right?<br><br>And no, I'm not from a rival company. I do not think that this bio-magnetic therapy stuff is worth its high costs in the first place.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Why do I say this? When I asked you how you know that Asayo has a coffeeshop under the office, no reply about that. When I asked you for your cousin's name, no reply about that. Prove me wrong if you can, I will do my best to check it out for you.<br><br>Regards<br>Jem</strong></blockquote>I have Asayo's address and it's not difficult to find it. It's located opposite the IRA office in Novena and you can see it from the main road. The office is right above a pub and a coffeeshop. So what's so surprising about me knowing that?? Anyone who passes by that road can notice that.</div>

We shall further confirm about that when we do receive anything from your side yah?<br><br>I told you guys before, I had no intenetion of posting anything at all in the first place.

I forgot about Nitr0 questions.<br><br>Reagarding reporting those cases, I personally know that action and reports have been carried out to deal with these people.<br><br>Secondly, I think you did not really understand the scenerio. You are right that deposit and downpayments are the same. In the past, there is such a thing as No DOWNPAYMENT/DEPOSIT installments. But to curb with the previous problems, we decided to to implement a downpayment based installments system. No action will be taken if we do not receive the downpayment.<br><br>Regarding your cousin's case, I am sure he understands our company's system very well. I think you should go ask him for further details actually. *smiles*<br><br>Well Nitr0, I hope I have answered your questions. I did not know why I was kind of worked up in my previous replies, maybe I thought you were just trying to pick an arguement. Nevermind about that. *smiles*<br><br>Take care and best regards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh i quoted sumtin but forgot 2 write my comments. Anyway, wat i'm gonna say is for any networking company in general; i not pointing fingers @ Asayo. If u r the customer and u feel that u have been patient enuf wth the company's excuses of why the products u order are yet to be given to you(though u made full payment oredi), etc, please just go make a report to the relevant authorities. Please dont keep thinkin "Oh the agent whom i ordered thru is my niece/nephew/etc lah, nevermindlah, i'll wait a bit more. Why would my relative want 2 cheat me?"<br><br>As a customer u have ur right. I  also really feel it's a gd idea to publicise the unscrupulous companies (whichever companies they may be) like that article about that gal working in DW.</div>

Actually Richard Chong is our accounts clerk. *smiles* I don't know, maybe there was another Richard Chong in the past, but the current Richard Chong does accounting for us at the moment......... Jack Soh was also in our admin department in the past. Maybe they also do sales in the past I guess</div>

Asayo will use this to their advantage.....they will tell the agents that on the way to success, many people will not share their thinking as most people do not have the thinking of a entrepreneur...only the lesser % of people have. So they will tell them to ignore those who tell them "bad" things which will hamper their route to success.......<br><br>pity pity......feel sad for those who have not woken up yet.....those who left awoke from this dream that will tkae you nowhere.</div>
