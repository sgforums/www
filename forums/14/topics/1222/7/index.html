And Asayo still have to pay for shipment and taxes and stuff...Shouldn't the product be much more expensive here than in Japan?But the truth is they are not..I rest my case...</div></blockquote>Im new here......was bumming around and happedned to see this website......should have seen this long time ago..<br><br>Just like to share some thoughts on this topic. Was with them for a  year or so......initially was fascinated with the idea of making money and owning a own biz...this is what they sell to you pple there....<br><br>people there do crazy things......like..<br><br>morning meeting everyday......sing their company song<br>go on stage and talk (say to train your guts)<br><br>they even have stupid early morning meetings at some secluded places......organised some "shouting" session in the middle of the night.....<br><br>wonder the guy who conducted this still there or not......always dress smartly and put on airs.......<br><br>one thing i know about the company and this is why my whole team left the company.......they like to encourage people to "buy sales" meaning part with your own money to reach the sales target.....<br><br>while working there......work like mad and no money.....mon-sun and go back late every night.......even gf left me after she saw the change in me.....lucky i left and manage to get her back....<br><br>The boss is good at spinning rich ideas for the members in there......he have some loyal people working for him.....powerful talkers (only on Asayo but dun think they can hold their views in the real commercial world)......the boss is the only multi millionaire fellow...the followers just follow him and wanna be like him as he have promised them he will make them milliionaires. pity those blinded followers!!<br><br>also their products are really marked up a lot.......stocks delay due to Japan's life does not want to continue giving them stocks as the big boss of japan life does not approve of the selling tactics and the marked up % done by the boss of asayo.<br><br>true, its like your own business as what the boss will say since he was an ex-insurance agent with GE life long time ago. But this business just cannot take off......they have been talking about expanding since donkey years. largest place they have is at Aliwal street @ beach road. now also closed down.<br><br>think for yourself. worked so hard, long hours but not enough pay. at the end of the day you still need your CPF to buy a flat. this is just not the business to be in. cos you depend on the co for stock.<br><br>also i invested a lot in it. but I managed to get the refund back after one of my relatives told them that we are bringing them to court.<br><br>its a year wasted there.......but a valuable lesson learned. just lead stable life....but if you are the biz type, try other biz but NOT asayo.<br><br>wonder if Joey, Bruce and Keith are still there???<br><br></div>

I read that her dad asked for help of police, M.O.M and his daughters' teachers to advise the gal but to no avail.<br><br>Hmm...seems that DW gives transport and meal allowance. Asayo got such allowance or not? Anyway reading that article was wat prompted me to 'return' 2 dis forum. Hmm, i wonder if the article is a 'wake up' call for investigations to be made regarding such companies?</div>

Argue your points, but then again, there are also many people disatisfied with Asayo (i have friends among them), so be prepared to have fellow forumnites coming up to challenge you. Even if people flame, at least you know you got good points. Flaming as you can see, doesnt matter to me already, coz for ntiparis thread, many put up many revealing info, so no matter how the Animal Farm tries to flame, they lose, coz their posts are childish, and without points.<br><br>Hmm *rubs chin*, so DW stand for Dolphin Warriors all along. So DW boss is a defractor from Asayo? Heard AMH boss is also from Asayo, from other threads, and VE is from AMH, kinda connected isnt it? My opinion is that either they are disatisfied with the former company, or they see the lucrative profits they can make in this.<br><br>In anyway, best of luck to you.<br><br></div>

You really do sound like a disgruntled employee. No worries, I have done my research and analysis before I decided to join Asayo. I was "invited" to Astramag before going to Asayo once, but I refused to join tjhem because of their "buying sales" technique. Regarding the increase in prices, do you know that a can of coke actually cost 10 cents to 20 cents? How much do you actually pay for when you buy it in the coffee shops? 1 dollar? Isn't that a 1000% increase? I think no one bothers because the drink cost peanuts. By comparing the market value of oour goods to the other marketing firms, I believe that the quality and price of ours are second to none actually. Take a look around, you will see what I mean. *smiles*<br><br>I do feel that you are very biase in your claims about Mr Raymond, because your claims has no basis at all. *smiles* Do you mean to say that being superstitious makes a person bad? I think many will agree that this claim is kind of dumb? As for being upright, in what ways do you think that Mr Raymond is not? He could have easily solved the goods problem by introducing low quality goods like some marketing firms around, but he refused. Doesn't that show his intergrity? I would like to add that being upright doesn't mean that your men will not leave you. Didn't it strike you that his right hand men might not share his values? They could have left because they are unwilling to face the problems together with him? They want to live a more relax life with other companies? They feel that defection is best way  to save their own skins? *smiles*<br><br>As for your claim that the boss gets richer while his employees slog. Isn't that the case for ALL companies? Have you seen any bosses in the insurance line running for sales? Do you see Bill Gates designing software now? *laughs* But I am certain that you don't know the amount of stress and pressure that he is facing. In the past when there were stock problems, who do you think is the one sweating his guts out to produce the goods for his employees to pass to their customers. It is of course him, it's his companny for God's sake! Frankly I do feel that from your comments, you are a person who only thinks in your own perspective. As a former employee of Asayo, I thought you would have more in you to analyse and differeniate the rights and wrongs, instead of pushing all the blame to Boss and the company.<br><br>As for sinking deeper, I know what you mean. I have many telling me about the difficulties of the job but never have i thought that they do not want me to succeed, no one n the company has ever told me this anyway. I think only your Dolphin Warriors team practice such an analogy. *laughs*<br><br>Toto4d, I will take a step back and analyse the situation now, but I also do hope that you can take a step back and analyse the past. Is it right to pass such comments and defaming the person who has been so kind? I hope that you do not stereotype everyone just because of the way you were handled in Dolphin Warriors. It doen't make much sense. *smiles*<br><br>Thanks and regards</div>

A complete package of Windows XP cost $999 on my last visit to Sim Lim, making people resorting to pirated version of XP.<br><br>a) People dont complain much about overpricing in retail stores, lest checking their effectiveness or quality. 5 people (if i am not wrong) died from smoking Centuri brand of cigarettes, and its still selling in retail shops.<br><br>b) When they do complain about direct selling, equally they engaged in unethical ways, by buying pirated vcds and music cds. Not only is the boss losing money (poor guy deserve his profits coz of his effort in bringing out products we want), the jobs of the people in the music, movie industry are at stake.<br><br>c) Why would XP, or even Nomad Jukebox be expensive? The quality, the effort towards inventing and producing them etc etc definitely increase the price of their products. What gave them an edge over other 'similar' products in the market? These factored in on the price of the products. Does adding the term 'MLM' or 'direct selling' mars the goodness of these products. Remember, direct selling is the marketing technique, not the QC of the products. As for the safety and pricing, unethical manufacturing practices and obnoxious pricing are prevalent in a lot of companies, retail or otherwise.  The boss of companies that are putting products on the retail shelves are laughing at our stupidity as we speaks against direct seling.<br><br>d) The main point I emphasise is will people put in effort to research what they think is right to back their facts? I discussed this with wuming78 at another thread.  Misconceptions are prevalent, coz many people will rather put it off. "Criminal!' they will cry, instead of looking it up. No wonder people will write books like "Thing You Thought You Thought You Knew' to put off the silly myths and misconceptions.<br><br>Btw, this got nothing to do with asayo, so please dont flame me.

I won't deny this fact nor will I try to protect or cover this fact.<br><br>But for a fact is we have stopped the importing of pillows since last year. We have instructed all agents to try their best not to sell any pillows since last year. Unless the customer is prepared to wait, then we will order the pillows. As you said, the agent left the company, it's very difficult to track the sales and goods for customers once the agent leaves. That's why it took such a long time.<br><br>We know that customers will not be able to understand this fact, that's why we do our best to refund our customers. I can assure you that such matters will not occur ever. *laughs* Wonder when did I become the Aunt Agony of angry customers anyway. I hope for your understanding and your uncle has received his refund, I suppose the matter has been settled? No point pulling out such settled matters anymore right?<br><br>Regards</div>
