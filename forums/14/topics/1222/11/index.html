            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Zorro,<br><br>I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things will go well as it comes by.<br>Just one thing u may want to take note, I hope you did not involve in their buying sales tactics..be it done by u or your uplines.<br><br>One of the ex-asayo staff actually had to go to court because the customer sue him and he had paid up for the products in full payment. But the customer receive reminders that they need to pay asayo claiming that it was an installment plan that they've opt for. In fact, the money was submitted in full to his upline but well, the upline broke the full payment up to various installment payments in order to make his sales look more so he can get promoted. Best part was when this ex-staff was in court, his upline did not even bother to go and bail him. Till he had to call him to beg and ask him to come....so much about their brotherhood/teamwork.<br><br>As for myself, I keep receiving threatening letters from asayo. it's like 2 letters in every 2 years kinda thing. The last one I received was in May..asking me to go down and settle payment for those sales that was bought by my upline. Have clarified these so many times with them like 5-6 years ago, but I still receive letters from them saying if i dun pay up in 7 pays, they will bring me to lawyer.  I even called them and tell them again and they said well, if u dun come down to explain and dun wanna pay, wait for their lawyer letter then.<br><br>Well till then, after so many years of threatening, nothing had come out from them. I've lodged various police reports against them.<br><br>Reason I'm quoting these cases is I want ex-asayo staff whom have the same problems to beware. It's just one of their ways to extort money from ex-staff whom are ignorant about their rights.  Stay tough against them, lodge police reports, that's the best we can fend these money suckers away! Lastly, I can understand the emotional hurt like what zorro had quoted. I believe many of the ex-staff left with such feelings. But time will heal, things will get better eventually =)<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I quit Asayo. They still owe me (actually, they owe my customers who r also my relatives) some products. Because i cudnt stand wrkin wth them anymore &amp; i oredi found another job, i quit b4 my relatives got their ordered products. I trusted that Asayo wud keep their promise &amp; deliver the products promptly. But NO. The delay continues.<br><br>When i tried contacting my ex-upline AND a few ex-collegueas, i realised they have CHANGED their numbers!AND even the office number is changed. I still donno the new number. And they didnt even inform me. I mean, my upline @ least shld have the decency 2 inform me since Asayo still owe me products  and a bit of my commission. But i more concern abt the products.<br><br>It came 2 a point whereby my relatives even 4got that they havent got their products. Or maybe they 'close one eye' to me. But i still feel responsible &amp; bad.<br><br>I reckon there r BLACK SHEEP in Asayo. Unfortunately the WHITE sheep dont seem 2 do much 2 make up for the black sheeps' doing.<br><br>The uplines who sabotaged their downlines (by mishandling the customers' payment) indeed did a very wrong thing. But have the Asayo managemnt investigated WHY they did what they did? My guess wud be there wasnt much effective motivation. Sure, there's all that 'motivational lectures' b4 evryone goes out to try 'clinch a deal'. But thats about it. There's no basic salary AND the commission rate is SO DAMN BLOODY SMALL.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>There's a 'legend' abt how Asayo's boss wanted 2 sue his exdownlines who 'betrayed' him &amp; stole some of the product samples &amp; set up their own magnet therapy companies. It's said that Asayo's boss (raymond) wants 2 wait until a point whereby these rival companies r @ their 'peak', so that when he sues them, Asayo can get some money out of it.<br><br>YEAH SURE. That legend DONKEY YRS already. Wait &amp; wait, UNTIL WHEN? Why wait if Asayo is 'concerned abt the public's health'? If Asayo is concerned abt the public's health, it should sue those 'betrayers' a.s.a.p so that the public  WONT B DECEIVED ANY FURTHER.<br><br>And in the end, WHO went bankrupt? Raymond. But of course this will probably be 'covered up'. Oh and is that stanley still there? Hmm bt i seldom saw him.<br><br>Asayo got this 'slogan', "it's not whether u CAN or cannot, it's whether u WANT or dont want". Sumtin like that. So probably when they say they "CANT do anything about the delayed goods", thats probably BS. The problem wth Asayo is that Asayo has a problem of NOT admitting that it HAS a problem &amp; it DOESNT WANT 2 do anything abt it. And it continues deceiving its customers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are GOOD things i learnt while wrking in Asayo. But it's OUTWEIGHED BY the amount of BAD things i discovered abt it.<br><br>I dont intend 2 bring the matter 2 the police becos i dont want 2 get into trouble wth my parents. I dont want 2 hear their "we-told-u-so" nags.They were sceptical abt Asayo but i TRUSTED Asayo bt LOOK WHAT HAD HAPPENED? Yes, indeed i ws stupid 2 keep staying long enuf in Asayo 2 b deceived so much.<br><br>I hope Asayo bucks up. There are actually some good people in there but they r overshadowed by the bad ones &amp; Asayo's mismanagement.</div>
