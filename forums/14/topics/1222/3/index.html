            <div class='col-md body'>After having read so much about Astral Mag and Asayo, I have to say something.<br><br>I have a friend who worked at Astral Mag, and he told me about how much the remuneration there is.<br><br>1) Senior Distributors get more than $500 for each matteress sold - either by themselves or by their recruits<br><br>2) The middle ranking ones get about $200 plus(I forgot the exact amount)<br><br>3) The lowest ranking people get $100 ++<br><br>The amounts above are approximate.<br><br>The above amounts add up to about $800. Which means out of the $1600 paid for the matteress, $800 is commission. And don't forget, out of the $800 balance, a good amount should belong to the boss of the company.<br><br>Therefore, what is the actual cost of the product? As many have already pointed out, in other countries similar products are sold for about $700 - $800. Their profit margins have not been taken into account yet as well.<br><br>So lets assume that for each matteress they earn 50%. Which brings the cost price down to about $400 for each matteress.<br><br>Finally, after these calculations, we can summarise that the product was perhaps marked up by 400%.<br><br>Of course, any and every product prices have to be marked up to allow for profits, advertising, and other costs. However, 400% seem to be a much heftier markup than what is the norm. And one has to take into account that these companies do not advertise. All the markups go into profiteers' pockets.<br><br>The point I am making is that this method of money making, though legal, is very unethical.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks to everyone who has contributed to this topic...prevented me from going down to the ASAYO office.<br><br>i was called up over the phone by one of the salesmen last week, asking if i needed a job. when i asked what industry the company was in, he said "life science" ha...seems like the hot term in recent months. wat's wrong with the usual "health products"?<br><br>and when pressed for details about the products, i was told that it was very difficult for him to describe them over the phone. really? i can say "magnetic matteress" faster than u can slam the phone down on me. and i'm not even working for ASAYO. well.<br><br>btw...how DID Asayo get my HP no.? the salesperson told me i filled in a form last mar (2001) at City Hall. after a while, i realised that it was impossible. i was out of the country from feb to apr last year. HOW DID THEY GET MY NUMBER? omigod...ARE WE ALL NOT SAFE?<br><br>------------------<br>Just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it. - George from Seinfeld</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.... the progress in this topic starting to get "unexpectatedly hot"<br>First thing first, maybe would like to address Biao a bit.... he/she felt that the mark up was by 400% and is unethical. Maybe all I can say is this, if u do try to look into branded products, u will actually find out that the so call mark up by 400% is norm. Why? Cos for all those who happen to do business or have their own companies b4, U will know that from production of a product to it being displayed in the shelf, such an increment is norm. To cite an example, how much do U THINK THAT A PAIR OF BRANDED NIKE or REEBOK shoe actually cost. In terms of cost price? If u really look into it, than u can start telling urself not to buy such products in the future(base on ur comment)!!! Not to forget these companies usually don't do their assembling in high cost countries such as Japan. So with such low production cost, they can still sell their shoes at this retail price. So why are ppl still buying? Are they unethical?<br>Biao, Moreover, from wat I know, magnet therapy products require proper medical licenses b4 u can commence production on them. Esp if they come from US or Japan. Today, magnet therapy products are seeing fast recognition in many adv countries(if u do travel a lot U will know this) so if ppl can buy a shoe so many times above their cost price(and just to look good or perform better for the next 1 yr or so), wat is spending a 4 digit figure on a health product that can last for many years rt?<br>Pardon me, but I'm just being very practical in my comment. And of course it would be much cheaper in countries like US, well, would a Mercedes be more expensive in Germany or Spore( I think that ans it rt?)<br>Lastly, to all those interested, U can actually get much cheaper magnet therapy products in Spore. Those that cost only a few hundreds BUT I must say that the Guass/tesla level of the magnets are frankly quite low AND the medical magnets are of earlier generation. So production will definitely be much much cheaper. (therefore cheaper selling price! Bingo!) So maybe watch out for wat U are getting before u buy it. I believe those on magazines will work too as long they have a proper medical license. But wat is the relative effectiveness if they don't have things like infra red rays, etc. So don't expect the magazines adver to put things like "WE DO NOT HAVE INFRA RED RAYS AND WE USE 500 GUASS MAGNET!" rt? All they put is "IT WORKS" and the "cheap price".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So don't be so amazed by the cheap price. U get wat u pay for. Remember, medical technology costs!<br><br>------------------<br>Japheth</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, did not noe that the forum is still on going. Its amazing how this small company is able to generate so much interest. I guess many ppl had encounters with ASAYO Grp, i guess ASAYO really needs alot of salesman for the company to survive huh.<br><br>ok first of all, i am neutral and i'm not some employee from Asayo but i almost became one. Who noes, maybe i could have been driving a BMW if i had joined.  :p<br><br>Personally I also had an encounter with Asayo Group. And first of all, i do have some knowledge of these "magnetic matress"  companies or else i would not be expressing my comments in this forum.<br><br>ok, right now there are 4 such companies in Singapore ( if there are more of such companies, its either they are not "famous"  enuff or in some others opinion not "notorious" enuff )<br><br>Here they are<br>1) NOP<br>2) Asayo Group ( claims to be ard 13 yrs old<br>3) Astral Mag<br>4) Venture Era ( just 10 mths old )<br><br>First of all these companies are all involved in "network marketing" or more specifically " single-level marketing" which is perfectly legalize in singapore.<br><br>Personally I had a brush with both Asayo and Venture Era and u guys may be surprised to noe that the boss of Venture Era actually worked for Asayo before he started his own Venture Era company. I guess the smart fellow finally realised that its better to sit at the top of the hierachy than to become one of the sale person down there at Asayo selling mattress.<br><br>Ok, have been to Asayo where my fren was one of up and coming sales manager, in fact he's got his own BMW now. And I was really tempted to join coz he seems to be doing really well.<br><br>But thats one of their methods: to tempt you to join with the promise of big bucks and BMW. The irony is that there is no basic pay untill u climb reasonably high. When asked the reason, they simply say:" when have u ever heard that the really rich have a basic pay? They own assets. It is how much they are worth not how much they earn"<br><br>WOW!!!! Impressive argument. Then y do u have a basic now?? Does it mean you wun get rich??<br><br>His mentor which is one of the big shots in the company even toked to me and wanted me to join the company as one of their sales person. And i must say that he had a really quick mind and the conversation he gave was really enlighting. However after he explained the hierachy of sales, i realise that if i join, i will simply become one of his money trees. He will stand to gain a  certain percentage of the profit from every mattress i sell. And worse of all there is no basic pay if u are just starting out!!! Just how do u survive?? What do u do when u have sold a mattress to everyone of your frens and relatives?? And i believe this mentor has not sold a mattress in a long time. Dun think he needs to either.<br><br>And i really lost confidence in the company when i saw its office. Its so small that its cute!!! And the amazing thing my fren told me was that they rarely see their founder/boss of the company. This is stange, they only have one small office and yet they dun see their boss often....So where does the boss hang out? And i was told that he used to be an AIA insurance agent earning 30,000 per mth!!!WOW!!! And he gave up the job to start a company. Really brave man.<br><br>And initially i was somewhat impressed with the interior decor which was rather pro until one of the staff told me that that they have recently moved to this new office which was previously an interior decor film, meaning the decor was probably left behind.<br><br>Venture Era's present office is even cuter. And I was amazed by the young staffs. Some are poly students workin part-time. In a few years time it may grow to be another Asayo, i guess.<br><br>And they is one thing which i still do not understand up to this day: If they have so much confidence in their product, why dun they try advertising on TV. I mean if it works and is really beneficial ( which i believe they are) Why dun they simply advertise on TV to reach a larger audience and benefit more people who need them.<br>Advertising can certainly boost pple's confidence in the product. Eventually pple will come to you to buy the products<br><br>I mean, just look at OSIM. It deals with massagers and electo-therapy devices which in a way relaxes the body and benefits the user. And it advertises quite a lot. It even has roadshows quite frequently. There's one at Bishan Jnction 8 now.<br><br>Can anyone give me a satisfatory answer??<br>Would the staff at Asayo give it a try?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just recently joined this forum and saw all these comments on Asayo and such SLM/MLM companies.<br><br>From what I know Asayo is a SLM company. In any case they are all legal as the products they sell are of some value and use. Definitely NOT like the traditional pyramid selling of gold coins and funny useless items.<br><br>We should have no doubt of such products offered by such companies. If the products sucks they should perish in hell. But obviously they are of some use. Moreover, they will be shut down and sued if their products are really of no use.<br><br>The overpricing of goods should also be forgiven as products in the normal traditional retail markets are all overpriced too? NIKE shoes are 200 bucks only because of all the advertising, overhead costs and so on. Furthermore, health is such an intangible issue that money shouldnÂ’t be in the topic. There is a new relatively new MLM in Singapore that I suspect will be growing big. They are selling Â‘makanÂ’able  health foods made from their trademark Inidine which sells for 1400 bucks per 3 mths pack. EXPENSIVE YES~!<br>But what if they really prevent you from having some funny diseases which you canÂ’t even see yourself having?<br><br>So what is really in question?? (meanwhile please also check out this site <a href="http://www.vandruff.com/mlm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vandruff.com/mlm.html</a>  )<br><br>I do believe that it is not the products causing so much displeasure from ppl all around.<br>It is the STYLE or the STRATEGY by which the sales person markets the products. From the Van Druff article, it is mentioned that Â“Anyone who has any experience with an MLM has strong feelings, either for or against, and this is the problem. Polarization runs deep.Â” People either go for it or hate it. Very hard to have a middle-land. Friendship comes into stake. For MLMers, friends become potential customers and business partners.<br>Everything around then evolved into substance of business.<br><br>What in the first place attracted MLMers? The concept of money making of course! What do a person know about a product initially? The GREED factor has come into play. Perhaps MLM makes the society into a more materialistic one? What will happen to friends all around? Perhaps the idea of MLM manifests more clearly the GREEDY side of human?<br><br>Of course some advocates of MLM say that they are into the business of sharing. Sharing of potent health products which have not been scientifically proven because somehow due to coincidence (or is it?) these products all belong to the umbrella of alternative health. ThereÂ’s not much evidence and documentation for alternative health. But there are certainly cases of evidence, passed down by word of mouth and through personal experiences. Hence, after enticed by the greed factor, MLMers suddenly realize how much they can do to help people around them by using their products. But the initial motivational factor is already in question.<br>The effect is self enforcing: you pay a high price for the product believing that it will work and it works! Placebo effect perhaps? Coupled with alternative healing methods? It just works. Hence, MLMers involved in Health products will be more motivated to SHARE these products which works well on them!<br><br>The products are good. But one question remains, which nobody can answer. Will the quality of the product remain? Everybody else in a certain MLM will be interested only in receiving and selling the product to earn their commission and to convince more people that their health can be improved. Who is there to check on the quality of the product? Who will probe and who can prove that these products works and will remain working down the generations? Or does it not matter since if people believed strongly in something it will work for them? It becomes rather like a religion. Except that this one works initially on the consumer paying a price inducing them to believe in it. Nobody has the ability to say whether these products work well or should be condemned at all unless if something really went wrong like the SLIM10 pills. If nothing goes wrong, they can remain in the market until the market saturates(also read up on market saturation in the Van  Druff article). Meanwhile, the MLMers will just thrive on personal experiences and stories which only people in the business will believe. ItÂ’s either you join to believe or refuse to believe totally in MLM.<br><br>So the conclusion isÂ… you shouldnÂ’t be blaming the MLM companies if  you are looking for someone to blame for all the irritating calls from your friends around you. It is the Network Strategy itself! And from what I see, it will fast become a trend. One thing I fear is that it brings out a greedy side of ppl. It is a job which can earnÂ… no doubtÂ… if you enroll in such a scheme and actively take part in it. But youÂ’ll slowly see your life changing. YouÂ’ll feel successful (especially with all the motivational talks and lectures to keep you confident and zesty).You may also end up happy because of the money and Â‘successÂ’. But only you yourself can define SUCCESS.<br>It doesnÂ’t seem to be a 9-5 job in MLM business.<br><br>(I refused a couple of times to take up MLM. I almost did, which was exactly out of greed. I now rather take up a 9-5 job and keep all my relationships with friends THE WAY THEY ARE! Oh one more point, I hate to work for ppl knowing that I make more money for them by working harder for myself!!!!! Oh.. one LAST thing, since those products really Â‘workÂ’, I am trying out alternative products of similar functions. Much cheaper anyway though maybe they are not of full capabilities hahahahhaah!!!)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,<br><br>guys everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Whether a company is operating on MLM ,the people there would know and we should not say too much. how the public sees is simple.<br><br>Should a product claims its good and it cuts out the a&amp; p portion to pass savings to the consumer its more likely MLM. In this way, actually more money is been paid into the sellers pocket. and more is being used to pay into the pockets of the multilevels of salesmen.<br><br>well should a product be professionally endorsed, it would be perfectly fine. there are always organisation or gov org that does such certification. if companies feel such product is good get it certified , our PSB corp does that too.. that should be the best way to guard against attacks on the quality of your product. is that simple?<br><br>People are greedy and for survival in tough times, we are all more prone to join such MLM schemes in hope of getting rich. but i would say its not doing any good to nurture our entreprenurship. the fact that most mlm sales are more interested in recruiting pple says much abt the quality of operations...<br><br>2 cents worth.<br><a href="http://www.mlmwatch.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlmwatch.org</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>Just like to share some points on MLMs. Actually it is just another buisness model. If u look at it on a macro level, it is the same as your MNC, SMEs.<br><br>Conventional businesses pays big bucks to advertise and celebrities to endorse their products.<br><br>MLM pays their members to sell their products.<br><br>Just like any businesses there are the bad and good ones. Are there any organization in the world that is exempted from having a few black sheeps?<br><br>Just before u take the plunge into any MLM, maybe u'd like to look at other MLMs and then decide. Most important of all, if u want to join, understand their Marketing plan first! Don't get trapped by the "Ctrl-Alt_Del" quota system of some of them.......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi ppl...long time no c...n boy isit kinda shocking to c so much interest generated by asayo.asayo has moved to goldhill plaza...but recently i heard that it might b moving back to its old office...although i have no idea.<br>okay..to set things straight..i have left asayo partly because of NS nearing...and also because of some personal problems.i shall not say too much...but to summarize things...the product that asayo is marketing is a quality product..however...the system isnt perfect..things such as stock delays,paycheck delays and some doctoring done by uplines unknown to their downlines.personally i think that its really a waste this company to b doing this badly(many of my ex-colleagues have left after me).i mean...what i learnt from asayo is really valuable..like having a lesson about life.we had training sessions...n they werent abt teaching us sales tactics..or 101 ways to con ppl...no.it was actually lessons on life..i still remember that one session..that was so moving i cried...and no there wasnt tear gas in the room.at that time...my belief i the company was so strong that whenever i spoke with my parents or anybody whu had anything slightly negative abt de company...i wld have a long face.when questioned abt stock delays..i would constantly assure my customers that we would deliver.and my boss...as i still prefer to call him..and i will still call him that if i ever meet him up again...is this great guy...who's under a tremendous amount of pressure n stress frm stock problems,paycheck problems and whatnot.i really feel sorry for him..such a guy shld not be going through such a predicament..sigh..<br>anyway..its all a thing of de past...tink i wrote quite a lot.any questions anyone?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To All Asayo pple: I agree with you guys that magnetic therapy really works. But I got a friendly question for you: are you aware that the south pole magnets on  your mattresses are bad? I don't know if your company has changed it to Bio North but I read a report not long ago saying that south pole magnets will actually worsen diseases such like high blood pressure, heart disease diabetes et cetera. I would like to hear both sides of the story, that's why I'm asking.<br>number two&gt;&gt;  I think u guys are real loyal to your company. u'll succeed if you believe. Always have faith, believe in your faith and it'll lead u to the right path.  *wink*<br><br>good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wrong Wrong Wrong!!!! the boss of Venture Era didn't work for Asayo before he came out to start his company!!! He worked for NOP! and every company starts out small. This is perfectly normal! just for your information, Venture Era has moved 3 times in a short period of 18 months! And each time, the office will be bigger then the previous one! now, Venture Era Marketing office is now 3 levels! I don't know why asayo ended up in this pathetic state that you pple claim to be. I only wanna tell pple that pls do not mouth words that are false. If you think Venture Era is a no good company you're damn wrong. If you don't believe what I say.. then come down to the office and take a good look for yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to give my 3 cents worth on this Asayo company.<br><br>MLM from a business  point of view is nothing more than just another method of distribution.  Just  as insurance decides to 'distribute' its products by direct  selling or personal selling, or a chocolate is distributed  thru retail stores, MLM distributes the products through its salesmen.   Now, if this is all it is, then it would be fine.  However, our complaint against  most MLM is how their  salesmen do things, isnt it? We just  cant appreciate the way they push and keep calling you to  attend their seminars and their talks about their products always end up like more than a hour long.<br><br>Asayo is just another company in this MLM craze thats going on right now. I know of a  doctor who quitted  his day job just to enter  MLM. many frens are doing it part time.   I guess its just another income source but yet a  word  of advice to MLM people is that, UNDERSTAND your  consumers. Do your consumers  react well to your style of selling? Or will this product last? Singapore only has 4 million people with over 900k households. How many matresses can they buy? and if your matress is so good, i think it may last quite long, so when will the  next repeat purchase be?<br><br>To be MLM people are glorified salesmen. THEY will emphasized  that you OWNED a business! THATS exciting!!! Bull. When you own a business means you own a franchise, you own a concept or  u own a product. here in MLM all you own is yourself. Do you own a concept? MLM is hardly a concept...just a feel good method...<br>you dun own the product. I can tell you that if Asayo goes bankrupt, there goes your BUSINESS.<br><br>So i have nothing against  MLM, go ahead if you think its good for you but think of how to approach  your consumers. May i also  add that according to market research, only 5% of all MLM people succeeded. Go ahead  and try, but as  a business person, it  will be sad for me to hear if you tell me that MLM is the best way to do business cos then you are terribly wrong..sadly.</div>
