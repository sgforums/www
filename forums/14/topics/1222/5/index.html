            <div class='col-md body'>Haiyah, wat's d big deal? Nothing can b perfect in dis world. Even if that Asayo company says that many people have benefited from it's magnetic mattress, there r still people on whom the mattress does NOT work.<br><br>It's just like how laser surgery on the eye can solve SOME people's shortsighted problem, but CANT solve SOME OTHER people's shortsightedness. OSIM massage chair works wonders for SOME people but NOT for some other people. So on, so forth.<br><br>From wat i notice, the procedure of salespersons regardless of company is very standard one..they'll say u have NO OBLIGATIONS 2 buy, but of cors they'll try 2 psycho u to buy. But if u r very firm, u dont have to fall into their psycho trap what...if they still persist or force u to buy, u can always complain or better still call police. Seriously, u have to know ur rights as a customer. They HAVE NO RIGHT 2 FORCE u to buy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok the quote below is fr another section under Asayo topic.But when i tried 2 post in that section it has expired. Anyway, here goes..<br>QUOTE:<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">So whoever have better ideas to help victims such as my friend, do feel free to add to the replies and let's help to stop dishonest companies such as ASAYO(Sometimes I wonder.... why are companies like these still existing and not get into trouble with Commercial Affairs Dept)!"</span><br><br>I tink it's becos many people cant b bothered 2 go thru wateva admin/legal procedure that comes along wth lodging a complaint, etc. But now  it's time 2 take serious action. I tink <strong>the best people to lead the way in taking an action r the people who have been 'victimised' by this company, whether by way of latecoming stocks or commission delay, etc.</strong><br>It may not necessarily b the products that we r 'attacking'--like someone mentioned b4, it's common 4 a health product to work 4 some people's bodies but not 4 other people's bodies. <strong>It's the way this Asayo company practices their business that is annoying. </strong><br><br>Unless their previous 'victims' unite to teach the company a lesson, many other customers r gonna b victims.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have read some of the replies and spoke to someone from another company DW Group. My sister was working for Asayo for a period of time, and my family did buy numerous products from this company and have been using their products for 3 years. thus i have every reason to believe that the company does not validate all its claims to market magnetic therapy as a healing product.<br><br>yes it does have magnets in the mattress, but the gaus level (magnetic level i think, not sure of the scientific explanation) is <strong>slightly</strong> higher than what is required for healing, which is why some pple receive healing effects, and other pple don't, possibly.<br>to those who work in Asayo Group because they have family members who have been healed of arthritis, you might like to refer to oct 9 2003 in The Straits Times for an article on magnetic healing, and relevant companies. first of all, arthritis is on and off, meaning that the symptoms may go away <strong>not</strong> due to the magnetic effects of the products. my mother had an ankle problem, and she used magnetic mattresses and an ankle support for all these years but was not healed.<br>one case of unvalidated claims made by the company's marketer or worker, which is my sister (would you believe that Asayo cons their own workers too? they delay payment for workers, yet expect swift and timely payment for products. is that inefficiency, or poor accounts? i'll leave you to decide) is "bad sheep", bad publicity enough for the company, because it shows that there is a possibility or probability that purchasing a $1600 magnetic mattress, and more products like the pillow <strong>may not</strong> work. if that is true, then why invest your hardearned money on something that does not and is unlikely to yield the results that you desire, ie. healing?<br><br>it is possible that Asayo's products do not work for some pple, because the gaus level in the products are not high enough to improve blood circulation, which reduces blood and swelling.<br><br>also there are companies who make use of multi level marketing to cheat people to work there, or to purchase their products. promises of vast profits after a minimum deposit or money capital has been sunk in, are indeed an attractive lure for greedy people who fall for it. you might like to note that many conmen (not referring to Asayo Group) these days operate by asking you to put in a certain amount of money, then abscond  with it.<br><br>also, the decline of Asayo Group today is the best proof for its unvalidated claims and not delivering up to its promises. it has been around for less than 10 years and  yet only has one office in Novena. A company that deals with honesty and fairness will stand, and does not need its workers to frantically call up long lost friends or colleagues or neighbours to make appointments to meet a certain quota so that they can receive commission or a high salary. such a tactic feeds on greed in colleagues and does not promote team spirit since one mentor may not teach its mentee well for fear of her/him outshining or surpassing him/her. this spells trouble for the company in terms of profit, which appears to be what is driving Asayo Group.<br><br>i do not seek to make personal attack at Asayo Group as there is no pressing need to, and this post is meant to serve as a warning for anyone who is approached to buy their products. Yes it *may* work, but chances are it might not. Take it from 4 people who have used it for 3 years.<br><br>Check how long the product warranty is. That should give you a glimpse into how durable this company's product is. the magnetic level will fall by 2% per year, so if it was low, to start with, chances are it might fall below the minimum level for it to cause a change in the human body in a few years, just after the warranty expires.<br><br>i  am no scientist and thus have no basis to say whether or not magnetic therapy works,but i will try it again from another company which sell products which have a higher gaus level to see if it works.<br><br><strong>so do not use the 'once bitten twice shy' argument on me,</strong> i am not writing this to redress the injustice this company has done, instead<strong> i am writing to warn possible consumers against products that simply do not deliver.</strong> i am basing my argument on tested and proven-not-valid products from this company, and have not been "conned by an outsider, but from one in the family whom the company has "brainwashed" into believing 100% in Asayo's products and working unearthly hours for ghastly pay (POSSIBLY exploitation of post A level students whose social circles are not wide enough to hit the target?), and definitely has no intention of tricking her family into buying substandard products. the only problem is, she didn't know about the substandard bit.<br><br>Asayo makes claims abt their products  that they cannot deliver. there is an element of truth in magnetic treatment since it dates back to many centuries ago, and the West (Not just Japan, where it has been tested and proven to work. you might want to note that Asayo's workers do not show their customers a license or permit for selling its products from Japan Life, as far as I remember even though i could possibly be wrong.). thus even though their products might work for some cases, it doesn't work for all.<br>willing to part with your money on substandard products? think again.<br><br>you can get more effective ones from other magnetic therapy companies like DW Group (no i do not work there, i merely met a salesperson who is eager to challenge claims and misconceptions pple might have abt magnetic therapy, i spoke with him for about  2 or 3 hours, and he was able to answer my questions on reflexology and acupuncture, which is being phased out with magnetic therapy. He was able to point out the lack of evidence or introduction to magnetic therapy by Asayo workers. I use the word 'worker' rather than 'employee' because Asayo pays their workers peanuts. If they really were concerned about customers being healed, they would market the products in a different way, and not go all out to make money, from all appearance  of how Asayo works that i have gathered.<br><br>to Asayo workers who are defending this company, are you willing to accept or question the possibility that you have been conned as well? not alot of people can even begin to consider the possibility of themselves believing in the half-baked truth.. you might just be one of them.</div>
