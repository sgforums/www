            <div class='col-md body'>well i have heard of that company too.  Actually the method of selling that they adopt is sort of hard-selling, multi-level marketing approach through establishing of networks with people.  It might seem similar to the pyramid scheme but is not cos multi-level marketing is accepted in Spore...while as we all know, pyramid scheme is not.<br><br>Yes i do agree that their selling approach can be very annoying as i also have an ex-classmate in there. i guess what u have to do is set your point straight to their salesforce that u are really not interested in buying the product, and there is no way u can accept paying an exorbitant price for a mattress that u don't think much of.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys.<br><br>Why would you say that they are con-men?  You must state your grounds in order to prove it.  As a layman, not knowing their products, we can't judge the products saying that it is not true.  If you say that a bed cost that much, it could be with latest technology and research.<br><br>For example, why would a pillow in the market had such a wide price differences? It could due to its materials, technology, research, benefits, etc.  As such products from Japan would not be inferior.  Most people would know that Japanese products are good.  Would you buy a product made in elsewhere or you will buy a product from Japan.  In terms of technology and research, Japanese had some advantage over some countries.  If you said that the products are fake, what do you think of TV Media products?  Do you think just 3 minutes a day, would achieve the results that shown on the advertisement.  Don't forget, products being advertised on the product may not be telling the truth.<br><br>We all know that handphones emit radiation, and why we still buy and use.  Since it is harmful to our health, why are we still using it. We might as well use public phone to call.<br><br>Therefore, please consider carefully about saying.  If a product had no effect on improving health, it would not be able to stand the test of time and the product will be disappear in no time.<br><br>Regards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha... So, I got few reply from Asayo employees here. I will see what other kind of nonsense your kind can shoot out at me in light-speed. Of course, no<br>salesman will ever say that the products they are selling is USELESS CRAP!<br><br>First to asaaclee, are you on drugs? Sorry to bust your bubble! Either you are<br>an idiot or ignorant. Did Asayo brain-washed you? What makes you think that it<br>is not a multi-level marketing company? If your company isn't multi-level, how<br>did it survive for 10+ years? Since you seems to know what is multi-level<br>marketing, maybe you would like to share with me and everybody? huh? If your<br>products is so good, why does it need a whole load of salesman to push the<br>damn products in everybody face? Don't you think your way of selling is too<br>much? Your kind of hard-selling is a pain in the AS*! Do you have any<br>scientific evident that the products you are selling is good for the health? I doubt it! However, I have to salute you. Great work salesman! You have just pissed off your customer even more!<br><br>To jamel, are you drunk or what? You and asaaclee is among the many crafty,<br>sly, slippery liars in Asayo! Both of you are just two bloody a**holes going<br>on your mission to deceive people. Of course, you would not dare to admit it<br>in public. Sorry to break the news! I will not waste my time visiting your god-damned company and listen to your marketing crap! I know all your gang is there, do you think I am a fool? Ha! You are wrong man! You trick won't work on me anymore. Maybe you can think of something new and I may consider your request!<br><br>To all people! Maybe you like to know why Asayo can survive for so long.<br>Because, they know that man are *SELFISH* and *GREEDY* in nature. They know that there are people out there willing to use any kind of filthy, low-down, unprofessional and under-handed methods to sell their wares so that they can earn $10,000 a month salary. These people are the most DANGEROUS! Their objective is to sell as much as possible so as to maximise their own income! They are all self-serving marketing weasels trying to maximise their profits at the expense of your savings. The feeds on your ignorant and trust! These marketing weasels from ASAYO are all suckers! This GOD-DAMNED company called ASAYO thrives on these kind of people, that is how they earn lots and lots of money. Once, you are taken in by them. They will kept on selling all kinds of crap to you even you do not need it. If their products is so good? Why do they have to resort to hard selling? Why do they have to persuade you to buy it? Why are they so irritating? Why the company is full of salesman and nothing else to support the whole business? These salesman from ASAYO have<br>no substances at all. Day in day out, they are sharpening their skills in "ART<br>OF DECEIT" and the "ART OF BRAIN-WASHING"! Don't you see the $$$ signs in their eyes? They care more about their income than your health! Why do they care so much about your health? They need your money! Because, they know people value health more than money. Therefore, they had got your *weakness*. They use *psychological tactics* against you! They use *FEAR tactics*! When your defence against them is low, they will make full use of their marketing jargons and product benefits to convince you to buy it! Do you really think a *PROFIT-DRIVEN* company with whole load of salesman will care a damn about you and your health? If you refuse to accept this truth, you are really sadly mistaken! Use your own judgement and ponder, I do not have anything to gain! I not one of ASAYO salesman. Of course, they will be glad that you trust their<br>products. It will be business as usual for them and money will keep rolling in as long as their *EXTREMELY OVER-PRICED* products can sell like hot cakes! You will never know about their technology and the way of manufacturing. They know you will pay any price if they say their products could cure a million illness. They prey on your weaknesses! BEWARE!<br><br>REMEMBER: They are despicable salesman! They want your money! They don't care<br>a damn about your health! It is just a favourable excuse for them to lower your defences. Don't listen to them and don't even go to their showroom! Else, you will regret it! If you have at least a bit of common sense, you should know what I mean! Tell them to *BUZZ OFF*!<br><br>Btw, asaaclee and jamel! Let's see how establish your company will be! I know<br>your company is always in need of new blood! Isn't this interesting? This is how everything work out, am I right? You can fool others but you can't fool me! I am not one of your kind! I am sure your kind of people had offended lots of people. A few number of clueless supporters towards your company doesn't mean anything to me. You can continue your *PROPAGANDA* and exploit them to your own advantage! You will reap what you sow! You are a blood-sucking DEVIL! Go figure... Any tom, dick and harry can work at your company. Your company will not last for long. 10 years is nothing! Get a life and grow up! I bet your company can close shop in less than 1 hour. There is nothing but a whole load of salesman! Do I need to say more?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading so many comments given by mozilla and those sales person from Asayo. If go by my viewing, i think mozilla is more to a selfish person who don't care about the people around him , why i say that becasue normally if you care for a person no matter who, you will feel like helping them up when they are in trouble. So if for those who care about their friends and family, no matter what happened they will go and care about them without asking much. SO if your mum and aunties and friend are having sickness, u will have the feeling of helping them and cure them, but you can't do so because you yourself cannot treat them unless you are a doctor. And even if there is treatment, it will also cost a bomb, even much more than $1600. If you think you trust more than the doctor and willing to spend more on them, dan i have nothing to say. But don't you think that u are giving $$$ to the doctor too. If there is anyway of helping your loves ones, why not give it a try. don't tell me your love one health is less important than your money. For me i will think more about their health rather than my money, $$$ can always earn back, but not health. Not everyone can feel the effect on that particular product like the bed, maybe becoz you r strong and young you still don't think that and you r more healthy, but what if you give to an older person with lots of ache in their body. They may feel differently. SO this is to depend on each other opinion. U can't say that a thing is useless if it does not give effect on you yourself only, but u must see other people whether that happened to them too. SO if you don't believe in this, why not you go and see the fact and proof and do homework first before you accuse of someone. it is useless and you can't say that the salespersons in Asayo are conmen and women, don't you think u are overboard in your talking. So you mean that all those working is sales line are con people lah, Becasue there are so many other product in singapore which have sales person including those insurance agent and property agent. Yours words can offend all this people, eventhough you are just referring to Asayo company but don't you think you it indirect offend others. It's better to mind you words. If you keep thinking this way you will get an enemy rather than a friend.Anyway everyone thinking is different, somehow you do must respect others idea not always saying you are always right. From my view, u are more to those who will want to win this argument rather than accepting others people view. Becasue by looking on your article with so many vulgarities, it shows that you r not mature enough , because in these real world when there is arguing, people don't use vulgarities, and using vulgarities or so called not nice words will give people idea on what type of character u have. Be more mature in giving your commend and proof it<br><br>Anyway, i like to clarify that i am not a member of Asayo group nor a buyer, i am just an outsider giving my view on this article. And how i got to know this article is just by conincidence and curious at first so after reading i think i should give my own comment too, my own point of view but not asking people to believe in me. I just beleive that no matter what , if u do have a chance to try on it, why not. that means u give out life easily.So think about it</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mozilla, each person is entitled to their own views and i m sure that u hv a reason for being so biased againest Asayo.  after reading through all the postings, it seems that u hv not mentioned WHY u hate Asayo so much. if u tell us then maybe it will be good.<br>Issac from Asayo hv already said why he and jamel r so supportive of Asayo and of course they do as they r employees of Asayo. they will naturally support the company that they work for, in fact i think this forum is getting rather popular as i got to know abt Asayo from this forum.<br>not all the companies r good but i will think that if the company can b around for 10 yrs as they say then it will be hard to accept the fact that the company cheats everyone. if this is true then the singapore government muz be really fucked up or Asayo muz b really good at cheating ppl till the goverment cannot even find any evidence.<br>will b interested to hear from both parties esp why mozilla is so pissed at Asayo. it muz hv been a really big matter for mozilla to flare up at the mere word mentioned abt Asayo, till then i will b waiting for any contributions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And i think wise saying is correct, if ASAYo company is really a con company while it still can survive in Singapore for so long. Wow that mean this must be a special person lah, without being caught even they con people. Mozilla wake up man, i know you are a biased type, dun keep saying that this company is no good. Please show proof that this company really isn't worth people to believe. U yourself may be in your dream land, without even waking up what is right and wrong. Wake up man..... i think u should go and stand in front of the mirror and see did i said those things worngly or correctly.. not all the stuff written are by Asayo employee some are outsiders why can't you accept the fact leh.... Stop beleiving u have say right</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YO, the impt ppl of this forum have not replied to my question yet and i m actually kinda disappointed.<br>Issac has not said anything yet and most impt is that Mozilla has not said anything as well. i was actually hoping for some kind of reply whether good or bad from either of u but i m glad that there is another person who sees my point of view that some kind of proof is needed for that screaming and attention grabbing title to this forum.<br>i will hv to say that the title is kinda misleading cause ppl seldom take the time to read through each reply so they assume that the title is the truth. i was also almost fooled by the title till i took the time to read through everything and realise that there r more supporters than condemners of Asayo in this forum.<br>anyway, still want to know WHY Mozilla hates Asayo since he is like the Uno Amigo in this forum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been to see the mattress before. The test worked on my friend. But none of us bought the mattress, the price is a bit too steep for us college students. However I have been obssesed with this magnetic theory. I have been running around university talking to my various professors. Trying to get one of them to run such an experiment. However as a scientist and a historian I am rather skeptical about the whole thoery. I mean I saw empirical results, but some claims that they made did not appear true during the test. I did not get to see any other reports by any other respected researcher or research institute to back up the claims.<br><br>As for whether it's mulit-level marketing, I really do not know. I too distrust such schemes. Especially when people abuse the system. I have seen MLMs work well if people stick to the rules. But many times their Singaporean reps cheat and harangue people to buy their products; there is a certain amount of duplicity. As to Asayo... I do not feel they are entirely a MLM, but I see certain similiarities. However if their products work and people can vouch for it, I see it less as an MLM, but rather a company with very pushy salesmen. And I must say it is pretty aggressive selling. Thank God for all that Army training and the lack of money in our pockets.<br><br>But i think it is unfair to come brandishing insults and ad hominem attacks. If you are to argue, argue on ground of logic and facts and not on logical fallacies.<br><br>If you lack the logical faculties to grasp logical arguments, then perhaps you should refrain from making personal attacks on the people who are arguing against you. Stick to arguing the data. If you ever wish to make a career in the academic world, or even to go to college, you should really not attack the person making the argument. Like I am. Find out more facts to prove or disprove their arguments. Because once you have the solid facts to disprove them and you publish it, there is no way they can ignore you or do some hand waving trick. They will have to admit defeat and pack up. So i urge you rather to collect solid data to back up what you are saying.<br><br>Do not, do not argue from such a flimsy and easily dismissed stand point.</div>
