            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jem05:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear Toto4d,<br><br>I can't help laughing when I saw your reply. You really do sound like a disgruntled employee. No worries, I have done my research and analysis before I decided to join Asayo. I was "invited" to Astramag before going to Asayo once, but I refused to join tjhem because of their "buying sales" technique. Regarding the increase in prices, do you know that a can of coke actually cost 10 cents to 20 cents? How much do you actually pay for when you buy it in the coffee shops? 1 dollar? Isn't that a 1000% increase? I think no one bothers because the drink cost peanuts. By comparing the market value of oour goods to the other marketing firms, I believe that the quality and price of ours are second to none actually. Take a look around, you will see what I mean. *smiles*<br><br>I do feel that you are very biase in your claims about Mr Raymond, because your claims has no basis at all. *smiles* Do you mean to say that being superstitious makes a person bad? I think many will agree that this claim is kind of dumb? As for being upright, in what ways do you think that Mr Raymond is not? He could have easily solved the goods problem by introducing low quality goods like some marketing firms around, but he refused. Doesn't that show his intergrity? I would like to add that being upright doesn't mean that your men will not leave you. Didn't it strike you that his right hand men might not share his values? They could have left because they are unwilling to face the problems together with him? They want to live a more relax life with other companies? They feel that defection is best way  to save their own skins? *smiles*<br><br>As for your claim that the boss gets richer while his employees slog. Isn't that the case for ALL companies? Have you seen any bosses in the insurance line running for sales? Do you see Bill Gates designing software now? *laughs* But I am certain that you don't know the amount of stress and pressure that he is facing. In the past when there were stock problems, who do you think is the one sweating his guts out to produce the goods for his employees to pass to their customers. It is of course him, it's his companny for God's sake! Frankly I do feel that from your comments, you are a person who only thinks in your own perspective. As a former employee of Asayo, I thought you would have more in you to analyse and differeniate the rights and wrongs, instead of pushing all the blame to Boss and the company.<br><br>As for sinking deeper, I know what you mean. I have many telling me about the difficulties of the job but never have i thought that they do not want me to succeed, no one n the company has ever told me this anyway. I think only your Dolphin Warriors team practice such an analogy. *laughs*<br><br>Toto4d, I will take a step back and analyse the situation now, but I also do hope that you can take a step back and analyse the past. Is it right to pass such comments and defaming the person who has been so kind? I hope that you do not stereotype everyone just because of the way you were handled in Dolphin Warriors. It doen't make much sense. *smiles*<br><br>Thanks and regards</div></blockquote>the boss have always showed you the good side of him.....there are things that people do not know and will not believe even if I tell them about your boss. I happened to know one of his ex-close aides and judging from wat they say n wat i know of your boss. It's reaslly astounding to realise that he is actually that kinda person. TIts hard not to believe as pieces fall into places and what he said do have basis.<br><br>who are we to know him personally and know his true self? I dun. but his close aides do<br><br>I wish you good luck in your pursuit for success in Asayo...again i wanna say....do not look back and regret</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading all the arguements for and against Asayo, IMO there are a lot of questions left unanswered about Asayo.<br><br>If Asayo is running a proper business, why is it still having problems with stock and cash flow? Why are there still disgruntled customers and ex-employees criticising the company? So many reasons were stated in favour of Asayo but the problems are still there.<br><br>As for my relative who's working in Asayo, he has not been paid his commission owed to him by Asayo for months. Asayo does not pay any allowance and he has to live on a tight budget. Surviving on what little commission Asayo gives him. He's supposed to be getting 40% commission as he's supposedly a "manager" but he's seen little of that 40%. Many of us have spoken to him and advised him that he can't carry on like this but he keeps insisting that he wants to help Asayo turn around and make it big. I guess Asayo has done a great job in brainwashing him that prospects are actually good. He has so much blind faith in this company that has been existence for over 10 years but still struggling to make ends meet now.<br><br>That's not all. This relative has also customers who are owed goods from Asayo. This has been going on for months. Asayo made  promise after promise to deliver but fail to deliver each time. These are customers who have made FULL PAYMENT for their goods months ago but have yet to receive them from Asayo. If Asayo really cares for their customers, how can they be doing this? This is a CURRENT problem and not a past one. I wonder what reasonable explanations there are for such cases??<br><br>Why is it that Asayo can have problems with stock for only pillows and not other products like bed pads or comforters?? Aren't pillows supposed to be cheaper?? Or is it just that the profit margin for pillows are too little that it's not worth selling anymore??<br><br>Why is it that Asayo is still recruiting when they can't even solve their current problems? Why do they sell the idea of JV and expansion to overseas markets when they can't even get stock management, cash flow and prompt paychecks right?<br><br>I also heard that some ex-employees (allegedly bosses of other similar companies) of Asayo played Asayo out or conned them and left Asayo with a huge loss to cover. If there was any wrongdoing there, why wasn't it made a legal case?? A company is conned of its money but refuses to take legal action. Something must be wrong somewhere...<br><br>A good company is one that pays their employees and delivers to their customers on time as promised. I don't think anyone can reason out that Asayo belongs to this category...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="small"></span>Hi all. Hoping to find out more abt Asayo and happen to came across this forum. Seems like it has been a hot topic for many years... which i feel is helping Asayo to 'advertise' itself indirectly. So well-known yet only appeared once in Wan Bao.. correct me if im wrong.<br><br>Personally feel that the topic title is a little too harsh, but not totally out of logic. I agree that Asayo is legal as it does fulfil the minimum requirements for it to be run in Singapore. And there is no doubt in the magnetic technology as it was proven to be helpful to health in certain extent. Just that the method of selling their products is something that few ppl can accept.<br><br>Have read many articles from Asayo's staff. All were saying how good their boss was and how he still managed to survive for 10+yrs if he's no good. <strong>But which of the staffs can verify whatever their boss said is true? Does anyone worked long enough to justify those who-betrayed-who stories?</strong> Asayo is able to survive 10 over yrs is due to the help of all its no-basic-pay employees. Therefore, the company can concentrate all their capital in purchasing products and resell them in overwhelming price. It's also impressive that the expansion of its workforce is unlimited without a penny coming out from the company itself.<br><br>I agree the price of many commercial products marked up a lot from their actual cost price. Business is all abt earning money. But the staffs of those companies have basic pay. They are still able to earn some amount even when times are bad. Imagine if you are one of Asayo's staff and sold only 1 product in the whole mth. Your 100% salary that mth comes from that product bought by your friend (i assumed). Does it come across your mind that you can actually be your own boss? And the only way to earn more is to climb up to the top of the hierarchy. Do you think your boss will let you climb that high to share his wealth? Perhaps these are the reasons for the bosses of Venture Era and Astral Mag to leave Asayo and start their own hierarchy. Why let others earn more when you can earn as much yourself?<br><br>Minimum start-up cost as the company only produced products when there is a need. Get full-payment from customer then order goods from Japan. That's why there's no warehouse in Asayo. Am i right? Might be the reason for the delay in delivery because the company is always <strong>not ready </strong>to deliver any goods.<br><br>The price of the product can actually be reduced if Asayo is willing to pay its employee. Meaning that if each employee is paid $300 basic pay, the product will be $300 cheaper, resulting in a wider market. Magnetic products are luxuries. Somemore it is not introduced by doctors or pharmicists instead of salesmen with little health knowledge, will reduce its market even more.<br><br>People who earn big bucks from Asayo are either started many years ago where the public is still quite ignorant to this company, or he/she have a group of 'real-supportive' friends to sell products to. Asayo is now so 'well-known' and people are only forming 2 categories: Believe or Not Believe. All the existing Asayo's staff can only target those who Believe, and the no. of ppl in this category is too little. Half of those Believe ones are already working in Asayo.<br><br>I do urge people to resign from that company as the targeted market of each employee is decreasing when its entire workforce is increasing. More ppl sharing a small piece of cake. We have spent 10+ yrs studying so much and we should actually put our concentration into what we specialised in. If you study sales marketing pls find a more stable job. Or if you are planning to be an entrepenuer than make sure you are the boss of the next MLM company like Asayo.<br></div>

We are not Aunt Agonies for goodness sake *laughs*. Reason why I did not reply as often is because I am quite busy. Furthermore, the questions posted are quite repetitive to say the least. I can't be replying with a standard template can I? *smiles*<br><br>Does this company actually offended you in any ways? Sure hope you can relax on your tensions. Take care and best regards<br></div>

Sometimes, I do think your questions are very indepth but sometimes I do think that you are living in your 'own' world. You do make everything sound so simple.  "Just report it to the CAD." you say, what makes you think that we haven't. Even if we had, how would you know?<br><br>I think you haven't got our predicament right, when I said NO DOWNPAYMENT INSTALLMENTS, it meant that these people are actually fighting for positions, they would record the sales and just pay for the first installment. But in actual fact, there is never this sale in the first place. That is how Asayo suffered losses.<br><br>Another thing is when you sue a person, the best return would be collecting your damages. Am I right to say that? Somehow for a fact, we do know that the people do not have the money. What is the point of sueing until the person goes to jail, no one and I mean NO ONE benefits from this?<br><br>And your point about agents pulling off the same trick? Duh! Of course the comapny has taken measures to curb some rubbish from happening. There isn't any no downpayment installments anymore, installment goods must have at least a deposit before there is any follow up action.<br><br>And the part about Asayo making promises after promises. Did Asayo promise you anything? How do you know that there are many people angry? You say Asayo owes your relatives goods, I feel any Tom, Dick or Harry can just post this question to tarnish our name. To put it bluntly, I have this huge suspicion that you are from a rival company who wants to do more damage to Asayo. Your credibility is so different from Zabel, at least he can name me the agent who sold the goods. But you? You just keep harping on the fact that Asayo owes you goods. Well I can say that too. *smiles*<br><br>Why do I say this? When I asked you how you know that Asayo has a coffeeshop under the office, no reply about that. When I asked you for your cousin's name, no reply about that. Prove me wrong if you can, I will do my best to check it out for you.<br><br>Regards<br>Jem</div>
