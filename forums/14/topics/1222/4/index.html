            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,I saw it too in the papers.I agree with you how come such a well-established company (claimed by the agents) only published such important ad in 1 paper and not all the other papers.<br>Could it be the truth tat this 'con'-company is facing financial problems?<br>Checked with some of my Commando mates who are still 'working hard' in Asayo.They claimed tat the Boss,Mr Raymond had recruited a motivation speaker,Mr Stanley to plan strategies and attractive packages to boost the sales of the company.Also to help the company to tide over the crisis as some rival companies (Venture Era or Astral Mag) had 'declared war' with Asayo.Wow...sounds like ancient Zhu Geliang giving advice and strategies to win a battle.<br>Actually the ad in the papers is 1 of the strategy by Stanley.They juz wanted to 'test water'.<br>Recently,my commando mates (one of them had achieved the JV and the rest are still Sales Manager working under him) 'jio' me to attend a seminar at Pan Pacific Hotel.Typical MLM style...all formally dressed and those prize giving ceremony(be it best sales,JV achievers,Mont Blanc Pens achievers,etc)The last part is talking about the future plans that will be used to boost the image of Asayo.Plans like giving out condominiums,cars,etc to those JV companies who had the highest sales.I almost doze off....all the BULLSHIT &amp; CRAP!!!The Company can't even afford the pay checks ( claimed by buddies tat their checks are delayed for nearly 5mths),where got money to buy condo and cars.Maybe Dulex Condoms from 7-11.hehe...<br>Asayo is also moving out of that pathetic office at Goldhill Plaza.If I'm not wrong,it should be moving to SingPost at Paya Lebar.They claimed that the new office is 4-5 times bigger than the present office.The other JV companies are also chipping in the rental as they plan to merge with the parent company,Asayo.<br>Last but not least,I really hope my buddies can persue their 5'C's dreamz and succeed in this crap company.If not,hope tat they can wake up asap and stop dreaming!!!This kind of job is not suitable for everyone.<br>Will be right back soon to 'fen xiang'(share) about the inside news of this Company,ASAYO.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, i must state that i am not against any company or anyone. I personally feel that no matter which company (Forever Living, Bel'Air, Astral Mag, Asayo, Amway, Newway, Sun Rider, NOP, WBG, Nuskin, Venture Era, Shuang He, Ai Kang, Easecox and so on). Their health products definitely can help to promote health. It's true that the product these companies' products might be abit costly but if it can benefit our kin, i think it's worth it. However, i feel that their price are quite reasonable because no matter what stuff we are buying, the price will be mark up by alot. These definitely depends on a person's perception. Different people think differently. I think most people who are distributor for all these company are good at heart. They just want to help to give their kin better health. Of course, they will get some benefit from the sales but that's not the main point. Maybe i code an example, if i open a handphone shop and my relative want to get a handphone, maybe they will buy from me. Reason is they might want to let me earn rather then others. But of course if i can give them discount that will be better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Morever, more and more networking company will be set up as networking is the trend from the 21st century. If the distributors don't sell the health to their kin, eventually, others will. In years to come, people will not be negative towards networking, rather, it's which company that they are thinking of joining that is the question.<br><br>Every industry will have their grey zone follow by awareness stage and lastly establish stage. A very life example is insurance. No one believe insurance when it's in it's grey zone meaning first started but now insurance is so well establish that almost everyone will have at least an insurance policy. Likewise for networking, it's is now moving towards awareness stage. I believe those people who persist on will be reward one day. Persist is the key word, it's just a matter of whether a person can withstand cristicism from friends, kins and others. Some people can't take it and gave up therefore leading them to the thinking that networking can't work. Also, when friends and kins seeing that they gave up. This also gave them the misconception that networking can't work out.<br><br>I personally feel that why networking is legalised is because retrenchment rate in Singapore now is too high. Alot of big networking companies are aiming the China market now. Once they enter the WTO next year, networking will be legalised in China because alot of people in China will be retrench in the coming years. Networking is actually a way of doing business for people who come from family that's not well off, not born in silver spoon and have don't have heritage of business from parent. Reason is because when network are form commission are split across the network when sales are generated. It's the same concept for tradition business. If 5 person start a business and when profit are make it will be split within the 5 partners and not just contribute to a partner only. Networking works with the same concept. Of course some people will still have the thinking that people are earning friends money by asking them to join the business. If you are a distributor, you have to understand from their point of view also because like i say networking is still not acceptable at this stage to alot of singaporean. Likewise, for people who is very skeptical towards networking, don't blame or boycott your friends if they are networkers as they have their own thinking also. They just have dreams that is different from others. We have to respect others in order for others to respect us.<br><br>As for some aguement towards some companies, i personally feel that these companies are quite ill fated because there's alot of thing we have to take into considerations. There will definitely be a small group of black sheeps in any industry. Same for networking companies, maybe the distributors for XXX company did not do their customer service, some might be using very pushy way to promote their products thurs leaving people bad impression towards the company or networking. But not all people in networking are like that. When situation like these happen, people will pin point to the company instead of the agent.<br><br>Last but not least, just to say something. If you are a networker, persist on and you will be different from others. It's very simple. In networking, those who persist till the end will have the last laugh especially when it's now in it's pioneering stage. If you are not a networker, maybe you can give yourself a chance to know more Who knows? It might be the turning point of your life. However, if you cannot accept the way networking works, it perfectly normal because some people prefer to lead a simple life.<br><br>If from the above msg i offended someone or companies, i apologise, it's unintentional.<br><br>vksg</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, well let me give u a first hand account from the point of view of an insider. I am an ex-employee of the place and had quit sometime towards the end of last year.<br>I entered the company knowing nothing about it and I cannot deny that towards the end of my days there; I was skeptical of the product as well as their company culture.<br>When I first entered the co. , we were made to go thru' training which included<br>trying on ourselves the products. Well, it was ok. I was excited abt the product, it seemed really good. I think it might improve your health. Then, we were made to go thru' (what me and a friend jokingly call the "brainwash" session) watching the company video. They really wanted to instill in us a sense of fierce belongingness, faith and belief in the products.<br>However, I remained the reluctant worker. It's not that I was lazy, on the contrary, I even managed to hit targets set by my manager. But I just found an error in the way they trained us.<br>I quote from the manager as saying 'you have to start from your family and friends'.. and I remembered saying, what if they can't afford it?.. well, my manager merely replied that then they are not your true friends or not supportive of you!.. I was upset as my family was not well to do and my friends were still being supported by their parents..<br>.. as the training progressed, I was specifically taught to make my friends feel bad if they dont want to attend the 'meeting' or demonstration. I was not even allowed to tell them what the 'meeting' was all about. I felt so sick about having to hide about all this. I felt like I was working for some underground firm that does not want to disclose too much in the open. It just felt wrong and it didnt feel like a real job. No basic pay, only commission based. I argued about that too, to the manager. But he merely debated that this was a way to motivate us to hit the targets. Ya right, it was more like exploitation.<br>There was even a timing to tell the price of the products.. my manager feared that they might be turned off upon hearing the price too soon. I just felt so sick. I started cancelling all my appointments with friends whom agreed to come bcos I didnt want them to go thru what I went thru. I just felt no more interest for the place. Had bad vibes about the whole company concept. So I left before me income became too dependent to the place. That's all I have to say. I'm glad I left. I was suprised to find that many people felt the same way, thought I was alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those of you who happened to look through this forum, Asayo had just terminated several of their used staff. Seems like they've decided to discard those they deem unable to make money. Some of them spent as long as months in the company and have fought to positions such as Assistant Sales Manager (ASM). What can I say.<br>Just an advice to those of you who thought about joining the company.<br><span class="large"></span><span style="color: red;"></span>THINK TWICE BEFORE MAKING THE WRONG DECISION IN THESE TIMES OF CRISIS.[/code]</div>

If you've been in the company for 2 months you should know better.<br><span style="color: red;">1) How long does it take for the goods ordered by your customers to arrive on an average and is it really right for the company that deals in direct selling to let the customers pay full amount of the products and then let them wait for more than 2 months or longer.<br>2) How long does the company intend to pay their staff their commission? Every month, every 2 months, 3, or even no pay?</span><br><br>Not that I want to bad mouth the company but it's just not right to delay things in such manner and people should know about this.

Is your company expecting the customers to GIVE IT A HELPING HAND??<br><br><blockquote>Asayo is the ONLY sole distrubutor of Japan Life products and DW also sells japan life products but their stocks come from China or HK where they use the left over materials to make the products</blockquote>Are you saying me this DW company is selling "pirated" products of Japan Life?

            <div class='col-md body'>i must agree with some of those who r neutral or support network marketing. but i am not saying i disagree with those who dislike network marketing. i admit i am working in a network marketing company. i wish to share my thoughts and opinions with u all and not trying to influence anyone. i believe all of us have brains and can think and can differentiate what is right and wrong.<br><br>1) first of all i believe that not all network marketing companies are bad or networking marketing is bad. it is the ppl who r doing it that r bad. network marketing is just a way of doing business. some of u may think 'of course we r toking abt the ppl, y would we tok bad abt a name?' tt's right! since u agree that it is the ppl and their way of doing it or the products they sells r bad, then y should we condemn tt all network marketing companies r bad, if some of u do.<br><br>2) we should not despise or outcast our friends if they are working in network companies. it is also a decent job if they are truthful and honest. for example if the products they sell really benefit ppl and they r not overcharging the price, then y should we despise or outcast them? they r just like any other salesman or insurance agents. i believe most of u do have insurance and bought them from agents as well.<br><br>3) pyramid scheme is illegal and banned in singapore. though mlm is legal, there r many restrictions and laws in singapore to prevent abuse of the system. comapnies operating mlm need to be registered as well. hence when a company says that it is a network marketing company, i dun see any reasons to doubt or flame them. by doing so, u r also indirectly doubting or not having confidence with our government. do u think in singapore where u r fucking fined for the smallest things in the world, will the government allows companies to operate illegal and cheat us?<br><br>there are some advices or opinions i would like to share with those supporting or neutral with networking marketing. first of all when u see and set ur goals, go all out to achieve them, just like u go all out to chase a girl/boy. there will bound to be discouragements and difficulties on the way. but dun give up easily because success belongs to those who r determined. at most if u fail to succeed, take it as a lesson learnt and experience gained. though some of u may think money and time r wasted, but think of it another way. use the money to buy lessons and gained experience which u may not get from other line or trade. dun u also invest or spend money when u go after ur girl/boy?<br><br>for those who dislike network marketing, my thinking is do not despise or outcast them. like i say it is also a job. what if they do is honest and truthful, y should we? take the case of insurance. or lets say a class with many students and the teacher is a professor and the best u can get in the world. i can confirm that not all students will get the same results though wat the teacher teach is the same and equal to all. and if 1 student is a gangster and bad discipline, can we judge all of them r gangsters as well? respect everyone's job or career. i believe if u dun wish to purchase anything from them, they will not use a gun to force u. just tell them straight in the face and show tt u r determined. warn them if they r ur friends that u will be angry and might leave him if he keeps pertering u. i believe he will not do tt again cos no ppl will one to make more enemies than friends.  they will respects ur decisions just like u respect their jobs. instead if they r doing it the ethical way, they will be gladful u r willing to spend time listening to them. it is both an experience for them and a lesson of the product for u.<br><br>who knows u may be working in the same line in the future or ur business may employ network marketing to sell ur products?!<br><br>last is to those who r about or thinking to join a network marketing company. i advice u should do some research first. check out the company financial status. whether it has delays for payments to its agents, or there delays in delivery of stocks or goods. it it does, the company is not financially secure and may close anytime. next if it ask u to buy the products upfront, dun be so stupid to do so. u may end up losing more money if u r unable to sell. or if they insist, ask abt the refund system.<br><br>http://www.mti.gov.sg/public/NWS/frm_NWS_Default.asp?sid=38&amp;cid=950<br><br>check whether it is selling real products that really benefit ppl. u wouldn't want to go cheating ppl of their money with false products rite? check the way the company works. whether the ppl have strong bonding or they r just using one another.the company will surely close if the managenment is bad no matter how gd their mkting plan is. for some u may think it is difficult to tell in such a short time. but there r tell tales signs so look closely. look at the way the ppl communicate. whether they are close and true to one another. see if the seniors r helping the juniors willingly and truthfully. or r they giving excuses to avoid helping them. u should be able to sense tt. top management is very important!! or if u want to 'test' them, tell them u r working. go through the training and 'waste' some of their time and efforts to train u. then make up some excuses to quit. if they r unhappy or wat, then u should not see them again. if not u may really want to consider working so make another excuse to join b again. last but not least, if u suspect their mkting plan in the sense tt the top earn more than wat they claim or legal levels, the only way to find out is to climb up urself. dun ever be so stupid to ask them cos u will never get the truth. one more thing, most ppl hate the 'brainwash sessions'. but i think of it another way. it is to instill a sense of belonging to the company. most business companies will do tt because they do not wish the ppl they train so hard to betray them by joining other companies or set up one of their own.<br><br>these r just my 1 cent worth of thought and opinions. i am not trying to influence anyone here. like i say all of u all can think for ur own. i am be wrong also and i welcome and comments.<br><br>______________________________________________________________________________________________<br>do not see things from one angle. it is important to have an open mind. u will learn more things and the truths usually are the opposite. dun be a toad in a well.</div>

BUT..... recently I have found out that the currently JapanLife in Japan sells construction materials. They are established for more than 30 years and had never sell any biomagnetic products before!!! They further provided me with info that 5 years ago a company with the same name, JapanLife, as them, selling biomagnetic products went bankrupt!!!<br><br>So those biomagnetic companies in Singapore claim to import products from JapanLife in Japan or even bought the production plants from JapanLife, IT IS ALL BULLSHIT!!!<br><br>PLEASE stop working for those companies before it is too late. Those people who do not believe, you can approach me for the emails that I have sent and received from JapanLife. I have black and white proofs that show the JapanLife in Japan does not deal with biomagnetic products at all!!!!<br><br>Please warn as many people about it as possible.
