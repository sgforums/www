Coz your post imply the recent flaming was due to backstabbing by other companies. This is considering some of these people I know were just victims or ex agents, rather than MLMers from other company.<br><br>By the way, its not i disagree with your post regarding two sides of the coins, but one problem, and its nagging me, its that most MLMers dont lay the hard facts and discuss the issue, in this forum i mean. Rather, the posts are like yours, i must say, very wishy washy, philosophical, always talking abt backstabbing, being neutral, black sheeps etc etc<br><br>Besides that, if you want to impress the non MLMers, lay down the hard facts. I think what most non MLMers wanted to see is some hard facts to argue against theirs, rather than some circuitous responses which dont answer the questions.</div>

And this defeats the purpose of doing business, especially so for mlm. In contrary, to suceed in mlm u need sincerity and not put on a mask. Human beings are not stupid..they can tell if you are lying to them. One example is the numerous complaints everybody can see in this forum. And what happens next? the company gets a bad name and everyone labels it a scam. Everytime!<br><br>But what about majority of those who are doing mlm the honest and sincere way, with products or opportunity offered that can really help improve their lives?And why is it that when a car or insurance salesman did not do well, it's because the salesman is perceived as a lousy performer? But why is it that when a mlmer did not perform as well it's the fault of the company, products, compensation plan, etc but never himself?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have at least 5-7 friends who took to MLM,they dragged me for the conjob talks more than a few times.Now, a few years after the frenzy, all of them have stopped and the losses range from a few hundreds to about 10K.<br><br>MLMs have to sell products at exhorbitant prices to ensure the upline would be making money. Hence there is an act of adding scores of middle men in the way of the manufacturer to the eventual buyer, by this act, the is no way that the product cost to consumers would potray its true value, as much of the costs are incurred in the latent service element.<br><br>I hope the best for MLM-ers but i have to agree that only those whom are right at the top would find the activity beneficial.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, it is true that some companies charge high prices for their products. But true mlm companies like mine actually prices not much difference from those on the shelves. As most would know the distribution channels of mlm, the profits will be distributed among the distributors according to how the compensation plan works etc...similar to how the traditional way pays its middlemen etc, not forgetting other costs such as advertising etc.<br><br>There is also the quality of products involved and the R &amp; D  being done on the product which requires costing also. Thus all these have to be taken into consideration, especially in looking at a good mlm company too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>as for ur frens, i am sorry to hear of the losses, but guess this is part and parcel of doing business.

            <div class='col-md body'>every product goes through similar marketing process, such as the r&amp;d stages and advertising..but realise that over the counter products go through a handful middlemen, whilst for mlm,the middlemen are aplenty,there is an inherent flaw in the concept that people actually buy the products for its quality, as any product sold by mlm, would surely find a suitable equal at a fraction of the cost..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, how much a product actually costs depends on the company actually, no matter whether it is mlm or not. Even in an over the counter product, depending on the profits given to each party, it is the same logic.<br><br>As for the number of middlemen, it all depends on how the compensation plan is worked out for the company. In mine, there is a limit to how it is given out, and it is all laid down in the plan. Also the products are quite comparable with the market price outside and this is the company policy to have quality products that are value for money, thus we do not waste too much money on the products. Although the profit return for each product may not be that great, however, the price is also not great, so it turns out the same and most importantly, at least our customers and us all know that we are paying the true price for each product <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
