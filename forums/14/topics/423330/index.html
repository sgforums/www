              <p>Recently my friend introduced an asset management program which can yield 6% return through renting of the product, which really caught my attention. But when being told about the company name, it some how becomes quite confusing as the 3 name of "Jiki Life, Japan Life, Asayo." are all related.</p>
              <p>Could anybody advice me on this asset managment program? How does it generate such good return? Although my friend had told me that this magnetic product had been used by many in japan and its proven to be effective. Thus selling or renting of this product is not a problem.</p>
              <p>The company got a brand new office in Suntec and is well renovated. Just that it looks empty with lots of seats and desk spaces available.</p>
              <p>Some kind souls please advice me on this company.. is it reliable? Does mangetic product really works? or is it a pure scam?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>recently my friend also introduce me to join Asayo Group~</p>
              <p>Asayo Group had moved from direct selling to now renting out the biomagnetic products.</p>
              <p>They got their agents to find customers to pump in capital and in return will give them 7.5% of the capital per annum as rental fee to this group of customers who pumped in their capital.</p>
              <p>The boss is still Raymond with the new CEO as Jonathan.</p>
              <p>Seriously i really have my doubt in this company. So can anyone help me to verify the credibility of this company?</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>from what i know, their business model is like that.(went for the talk)</p>
              <p>Rule number 1,basic supplies and demands, With people investing the products, they will find the rentees, so to pay the asset owners the returns promised.So, regardless whether they rent it out, the company will have to pay the rental charges of 7.5% to the asset owners.</p>
              <p>There is a cap for the numbers of asset owners(rem rule number 1) I think is 50,000 owners. then assets size is approximately 50 millions.Once reached they will stop admitting assets owners.</p>
              <p>So if there is just 50,000 owners, it is just 1 % of the PAP's assumed population of 5million in the 2030. So there is a assumption that it will definitely able to support  the rental market. The asset owners will keep having the rental as long they keep their assets for rent.They can sell back the asset certifications back to company or people outside if they want to liquidate their investment.</p>
              <p>The Assets the asset owners bought to rent to rentees are those medically certified in japan beds.jewalaries,Etc. Saw their mother company in japan in the internet, it had been operating for the past 30 plus years and still growing in sales and volume until their country cap.<br>As they told me, the monthly rental is as low as 40 plus dollars with terms of 3 years, so alot of OLD people are renting instead of buying the medically certified products to protect their health.</p>
              <p>I asked them if Rentees defaulted payments, they told me the company will still honor the payment back to the asset owner. they will repair the product if it's spoilt and replaced after the 3 years term. And it is gurranteed by the factories in japan and singapore.</p>
              <p>Their marketing strategies are like as general singapore population are getting old, they emphasing on health enhancement for the people who see importance on health, therapatic,fashion. and fro the owners, continous rental income for old age.</p>
              <p>Guys, those who had listened the presentation, is there any thing more?</p>

              <p>Hmmm.... this plan sound so good? but why wasn't it marketed in the company?? As far as i know they claim that Japan life is very well-know in Japan and this kinda plans as well. However when i check with a few japanese friend, they have not  hear of this at all.</p>
              <p>Perhaps we should wonder about about this few points...</p>
              <p>1. As far as i know this company is not register under MAS. Whether or not are they allow to sell such plan is still  a question? and they are not under any rule and regulation. How can we know their competence for dealing with such plan?</p>
              <p>2. Their plan will only see the investment return at least after 10years. However will the company substain for 10 years? This company shifting around and their most recent listed address is wrong (the wrong unit no). and the telephone no they listed, nobody answer even during office hour??</p>
              <p>3. i was told If the company liquidated, we are able to get the magnet back and sell it to other buyer. however does the magnet worth 3k? </p>
              <p>4. If u google closely, the comapny that sell this plan is call Asayo Jiki and the one that sell magnetic products is call Asayo group. which means that they are 2 different companys. If asayo jiki decided to wind their business up, Asayo group are not liable to pay any cents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not trying to proove that this plan is a scam, but there are really a lots of doubts for us to clear. i hope that a sales person from the company can answer my question</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">i went for the talk too. from what i see returns @ 7.5% per annum is rather reasonable. not too good nor shabby. sounds like those investment plans offered outside but at least this is guaranteed. better than put inside bank n suffer losses from inflation (provided this is not a scam la)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">as for the registration with MAS part they dont require because they do not rent out the items for you while representing their company instead they rent it out on ur behalf. its kinda like a workaround but there is a contract for this. anyway with or w/o MAS registration no diff, those kena the Lehman case also like that. dunno case fight until how liao.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">i'm kinda confused by the jiki thing also as there is jiki, asayo and japan life. dunno y so many entities also. never did have a chance to ask. but i have a friend going down this wednesday so i guess i ask him to ask this chim question for me.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">btw the_fallen y do u need some1 to invite u down? i mean you could go down and have a look by urself also rite. anyway since my friend is going down this wed maybe u would wanna go with him. n hopefully of cuz that ur not a asayo/jiki/japan life agent in disguise or it would not be very nice as we r rather open minded ppl but do not appreciate being tricked. PM me if u interested ya~ no offence ok cheers!</p>

              <p>don't worry about it..it's all part and parcel of learning..and to avoid being mislead..</p>
              <p>it's okay to suspect and cast doubts on anybody, just don't let it cloud your vision (with colored lens) or perspective on the way you analyze and observe things from your previous negative experience..</p>
              <p>that's what i learned..the basics of the basics..that allowed me to grow and learn knowledge..</p>
              <p>it helps when you have someone experienced to speed up the learning curve..i had my advisors in the past that laid the fundations right..and having moved on from there myself..</p>
              <p>let me know or past me the contact of the person whom referred/contacted ur fren to go down..this way i can get a wider area of subjects for observations, as compared to going in without any person from the company.</p>
