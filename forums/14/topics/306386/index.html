              <p>Sunshine Empire is closing during the CNY break. What many people do not know is that this is just a cover up. The leaders of this scheme are currently trying ways and means to shift their funds overseas and after the CNY break it is safe to say that SE will NOT be back. All the people in Singapore will NOT be able to cash out their money or epoints anymore after CNY.</p>
              <p>In fact even now many people in SE are already experiencing this.  </p>
              <p>IF YOU HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN BY SUNSHINE EMPIRE AND THEIR LEADERS, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL AFTER CNY BECAUSE IT WILL BE TOO LATE. PLEASE CALL COMMERCIAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AT  <strong>6557 3918. </strong>THEY ARE OPEN TODAY until 6 PM. Alternatively you can contact them at <a href="http://www.cad.gov.sg">www.cad.gov.sg</a></p>
              <p>IF YOU HAVE TAKEN PART UNWITTINGLY IN THIS SCAM, or UNKNOWINGLY RECRUITED PEOPLE INTO SE BECAUSE YOU WERE TAKEN IN BY THEIR LEADERS, the CAD WILL NOT TAKE ACTION AGAINST YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A VICTIM. If YOU HAVE MONEY IN SE, please report the details to CAD so they can help you.</p>
              <p>IF YOU ARE A JUNIOR 'MANAGER' in SE, you have also been DECEIVED. PLEASE REPORT the TRUE MASTERMINDS of SE to CAD and no punitive action will be taken against you. The important thing is to STOP THEM before they disappear with the funds.</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>If a company is closing down, or if you got news that a company is closing down, would you want to make sure your money is in liquid form, ie, cashed out?</p>
              <p>Of course accounts frozen, lan lan, but this wasnt the issue raised from the series of conversation.</p>
