              <p>Any person who knows of James Phangs history, or researched into the companies he has owned and the 'projects' he has involved in will know. For over 10 years, James Phang has been in many many projects involving Singapore Malaysia, Indonesia and maybe China and HK.</p>
              <p>ALL OF HIS PROJECTS HAVE FAILED. From NOP, to NTI, to China Dream, to now SE. All his products rep have been spoiled by him,</p>
              <p>Selling niches in Lim Chu Kang Columbarium as "investment", anyone remember that? FAIL</p>
              <p>Selling Country club membership in Batam for the non existant Magic Kingdom. FAIL</p>
              <p>Before that peddling Pai Du Pills, which are now still being sold by Long Far. FAIL</p>
              <p>Selling magnetic underwear Lumimi and trying to bring it to china. FAIL</p>
              <p>Oxy8 skin products. $20 cost price, but because of MLM markup, sold for more than $200 per set. FAIL</p>
              <p>Selling "crystals" from china, "Huo Shan Liu Li". EXACT SAME PRODUCT in chinatown square or pearl centre, $5.00. NTI price? $100 plus per piece. FAIL</p>
              <p>NTI people will know this. MOURINTON COUNTRY CLUB. Poker tournament? I think he would have had better luck setting up a table in geylang lor 9. FAIL</p>
              <p>Why did NTI MLM suddenly become "investment" plan? I suspect that was a knee jerk response to the other scam Swisscash that now disappeared already. Probably they were losing people to this "investment" plan, thats why they have to repackage their scheme and offer higher returns than them to attract "investors". But end up all people invest in invisible things also, all the things that never manifest, so now running out of money already.</p>
              <p>SE. Enough Said. FAILURE IMMINENT</p>
              <p>With this kind of track record, still boasting that he is better than Warren Buffet?</p>
              <p>Jackie Hoo, left NUS (or maybe expelled?) to follow him, setting an example to many young people to defy their parents and leave school to follow him, Doesn't he feel guilty?</p>
              <p>Kids are GIVING up their education in poly and NUS, and WASTING their parents hard-earned money in these SCHEMES. Irreparable HARM is being done to these young people who will eventually realise they are caught in a spiral because they HAVE no education and in the end no job prospects so will have to be like MLM zombies jumping from one scheme to the next.</p>
