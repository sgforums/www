            <div class='col-md body'>For 19th February<br><br><strong>Know A Hawk From A Handsaw</strong><br><br>When Shakespeare was searching for a way to have Hamlet tell people that he wasnt a fool and that he indeed knew what he was talking about, he gave Hamlet these words to say (Hamlet II,2). Here we have Teddy using the same words to say somethin gabout his uncle. "He's the smartest man in the world. If anyone knows a hawk from a handsaw, Uncle Felix does."</div>

I guess thats why someone once said that laughter is contagious. Therefore, when someone is in a happy,cheerful mood, people like being with him. Thats the meaning behind laugh and the world laughs with you. The complete saying is this: laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Least Said, Soonest Forgotten</strong><br><br>After making a mistake, saying or doing the wrong thing or, perhaps, embarrassing ourselves or others in some way we tend to think and worry about it - and we might apologize for it over and over. Usually least said, soonest forgotten. That is, less we say about it the sooner the incident will be forgotten.</div>
