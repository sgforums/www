              <p>no difference actually,means the same thing,some prefer the term mlm some prefer saying nm,both market through a network,through referrals and build levels down,both with products or service,but if no product or service than it would be a pyramid scheme</p>

              <p>pyramid is when u're paid if u recruit ppl under u without any form of product sales involved.</p>
              <p>mlm/network marketing is legal by law AS LONG AS there's sales transaction is BASED ON A SALE OF PRODUCT!!</p>
              <p>[As amended in Singapore Civil Law in Year 2000], but it wasn't being shown in big govt company thus giving young guys/public serveants false impression of mlm is still ill-legal by law since it wasn't mention in the directive.</p>
              <p>I will not mention the exact govt company, if you catch the hint, good, if you don't slowly guess to cover and protect myself.</p>
