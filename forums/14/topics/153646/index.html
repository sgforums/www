            <div class='col-md body'>The amount of investment is too high $12,000 for a count. They told u to follow their system 221 and within 3 months can earn 5 figures. But if you can get 2 , 2 and 1 partner to join each month respectively, if your downline can't even get 1, u still never earn 5 figures. Is very difficult to get a business partner.<br><br>Firstly, they will give u a book to read "rich dad poor dad", try to phyco u not to work for people and be your own boss. They will say that mlm is the fastest and the only way for the poor like us to be rich. This is a only way to generate passive income. But what I think is that passive income is the income that coming in without spending any time on doing any work. But it is not true for them. Even if you r a duke, if you never work hard, u will get whatever u deserve. U got so many downline's downline's downline that u need to take care of. I think is getting more and more tougher, spending more and more time on it inorder for u to survive.<br><br>Some of them have joined a year and they can only get 1 downline. Which means that their annual income is about $5k to $7k...<br><br>Alot of people stuck there and some even can't get any downline at all. So it is a very expensive investment. You must consider properly before joining them.</div>

I do not know which big group you are referring to because I know there are 3 main groups in the company itself. Thus I don't really understand y you would say there are so many counts.<br><br>It seems the investment is hefty for a newcomer to join as a count, which is highly encouraged.

They also target traditional businessmen as far as I am informed.<br><br>Oh btw which products did u use? I won't really say their products are ineffective or what...well some are quite good. Oh well.. the question regarding products are really subjective. What works for someone may not work that well for another.<br><br>My main concern is that the entry level for a count is hefty for an average joe.<br><br>Their argument is that while most mlms concentrate on selling products, their selling point is encouraging people to start off as a count by investment to earn huge profits and enjoy huge discounts or retail profits.<br><br>In other words,my opinion is that they are recruitment-driven. Nothing's wrong with that, i feel that it's just sort of against conventional mlm way of business whereby people start from a noob and build their network to rise in a mlm company hierachy, not from a rank (which you buy/invest) that you start off.<br><br>Well what do you think?<br><br>Jus my two cents worth of thought. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everybody, Im new in this forum but I do concern about Belair.<br><br>I want to ask more about schemes of Bel Air if anyone happened to know about it? It is like first time I have to pay 1k to join as a lowest entry fee, rite? Or I can choose to become a Count and pay 12k, or I can choose to become a Marquise and pay 80k. But the point is what are the priviledges to become a Count or Marquis? Will I get a difference in discount/comission or something?<br><br>By the way I heard that becoming a Marquis that means you are a shareholder of the company. So what shareholder means in this case? Is it like in stock you will get quarter payment based on % of stock volume you are holding?<br><br>Oh Im so noob, please help me out. Thanks in advance.</div>

Once u invested in it u mus make sure u are really interested in the biz not becos of a spur of a moment or due to emotional reasons.<br><br>As far as i know, the more u invest the more discounts and overriding commissions u can get.<br><br>Yes the marquis status is important as u do get some bonuses based on the global sales turnover.<br><br>But pls, before u join, u mus make sure u are responsible to the people u are pulling in becos u are going in an investment scheme..and not evryone is rich with 10plus K..some ppl live in debts borrowing from other ppl.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

Besides different marquises have different levels of income and depends on the individual marquis work performance.<br><br>Therefore i think it's kind of a useless question if he tells u that he earns a lot..cos evry top distributor from every co. will tell u that he earns a lot.

I just want to ask that do you know any real figures about the money a Marquis receive from that payout so far? For example, last time a Marquis X received $10,000 from the global company's income.<br><br>The point is I just wonder how high the payout will be comparing to the investment 80k. Any ideas?<br></div></blockquote>Im sure the company pays a much lesser than 50% of their global turnover to all the Marquises in the world.<br><br>Yes, I heard of Marquises earning an extra 10-20k frm global bonuses although I have not seen it myself. Im not sure how true this is.<br><br>Regarding the 80K issue i think it is a challenging-Marquis position..hence u are still not qualified to get the global bonus. As a challenging Marquis u are much like a count unless u r promoted to a Marquis that's a different story becos u get higher overriding commissions etc.</div>

If you invest 80k into Bel Air to jump into the Marquis position. You are just like much a Count but earning 10-20k global bonus extra. So you have to recruit like any Counts and build up your network like them, rite? So in my opinion, paying to be a Marquis is not a smart investment at all while you have to incur a high risk if you dont know anything about how much the company paying for you per year on average as a Marquis. But if you know it is exactly, for example, 20k/year, well you can consider about this.<br><br>But I am afraid that that gobal bonus will be reduced each year because the more recruiting the more wannabe Marquis. Therefore, the global bonus just is high only in the first few years. Maybe next year it's reduced to 10k/year and the year after it will be 8k/year, who knows? Any ideas?</div>

U pay 80k but u are still a count altho the route to marquis is shortened.<br><br>As for how much a Marquis earns it really depends on the individual performance of the marquis. And it's not like when u are a marquis u will comfirm get the money 2 times per year. I heard u still have to clock some sales. So there's always a catch.</div>
