            <div class='col-md body'>i beg to differ<br>people might consider it a meeting of minds, chemistry, gut instinct etc<br>i think it's more to do with the propensity to stop thinking of each other as 2 individual entities sharing a common pleasure or goal, but as 2 people as one.<br>About letting go of fear to achieve happiness<br>Fear of rejection, betrayal, indifference and infidelity.<br>And total trust in each other and the honesty that counter balances that trust as well as eliminating the fear.<br><br>And THE ONE is what you make of it. IMO, love is not about hanging on or being comfortable with a person or worse of all being in the relationship for the sake of the other person.

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not know, too.  Are normal hearts capable of staying true no matter what and so hold on to love when there is nothing to hold on to or many feel the temptation sooner or later.<br><br>After a while, one changes.  What used to be enough may seem inadequate.  That which used to be tolerable might prove killing.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MayaJade,<br><br>Sometimes, I doubt that normal hearts are capable of staying true. Sometimes, I look at myself and wonder why my past r/s fails Sometimes, I wonder why I am still travelling alone and be envious about the people around me who are already attached or married...<br><br>Yet I still believe in true love, no matter how sometimes these feelings of depression, sorrows and fear could creep into my heart and sadden me. I wish that I could have the day where my ex-gfs come back to me and start it over again. But the saying goes, somethings which are broken can never be mended back again... Maybe I just decide that I should leave it behind....<br><br>Nevermind, just some thoughts.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal, don't be sadden by your failing relatinship. You don't have to envy others. I think that the reason why we are alone are inside ourselves.<br><br>From my point of view, it's more like we are not ready to look into the same direction of the other party.  thus, we tend to change and look at the ugly side of the relationship and this is where we start to drift.<br><br>true love is great but how many examples could be found in our society.  We are jus too relistic about too many things.  I think in our society, our focus is not love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not believe the "meant to be" is a love at first sight kind of thing..although perhaps in rare cases, so do not bet on it.<br><br>Rather, you will know if it is "meant to be" thru' a simple experience. Let's say you know this person and has been in communication for a period of time, say half a year or more on a regular basis and suddenly the person "disappears" for one two days, maybe work related (or purposely), you will feel panicky and keep wanting to call. Then you know the person is "meant to be".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It all depends on something called gut instinct or feelings or whatever it is,but how does the gut instinct tells you that is a different matter altogether as there is no hard and fast rule,some more,nothing is confirmed in this world.You gut instinct or whatever may tell you this is the one now,but later on,it may tell you a different story altogether.so just trust your instincts cause when you know the person is to be,you will know it by omne way or another</div>
