              <p>occupation or not, i tink 99.9999999999% of them are just naive kids.. they dun even pass their o-lvl and ppl are trying to tell them they can start a biz without capital, or maybe some with little capital.those talking abt "little capital", is not little at all.. is actually a huge amt to the kids...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>0.0000000001% are adults who give up their high positions in banks that gives them a secured and stable income every mth. I know of some one who used hold a very high position in a particular bank n he was earning big in office itself. including he's invest, he was earning an income no one can imagine. then, he went into MLM and quit he's bank job, sold some of he's investment. now, he can hardly pay for he's CC.</p>

              <p>occupation or not, i tink 99.9999999999% of them are just naive
              kids.. they dun even pass their o-lvl and ppl are trying to tell
              them they can start a biz without capital, or maybe some with
              little capital.those talking abt "little capital", is not little at
              all.. is actually a huge amt to the kids...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>0.0000000001% are adults who give up their high positions
              in banks that gives them a secured and stable income every mth. I
              know of some one who used hold a very high position in a particular
              bank n he was earning big in office itself. including he's invest,
              he was earning an income no one can imagine. then, he went into MLM
              and quit he's bank job, sold some of he's investment. now, he can
              hardly pay for he's CC.</p>

              <p>I think that is one of the reason MLM is getting a bad rep... according to the e-book "7 Greatest lies of network marketing" is that not everyone is cut out for MLM... People, rather that chose people who can actually work, they chose people randomly who hopefully can work... As a result, majority who are unable to produce resulty feel upset and say MLM is full of empty promises when infact you need to work hard just like a real businessman b4 you get to see any results...</p>
              <p>Another contributing factor is MLM's bad rep is undesirable products... Some products are just doomed to fail in Singapore but they still try to market it anyway... and when people have a hard time sell them, they lose hope and give up easily...</p>
              <p>Last but ultimately main reason why MLM is getting such a bad rep is that people have been cheated b4 by scam companies discuised as MLM... People have to learn that MLM =/= scam... Just link muslims and terrorism... Just because some misguided muslims become terrorist doesn't mean all muslims are terrorist... If all MLM companies are scam, then we can no longer believe in the words of Donald Trump and Robert Kiyosaki...</p>

              <p>given the right circumstances any business can succeed and allow you to earn the money back right away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"usually" or "traditionally" when it comes to sales, the idea is the boss comes up with the idea and money and the staff puts in effort and takes a cut depending on the conditions but the basic structure of a MLM allow the ones on top of you to take a cut whenever you make a sale, that would naturally make anyone apprehensive, not to mention now its the "staff" who are providing the capital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from experience, in S'pore once you understand the idea that you make money as you sell, you start trying to sell more, friends, relatives and so on. there were at least a couple of guys i knew who were forced to enter an MLM and brought their products(a few hundred dollars worth of slimming pills) to sell by their own friends. how many of these people do you think would have a good impression of MLMs?</p>
