Not to be just getting emotional over it to get back at the company.<br><br>Everyone will try to stand-by their beliefs in his/her own MLM company but why flame on one another?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MLM is good, and can even make u F**king rich, notice I use the F word. It's the ultimate complement. The tricky thing alot of ppl dont not see in dealing with mlm is this. MLM companies may have little overhead costs, which also means, they have little barrier to entry, therefore it's like bubble tea effect. you can make alot of money in mlm, but what happens is, alot of ppl also can do mlm, and when u have alot of ppl doing it, your profit margin and market become smaller. What's more you are already competing with thousands of products out there selling in retail shops, such as health and skincare products. It's not an ezy business.... think twice b4 u jump into it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the say it's working as a team, but essentially, there's still competition - fierce ones.<br><br>Let's say max 2 levels down. So any one 3 levels below or above is actually in direct competition. There's still competition within 3 levels up/down, just that it's let's obvious; guy 2 levels down still competing with the one just above you, thus the guy above you still in competition for your income from guy 2 levels down.<br><br>Anyway, I think it's crap to compare normal corporates with MLM. MLM is just a subset of it only. If everyone in company MLMers, then who's in charge of production, R&amp;D, accounting, finance, etc?<br><br>The argument by <a href="http://www.mlm.ch" rel="nofollow">www.mlm.ch</a> about leveraging other people's efforts is pure nonsense. In normal corpoations, the reason why people at the top earn more is because they leverage people's efforts so they themselves can do more productive work(supervisor, manager, etc), and hence earn more. Afterall, pple with the calibre to be CEO should not be purely involved in cleaning toilets, acting as salesmen(they do that only to motivate workers), doing admin work, respectively, when he has more essential/productive things to do. In MLM, essentially people from all levels are salesmen. So how is the one above be doing more productive work by leveraging others' efforts and hence deserve to earn more? There's still this loophole that he could do little work, and yet earn from his downline's efforts. How is this fair?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to lifeline post and to add on to leddy's ones<br><br>There is one quite big flaw i see.<br><br>If lifeline chooses to only select and recruit only qualified people to join his network, and his downlines choose to do the same thing, the end losers will be the downlines.<br><br>Look, seriously, there is only a limited number of people who fits in your criteria. To top it off, its impossible to go find them all into your network.<br><br>You may have qualified and well trained downlines whom you leverage your income on, assuming your company is a legal one, and that the income are from your own sales and your downlines' sales as well.<br><br>But when the downlines find that they have dwindling number of people whom they can leverage their income on, to who they turn to?<br><br>We all know this, without continual recruitment, the fundamentals of MLM fails. Lifeline could have his network plus his own sales to depend on, while his downlines could only depend on sales alone, without the power of leverage.<br><br>Now, isnt such scheme stupendously unfair to your downlines? Your quest for quality people is understandable, but it may come at costs to your downlines.<br><br>and lifeline have not answered my question. many of us have regard ms jane's company as a scam, with some victims already crying out for refunds which they could not possibly get back. is lifeline actually supporting such scheme? and we all noe what ms jane is here for after the brouhaha over those topics.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all ,<br><br>I used to think that MLM is a Pyramid scam too. However i took up one of their products  when my friend persistently promoted it to me and it worked very well for the effects.<br><br>My mum was suffering from thyroid and Hormone disorders and the product help her recover over a one year period. I'm happy that I dont have to pay Hospitals and their crap thousands/hundreds of dollars bills for stupid Doctor's scribbles on pieces of paper.<br><br>For people who didnt know what you are paying for the inferior junk food and health supplements Hospitals are selling you overpriced for, go ahead and ignore MLM products , (of coz not all MLM products are effective) which is why that many <strong>SCAM</strong> MLM companies have failed. Which is why i also understand its difficult for many to succeed in convincing people about buying a Quality MLM product.<br><br>However life's a challenge to succeed and the challenge is about how well you sell your services , as a paid employee, or an entreprenuer who dares to be challenged and face your own sales.<br></div>
