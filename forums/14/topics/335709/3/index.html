              <p>hi guys seems like a pretty heated conversation. well ill begin
              introducing myself first, im indeed a member of lfi. but if you are
              wondering if i am a brain washed member, i highly doubt so tho.</p>
              <p>well i do want to make a point. i agree that imu- 6 cannot cure
              or treat cancer. but i do know for a fact that the national cancer
              foundation is using Bovine colostrum ( note i did not say imu-6 due
              to my best of knowledge they are using a different kind of bovine
              colostrum ). whilst bovine colostrum cannot treat/cure cancer its
              know to slow down the development of cancer. my further research on
              the ingredient has revealed that bovine colostrum has also the
              ability to prevent formation of cancerous cells though.</p>
              <p>personally, i practise muay thai. i must admit that using imu- 6
              does improve my overal stamina and muscle recovery as stated from
              my research. i do a fair bit of conditioning hence forth muscle
              recovery is important to me too.</p>

              <p>Well, I think there's something about the leading product, PDMB... I tried it for a month, made me crapped like there's no tomorrow... :(  Was a really painful experience... Needles to say, my everyday schedules were all ruined because I will have to tend to the sudden bowel impulses aggravated by the "diarrhea-inducing" capsule. This is no funny when there's a marathon coming and whenever you train, the "crisis" surfaces... Hmm, also, I read the fine prints on the bottle... Seems like it was supposed to be a "wonder pill" cause it treats almost anything.. yet, the subsequent finer prints says, "If symptoms persists, please consult your doctor." ... Hmmm... I wonder why...</p>
              <p>I have some friends from LFI and apparently, some of them were of excellent academic backgrounds... Well, long story short, they have decided to change their career route; deferring their degrees so that they can "strike when the iron is still hot"... Sigh... I don't know... They tried to rope me in on this opportunity with attractive overseas trips, promotion seminars and of course with the typical late night "motivational" talks at the company...</p>
              <p>Oh well, what can I say... :s</p>
