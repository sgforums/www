              <p>Well lets just say the people who started flaming are just not cut out to be a business minded individual.</p>
              <p>If you want to criticise, do it constructively. Flaming doesnt help.</p>
              <p>The barrier of entry is low for mlm. Anyone can join. Without a proper education system, there will be people who "cheat" their friends to join. It is not for everyone.</p>
              <p>Similar to the insurance or property industry, there are black sheeps out there as well. However having a bad experience with mlmer doesnt mean that the company is bad.</p>
              <p>You just have to open your eyes and see whether the team and company is suitable for you anot. Understand more about the system first before jumping in. We all have spend more than 10 years learning in school just to come out to work with the hope of earning a comfortable income.</p>
              <p>So it is highly unlikely you will survive in a mlm business if you didnt take the time to learn and understand it.</p>
              <p>If you join and fail to make it, then you have no one to blame but yourself. No use blaming the whole galaxy.</p>
              <p>I have join an mlm before but no progress. That is because i didnt put in enough effort to expand it. But the knowledge you can learn from people in mlm is priceless.</p>
              <p>Learn from the best and you will be the best.</p>

              <p>last time - people never eat health product, pollution's normal, genetically modified food level none, stress level low - average mortality age: 90</p>
              <p>now - people eat health product (1-5 variations), pollution's normal-high, genetically modified food high, stress level high - average mortality age: 75</p>
              <p>next time - people HEAVILY CONSUMED health product (20-50 variations), pollution's high. genetically modified food high, stress level extreme - average mortality age: 45</p>
              <p>this might be a joke to you my friend, but hope it reflects what is the issue around you causing problems.</p>
              <p>sadly, scientified research 95% of the health products we consumed, we don't even absorbed bloody 1%. it's either over saturated or our body can't take that much.</p>

              <p>Last time can live till age 90? Maybe if you are just talking about a few cases. But if you look at the average statistic, the lifespan is increasing.</p>
              <p>Now where did you get all this infomation? Does it have any statistic to proof?</p>
              <p>If you relates this to health product, then i think you need to reconsidered. Obviously it is the day to day thing we consume anf the environment that is affecting us. If you relates it to health product as the main cause, i think you have overlook plenty of areas.</p>

              <p>Because they like to overcharge. Many online shops here import protein powders and sell at a very cheap price direct to customers as compared to GNC's overcharging as well.</p>
              <p>There's no way MLM can beat these online shops' prices simply because they will have to pay multiple downlines. These online shops have no such restrictions. If MLMs can beat the prices with quality products, immediately they will be flooded with purchase orders from fitness enthusiasts all over Singapore who are always seeking for cheaper , yet good quality sources.</p>
              <p>Thus, MLMs will not bring in protein powders.</p>

              <p>Because they like to overcharge. Many online shops here import
                      protein powders and sell at a very cheap price direct to customers
                      as compared to GNC's overcharging as well.</p>
              <p>There's no way MLM can beat these online shops' prices simply
                      because they will have to pay multiple downlines. These online
                      shops have no such restrictions. If MLMs can beat the prices with
                      quality products, immediately they will be flooded with purchase
                      orders from fitness enthusiasts all over Singapore who are always
                      seeking for cheaper , yet good quality sources.</p>
              <p>Thus, MLMs will not bring in protein powders.</p>

              <p>Haha. I see  what you mean. Yes, these powder can be bought online at a cheaper price. I also buy it online.</p>
              <p>I guess it is up to the consumer to judge whether the price is affordable and it's up to the sales person to convince them.</p>

              <p> Good for you. Other MLMers that came here so far are not at all
                                          what you said... At least you are one of those who sound more
                                          practical and down to earth so far.</p>

              <p> I'll take that as a compliment. Thx.</p>
              <p>I think they are eager to convince the non- believer about something that is good and beneficial. This perhaps lead them to become somewhat emotional.</p>
              <p>Just like how you guys try ways to convince us that it doesn't work. It all boils down to what is the intention.</p>
              <p> So when i tried to stand at your point of view, the intention is to stop us from been cheated or been lied to.</p>
              <p>I have learnt to look at things from different angles to have a better assessment of the whole situation.</p>
