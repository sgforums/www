              <p>Hi guys i happen to found this topic and i would like to share my piece...</p>
              <p>I am a singapore businessman in bangkok but i think Multi level marketing is indeed a way to earn big money using small amount of capital. There are alot of money earning methods out there and all of them comes with a certain amount of risks. The question lies with how much risk does one willing to take? If you are willing to open a shop selling something you think will earn you big money, then i'm sure putting 10 to 50k to start up is not a problem to you. Just like all the shop owners and conventional businessmen out there, they are willing to take the risk. But is that consider a scam? Not really coz thats what normal conventional business is all about, yet by doing this does not gaurentee big money while it will take up alot of your time and definately alot of hard work involve. If the money starts coming in then perhapes the hardwork do pay off but what if it doesn't? Then your capital will all be gone and if you are lucky enough maybe you just lost everything you start up and not owing more to the banks. Multi level marketing is a way for people to learn while earning, It reaches out to people who wants to earn like a businessman but could not afford the time and money. What it does is actually using the power of leveraging. By spending only a couple of hours a day, you will not be able to earn alot of money unless you can leverage on other peoples time. Only then can your 2 hours daily become 10 hours daily. Successful businessmen understand the power of leveraging and has use that to make them more successful. Henry ford, Bill gates and even Dennis wee are just some of the people using this method. If they were to do everything themselve thn there is no way they are who they are now. If you are somebody who wants to make big money but do not have big capital and yet understand the power of leveraging, multi level marketing i the way to go. Please understand that nothing comes for free or in this case comes easy. some of the MLM people will tell you its not hard to achieve it or very easy to be successful, they are only half correct. It is very easy coz there are very fast cases and people in all trades tends to use the fastest and easiest example to sell you. But it also requires alot of hard work and effort. Lets be honest, after so many years in this world, do you guys really still thinks everything comes for free??? Ask yourself this question, if you are willing to spend 10 to 50k and commit 10 to 12 hours everyday on your convectional business with no gaurentees, why is it different when it comes to MLM? In actual fact when it comes to MLM it is much easier because they only require 2 to 3 hours of your time in comparison. People always tend to think money should come fast and easy in MLM but thats not true. Only money scam do that, a normal MLM company will not be like that. Its all about learning how to be a businessman then you will start earning. With only a small start up, you are able to do this business without the worries of rental, advertising, overheads, stocks and etc i think it is worth the trying. I do encourage people with skeptisim in MLM to look at the models with an open mind and decide for yourselve if its worth doing and not rejecting it without a proper thought. For those of you who think MLM is hard and would like to try conventional business, my advice is don't bother coz you will fail. To me, MLM and normal business is the same but only its cheaper and uses less time. so if you cannot even make it with more advantage, then why do you think you stand a better chance in the normal business world?</p>

              <p>To me MLM is learning to be more like a salesman than a businessman. Not every one can do business in this world and not everyone should do it. MLM is a so called low start up "Business" scheme, which thus attracts anyone who have that initial start up cash. That is why MLM have different results. People who should not do business, would be conveniently pulled in because of this low start up "business scheme".</p>
              <p>Till date, I am still figuring why can't people just get a job and work? If one wants to upgrade him or herself, by going courses and changing jobs for better prospect why not? Why must they turn to MLM? No one likes to work forever, because there is no very beautiful prospect in working forever unless you are highly paid. This is where MLM comes in, as the MLMers paint you a picture of how your life will be better when you succeed. The key word here is when you succeed, which 95% don't.</p>
              <p>MLM is like buying lottery to me. When you strike, you will say lottery works for you. Thus, you will encourage people to buy more lottery, but think of how many people who did not strike. Conventional business like opening a stall, is easily described as if you make it, you earn. If you dont, you lose money. But for MLM, perhaps one can argue if you don't make it, you lose less. It is true, but how many would stop there? Some might turn to another MLM company, pay another couple of thousands? Some might become desperate and resort to distorting the truth? You might lose friends and trust as most are skeptical towards MLM?</p>
              <p>How about the people who lose 50K in opening a conventional business? Not many would and have the money to invest another 50 or 100K to prove that their business works. That relates back to what i was wondering, why can't we just stick to our jobs, if we have, and just work? All these mentioned would not have happen, though I agree there are still other problems faced by people who just choose to work only. <strong>My point again is, not many are cut up to do business and should not do business.</strong> <strong>Who would not want a better life? Hence, lets hope that this desire, will not lead you to do things you should not do (like business). Perhaps, by just working would be the best solution for your life. </strong></p>

              <p>MLM a.k.a Networking/ Network Maketing is a biz which is open for everyone who wan to achieve their derams/ goals in life. Morever it is abut to let them control their life and not work control their life. IT is a life time biz once you succeed. It really need a strong foundation for everyone to success. As long as you are keen to learn, success will find you when you learn and do what your upline to you to.</p>
              <p>I join LFT recently and they issue me an Marketing book for me to know more about MLM and related issues. I recommend everyone to find out more about networking and IS NOT PYRAMIND SCAMS like money throw money biz.</p>

              <p>You are haf correct abt MLM, some companies do seems like training people to be a salesman, but in actual fact its part n parcel of doing business. When you start a small business, you would do the selling too. But ultimately when you are in a better position  (like more sales or can hired salesman) then its about managing which in MLM it also teaches you that. People in MLM will never be able to succeed just by selling alone. You need to learn to manage when you have your own network and that is more important then selling... About people should just work, too bad most people dun think tat way. Just like most people still choose to gamble even thugh they know it will never make them rich but will kill them instead. I believe people have their own choice on what they wanna do and MLM is just another option for them to consider. But i do advise people who wants to join MLM not to think it as a get rich quick thing and treat it like an education on what to expect if you want to do business. Only when you understand it then you can start earning....</p>

              <p>I agree with you that its not a quick rich thing. But i feel that it is usually portrayed as a quick rich scheme by new agents, desperate agents, and also dishonest agents who want to earn the downline's share.</p>
              <p>To the part on managing salesman, not many people reach that stage. However, I think that most importantly, perhaps shouldn't ask friends to be your downline or family. Unless you can find a friend who share the desire and not afraid to fall, then you could consider him. Alot of people usually ask their friends, and friends (some) join based on trust. In the end, someone made a wrong move or cannot make quota, thats it. The chain is going to break.</p>
              <p>But then again, the thing I'm quite unhappy with MLMs is, it seems like people are not speaking the truth. They want to convince you to join, so they will paint very beautiful pictures of what should happen, but in the end they usually dont. And if you fail, they will say you did not work hard enough or you give up very easily. From a very nice picture and partnership, you soon get disagreements and unfulfilled desires. Thats what I feel...</p>

              <p>To rhappy86:</p>
              <p>This is where i would like people to understand, i agree that all MLM agents will always paint the most beautiful picture in order to close you. But isn't all things are like that too? When you buy an insurance policy, the agent will emphasize alot on the money you'll get after you finish your bonds or the coverage you'll recieve, he'll make it sound that paying $200 every month for 20 years is not really a far fetch committment but in actual fact it is. When a car sales man tries to sell you the car, he will emphasize alot on how good this car is and considering the cheap price how worth it if you purchase now. Yet he will try to minimise informing you about the loan interest plus taxes and insurance and fuel consumption divided to every month installment. Even when you go for an interview for a job, they will tell you how big their company are or gonna be soon and by working with them you will have a bright future if you are diligent. Thats just the way things are in our everyday lives and yet we choose what to believe. It is important to ask questions and judge for yourself if MLM is viable for you and if you choose to do it, be prepare for the tough part. Consider being successful fast in MLM as a bonus and if its slow take it as a norm so as not to dissapoint yourself. In every jobs and opportunities, there is never a short cut or easy way out, it will always have its fair share of hardship. The question you need to ask yourself is if its worth it at the end of the road. I get friends telling me all these years that theres a much easier way to earn big money but sadly they are still the same or worst. People always wants the easiest way out but never ask themselve what makes them so special? The pot of gold at the end of the road will always be long and bumpy. But are you ready for it?</p>

              <p>Hi. I RECOMMEND everyone to stay away from LFI. Their distributors are not honest! They only want to earn your money. I brough some products from LFI and they told me that if I am leaving LFI I will not be able to get my product back. I had give them a warning that I will report to the police if they continued to be so dishonest. Trust me. Stay away. Stay as far as you can. They just do not bother to help you. They will use all kinds of means to make you stay. I already told my friend to stay away and spread the negative.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This kind of distributors will not have a bright future and their group members will leave them soon. They are just those bastard that using the wrong skills for MLM. That is not the right way to do MLM.</p>

              There's no way i could change the bad impressions you guys had of LFI and in whichever network you belong to in LFI.
              
              
              
              But as for me, i do had my down period and my network are the ones who brought me back. 
              
              
              
              If you guys have the mindset that they are out to cheat your money, then thats the way its gonna be. I do know that there are some agents who uses mean ways to get their PVs up, but my network, we don't concerntrate on the accumulations of PVs. This is after-all a human business, where feelings and thoughts are counted and appreciated. 
              
              
              
              We share our hardship and figure out ways to help each other. We always had makan outings and sharing sessions where we have our directors listening to our problems and they would suggests ways or alternative to counter our problems.
              
              
              
              Its always fun being there,being around them. They are more than just business partners, they became part of my family. (:

              <p>Just my point of view..</p>
              <p>Alot of people esp Singaporeans are without doubt very skeptical about MLM or networking marketing. I myself am involved in this business. But no matter what I always believe people like me do not have the rights to "counter" back at those who are flaming at this trade, because we are the ones that believe that this will work out somehow, while some don't. If we act aggressive against these people, it'll just look bad on us.</p>
              <p>Whether you regard this trade as sales or business or scam. If there's a way to earn money, a system to follow to be exact, it all depends on one to whether he/she is willing to take up this risk and start doing it.</p>
              <p>I don't mind anyone around me saying negative things about the trade I am in now, it's me that believe this trade will work for me. "Countering" back at them doesn't only spoils relationships but also spoils the image of this trade. But if they are willing to give it a chance and listen to how it actually works, I am very willing to let them know. Whether they intend to start doing or not, it's totally up to them.</p>
              <p>After all, I really hope people like me can leave a good impression for the rest out there.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>    I myself is not in LFI but I have dabble in MLM in the past. There is no sure honest way to make money, even if you go shopping at a shopping centre, the sales staff may also give empty promises to entice shoppers to purchase(Eg, Sim Lim Square).</p>
              <p>As consumers of products it is important that when we buy the products, it is because we would want the product and not be entice by empty promises.</p>
              <p>MLM or network marketing is just another strategy employ by the company to push sales, however I notice that many new agents or so call distributors then to forget that they are selling the product and instead concentrate on building their downline.</p>
              <p>There is no hard and fast rule to success in MLM, but for a product base company, networkers should also concentrate on educate their consumers on how to use the product instead of just saying that their products are good and their competitors products are not that fantastic.</p>
              <p>By building on a steady consumer base, then you will the means to sustain a long battle in the network marketing business.</p>
              <p>Just my simple thoughts.</p>

              <p>YOU YOURSELF lack ethics and the proper training of a genuine sales agent as a general MLM distributor</p>
