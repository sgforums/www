              <p>I found a website that said this:</p>
              <p>The consumer needs to be aware that the benefits of colostrum –particularly in specific disease states like arthritis- have not been proven to be effective in large controlled studies. Almost all the studies have been small and uncontrolled. In addition, many of the supporting pieces of evidence on websites touting the benefits of colostrum are testimonials. <br></p>
              <p>Although colostrums is theoretically promising, it needs more good quality research behind it before it becomes accepted. This isn’t to say that it isn’t effective. It may well be as good as all the claims say it is. Unfortunately, when statements are made about a product that are too good and that the substance can cure everything, I think it pays to be skeptical.</p>
              <p>from <a href="http://www.arthritis-treatment-and-relief.com/colostrum-and-arthritis.html">http://www.arthritis-treatment-and-relief.com/colostrum-and-arthritis.html</a> 2nd and 3rd last paragraph.</p>
              <p> </p>

              when you claim more stuff in future, you could provide with more

              <p>Ahhh... but those are simple taking immunoglobins in its raw form...</p>
              <p>colostrum however is not pure immuniglobins... Colostrum in its pure state can actually regulate over active immune cells that causes autoimmune diseases <a href="http://www.carttonic.com/files/file_download.php?fi_id=688">http://www.carttonic.com/files/file_download.php?fi_id=688</a></p>

              <p>hi guys seems like a pretty heated conversation. well ill begin introducing myself first, im indeed a member of lfi. but if you are wondering if i am a brain washed member, i highly doubt so tho.</p>
              <p>well i do want to make a point. i agree that imu- 6 cannot cure or treat cancer. but i do know for a fact that the national cancer foundation is using Bovine colostrum ( note i did not say imu-6 due to my best of knowledge they are using a different kind of bovine colostrum ). whilst bovine colostrum cannot treat/cure cancer its know to slow down the development of cancer. my further research on the ingredient has revealed that bovine colostrum has also the ability to prevent formation of cancerous cells though.</p>
              <p>personally, i practise muay thai. i must admit that using imu- 6 does improve my overal stamina and muscle recovery as stated from my research. i do a fair bit of conditioning hence forth muscle recovery is important to me too.</p>
              <p>Last i do hope that i have contributed something of substantial value to this topic thankyou</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi guys, sorry for dissappearing for a while... my day job had
              something on...</p>
              <p>Anyway, after discussing with some of the directors and my
              network, and getting feedback from some of the threads, I've
              decided that even though sales is important, sharing is even more
              important... After all, its call Network Marketing, not Network
              Sales for a reason...</p>
              <p>Currently, I'm working for a company called LFI which deals with
              Health and Wellness.</p>
              <p>Here's the website: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lfintlgroup.com/index_intl.html">http://www.lfintlgroup.com/index_intl.html</a></p>
              <p>In the website, you can see that LFI deals with Traditional
              Chinese Medicine in Long Far, health care and derma care in
              Labratory Formula, Linac Fusion deals with future tech health care
              and Luxury Finesse will be coming soon once we finished building
              our chain of spas.</p>
              <p>To say LFI as a Network Marketing company would be inaccurat
              because it is more of a hybrid company. Other than Network
              Marketing, we have business partners which retail our products
              which are Guardian and GNC.</p>
              <p>We also have celebrity endorsement, which you may have seen
              somewhere...</p>
              <p><img src="http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p301/MohamedF/Business/Marcus800.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><img src="http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p301/MohamedF/Business/Vincent800.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other than health, we also deal in beauty with our Derma care
              series and consumors of our Derma care series are elegible to enter
              out beauty pagent held every year.<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lfintlgroup.com/gallery/gallery_sg_20080614.html">http://www.lfintlgroup.com/gallery/gallery_sg_20080614.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But what ultimately attracted me to this company is the fact
              that it helped my mother a lot in terms of health and have
              virtually cured her of artritis through its products and can even
              cure diabeties in the right conditions.</p>
              <p>In accordance to forum rule, I am not allowed to advertise our
              product... but if some ask about our product, I am allowed to
              answer him/her...</p>

              <p>Well, maybe I haven't seen the guideline that you mentioned...
              But thanks for putting up this question because it gives me a
              chance to talk about our 2nd star product...</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://lfintlgroup.com/brands/labfor/hc_imu6.html">http://lfintlgroup.com/brands/labfor/hc_imu6.html</a></p>
              <p><img src="http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p301/MohamedF/Business/IMU6.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The reason why IMU6 is our second best selling product and why
              many has come to trust LFI... IMU6 is made out of <span style="color: #ff0000;">100% pure bolvine colostrum</span> extracted
              immidiately within the six hours of a mother cow's calving and
              approved by renound researcher <span style="color: #ff0000;">Doctor
              Anthony Kleinsmith</span></p>
              <p>The benefits of colostrum is definately amazing... Colostrum is
              known as a baby's first food, once a baby is born and exposed to
              the harsh world, nature has provided them with this natural first
              food to increase it's chances of survival. That's why many doctors
              advise mothers to breast feed their babies as soon as
              possible...</p>
              <p>So what's inside colostrum that makes it so special? Colostrum
              is high in natural protein, carbohydrate, NATURAL ANTIBODIES
              (<a title="IgA" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA">IgA</a>, <a title="IgD" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgD">IgD</a>, <a title="IgE" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgE">IgE</a>, <a title="IgG" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgG">IgG</a> and <a title="IgM" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgM">IgM</a>) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">growth factor
              IGF</span>.</p>
              <p>I could list out all the details and benefits but what most
              amazing is the growth factor. The high levels of IGF in colostrum
              promotes growth of new healthy cells and tissue repair.  So,
              by taking colostrum, a diabetic patient can, as long as their
              kidney is not 100% dead, repair their failing kidney.</p>
              <p>Infact, if you have an open would, you can simply apply
              colostrum on the would and it would speed up the healing and left
              no scar behind.</p>
              <p>I, myself have taken IMU6 colostrum and the most notiable thing
              about its benefit was that I had fast muscle recovery after my
              workout. Meaning I don't feel any muscles strains the day after I
              workout. That's why colostrum is also beneficial for sportsmen with
              sports related injuries.</p>
              <p>As for my mother, she had be suffering from arthritis for over 2
              years now and been taking don't know how many doctor's medicine and
              finally asked to go for surgery. But because we can't afford a
              surgery, she decided to live with the pain... That was until I gave
              my mom IMU6 Colostrum capsules and she is no longer arthritic after
              1 month...</p>
              <p>At first I myself was sceptical, but among all the testimonials,
              the one that convinced me that IMU6 works is the one of my
              mother's.</p>
              <p>Other's testimonials: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lfintlgroup.com/exp/exp_imu6.html">http://lfintlgroup.com/exp/exp_imu6.html</a></p>
              <p>So, even if you don't trust <span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr
              Anthony, Vincent Ng, the testimonials, myself or the thousands of
              sites on the internet supporting colostrum</span>, its ok because
              we also have a <span style="color: #0000ff;">qualified doctor in
              our health centre</span> that can give you the proper prescription.
              Infact, many of us when facing with more serious diseases actually
              consulted with the doctor first before selling to the customer.</p>
