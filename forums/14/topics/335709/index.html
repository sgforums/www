              <p>Anyway, after discussing with some of the directors and my network, and getting feedback from some of the threads, I've decided that even though sales is important, sharing is even more important... After all, its call Network Marketing, not Network Sales for a reason...</p>
              <p>Currently, I'm working for a company called LFI which deals with Health and Wellness.</p>

              <p>In the website, you can see that LFI deals with Traditional Chinese Medicine in Long Far, health care and derma care in Labratory Formula, Linac Fusion deals with future tech health care and Luxury Finesse will be coming soon once we finished building our chain of spas.</p>
              <p>To say LFI as a Network Marketing company would be inaccurat because it is more of a hybrid company. Other than Network Marketing, we have business partners which retail our products which are Guardian and GNC.</p>

              <p>The main reason I'm here is to clear the air about some rumors floating about...</p>
              <p>For 1 thing, members only required a S$10/- + 7% GST administration fee to join the company. Then a member have the OPTION to buy a starter kit which is a a full range of our products. No one is required to bu the starter kit but it is advisable to buy it so to fimilarise themselves with the products... You cannot convince someone to play DOTA if you never play dota yourself...</p>
              <p>In adition, all our products are REFUNDABLE as long as they are not used... Details are on the back of the invoices upon purchase...</p>
              <p>I hope this helps...</p>

              <p>Well, maybe I haven't seen the guideline that you mentioned... But thanks for putting up this question because it gives me a chance to talk about our 2nd star product...</p>
              <p><a href="http://lfintlgroup.com/brands/labfor/hc_imu6.html">http://lfintlgroup.com/brands/labfor/hc_imu6.html</a></p>
              <p><img src="http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p301/MohamedF/Business/IMU6.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The reason why IMU6 is our second best selling product and why many has come to trust LFI... IMU6 is made out of <span style="color: #ff0000;">100% pure bolvine colostrum</span> extracted immidiately within the six hours of a mother cow's calving and approved by renound researcher <span style="color: #ff0000;">Doctor Anthony Kleinsmith</span></p>
              <p>The benefits of colostrum is definately amazing... Colostrum is known as a baby's first food, once a baby is born and exposed to the harsh world, nature has provided them with this natural first food to increase it's chances of survival. That's why many doctors advise mothers to breast feed their babies as soon as possible...</p>
              <p>So what's inside colostrum that makes it so special? Colostrum is high in natural protein, carbohydrate, NATURAL ANTIBODIES (<a class="mw-redirect" title="IgA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA">IgA</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="IgD" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgD">IgD</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="IgE" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgE">IgE</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="IgG" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgG">IgG</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="IgM" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgM">IgM</a>) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">growth factor IGF</span>.</p>
              <p>I could list out all the details and benefits but what most amazing is the growth factor. The high levels of IGF in colostrum promotes growth of new healthy cells and tissue repair.  So, by taking colostrum, a diabetic patient can, as long as their kidney is not 100% dead, repair their failing kidney.</p>
              <p>Infact, if you have an open would, you can simply apply colostrum on the would and it would speed up the healing and left no scar behind.</p>
              <p>I, myself have taken IMU6 colostrum and the most notiable thing about its benefit was that I had fast muscle recovery after my workout. Meaning I don't feel any muscles strains the day after I workout. That's why colostrum is also beneficial for sportsmen with sports related injuries.</p>
              <p>As for my mother, she had be suffering from arthritis for over 2 years now and been taking don't know how many doctor's medicine and finally asked to go for surgery. But because we can't afford a surgery, she decided to live with the pain... That was until I gave my mom IMU6 Colostrum capsules and she is no longer arthritic after 1 month...</p>
              <p>At first I myself was sceptical, but among all the testimonials, the one that convinced me that IMU6 works is the one of my mother's.</p>
              <p>Other's testimonials: <a href="http://lfintlgroup.com/exp/exp_imu6.html">http://lfintlgroup.com/exp/exp_imu6.html</a></p>
              <p>So, even if you don't trust <span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr Anthony, Vincent Ng, the testimonials, myself or the thousands of sites on the internet supporting colostrum</span>, its ok because we also have a <span style="color: #0000ff;">qualified doctor in our health centre</span> that can give you the proper prescription. Infact, many of us when facing with more serious diseases actually consulted with the doctor first before selling to the customer.</p>

              <p>Well, maybe I haven't seen the guideline that you mentioned...
              But thanks for putting up this question because it gives me a
              chance to talk about our 2nd star product...</p>
              <p><a href="http://lfintlgroup.com/brands/labfor/hc_imu6.html" rel="nofollow">http://lfintlgroup.com/brands/labfor/hc_imu6.html</a></p>
              <p><img src="http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p301/MohamedF/Business/IMU6.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The reason why IMU6 is our second best selling product and why
              many has come to trust LFI... IMU6 is made out of <span style="color: #ff0000;">100% pure bolvine colostrum</span> extracted
              immidiately within the six hours of a mother cow's calving and
              approved by renound researcher <span style="color: #ff0000;">Doctor
              Anthony Kleinsmith</span></p>
              <p>The benefits of colostrum is definately amazing... Colostrum is
              known as a baby's first food, once a baby is born and exposed to
              the harsh world, nature has provided them with this natural first
              food to increase it's chances of survival. That's why many doctors
              advise mothers to breast feed their babies as soon as
              possible...</p>
              <p>So what's inside colostrum that makes it so special? Colostrum
              is high in natural protein, carbohydrate, NATURAL ANTIBODIES
              (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgA" class="" title="IgA" rel="nofollow">IgA</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgD" class="" title="IgD" rel="nofollow">IgD</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgE" class="" title="IgE" rel="nofollow">IgE</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgG" class="" title="IgG" rel="nofollow">IgG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgM" class="" title="IgM" rel="nofollow">IgM</a>) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">growth factor
              IGF</span>.</p>
              <p>I could list out all the details and benefits but what most
              amazing is the growth factor. The high levels of IGF in colostrum
              promotes growth of new healthy cells and tissue repair.  So,
              by taking colostrum, a diabetic patient can, as long as their
              kidney is not 100% dead, repair their failing kidney.</p>
              <p>Infact, if you have an open would, you can simply apply
              colostrum on the would and it would speed up the healing and left
              no scar behind.</p>
              <p>I, myself have taken IMU6 colostrum and the most notiable thing
              about its benefit was that I had fast muscle recovery after my
              workout. Meaning I don't feel any muscles strains the day after I
              workout. That's why colostrum is also beneficial for sportsmen with
              sports related injuries.</p>
              <p>As for my mother, she had be suffering from arthritis for over 2
              years now and been taking don't know how many doctor's medicine and
              finally asked to go for surgery. But because we can't afford a
              surgery, she decided to live with the pain... That was until I gave
              my mom IMU6 Colostrum capsules and she is no longer arthritic after
              1 month...</p>
              <p>At first I myself was sceptical, but among all the testimonials,
              the one that convinced me that IMU6 works is the one of my
              mother's.</p>
              <p>Other's testimonials: <a href="http://lfintlgroup.com/exp/exp_imu6.html" rel="nofollow">http://lfintlgroup.com/exp/exp_imu6.html</a></p>
              <p>So, even if you don't trust <span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr
              Anthony, Vincent Ng, the testimonials, myself or the thousands of
              sites on the internet supporting colostrum</span>, its ok because
              we also have a <span style="color: #0000ff;">qualified doctor in
              our health centre</span> that can give you the proper prescription.
              Infact, many of us when facing with more serious diseases actually
              consulted with the doctor first before selling to the customer.</p>

              <p><br>Nope. lets put an eg. Lets say cancer. Cymotherapy is a treatment. There is no cure for cancer yet. Means that the cancer can come again. Like VE, they always mention that their so called powder can CURE cancer which is crap. If not, so many people would purchase them.</p>
              <p>Cure arthritis means when consume the product, for sure I will never ever get arthritis pains anymore when I stop consuming the product?</p>

              <p>Its not by magic... And colostrum can treat arthritis to 100% recovery given the right conditions...  like I wrote above... Colostrum have an abundance of growth factor that can regenerate damaged tissues... note: damaged tissues can be healed but dead tissues can't be brought to life...</p>
              <p>a diabetic patient with a 10% working kidney can heal his/her kidney back to 100% working condition but a dead kidney can't be brought back to life...</p>

              <p>Cancer still can't be cured because it's not a disease... its a mutation of your own cells... cymotherapy is still the only known way of killing cancer cells but VE products I've heard can only PREVENT cancer...</p>
              <p>Colostrum can be guarnteed to cure arthritis and, even help people recover from cancer, but it must follow certain conditions set by our nutritionist... some whom have taken our products can feel the difference within 2 weeks, others in 2 months... this is because of the absorbtion of colostrum into the system... if your colon is encrusted, the absorbtion of many nutrients is blocked...</p>
              <p>And yes, people can stop taking colostrum and still won't suffer any more pains, but it depends on your diet and your lifestyle... you chose a healthy diet and lifestyle, you won't get arthritis again...</p>
