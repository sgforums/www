              <p>It's very sad to see how many people out there have mistaken the concept of MLM. Network marketing is a very good platform for those who are serious about earning side income, passive income or just business.</p>
              <p>Many people have made it look like a "scam" and "cheat other's money to earn more money". As a business owner myself, I have many business partners and associates who see MLM as an opportunity and these my friends are Managing Directors even Vice presidents of big MNCs and even one of the renowned international banks, likewise average people see this as a getting rich quick scheme, pity those who try to recruit their friends by making huge promises.</p>
              <p>Network marketing is actually a business model, and normally called "Human Franchise" that is why people need to refer to other people by expanding the franchise via people or recruitment.</p>
              <p>Many people failed due to several reasons, they pay the huge sum of money with an expectation to see huge results in few months. they pay the money and hope to sit down and wait for money to pour in quickly, they have not found out the perfect MLM companies that work for them. Not all MLM companies are made similar, they have different structures.</p>
              <p>Some MLM companies may train you how to prospect and sell their products like a salesman, some companies may train you how to expand their businesses by recruiting more downlines, some companies may train you how to become a businessman and help the company to increase sales volume. So as long as you have found the one that suits your charateristic you'll go for it. All of these require "recruitments" that is why it is called Network Marketing and by all means, people are involved in this business.</p>
              <p>Why pay big bucks to join an MLM company? The same goes for why do you pay big bucks to pay McDonald to buy the franchise? MLM company encourages you to buy their products so that you can use it to yourself and eventually fall in love with it, because by joining the MLM company you are ultimately part of the business, and you walk to your clients or prospects as if you own the company that is why it's called "Human Franchise". If you don't like or love the products of your own company, how can you prospect and convince others to join you ? If you pay huge sum of money to McDonald, but you haven't even tried a bite of the burger, what makes you think your customers will want to try it?</p>
              <p>That is why many people fail in this business and only few succeeds. Isn't this the same thing happening to real life even in traditional businesses ? many fail and few succeeds. When people fail in MLM industry, they will blame the company or uplines for cheating the money and it never works, while on the other hand, when people fail in traditional businesses, they will blame their lacking of money to do marketing, the economic situation is not on their side, no businesses, and the list goes on. Can you imagine what the world will become if all people succeed and no one fails ?</p>
              <p>MLM company is a very low risk and very low cost for most entries, it is an opportunity to earn money but absolutely not a getting rich quick scheme, you need to work hard in the beginning to reap the effort. because in the long run, once you have many downlines, the system will work for you and you will start making your passive income. This is truly a dream come true for most business owners and entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>I am not saying LFI is the best, but in my personal point of view, LFI has the simplest structure for you to create downlines with minimal effort. Once again, it all comes down to you, look at yourself, why you fail in MLM companies and whine, but the successful ones are doing it effortlessly without complaining. The problem lies in you not the company.</p>
              <p>Most MLM companies require team work, not a one man show. This is another reason why many people fail too, because they tend to skip the gatherings or meetings with their fellow members, because they cant be bothered, they think it is a waste of time, they only want to participate after they have earned money in the company. They just keep finding excuses to shy away from the group meetings.</p>
              <p>Again, many businessmen see MLM as an opportunity and just in case you don't know, many high net worth persons in this world have done MLM before ad even if they haven't done it, they are very open to it. In this case, Donald Trump is one of the men, when he was interviewed and asked what he would do if he goes bankrupt, he replied "Network Marketing" and all of the audiences responded with chuckles and laughters. Trump then said to the audiences "that is why you are sitting down there laughing and I am on the stage here".</p>
              <p>I stand by the power of network marketing and I continue running my conventional businesses and doing network marketing without feeling ashamed. I only pity those who avoid money making opportunies, especially those who have never been in the MLM industries but they speak evil of it as if they have tried it.</p>

              <p>These managing directors and vice presidents, they become part of the mlm companies not for the sake of cheating more money from the people. But they do realize the 9-5 job and the full time job they are currently doing, do not guarantee them security. They need something to fall back on when something happens to them, retrenchment can just happen anytime without you knowing it, especially to those people whose pay is considered high in the company.</p>

              <p>I didn't mean in particularly that side but rather there's this phrase as used often in dramas, conversation etc. It's very often being viewed as such ma, since there are lots of baits to lure people from company to company.</p>
              <p>As for people leaving the company, it just shows that people join mlm is for money and not for learning.</p>
              <p>Nothing strange. It's a normal trend. Stay long enough in the industry and you will see the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">MLM drop out rate going to as high as 85% over a period of 3 years.</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> (Conservative Figure already) For people who wants to learn MLM / Work MLM, think again.</span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> Success rate of those who persist on for the remaining 15%  - - - Lol..Will keep it as a secret for now.</p>
              <p>There's a phrase which they often use in the route march, marathons etc. "When the tough gets tougher, the ...."</p>
              <p>Can't exactly remember the whole phrase, do anybody here still remember the exact phrase? Help needed with this phrase. Thank You.</p>
