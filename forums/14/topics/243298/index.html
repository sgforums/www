            <div class='col-md body'>This is a mlm company offering the various products with inferior qualities and have a lot of fake claims of the product.<br><br>Singapore's Love Moon is 2 weeks old from what i heard from the Malaysia Upline who traveled to Singapore to present to me.<br><br>It's Located around Central Area of Singapore.<br>Exact Location will be kept sercet as I'm still checking up this company in progress!! (details will only be revealed to those people who are interested in meeting up.)<br><br>Malaysia's Love Moon is 2 months old.<br><br>But more importantly, this company is a China Based Company. For details, feel free to approach me.<br><br>I've got the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;"><strong>Newspapers Report stating that this company is listed as a Scam Company</strong></span></span> offering products with Fake Claims of Better Quality than XXX sanitary Pads in the market.<br><br>The company are dealing with the following products:<br><br>1 - Sanitary Pads SGD$8 per pack I guess<br>[I'll check again and confirm the price in few days' time]<br>I) For usage when Ladies have menses during Morning - Afternoon<br>II) For usage when Ladies have menses in Night Time<br>III) For usage when ladies menses are over.<br>1 box of this sanitary pads cost SGD$118.<br><br>2 - Push Up Bra Price - I can't remember. [T.B.A soon]<br>The agent claims that the Bra has a Push Up-Effect, but when I look at the Design of the Push-Up Bra, it doesn't even look like a Decent Push-Up Bra.<br><br>The design aren't similar in any way with those push-up bras or lingerie offered in the market nor those featured in magazines and newspapers advertisment..<br><br>The Design is Bad.<br>The Style is Bad.<br>There's Little/No Support at all!<br>The Claims are Fake. (Comparing to similar products with similar effects)<br>Everything is Bad.<br><br>3 - Shoe Pad<br>Cost around SGD$180++<br>They claim that it can remove/reduce the Smelly Feet<br>The product has 2 Magnets Below the Shoe Pad<br><br>4 - Beverages Related Products*<br>Don't ask me for information on this as I am still waiting to Go to their company to View all the Products that they have.<br><br>I'll keep you all Posted as soon as I've Updated myself with new information.<br><br>I'll not post anything regarding this company's compensation scheme as it's a Scam Company, so no point knowing so much.
