              <h1>Pigeon-based Ponzi <br> Snares Canadian and USA Farmers</h1>
              <p><strong>January, 2008</strong></p>
              <p>Hundreds
              of family farmers in Canada and the USA, many of them in Amish and
              Mennonite religious communities, have made large investments in an
              income scheme based on breeding pigeons. The trouble is that nobody
              knows where the money would come from for the farmers to sell the
              pigeons they are breeding.</p>
              <p>The Pigeon scheme was exposed largely due to the tireless work of Canadian consumer advocate, <a title="Crime Busters Now" href="http://www.crimebustersnow.com/">Dave Thornton of crimebustersnow.com</a>.</p>
              <p><a title="Pigeon Ponzi News" href="http://www.pyramidschemealert.org/PSAMain/news/PigeonPonziNews.html">The news media</a> is finally shedding light on what appears to be a financial disaster
              for the farmers and a scandal for Canadian government regulators who
              have done nothing to investigate or protect the farmers.</p>
              <p>The
              real investigative journalism that opened the full story to public
              scrutiny was not done by news or business journals. A full
              investigative report was done by a Canadian farming magazine called <a title="Better Farming" href="http://www.betterfarming.com/magazine/better-farming-special-investigation-faith-arlan-galbraith-ontario%d5s-pigeon-king">Better Farming</a>.</p>
              <p>The
              pigeon scheme is run by a Canadian-based company called "Pigeon King
              International". This company is selling breeding pigeons to the farmers
              at extraordinarily high prices. The same company then contracts with
              the famers to buy back the offspring also at amazingly high prices. The
              promised net return for the farmers is very lucrative. Hundreds of
              farmers have bit the lure, some investing hundreds of thousands of
              dollars and have staked their entire farms and life savings on the
              scheme's promises.</p>
              <p>Now, <a title="Iowa AG Investigates Pigeon King" href="http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/dec_2007/Pigeon_King_International.html">one state Attorney General in the United States</a> has launched an investigation. Like the consumer advocates and the news
              media, the regulators are asking, "Where does the money come from?"
              Pigeon King International has not been able to explain how it could pay
              the high prices it has promised the farners for their newly bred
              pigeons. The lack of an answer leads investigators to one terrible
              conclusion -- the money is coming from new investors.</p>
              <p>This
              reality would make Pigeon King International mererly a money-transfer
              scheme, destined to financially ruin the majority of all investors. It
              would mean the scheme is not about pigeons at all. Pigeons are only a
              disguise for gaining the money from the famers. The story about a huge
              new market for pigeons would be a lie.</p>
              <p>Finally and
              perhaps the worst aspect of this alleged scam is that the religious
              communities of farmers were led to spread the scheme among themselves,
              brother and sister to brother and sister.</p>
