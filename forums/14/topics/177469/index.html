            <div class='col-md body'>Tangled mess behind SITC collapse revealed<br>TODAY 8 FEB 2006<br><br>LOH CHEE KONG<br>cheekong@newstoday.com.sg<br>AS FUMING students in Vietnam contemplate<br>lawsuits to get their money back, it has<br>emerged that the way the recently collapsed<br>chain of Singapore-funded private schools<br>was run was a huge tangled mess.<br>Sources close to the Singapore International<br>Training Consultancy (SITC) Holdings,<br>which runs the private schools, revealed<br>that the business was run on a<br>multi-level marketing (MLM) model.<br>And each time an injection of funds was<br>needed, a new set of investors was roped in<br>to set up new schools. The 19 schools in Vietnam<br>were set up within a short span of two<br>years and 12 of them operated without the<br>required licences from the respective citiesÂ’<br>Department of Education and Training.<br>Each month, dividends of US$30 ($49)<br>to US$100 would be paid to shareholders.<br>Singaporean businesswoman Angela<br>Lee was approached to invest in the company<br>two years ago but rebuffed the proposal<br>asking for an investment of US$10,000<br>as she found the business model flawed.<br>She declined to help recruit more investors.<br>Â“They told me they were using an MLM<br>business model. But as an education platform,<br>you are a service provider. How can<br>you run the business like an MLM model,<br>which is product-based?Â” she told TODAY.<br>An SITC director also revealed that a<br>new set of investors was roped in to set up<br>a new school each time the business needed<br>an injection of funds, up to US$125,000<br>on each occasion. Each time, the school<br>saw full enrolment as fees were below cost.<br>In November 2004, the directors in Singapore,<br>alarmed at the pace of expansion,<br>asked their <span style="color: red;">Taiwanese consultant Michael<br>Yu,</span> who had been managing the firm in Vietnam,<br>to stop building new schools. Within<br>months, he approached the directors and,<br>for the first time, asked directly for funds.<br>The financial mess was discovered when<br>a director went to Vietnam to check the accounts<br>in detail last June and it emerged the<br>schools had all along been running on deficit.<br>The directors have filed a police report<br>against Mr Yu, who has since gone missing.<br>The chain, a US$2 million investment<br>with 82 Singaporean shareholders, purportedly<br>included schools in China, Thailand,<br>Vietnam, Cambodia and Singapore. In truth,<br>many of these ventures never worked out,<br>the director told TODAY.<br>Last month, its businesses in Vietnam<br>collapsed, leaving the wages of 1,000 employees<br>unpaid and 30,000 students demanding<br>refunds. The schools have remained<br>closed despite notices claiming they<br>would open on Monday.<br>A former Singaporean regional manager<br>said SITC used as a marketing tool<br>Â“education vouchersÂ” that could be bought<br>by anyone and sold for a quick profit. Typically,<br>the vouchers were sold for US$30<br>less than the course fees. As news of SITCÂ’s<br>difficulties spread, panic selling has made<br>the vouchers Â“worthlessÂ” overnight.<br>At least one group of Vietnamese students<br>plans to take SITC Holdings to court.<br>About 300 MBA students from Hanoi and<br>Ho Chi Minh City are filing a lawsuit against<br>SITC for Â“swindlingÂ”, said Mr Nguyen Hoang<br>Diep, a 29-year-old legal consultant who had<br>paid US$3,600 for a US$4,500 MBA course.<br>Â“Most of the MBA students hold key positions<br>in government agencies. We are prepared<br>to spend more to get justice done.Â”<br>A statement by the Ministry of Foreign<br>Affairs here said SITC Â“is a commerciallyrun<br>entity with no connection with the Singapore<br>GovernmentÂ”, adding that it hoped<br>the problems Â“will be resolved expeditiously<br>in accordance with VietnamÂ’s lawsÂ”.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, Today should have spell out how this 'MLM scheme' clearly works, like how much the current investors get as a monthly commission if they help recruit new investors.<br><br>Otherwise, the injection of funds and monthly dividends per month sounds heck lot more like IPO events than a MLM scheme.<br><br>Secondly, while MLM companies usually focus on products, I think there are companies which focus on service too. Gotta check this out.</div>
