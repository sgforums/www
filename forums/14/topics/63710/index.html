            <div class='col-md body'>For those who wan to know more bout wat the hell is Network Marketing, pls give urself some time to view the following URL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> :<br><br>http://www.mlm.ch/<br><br>(copy and paste it in ur link)<br><br>u will find answers to :<br><br>1) How Network Marketing, this biz concept comes about?<br>2) Why Network Marketing products so expensive?<br>3) Why are their products so good?<br>4) Why people mistaken it as pyramid scheme? etc<br><br>Find out more answers from there. Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies. Jus take a look at the newspaper for the past one month, alot of articles is focusing on NETWORK MARKETING, and they also teaches us how to prevent from bad companies. if u wan to know, read the straits times forum on MLM and chinese lianhezhaobao on last sunday 18/01/04.<br><br>Most imptly, its not the money that counts. Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>
