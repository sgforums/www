MLM companies only proclaim they dun advertise in order to give the best rewards to the distributors, if they advertises always, the distributors have to be careful. Just like some companies that sponsor this charity and NDP to get in the limelight, cos most MLM do charity in low profile, anoymous donations,etc. If products of company is really good, word of mouth with itz compensation plan is enuf.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me share with u something about this so-call successful KELVIN HO. He was successful in NOP after CID, not Coslab. He failed in NOP and he went out and set up a small and typical comic shop in AMK with my friend (YS). But the worst thing is this chap had no more money and he started the business using his sister's $$$ and my friend (YS)'s $$$. After some hard time with that silly shop, he went back to search for MLM (thats why u see him in Coslab now) and just throw that pathetic shop to my poor friend (YS) to handle. And i heard that he had declared bankruptcy already, but is it true or not, i dunno. B'coz i have no solid proof to say he is bankrupt. Even he is not bankrupt, he is broke and thats confirm. Btw, the Lexus that he is driving recently is not his! hahaha! that car belong to the Coslab's Boss's nephew's good friend who went oversea and ask him to take care of his car. But that lunatic kept on telling people that the Lexus is HIS.<br></div>
