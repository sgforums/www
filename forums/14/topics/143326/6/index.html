            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, it has been ages since I last posted here. My presence here today is to affirm that I HAVE NOT BEEN CONNED &amp; I am not cheating anyone to join me. (Please dun put words in my mouth again)Since when did I say that I am being cheated? Dude, I NEVER declare that.<br><br>Btw, I have been pretty busy. Doing part time in NTI and full time else where. Yeah, I know when I say "part-time" , I believe that there will ppl around to ask me why am I not doing full time.Com'on, before I started in NTI, I have already a full time stable job and NTI just offer me some sources of income.<br><br>Life been pretty good and busy so far. We are launching some exciting stuff in NTI soon but I am not going to say anything till its official launch. Definately, it's good and a practical approach.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Btw, a piece of advice to those who wants to back up NTI, dun waste your time here becos nobody is gonna 'listen' to us. Coming here once a while is fun as they to help to 'improve our blood circulation!'</span><br><br>Cheers!<br><br>Please rememeber me always. And thanks for those who remember me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people, I've juz being kinda introduced to this whole system of binary marketing in NTI from my frenz working there. It seems kinda feasible and does promising to some money-earning for youngsters like us who do have much qualifications at the moment.<br><br>Out of curiosity and protection over my money (which I've saved like crazy), I've googled niutrend international to see wat I can find. N pronto, I've been directed to this forum to check out all the threads on MLM, inc NTI of course.<br><br>Wat I dun realli understand is why are there so many out there who have shot NTI so badly? Have you guys been scammed before or...? Coz from all my frenz who are working in NTI, they have earned back their capital and continued earning, with proof of their own of course. Yes, Im not denying that the upperlines will earn tonnes more but to agents like my frenz ( and me, if I happen to join), the important thing is that I AM earning e amt I want as well. Hence, it would definitely benefit everyone out there if some kind soul could share his or her actual experience as to how he/she was conned/ scammed by NTI. That would definitely serve as a better warning to all potential NTI agents out there. Thanks.<br><br>As for the NTI agents out there who wish to post, pls....I have a pretty decent impression of NTI and its agents from my frenz who are involved in this job. From that they have told me, Im pretty alrite with it and I have seen results in them. That is why it hurts, not to mention confuses, me as to why u guys are postin such replies on this forum. They give the company a veri bad image, an image which I cannot link to NTI after all the interactions with my frenz (who happen to be my close frenz).<br><br>In addition, if it is true that the president of NTI realli has hailed to all under him not to post anymore replies in this forum, I hope that some agents could still stand up and defend urself. If NTI realli is a legitimate company using standard procedures to earn money, there should be clarity in the company's system. It would definitely be better than flamin back whoever that has flamed u.<br><br>Thanks for everyone's attention, I hope to hear some advice pls. Cheers!</div>
