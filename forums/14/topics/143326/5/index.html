Because IamfromNTI layed down his dare to post the photos here, he should have the integrity to "walk to walk".<br><br>You can continue your ranting, but if you cannot find him/her, it just goes to shows that:<br><br>firstly, you are talking bull about your "superb knowledge of NTI"<br><br>secondly, you are just another untrustworthy fellow just like IamfromNTI.<br><br>and i am also going to guess that after 50-100 post, you will disappear from this forum like IamfromNTI.</div>
