            <div class='col-md body'>Many things improve blood circulation. Even the cheapest heath food supplement does that but that does that mean it will improve a person's health. I still believe you need the nutritions that play a more important role. Exercise improve blood circluation too.<br>I said they cheat because of the way they sell. They keep trying to make you believe by giving testimonials. If those products are effective or anywhere good, where are most of the earlier agents now ????<br>I said they cheat also because they could not tell you who is the manufacturer, no name and no address, can you believe Japanese products in this way ?????<br></div>

Some really good products I seen are endorsed by doctors, and they did not go against their ethics.<br><br>a) If they endorse without any benefits returned. I swear I seen few companies who thoroughly research for many years, and even to do experiment on human beings also take much time and tedious efforts after the research. Kudos to those people. Btw, these guinea pigs also have no benefits for participating. The only benefits comes from the goodness of these products.<br><br>b) If they are really endorsing products that they have used on their patients, and seen the positive effects, in fact this widely happenning, sure as there are good products, surer would good doctors who want to see people cured using them. This have happened widely.<br><br>c) I do beware of companies who self research, and using their own doctors or researchers to endorse, if so, there must be also a recognised third party or institution to back that up. Eg, I seen some companies who have Nobel Prize Winners among their researchers, but as to effectiveness and safety of products are not backed up. Only these Nobel winners names were used.<br><br>d) In fact, some really good products are used by hospitals in the first place, are then have their distribution rights bought over (after some intense evaluation by the companies) to be sold exclusive by themselves.<br><br>i wouldnt mind bringing doctors in, its them who created these in the first place. Just make sure you yourself as a consumer do a check up first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

So these hospitals will soon be endorsing and promoting their products.<br><br>I find this rather strange. Firstly, if so many people telling me hospitals are using their stuff, so who is right...and I never seen these used by hospitals before or even after some time.<br><br>Secondly, nothing wrong with companies promoting to doctors, and doctors after finding them good, endorse and promote to customers...BUT..it should be done by non MLM companies. Why?<br><br>Sure sure, its good to use doctors as direct sellers to promote stuff, but then again, you wont need other professionals or people from all walks of life to be come distributors. Many forget that MLM is supposed to be low cost packaged business to be successful. If one target a selected pool of people, for example, the youngs, or the doctors etc etc, you will end up with limited pool of distributors wont you? Within this limited pool, how many want to endorse or promote the products?<br><br>Worse is, I seen companies targeting people from all walks of life, at the same time, SPECIALLY targets doctors too. Why I dont like this? Dividing the company distributors into two camp, ultimately, the doctors camp is gonna earn a lot simply because of their status and profession. This gonna make the other camp pissed off, coz they see themselves unable to do better.<br><br>Funnily, I had also seen people targeting rich people. Its ok, but dont make this a norm, Coz, there are not many rich ones who will become customers, and people will point out the reason why you become successful is becoz you have rich friends, who enable you to be more successful. This among also many other reasons, deter people from joining your business.</div>

As to whether its effective, remember, gahmen is not the biz, so its the biz who is losing money if its found to be ineffective.<br><br>This is a society of free entreprise, and there are thousands of products that are sold but are not effective here. So this effectiveness and marketability is up to the biz world.</div>

Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.....talk about products, there is a need to consider whether it's something that people use every month( highly repeatable sales) and whether sales can sustain during bad times. MLM which are too product focus will have challenges when there are competition on cheaper or better products. So choose wisely because you do not want to put so much time and effort into something that will not sustain the test of time.<br><br>Monkey year is the perfect year for a rat to be successful in business.
