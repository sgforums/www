              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Yup, there is no such thing as fast cash, so if you want fast cash.. sorry, this is not the place.. you will be greatly disappointed.</p>
              <p>This ia a long term business and requires having the right business and entrepreneurship mindset, plus true effort and 100% focus to build a stable business. The results are in the long term if done right, not the short term.</p>
              <p>Only when you seriously know what you want and able to discern and analyse the different opportunities should you think of looking at it..</p>
              <p>Anyway, just be careful and know that this is not a game, it's for serious people.</p>

              <p>If you are interested in Network marketing, its good.... But I'll still advice you to continue studying because its essential to have good knowledge in our world...</p>
              <p>Secondly Network Marketing is not a gurantee fast cash... yes, some definately can earn cash very fast but it depends on how smart he/she works and how big is his/her market group... Most of us would take a few months or even years then can get some big bucks... so its important to get your diploma and get a day job when working with Network Marketing...</p>
              <p>Thirdly, don't listen to those who discourage you from Network Marketing... If you want to do Network Marketing, it is the smarter choice... but you must ask yourself one question... do you have what it takes to be a Network Marketer? It will take time and a lot of leg work for you to get results and remember, Network Marketing pays you for results... Its not you trade in your effort for money... Some people work damn hard in network marketing but get no results... others do little effort but make tonns of results...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in conclusion, concentrate on your studies for now... and if you got what it take to be a Network Marketer, then congrats to you... PM me if you got any more question...</p>

              <p>MLM is not for everyone. Many people failed because they are led to believe that any Tom, Dick and Harry can succeed in this business at the many MLM seminars out there. The reality is that MLM is a business, and it does require business acumen, sales skills, networking skills, pool of prospective customers, and a great deal of time and money to invest in the business.</p>
              <p>Business acumen, sales and people networking skills are things you can learn either by your own experience or through coaching by experienced people. But time and money are really scarce resources that you must be able to afford. Many people got burned in MLM because they are compelled to buy something every month (aka maintenance) so to keep their distributorship status (which guarantees a certain overriding commission), while not enough income is made because they lack time, customers, etc.</p>
              <p>MLM is not equal to quick money. Like any biz, it needs time to grow. Don't be greedy by buying up ranks (eg: Regional Mgr, Director, Count, etc) just because it gives you high overriding commissions unless you already have a strong base of potential customers. This is where most people lose their money. Don't be greedy.</p>
              <p>You may have heard of many rags-to-riches testimonials at MLM seminars. People who were like you who now make 5-figure incomes, have company sponsored cars, etc. etc. Take it with a pinch of salt. MLM companies must make themselves believable in order to attract the men on the street. There must be "success stories" to wow the audience. While there may be indeed some true rags-to-riches cases, however, many such successful individuals have been specially "nurtured" by the company management in order to produce the perfect stories. There are many "interesting" things you will never know about how some MLM organisations operate unless you are in the inner circle. I mean some, not all.</p>
              <p>Are their products really that great? Some are but most aren't. In fact, most of these products can be bought at mainstream pharmacies at very affordable prices with nearly similar ingredients and concentration. I have heard stories that some MLM companies have a team of "specialists" whose job is to write stories about their products being certified by so and so laboratory. Some claim that their products are endorsed by a certain celebrity or well known figure who have benefitted by consuming the products (if you believe so). In this money-making world, people are known to lend their names for handsome endorsement fees as long as the products sound safe. Some of them may even have not touched the products even though they are given free by the companies!</p>
              <p>If you are still keen in MLM, do your due diligence. Research the web, ask around, but make sure you do so with a crystal clear mind. There are a few great MLM companies around. Many are good for now until you see them on the newspaper for the wrong reasons (usually due to the products). Join the right company and the right team.</p>
              <p>Be prepared to lose some friends when you are in the biz. That's the reality. Many people will avoid you because you are in MLM. You may lose some friends because they joined but made little or no money (or worst lost money). It could be better to bring strangers into your business.</p>
              <p>I have seen highly successful uplines who finally left the MLM industry disillusioned. Many of the uplines (especially the "001") who are still in the business are simply circulating themselves from one company to another new company, and along with them, migrate their entire network over. That's how they make a lot of money when they switch organisation. Been there, done that.</p>

              to survive in this world, what i believe is the skill that we possess... every field has its own benefit and advantage, otherwise the government would disallow them to step into the land for sure. 
                      
              be open minded to any aspects of job that people says, suspect them, however, you may go and verify it yourself whether this wonderland does exist or not...
                  
              i believe in what i have seen and undergone thru myself...
