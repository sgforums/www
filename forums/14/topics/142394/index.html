Which is why you only see MLMers trying to reach out to the general public.  The reason why MLM is made taboo in Singapore is mainly because of unscrupulous local MLM companies that deceive their employees in order to achieve their profit targets.  Eventually turning all the marketing strategies and ideologies of MLM into conjob gimmicks.<br><br>MLM in Singapore, compared to many other countries, is still at its infant stage. It is an effective marketing strategy, if you join the right company that is transparent in its dealings, has an excellent marketing product, and is able to nurture its people in the right way.  I've been introduced to one that only requires a very small investment, but has a high potential.  Up to now, i have never been asked to purchase anything, only invited to attend a few free seminars conducted by internationally renown speakers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The problem is he probably worked too hard and lost his mind from the fact that he's a CEO of a charity organisation, not a public-listed company. That's why the lavishness are under attacked. Singaporeans hate to see their donation money going to unnecessary lavishness and extravagance.</div>
