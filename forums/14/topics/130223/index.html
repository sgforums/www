            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>Personally i have been involved with MLM for a couple of years already. Frankly speaking, i was blown away by this brilliant concept about MLM when i was first exposed to it during my university days.<br><br>After doing the business actively for some time, i guess i have seen just enough about most people's perception about this type of business. Bottom line is, the business idea is fantastic, what is not, are PEOPLE.<br><br>In whatever business, there will be people out to cheat and be unethical. There will be people who are promised false dreams and they can make all the money without putting in any efforts cause "your upline will HELP YOU BUILD THE BUSINESS." That is really bullsh*t. Everyone knows there are no free lunch in this world and i really wonder what they are thinking when a networker says that to them during the pitch. the problem is, most people who participated decided to take the application form like a lottery ticket.<br><br>You cannot love what you don't know. And like what i said, the key is education. As a networker, i feel that my job is to teach and show what MLM really is. To convince? not my job. There are so many avenues out there where i think people can be taught to understand what this biz is really about and not to blatantly condemn people like me who just have a stronger desire to pursue my dream.<br><br>If only our prospects look at facts more than listening to just opinions.<br><br>A harvard trained professor,Dr Charles King who teaches MLM as a business subject in the UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS was also skeptical until a student asked:<br><br>"Sir, why are you so skeptical about MLM?"<br><br>The professor replied: "I know just enough to not want to look at it."<br><br>The student says " If i am to give you the same answer you gave me without any more facts, you will certainly give me an F"<br><br>Professor says " Son, You are absolutely right, you just got yourself an A."<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi alex, of course it would be silly to think that these are all i have learnt after a couple of years. And of course ignorant to assume that i will type ALL i had learnt here in a single post. ( No intention to flame too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>There are many ways one can choose to educate as far as MLM is concerned. As for HERBALIFE'S education system that is conducted through the monthly STS (Success Training Seminar) I truly agree that it ought to be improved. Somehow I find the quality of the training has gone down over time. Personally I have picked out many 'facts' that have been conveyed to the new distributors in really unintelligent ways. To the extent that the very last time i attended the training, i actually left halfway as me and my group felt that it was not worth our time.<br><br>I am trying to be critical and objective here and i will not defend anything that is clearly bad. I feel that the company is good and the product is fantastic, but well, the training... I hate to comment too much. The only training I look forward to is the regional trainings and special trainings that are held on the first Saturday of each month by President's Team members. May will be great as JIM ROHN is coming to town.<br><br>I am still a beginner as far as networking is concerned and i am sure i have much to learn from you guys being seasoned networker. But John Kalench, Robert Butwin and Big Al have been really valuable to my infant period doing this business.<br><br>But seriously speaking, when you brought up education, what is it in your context? What I do is to use books, CD's, Videos and Internet sources to help me, and the response is good so far.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree.<br><br>To first critisize MLM, you must understand how it works.<br><br>The structure is not the same as other corporate organisations, where you must have certain attributes to be a prospective employee of the company.<br><br>Most MLM companies market their products thru mass distribution thru the avg joe. The crux lies then in the training. Its how you manage to train up your workforce of distributors. Unfortunately, this is not largely successful even in major legal MLM companies. The bad customers service and lack of professionalism left bad impression on many prospects and customers.<br><br>Few other misconceptions including labelling ANY direct selling company as MLM companies when they clearly are not. In fact, so far, all direct selling companies that do stringently recruit salesman to do direct sales, and paying them commissions instead of basic wages, are not really MLM. So far i have not encountered one yet. and in anyway, such stringent recruitment would defeat the aims of MLM, which is more towards mass sales and referrals.<br><br>Therefore, the crux would lie in training.<br><br>To add, there is one forumer in sgforums who is a psychologist and human resource consultant himself, who has been doing work for companies in this region and Australia.<br><br>He stated once, that sometimes, its not the host of experience or skills you have that will get you a job in that company. In many instances, its rather that you are skilless and its easier to train someone from a clean slate. It will be then easier for you to adapt to the organisational culture and goals.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree. Uplines are not responsible totally for your success. It is you yourself that determine how you want to pursue your success in the business.<br>Personally I have seen so many cases where crowns, diamonds and chairmans have uplines that MIA. My sponsor makes over SGD110,000 a month and he had an upline that quit the business after he joined. It is due to THIS that causes him to work even harder and learn all he can to do well. An upline COULD be in some case your handicap.<br><br>As for the lack of control of the people participating in this business, i guess that is really an arguement base on no ground. Who then control people starting any business, say any other retail, consultancy, food or traditional business you can think of? There are trash businessmen EVERYWHERE IN EVERY INDUSTRY. If you cannot make it, you lose. Simple right? Why then is there such accusation just because it is MLM? I think that is so simple and narrow minded.<br><br>The only thing that MLM offers is EQUAL chance for ANYONE to make it. Seen too many school dropouts and lowly educated people becoming financially free here more than any other industries. The fact that YOU cannot make it, does not mean it is bad. If it has worked for some people, you cannot say it does not work. Blame it on your incompetence, lack of judgement/information or simply not tenacious enough to carry on.<br><br>And if the idea of only the TOP or EARLIEST people who joined makes the most money is another good excuse, just think again before you say that.</div>
