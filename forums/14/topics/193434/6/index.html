If it is less than 60 days, or 2 month, you are always free to refund.<br>Go directly to the company and ask for refund.<br><br>CASE and police is not doing anything because NTI is considered legal for now.

It is either your cousin is stupid, inpresistent or greedy.

There are still NTI agents floating around this forums.<br>You lost, admit it and review why you lost.<br><br>It is okay to make mistake, as long as you don't repeat the same mistake again.
