            <div class='col-md body'>One thing I don't get about NTI is this thing about the use of the title Mr. Anyway Mr. is usually attached to a person's surname as a form of salutation, its actually pretty rude to call a person by Mr. (Firstname) and its also quite bad English. Hahahaha NTI people can call me Mr. Eikei for now, soon it will not be Mr. anymore hahaha<br><br>Anyway I don't think they know who Laurence and I are, just many wild guesses. I've even heard them accuse someone else of being me, which I found very amusing indeed. As to NTI, I would still like to ask the same old questions, why doesn't anybody from NTI want to talk frankly about their earnings and stuff on the forums?</div>
