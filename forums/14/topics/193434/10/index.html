What moronically flawed logic.<br><br>He is wrong to call everybody dogs cos some were tricked into the kennel. However, there are black sheep and wolves in sheep clothing and most of those from NTI who post here are wolves in sheeps clothing. Anyway when you come to a NTI thread, it would be nice to state your affliations since you took the liberty of registering and only posting in this forum.</div>
