He only know how to talk BIG when he was in the same camp as mine.<br><br>His upline Danny, who was also the camp like mine recruited him and go around boosting the BIG money he was earning. But i found out that he was only boosting when they invited me to NTI. Yuanjie is his BIG leg and he will not be earning a single cent if he dont balance up another leg.<br><br>As for Yuanjie, he found one guy called Andrew Boo and that Andrew is really someone that so far i think is capable to create BIG amount of sales for NTI.

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I know, the gold mine and LPS payout has been very inconsistent, much to the displeasure of older Managers. Imagine the top earning 3k only, if that is true now. I think recently the takings have been dismal so they need to find a way to re-energise their pitch. Its too hard fighting people who have wide networks actively stopping them from going to NTI. I think I've stopped like on average one person a day and via my own anti-NTI MLM scheme have stopped a few hundred people.... Till the day Jackie wants to sit down and have a chat with me and the other people, we aren't going to let NTI have its way.<br><br>If you are reading this Jackie, there is so much we can discuss about. Must you be arrested or be bankrupted before you are willing to talk and see the errors of your ways? Your image was given to you by James Phang and was never your true self. Its about time you actually came out and be honest to yourself. Personal discovery is a step towards self actualisation.</div>

Universal fund) that was able to use for anything but suddenly change the rules and make it only applicable for buy a car(carfund)?<br><br>Though this case has nothing to do with me anymore, but I have a friend there who was a little "busted" by the company because of the change of plan<br><br>Thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You don't have much of an agreement with them so contractually they don't owe you anything. Remember when you signed the MOPI and other forms? Not one of them stated anything about a car fund, payouts and other things they verbally promised you so technically, they do not have a plan and all they sold you are BVs. They don't owe you anything and can change the plan all the time because legally, they don't really have a contract with you to service a plan.<br><br>I guess that is the part where people get fed up as they feel they have been lied to and cheated.<br><br>Things like LPS payment, Gold Mine, Universal fund (car fund) and so on are some of the promises they have broken repeatedly. I'm just wondering how do some people promise these things will be given out when they themselves have been denied them. Your friend might want to confront his manager and see what he says. I'm sure his manager can fight for him to withdraw his car fund if his manager truly sees him as a friend.</div>
