This guy is our dear "Bo-Gay" (No teeth) Christian!!! My friend confirmed with me liao!!! Hahaha!!! WHAT A PATHETIC NTI DOG!!!<br><br>By the way, Christian, Please tell that Jackie Hoo to shut his fucking mouth lah.<br><br>Wait till my friends all get their carfunds and leave that stupid NTI, then he will realise that he is the greatest fool in the world.<br><br>Wait till JP play him out just like how JP played Alan Mok(EPI) and Desmond Teo(China Company) out, then he will know who is the greatest fool in the world.<br><br>Wait till he cant pay his bank-overdraft of $150,000 and JP walked out, then he will know who is the next best candidate for bankruptcy under JP's list.<br><br><span style="color: red;">And yes, on my behalf of my friends who put their money in the China company (Setup by that useless and incapable Desmond Teo), i would like to ask where is the company now? Where is the money now? Dont tell me that idiotic Desmond spend all the money away in KTV, massage and sex? Can we see the black and white what he spent in China?</span><br>Now, attention to all NTI managers who put in their money in the China company. How can u trust this two con-men (Jackie Hoo and Desmond Teo) if they cant even give u a good explaination on the money that u guys put in?<br><br>So, be smart, just leave them as far as possible once u get yr carfund. Just like what my BDM friend and BEM friend intend to do. </div></blockquote>Ya, i think he still own those pitiful managers an explaination who put in their hard-earned or their parent's hard-earned money. My upline who is also a manager, borrowed Hard-Earned money from his parents and put into this China Company. Poor thing.</div>
