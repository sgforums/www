Not knowing much about it beyond the usual hearsay, I read up on NLP during the past week I was remiss from this forum.<br><br>A very interesting science, but nothing like what you say. Please, Eikei, I don't give a f.uck if you think I'm childish or nagging or emotionally unstable, but at least make me respect you like an adult.

            <div class='col-md body'>Where did you study NLP from? NLP is a template which can do many things, some have even used it to help improve allegic conditions, quit smoking or help improve their creative thinking. From motivation on a daily basis to creative thinking to memory exercises, NLP provides a tool and is a platform to engage in these activities using the concepts of NLP. Anyway, your definitions from the websites differ quite greatly so I don't know which foot of yours you are shooting by posting them at the same time.<br><br>Enough of the detour from the main topic. Before the "Page Clearer" came in. Back to our regular programme, we have last seen YadoKing exposed as an NTI agent pretending to be anti-NTI. He was trying to defend his downline (Zhao Hui) when MOSPyramid exposed him to be an NTI agent. His Friendster profile was subsequently exposed and he is depicted as a hardcore NTI fanatic on his profile, which can be visited at christianrio@hotmail.com. MOSPyramid has "invited" Yadoking to a meeting at Lau Pa Sat this Sunday and if it really takes place, quite a few forumers are interested in going to watch. However, due to a sudden stroke consciousness, Yadoking sees no need to meet and decided to put up a lame picture which he probably spent quite a lot of time designing, just to mock MOSPyramid.<br><br>Any further deviations from the topic will be categorically ignored. If Decantre wishes to flame me, she is welcome to do it in a seperate topic or PM me with her rants. I would sincerely enjoy the pleasure of deleting them without reading.</div>
