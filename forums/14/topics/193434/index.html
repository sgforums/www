But if you just want to throw some defaming, malicious and ridiculous remarks on me, I just want to say you need to join NTI for you need a life.<br><br>And for all those who have been whacking NTI/The Leaders/Me, please try to understand our point of view and just give us a little benefit of the doubt that this place really make my life better. I just want to share my personal opinion of NTI and I vouch that whatever NTI taught us is not like all the bad tings that has been said. THere are many things here that changed me to become a better person. Its Time that this forum start to see why people are joining NTI and i urge all those who has benefited to write  their testimonial. Thanks.</div>
