            <div class='col-md body'>It just boils down to the fact that the truth hurts. We want the truth about NTI and we have repeatedly asked for facts. But the facts are just too damaging to the company and hence its almost embarrassing to release this information, hence they go into personal attacks, launching long tirades of useless information and nonsensical analogies. Then now it seems like their latest "counter-attack" involves flooding the forums with clones to spew trash hoping to change the topic from the real issue at hand.</div>

In this area, we are talking about Multi Level Marketing.<br><br>You might be saying there is a black sheep in my company therefore our name become stinky. Yes, you may. However this is only possible when your coy have a population of more than 5 million for example, Amway.<br><br>This is hard to control as it is simply too huge, just compare America and Singapore. Now, back to MLM. If you saying a small scum scamming coy like NTI, having a population that has only like 50 people. This is no more individual black sheep.

Their aroma therapy bottle is so weak that you burn 1 time the fuse cracked  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> . Anyway to prevent my health frailing, I gave them to a reporter, and hope she can report something out of it.<br><br>Black sheep point 1: In this case, many other industries selling aromatherapy is affected.<br><br>2.

If you successfully close him, either you will become one of them, rot in the company or quit for good.<br>All the agents know is to brainwash them with dreams, parents and greeds. All the follow up and pressure are making people sick!<br><br>Black sheep point 2: This really upsets the entire market, many people hence,<br>move away from MLM.<br><br>3. Gangsterism, I still remember there was once how NTI agents surround someone and scared the daylight out of him. Please remember you are just some insolent kids, do not act. Since then, people will grew awry of people wearing formal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> , oh man.
