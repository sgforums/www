              <p>Just my 2 cents worth, as once said by a successful man...there are 3 type of people who will try to pass down a msg about a particular topic/trade. No need to be just "MLM".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>1)Those that have not done it but choose to comment. (do they really know anything at all, is their opinion valuable?)</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>2)Those who have done it and failed. (hmm..this group is a bit tricky, the have obviously not used the right methods or are doing something wrong or maybe its just the wrong company)</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>3)Those who have done it and suceeded. (they will be able to share with you, there personal journey...which normally is not smooth sailing.)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you were to take advice from anyone, which of this 3 types of people will you heed?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me its pretty simple, i seek advice from the people that are living the life that i desire. so if you desire to earn $2k/mth, ask your friends that earn $2k/mth. if you want to earn $10k/mth, you have to ask someone that is already earning $10k/mth. You can't possibly expect someone who earns $2k/mth to tell you how to earn $10k/mth...right? If they knew how, they would prob have done it already ma...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of MLM, it may not be for everyone. But anyone can do it if they were to put in effort to learn. Its is the lowest risk and highest gain business model that you can find in the world. You can ask people like, Donald Trump, Robert Kiyosaki and even Bill Clinton.</p>

              <p>I've been poached by MLMs before...</p>
              <p>My strategies are very simple:</p>
              <p>1) If there are many teachers, test each of them (different companies approach me, I ask about the structure).</p>
              <p>2) Ask about the products, this is the content/value you gonna bring to your 'future' customers. Then ask about the coaching, this would be the value you'd bring to yourself in the future.</p>
              <p>3) Keep the meetings short and sweet, the longer you meet such people, the longer you'd be overwhelmed. Their goal might not to get you up on their 'hook' but their personality might.</p>
              <p>Further analysis and re-evaluation of meetings with different MLMs I realized they may be only providing 1 value in business - Motivation - MLM is definately a motivational business and in some cases blur into unethical zone.</p>
              <p>Also, the materials I've been loan to read, such as Kiyosaki rich dad poor dad, feels like total waste of time. Its totally fiction and should be taken as such, financial management in such books are totally heuristic and not-based-on-factual-information. People might dismiss it as merely inspirational, I suspect its more like creating cult of personality.</p>
              <p>Well, if there are people committed to MLM, they may have the reason to do so. I may feel arrogant for saying this, but I am lucky to have a goal before I even met such MLM recruiters.</p>

              <p>1) You know, when our friends or families do it, we never really got to understand in depth what they are doing or what its about..</p>
              <p>Personally for me, only when I actually got to do it, do I understand what it is all about..</p>
              <p>Knowing and understanding are totally different. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>2) I agree it's true that there are some who is not for them.. similar to studies, some people just cannot study and always fail no matter what.. but it doesnt mean that we can't.. that's why learn from those who can.. goes back to 1) again.. seriously understand it.</p>
              <p>3) Whether they are egoistical or have stake in other people etc dun matter to me.. as long as what they share can help me to succeed in my own business.. dun need to care how much they earn etc.. it's their business.. just focus on our own.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Think it's how we look and understand the business.</p>
              <p>The company and products are actually very important. Personally, most people that I share with just simply love the products and they would keep reordering even if they did not want to build the business at all.. This shows the market potential of the products and with market comes opportunity and those who wish to tap on the market can take up the opportunity also and so on etc.</p>
              <p>Most imptly, even up till today, I have never lost a single friend in the business, and on the contrary gained more.. just by understanding them and genuinely sharing what I feel can help them etc.. and let them make their choice. As long as we conduct our business with integrity, and have a good image, it can last.</p>
              <p>Probably you interacted with those who were more aggressive or greedy, there are those around, but as long as we conduct and teach others in the appropriate manner, our own life and business wont be negatively affected.</p>
              <p>I have also personally grown both inside and out through this business, this alone justifies what I have learnt and gained here. There was nothing to lose but plenty to gained and if I never looked further here previously, I would miss out all of those. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Well if you say you are fine with everything and you are able to seperate 'business' from 'personal' good for you.</p>
              <p><br>Regarding the article is that they never tell you the other side of the story. I define useful facts as data you can use to make high involvement decisions. There are no factual information that says Network Marketing is sustainable and is built on the fundamentals of sound business logic.</p>
              <p>Critical reading points out that the author has a stake in Amway, so you must also consider whether he has any conflict of interest.</p>
              <p>In general, the article is similiar to any business proposal I would draft in order to get potential organisation to buy my products, its just playing on emotions, thats all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course if you can use the book, if you feel like MONEY is the most important thing in life and you need it (for control purposes), GET IT. But becareful for those books are totally fiction, which means they can easily bluff their success stories with 'cliches'. And in reality, there are much more important things in life such as families and friends, and they also has a stake in your future, thats why they may say bad things about MLM.</p>
              <p>And btw, those books do sell long cos they prey on the main desires of human: Freedom and Greed.</p>
              <p>Anyways, I got to end here for abit cos I think most people who are already in MLMs do not see my point in anyways (environmental issues or egoissues no idea):</p>
              <p> If you are in MLM and it didn't work well for you, makes you frustrated, I suggest you take a break in your endeavour and look at things around you, maybe you are really in the wrong business or you had the wrong support.</p>
              <p>If you are not in MLM and you need justifications why MLM may not be for you, you may PM me, I'd provide relevant information that I've dugged during my stint as freelance contractor for many sales organization.</p>

              <p>Greed is also something that I never wanted to be associated with.. and I also believe that too much greed will be the downfall no matter what you do.. thus this was never the philosophy that brings about a successful sustainable business..</p>
              <p>Actually it may seem contradictory to what you said.. as generally it seems that being in this business, your friends and families will shun you.. and its only preying on pples greed etc..</p>
              <p>That's why it's impt to be part of a team that has the correct values and concept.. and we are able to develop ourselves and to achieve something more in life etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>To be honest, there is nothing wrong with the MLM industry.  What I felt was wrong was the approach and the worst thing to do is to invite people just for coffee and catch up and in the end asking them to join the presentation.</p>
              <p>Back then, the insurance industry also had a very bad name and it was only when people realized the importance of insurance where people start opening up to it.</p>
              <p>The true matter of the fact is that MLM is not suitable for everybody and not everybody wants to build their wealth through MLM.</p>
              <p>We still need people to design and build houses, design and build cars and provide delicacies for all to enjoy and if everyone will to do MLM, no one will do all these things.</p>
              <p>To my basic opinion, ask yourself if you will buy the products if there are no compensation plan that comes with the products and more importantly, will you take it on a regular basis?</p>
              <p>As MLM leaders, I think the very basic is to set a good example of professionalism and people will respect you as a person and a friend.  Honesty is the way to building business and only through honesty, can a business be built long term.</p>
