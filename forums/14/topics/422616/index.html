              <p>why would you want to slap yourself in the face?</p>
              <p>don't need to sell, invest, join &gt;&gt; does it mean you help every single one to open a zero cost membership account in this company?</p>
              <p>buying products = a form of investment &gt; if you said don't need, than when all of us wants products, do we ask you to collect it from the company and give it to us FOC?</p>
              <p>if you don't benefit anything from this company, would you even be bothered to start a thread and talk about it in the first place?</p>
              <p>if it's really that good like you mention in the thread, why isn't it a Non-Profit Organisation instead and showing up in yearly charity drives giving FREE FOOD to the poor all over the world.</p>
              <p>don't be naive and be tricked by your enroller aka your upline.</p>
              <p>if it's really that good, arrange an appt for me with your upline/enroller who can do a proper compensation plan presentation; not just a upline who only shows the retail outlet, but also the office, back-end training, suppport etc.</p>
              <p>which business in the world will not have all these basic structure in place? if you believe what you're enroller tells you, best of luck!</p>

              <p>as expected..another person trying to trick and mislead the naive, gulluible individuals..</p>
              <p>only to brush the subject of mlm issue aside only when being caught or confronted. (refer to the bold red text which i highlighted from your quote)</p>
              <p>the other thing is...</p>
              <p>as for the chemical ingredients harmful to our body..let me ask you this question &gt;&gt; do you know that all medical drugs are poision infact, and are being used by everybody in the world from hosptials to clinics?</p>
              <p>do you even know that all pre-prepared or some processed &amp; canned food have preservatives inside deem harmful to living beings, but as long as they are kept at minimal acceptable level which our body can tolerate, it's fine. same goes to poision or aka medication prescribed by hospitals and clinics.</p>
              <p>all people know it, a fact, but just not to overdose and overuse or overdependent on it and we'll be all fine. it's that simple.</p>
              <p>mlm company just tend to over-claim, over-promise, under-educate, exggerate and twist the facts in misleading those innocent individuals into buying their products in return for a commission.</p>

              <p>medicine are created using chemicals in the first place. different people have different allergies..just because your mom is allergic to the dish-wash doesn't means you can openly black-name a company (majority are still fine with it)..in return to advertise or put in good words for your supported company</p>
              <p>the reason why there are subsitute products in every single market is because not all people will like a certain brand/product, thus i quote drugs/medicine as example.</p>
              <p><strong>Paracetamol </strong>&amp;<strong> Aspirin </strong>are fellow competitors in drugs industry with respective side-effects too, but you don't see them bad-mouth each other..same goes to any and every single business out there globally.</p>
              <p>that's un-ethical..in business we do not encourage that.. &gt;&gt; it puts you the negative spot light = bad reputation for you, your moral ethics etc.</p>
              <p>i'm not against MLM, but rather I'm anti those irresponsible sales agents/distributors who mis-lead, mis-represent, over-claim and over-promise without holding themselves responsible for their own actions.</p>
              <p>i've pointed out your mistakes, yet you just laugh it off and didn't learn to from your mistake. it is people who don't hold themselve accountable that help cast a negative stigma on the industry itself.</p>

              <p>Plain and simple, although "Melaleucans" claim they are "not" MLM (to avoid the stigma of the industry) - it is direct sales, MLM, network marketing . . .whatever you want to call it - with a benefit of getting paid for sales &amp; recruting efforts. Compaines continually find creative ways of recruting others into their businesses. It is what it is . . . . it's only bad when unethical or illegal business is conducted. It is unfortunate that most people are "mis-informed" about a business, its comp plan, or the methods by which to conduct business.</p>
              <p>The sad reality is that a majority of people will fail in the "MLM" business because they do not take the time to become properly educated or mentored to become successful - it's the same principle with any endeavor or business. And pay special attention to the words "take the time" . . .because to be successful takes time and so many people "QUIT" because they do not experience instant success, or they do not understand the principles behind the business. Success does not come without its trials and tribulations. Just ask TRUMP . . . . . HA!!!!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
              <p>I looking to shed some light on why Melaleuca is NOT a MLM.  First 
                  and foremost Melaleuca is the only company in the world that is a 
                  consumer direct marketing company and they owned that trademark, so no 
                  company can copy them. HAHA</p>
              <p>1)  The main reason why people join MLM's companies is to make 
                  money.  When they don't make any money is the 1st 90 days then usually 
                  they quit.  Guess what?  As business builders not only do you loose a 
                  builder, but more importantly you loose a CUSTOMER.  Why?  Because they 
                  were never a real Customer in the 1st place.  Their just a person buying product to get a
                   check.  So the Residual you were earning disappears because it's not 
                  TRUE RESIDUAL.</p>
              <p>Melaleuca:  Looking at Melaleuca 2009 Annual Income statistics 
                  clearly shows that 88% of customers who join Mela... are stricly 
                  customers and are not considered business builders.  Melaleuca offers 
                  Highly Consumble quality prodcts at reasonable prices.  Often times less
                   expensive than what you would fine in the grocery store.  These 
                  products are already being used by the consumer so it's not an added 
                  expense.  Melaleuca has real customers buying products that they really need.  Therefore you have real customers buying real products that they really need.</p>
              <p>2.)  MLM companies are known for their breakaways compensation plan: 
                   Breakaways are when you enroll someone better than you who passes you
                   in rank, then your income gets cut off from that person.</p>
              <p>Melaleuca has NO Breakaways.  If you enrolled someone better than you, you
                   can earn 7% on 7 generations period.  Of course you need to reach the 
                  position of Director which allows for you to get paid on all 7 lvl's.  It's the 1st position in Melaleuca's Compensation plan.  You can 
                  reach that position by simply referring 8 shoppers, and they don't have 
                  to do the business.  Melaleuca has NO Distributors.</p>
              <p>There are many differences between M.L.M. and C.D.M. as detailed 
                  below:  Compare the same number side by side</p>
