              <p>Hello. How come you say melaleuca is not MLM? Do members refer new members and get a $reward for doing so. ? If that is the case, what do you call that? Referrel marketing, Multi-Level-Marketing, Network Marketing=??</p>
              <p>BTW, is there anything wrong with the MLM system?lol</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am currently a preferred customer for Melaleuca. Have been  for the past 3 months or so. I have not reached a stage where i am referring potential customers to the company. Though i have to say, i have been using a wide range of their products, from body wash, to facial wash, detergent to floor cleaner and i must say me and my wife (who is a huge sceptic of MLM) have no complaints for the products we bought. Instead, we are seeing good results.</p>
              <p>My wife who has a acne problem since  her school days began to see improvements in her skin from using the facial wash. We have also scrapped plans to overlay our master bathroom tiles after we managed to get stubborn stains out by using the multi0purpose cleaner from Melaleuca.</p>
              <p>Like i said, i have never referred any customers. One reason is i wanted to try as many products as possible on my own first; built confidence in the products before i can say to potential customers thatt he products works.</p>
              <p>Their products may be a bit more expensive that normal products found in supermarkets etc but i find that so far the results i got is worth the extra money. Furthermore, i am not buying any extra items but replacing the items i normally buy in normal shops with the products from Melaleuca.</p>
              <p>Would appreciate any comments or feedbacks from people who have dealt with Melaleuca before be it a good or bad experience. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hi, i don't think its nice to call people shamelles for promoting their products. Nobody ask u to come in her and put a knife on ur throat to buy. Just see and if you dont like it just leave.</p>
              <p>I have stopped using the Melaleuca products mostly due to cost and not quality. I can testify that some items are good but this is also applicable to all other household brands out there where some are more suited to different individuals. Anyway, there is no contract that ties a person down to a period of time. Dont like, just stop buying.</p>
              <p>Anywya, for your info, in case u havent notice, this IS an MLM Forum so there is nothing wrong if people want to promote their items.</p>
