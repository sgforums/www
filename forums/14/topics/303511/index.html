            <div class='col-md body'>Copied this from another forum<br><br>Today, one of my girlfriend feedback to me regarding this 2nd edition of the Miss/Mrs LFI pageant. She has been contacted by Eric, a 23 year old Male claiming to be from the LFI wellness center. Excerpts from the messages Eric sent to her:<br><br>1st Message:<br>eric wrote:<br>hi hi i am eric 23m ... i am actually a business partner of a wellness center at marine parade ...we are holding a beauty pageant june this year and registration end at feb ..would u be interested to participate in this beauty pageant ? i seriously think u stand a high chance to win this pageant and mayb get to take part in the miss singapore 2008 or 2009 !!<br><br>2nd Message:<br><br>eric wrote<br><br>http://www.lfintlgroup.com/images/lf...t08_poster.pdf<br>this is the link with more information<br><br>i tell u y it worth it... this event will b big and there r celebrities attending the event too....<br>i personnally think that you are so pretty that u will definitely win in at least 1 category ...with the bust serum or the makeover package u will tone up your body perfectly ...u got 80% chance of getting a prize, u get lots of exposure and attention from this event and you can tell your friends that you have joined a pageant and there is actually a way for you to earn lots of money so come on ! dun wait le wor i find u very very very attractive n in fact so confident that u will win at least the 2nd runner up !! last year there was a lady that was 157cm tall and she also become 1 of the top ... n honestly speaking i think u are more pretty and "you mei li" lor u consider about it ba ...it is very worth it .. u gain a better figure and u likely to win more cash than wat u paid the bust serum u can share w friends too n pay by 12 months installment w credit card . which is only $65 per month .. i really think u are a beauty queen !!<br><br>My thoughts after reading this and looking at the contest:<br><br>* They are more interested in the sale of the packages rather than the pageant itself? With points given for weight lost and bust gained, this is more like a reality show rather than a pageant contest. Let's hope the contestants are certified medically to be fit for any rapid weight lost/bust enhancement regime. The organiser must take care of the welfare of the contestants and make sure that adequate medical insurance and coverage is undertaken just in case any of the contestants fell ill due to adverse reaction as well as a rapid weight loss. Will there be any money back in case the contestants are deemed not suitable to continue the regime since they cost more than $700?<br><br>* Does the organiser wanna send out messages such as bigger the boobs, the better and the thinner you are, the better? Beauty contest is never about just having the biggest boobs and the thinnest waist. Beauty is certainly never as shallow as that. A pageant winner should be judge from not just the figure alone.<br><br>* LFI is the organiser of Miss Singapore 2008/09? If they are not the organisers, they shouldnt be promising the contestants direct entry to the prestigious pageant. Anyway, interested girls who wish to join Miss Singapore does not need to pay $700 to join the contest proper, nor is there a requirement to join Miss Singapore only through the Miss LFI contest!<br><br>What are your thoughts if you or your GFs are asked to join this pageant?</div>

You are always threading on thin ice and using abusive language and calling names when you are cornered.<br><br>What makes you so sure I did not comment on Sunshine Empire? Go check it up before you start blowing up and whacking in every possible way to distract from the issues at hand.<br><br>You are really a good real life example of what bad MLMers are all about. Cursing someone's mum is not the way to go. What proof do you have that my mum took LFI products and died from it? You cant just go around blurting out like that. How will you feel when someone curse your whole family? You owe me, my family, all your customers and everyone here an apology for your behaviour. You are way out of line. Bad character and personality shown here.<br>You could be sued for defamation, misrespresentation just for blurting out information that is not true. Now you are dragging everyone in to support your claims. This issue has nothing to do with lawrence or the fallen.<br><br>Whether you left LFI with any regrets is none of my concern. I am more worried what you say and represent, your sense of responsibility and commitment towards your customers.<br><br>You must be made responsible for your own action and words or it will come back to haunt you in your life.<br><br>Yes, you can choose to go away and cool down. Its your life, you can choose whatever you want but if you say the wrong things, i will not hesitate to whack you because such behaviour should not be tolerated. Any misinformation and wrongful accusation should not be left alone.<br><br>Hope you understand where I am coming from and please do not put words into my mouth again.</div>
