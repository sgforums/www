            <div class='col-md body'>Twelve years ago, entrepreneur Tony Kwong struck out on his own with $100,000 -- most of it borrowed. Little did he dream that he would become a $65 million man. He shares some of the knowledge he has gleaned along the way with LEONG CHAN TEIK<br><br>SO you dream of becoming an entrepreneur -- and a hugely successful one at that.<br><br>Well, entrepreneur-multimillionaire Tony Kwong, 44, advises: Be prepared for the toughest times of your life.<br><br>To be sure, Mr Kwong did not have the advantage of connections or instant financing.<br><br>He worked as a technician for nearly three years after getting his Diploma in Mechanical Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic and doing national service.<br><br>Later, he joined the company of an ex-colleague and rose through the ranks to become an operations manager. He stayed there for seven years until he was 31, when he became disenchanted with his job.<br><br>He went for interviews with prospective employers, but a relative urged him to strike out on his own.<br><br>Mr Kwong recalls: "He said, 'You work so hard, why don't you become your own boss?.' But I didn't have funds as I didn't come from a rich family."<br><br>He counted $40,000 in personal savings, including his wife's. Some relatives decided to back him up and pooled $60,000.<br><br>Little did he dream that his business would command a market value of around $220 million on the Singapore Exchange today.<br><br>He is now chairman and managing director of Manufacturing Integration Technology (MIT), with a personal stake in the company worth around $65 million.<br><br>The firm designs and develops equipment for the semiconductor industry and was listed four months ago.<br><br>WATCH CASHFLOW<br><br>Cash is never enough when you are a young and growing company. You order parts to assemble your equipment and then you wait five or six months before the machine is commissioned and you are paid.<br><br>Mr Kwong recalls chalking up expenses of as much as $500,000 at one point: "It was quite stressful. The expenses were rising but you needed the work. And you had to pay your employees.<br><br>"I told customers point-blank that I could not take on the job if they couldn't give me a downpayment." Some clients agreed; some did not.<br><br>And when Mr Kwong was close to delivering the equipment or finishing the work, he would tell them: "When I deliver, you please settle cash on delivery."<br><br>BE A TIGHT-WAD<br><br>You have to be stingy if your profit margins are razor-thin, as was the case with Mr Kwong's business.<br><br>"Customers are smart: they know you need the job and they squeeze you on the price," he recalls.<br><br>He could not afford to waste a cent. "We counted every screw and every bearing!" And he bought used furniture and equipment for his office.<br><br>GET A BANKER<br><br>Gain the confidence of a banker: By nature, banks are selective and cautious -- sometimes to a fault.<br><br>At one appointment, Mr Kwong was kept waiting for three hours by a manager of a Big Four bank -- until he could not stand it anymore and walked off. The next day, the manager called, apologised and made another appointment, only to keep him waiting for two hours.<br><br>He left for a small bank, where the manager greeted him warmly. He secured an overdraft of $100,000. But it came with the proviso that he kept $100,000 of the company's money in a fixed deposit account.<br><br>Later, as the business grew, he felt he needed increased credit lines and better terms. But by then a new manager was in charge of the bank branch, and he did not take to Mr Kwong's request.<br><br>Laments Mr Kwong: "Every few years, banks changed their branch managers. Some could be approachable but others later looked at your account and considered it so small that they were not interested." On a friend's recommendation, he turned to Overseas Union Bank and has enjoyed a good relationship with it since.<br><br>It helped that his company's revenue grew in leaps and bounds: from $1.5 million in 1992 to $3 million a year later and doubling again the following year.<br><br>HIRE TEAM PLAYERS<br><br>When you are new and cannot afford better-qualified staff, you can end up with people who are not a good fit.<br><br>Mr Kwong recalls some of the staff in the early days of the company:<br><br>"It was frightening. I would tell them that there was a meeting, and they would say 'it's a waste of time'.<br><br>"I would ask when they would be finishing their work, and they would say, 'when I finish, I'll tell you'."<br><br>He gradually let these employees go and, as the company prospered, dangled more attractive salaries in order to attract better-qualified staff.<br><br>GOVT GRANTS<br><br>Mr Kwong emphasises: "The Government is pro-entrepreneur!" His company applied for and received an Innovation Development Scheme grant of $1.5 million from the Economic Development Board (EDB) to develop some of its equipment.<br><br>A National Science and Technology Board grant of $856,000 in 1998 helped the company with research and development.<br><br>More money poured in when the company caught the eye of the EDB's investment arm. In 1996, it took a 15 per cent stake in MIT for $3.5 million, which enabled Mr Kwong's company to expand its product range and hire better-qualified staff.<br><br>EDB's stake, now worth seven times its original input, reflected the recognition MIT was gaining.<br><br>For four years in a row, from 1996, it was among the top 50 privately owned companies in Singapore, winning the Enterprise 50 Award.<br><br>In 1998, Mr Kwong was one of the 10 winners of the Rotary-ASME Entrepreneur of the Year awards.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>TIPS: Getting funds<br><br>Impress on your bank that you know the business environment and outlook in general and your industry in particular: for example, the market size, competition and growth prospects. Highlight your niche.<br><br>Share your business vision, plan/strategy and goals so that your banker is aware of your aims. Goals must be realistic. Present your organisational structure.<br><br>Show your commitment in terms of your investment in the company, both time and money. If you are unwilling to commit yourself, no bank will.<br><br>Over time, demonstrate your ability to meet commitments, to improve earnings and grow.<br><br>Good credit references from customers, suppliers, business associates will help.<br><br>Be prepared to show your bankers your existing/projected financials and cashflow statements so that they have all the relevant information to make a credit assessment.<br><br>Assemble a core competent management team with good business acumen, relevant background, expertise and, most important, integrity.<br><br>Keep to one or two primary bankers and help to build mutual trust. An established cordial banking relationship will go a long way towards helping you when your business expands. -- Contributed by OUB<br><br>The Straits Times, April 2, 2000</div>
