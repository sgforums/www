              <p>no idea. received a lot of calls from mlm companies recently...from eunos and clark quay. the clark quay one i tot is real job. cb, kena conned. i ask "is it mlm?"...the joker said no. den i go down its ENYOUTH. CB. DIRECT SALES. wads the diff??? now they call is SLM: Single Line Marketing. ok their tactic quite similar to other ppls experience.</p>
              <p>1. "Friend" offers to pick you up at MRT station. Why ah? all of them always offer to meet at mrt station.</p>
              <p>2. Brings u to some kopitiam. Talk cock with you non-stop, nothing related to work. I was actually very unamused and sensed sth was wrong then. I asked him about the job, he said later his manager will tell me more. 2nd warning sign.</p>
              <p>3. Suddenly his manager, some chiobu, pops by coincidentally. But before that he was SMSing away. So she comes and talks a bit more cock. But this girl, who is only 26 didn't talk much cock with me. I think she knows I've seen enough to not be so stupid. I'm 24 btw. Her bottomline was : Listen with an open mind den see if you like or not. Nobody will force you. (I really appreciated that part, and this was a confirmation it was MLM)</p>
              <p>4. Finish drink, we go up to the office. Cheapo i'd say. Tour you ard the cheapo place, show you their achievements, achievers with new cars, tell you how successful they are. the same usual shit. damn sian. i been thru this when i was 17, 22, and now 24. =) wonderful. and they nv change tactics, just use different names.</p>
              <p>5. Then a Divisional Manager will come and talk to you. Tell you that working this job is great. Great monetary benefits. Den tell you her/his life story. Sian. Same shit, different company. I think this tactic can only cheat kids.</p>
              <p>6, When its done, they will bring u to their famous kopitiam downstairs, tell u more abt products. and nearby a row of flashy cars are parked and they tell u those cars belong to so n so manager....den get u to meet some of the higher ups. oh wtf. boring...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>comments: they are stupid people. they treat their higher ups like GODS. buy drinks, bow, every stupid thing their managers say they respond with "dui, yes, correct, right". like hitler's fools. sad. its so stupid. all mlm companies always tell us to STAND UP when their manager or whatever big shot comes in. WTF man...i know mlm can make a lot of money. if u haf the contacts. but for there to be kings and princes, there must be fools and the unsuccessful commoners. if u can make it UP there to the royal family, i'd say to you "join lor"...note the lor. if not, dun be someone else's dog. i asked the "fren" who brought me there: if i join u guys, must i do those dog-like things too? he had nothing to say.</p>

              <p>if it's a good established MLM company based on RECURRING sales like healthfood, etc etc, it's okay.................especially in a big country with a big population..........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if it's a short-term MLM scheme involving one-off purchases of ''god knows what'' then it's obviously just a shell game..............then that's another thing, especially in a small country with a small population............this kind of companies always like to disguise their shell game by re-branding it as a ''business' or ''franchise''..................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, it the money involved is not too large, can give it a try....................at least the odds are still way ahead of Toto...........</p>

              <p>Perhaps there's still some confusion in scam, mlm, network marketing/business.</p>
              <p>MLM is Network marketing which is business.</p>
              <p>No such thing as good/bad mlm buisness. It is a system that is used to run the business.</p>
              <p>Example Macdonalds is using a Franchise System, that is Franchise is what we all call as Franchise. It is also a system which Network Marketing companies used.</p>
              <p>As for short term/bad Network Marketing scheme, it is identical to insurance, financial and lawyers who have ill intentions who run off with either company's or clients' money.</p>
              <p>As for the word "try", that's the problem and key cause why people who do Network MArketing Companies mostly say it is a scam, because they treat it like a cheap employment and not a business, thus people try for play play and is not serious, thus 95% of people in network marketing failed by the 3rd year of doing network marketing business or they leave for personal reasons.</p>
              <p>As for Scam, in every and any trade, there are scams, it just depends on whether you are greedy and ignorant to fall into the traps of the 95% of under trained sales distributors who just do what they are told without put on their thinking cap.</p>
              <p>People think it is easy and simple, but I can tell anybody straight in the face, Network Marketing is not a simple trait, if anybody tells you it's simple, you might want to consider revising on your decision to even listen to the distributor who may not know exactly what they themselves are doing or have yet to meet such difficult situations yet.</p>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> the percentage which I've written above are purely based on what I observed since I have started network marketing years back and should not be used as a standard measure, should anybody require statistics, kindly seek professional govt websites and do the calculations yourself.</p>

              <p>now they aim for the young people becoz they're more willing to risk and they're the new market for the new MLM companies. in this kind of thing, all depends on your contacts............</p>
              <p>but many irresponsible uplines will simply lead the new people in and then before these new people can break even or make money, the uplines will be involved in another company or the same company will launch new product...............so only the top people make tons of money while the new recruits lose............</p>
              <p>this kind of companies don't care about long-term as for them it's kind of hit-and-run............once the big bosses make the dough, they'll jump ship..........</p>

              <p>okay, agreed on this.</p>
              <p>in business it's also the same right.</p>
              <p>the business with larger business earns the most. Toyota was previously the highest sales company of cars isn't it thus they earn in volumes. Similar in some ways.</p>
              <p>As for your 2nd line, I suppose you're referring to salesmanship. If it's salesmanship, it can be learned.</p>
