            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, guys.<br>I am new here. Just want to say hi to everybody.<br><br>I would like to ask has anybody heard about this company "Forever Living Products"? I would like to know some comments or anything with regards to this company.<br><br>Anybody care to enlighten me?<br><br>I am approached by plenty of MLM comapny and I must say that there are so many varieties. But which is the best and which is the one that can do. I feel that its so difficult to find.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Below are my PERSONAL OPINIONS towards other companies. I REALLY HOPE someone can tell me that my thinking is wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I AM HERE to LEARN <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>NTI - Its not binary as confirmed by the distributor inside. But somehow feel that there is a similarity. (http://www.ntiparis.com). I must say that the company is aggresive. My friend brought me down to listen to a talk and never tell me about the plan not even the product. Just say u should stay back and chat? So strange.<br><br>NOP - My relatives join and now they switched to Bel' Air. Company at Paya Lebar closed down. I think. Heard its the same founder as NTI.<br><br>Bel' Air - used to be the same as Lamber Gel (sorry for the spelling)? Heard that Taiwan centre has been closed down due to some things. Dun noe true or not.<br><br>Astromat - Heard also cannot do. Sell magnectic matress. But dun noe what method are they using.<br><br>E.Excel - Not a bad company. Just love the office. So classy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The products packaging is also very beautiful. Plan not bad also. 17 yrs liao. They sell cactus juice. Business kit is around $50+. But very impressive by the packaging.<br><br>Armway - Best known for its pots and detergent. Not bad but the shampoo dun suit me. After washing, hair become very oily. 40 yrs of experience. Just dun like to have yearly maintance.<br><br>Herbal Life - Dun like the product. Though heard that it has 24yrs of experience in US. Heard that there is side effects?<br><br>Omegatrend*** - very new. Heard that the CEO of the company is the ex chairman of DSAS. Anyway, the plan is similar to binary but u do not need to balance it. Raw matertials are taken from different manufacturers to be re-packaged into a new product. Variety is much more than Armway&amp; NOP  with lots of things like cookware, brooches, jams, coffee, tea, cakes etc.<br><br>Forever Living - one of the best, I have seen. The distributors are friendly but the office, really no comments <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. Its cheap $18 only and u r entitled to 30% discount on all kinds of products. No maintainace needed. Its selling Aloe Vera. Heard that it supplies around 80% of the world usage. Heard that worldwide sales has reach 2.1 bil in 25 yrs times.<br><br>Anyway, I am still new. Can anybody give me comments. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forever Living's President, Rex Moore was in Singapore 2 weeks ago, and they paid cash in full for a new building, Old Thong Chai Clinic at South Bridge Road.<br><br>They do indeed have a fanstastic product and one of the important test of any MLM business is that would you buy the products without a MLM plan. If it is YES, it is a viable business.<br><br>Secondly, does it have consumables. If yes, it means that consumers will keeping buying it.<br><br>Thirdly, are there a large consumer base.<br><br>So, FLP fulfills all these conditions.<br><br>MLM business is a unique business as it does not require you to come up with heavy capital and if you are ready to work hard, you have a decent chance of success.<br><br>Many people are dissappointed abouy MLM, and they think that it is a scam, payramid scheme and treat MLMers like dirt. Of course, it is true that there are many scammers around, just like there are bad-hats in any industry or occupation.<br><br>SO MLM is NO different. What makes the difference is the strength of the company, its product differentiation, its compensation plan, its support instrastructure, its distributors, and for that matter, your immediate upline.<br><br>So, if you are interested to know more about FLP, do drop me a mail at rthong@singnet.com.sg<br><br>Cheers,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>All i can said is FLP is a great company. As for a previous topic commenting abt  FLP doing advertising using a TAXI, its totally RUBBISH. FLP DO NOT hv to pay for such advertising stunts. The reaons y the TAXI is carrying our FLP is simply because the driver is also FLP's distributor and he wants to let more people know abt FLP.<br><br>Rgd<br>SQuare<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i have been researching into MLM for quite sometime now and like to point out a few important factors on how to choose a good MLM.<br><br>"makelifebetter" has pointed out a few good points in choosing a good company in another thread i just copy what i have written over here hope it's useful.<br><br>1. Company backgroud<br>2. Products<br>3. System<br>4. Timing<br>5. Team<br><br>1. Company backgroud - A good company should be debt free and does not involve in any form of investment and listing. It is a risk for the company if investment is involved and listing only tells u that the company do now have sufficient capital to further expands its business therefore it is looking for shareholders. As MLM meant bringing the products from the manufacturer straight to the the user to reduce product cost. Therefore its is important that the company has the ability to manufacture and distrubute the products itself. Its manufacture and distrubution should not be of different company as it will mean extra cost and possible change of manufacturer.<br><br>2. Products - Not all products should be sold in MLM structure. In MLM repeated sale is important as it will ensure that its distrubutor will have a stable income instead of a one time sale. The product must be expandable, meaning can be used up and need to restock. The product itself must have the ablility to prove its own usefullness. If today u were to setup a company what would u sell? of course u will look for something that is really good and incurr good comment from the consumer and encourage propagation from words of mouth. When a product is good, distrubutor need not push hard sale as the product speaks for itself.<br><br>3. System - After comparing products only a few company is left. Then the system comes in. I have seem quite a few system from various companies but most of them are hard to accomplish. Most company focus on finding extremely strong downline in order to rise up in high level. But that means not everyone can do it, for example some system said that u must have 3 downline which are doing a certain amount of sale inorder to attain a certain level, that also mean that the person need to find very good distrubutor to rise up in level. Some company runs binary plan which mean balance both side to earn. But what happen if i find an extremely strong distrubutor as a downline does it mean i must restrict him from expanding or i will not be able to earn? Therefore a system must allows everyone have an opportunity to success no matter how weak or strong he.<br><br>4. Timing - MLM can be catagorise in to 3 stages young, medium and mature. This catagorises meant the numbers of years the company have survived. Nowadays with comparision to the oldest company in the market. Young suggest company less that 10years, medium range from 11- 30 years and mature mean more that 31 years. Its is good to join a company in the medium range as it is more stable and has less market exposure.<br><br>5. Team - This factor decide whether the distrubutor of the company is pratising MLM correctly. Honestly, Love, Ethic, team work and a lot of other factors contrubutes to the success. The culture induced into the team will reflect alot on the whether the team will put through in the end. Many distrubutor have the thought of if i can sign more people under me i will be success, however this is not true. Success depends on whether the team have the correct attitude to attract other people into the business. Ethic also plays an inportant role. I have seen distrubute not willing to sell a product because it doesn't suit the consumer's needs. Sometime selling a product is not everything in doing business, its the trust and professionalisium that is important.<br><br>There are a lot of other interesting things to share but i'm worried that i type too much. If interested just email me at happy_love_you@hotmail.com for an appointment i will be more that happy to arrange a meet out and have a nice  chat over a cup of coffee.<br><br>People presently working in MLM are also welcome but pls meet me with an open mind as this will allow us to understand more thing. ^_^<br><br>I have did some research on the trend of the next era and the possible reason for the next economic boom. We could make a good fortune if we only know what is coming up next.</div>
