            <div class='col-md body'>I was actually quite keen on the Lampe Berger deal. Look for big investors and you climb fast.<br><br>But not all your recruited can easily find people to be instant Counts. Not everyone out there has $15k to spare. It'll take a while to work their way up from Franchisee to Count.<br><br>The other thing is, going in as a Count, you can only transfer your $15k of stocks out max $1042 at a time, people joining in your FIRST LINE. That'll take quite a while.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heard 2 latest news about them, may be true, maybe not:<br><br>a) They will change the marketing plan and increase to RM45K for the RM30K position. This is expected sooner or later as more and more people know about them with the "30K". By increasing the figure, they can encourage the prospects to join faster and also they(prospects) will not know that so much complaints have been against them in the past.<br><br>b) To create some BIG news and hype to boost their business, Steven Yean announced having a rally soon in Orchard Road inviting their leaders from overseas and renting helicopters from the Singapore government to fetch the leaders for the event. Also claimed Orchard road will be closed.Sure, many leaders will be motivated for the event and spend more money for the trip as they are taught to WANT FACE.<br>Most Scams in MLM always announced some event with "Fake news" to hype up their business. While the Singapore event may be true, as Steven Yeam is trying to take over and save the Singapore market. Their Singapore sales has dropped compared to 2 or 3 years ago.<br>He sure can afford to rent some helicopters BUT claiming that Orchard Road will be closed is definitely false. Later on, he can just say Singapore Government could not approve it in time due to some "unknown reasons". Again, no black and white. Just like their claim that HK TVB apologised to them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SYN Network is similar to Bel Air which is in singapore. They created some kind of story that two brothers fought with each other thus two networks. the only difference is the name. It has been in fact active in malaysia for the past five years, six to come. Before that it was opened once and closed down due to unpopular demand. however, there have been alot of reported problems that this network is a scam and even daily reports, pls forward this thread around<br>the websites are created due to unhappy members which were duped into this scam. please have a good read and investigate before entering this company.<br><br>http://antilampeberger.blogspot.com/<br><br>http://www.brandmalaysia.com/movabletype/archives/2006/04/lampe_berger_a.html#more<br><br>http://lampebergerhelp.blogspot.com/<br><br>lastly,malaysian forums on SYN network<br><br>http://forum.lowyat.net/index.php?showtopic=256356<br><br>http://www.usj.com.my/bulletin/upload/showthread.php?t=8407<br><br>http://www.usj.com.my/bulletin/upload/showthread.php?t=12583</div>

This is expected sooner or later as more and more people know about them with the "30K". By increasing the figure, they can encourage the prospects to join faster and also they(prospects) will not know that so much complaints have been against them in the past.<br><br>b) To create some BIG news and hype to boost their business, Steven Yean announced having a rally soon in Orchard Road inviting their leaders from overseas and renting helicopters from the Singapore government to fetch the leaders for the event. Also claimed Orchard road will be closed.Sure, many leaders will be motivated for the event and spend more money for the trip as they are taught to WANT FACE.<br>Most Scams in MLM always announced some event with "Fake news" to hype up their business. While the Singapore event may be true, as Steven Yeam is trying to take over and save the Singapore market. Their Singapore sales has dropped compared to 2 or 3 years ago.<br>He sure can afford to rent some helicopters BUT claiming that Orchard Road will be closed is definitely false. Later on, he can just say Singapore Government could not approve it in time due to some "unknown reasons". Again, no black and white. Just like their claim that HK TVB apologised to them.</div></blockquote>Why they don rent MRT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  can fetch more associates ma if they care about their own downlines, lagi "best" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Internal news said she joined Lampe Berger.<br><br>Source: http://www.sinchew-i.com/special/missing/i...id=200511221078<br><br>Edit: Add one more thing, ever wonder how Lampe Berger in Asia start? here is the link:<br><br>Link: http://www.geocities.com/joyfulluck/history_of_lb.html<br><br>I know some is lazy to read or dunno chinese so i briefly translate it: Lampe Burger Asia was originated from a company named Al'gomer lead by 黃樹立, but Al'gomer sales not that good so he sell it to a lady called Mrs Soo. Mrs Soo changed the company name to Lampe Burger using pyramid scheme and it was very successful. But later on this company have to bankrupt because the supplier is 黃樹立's father 黃國屏, he make her no more business then take over her company and woalah, here come the all famous Lampe Berger where we see right now. But then 黃樹立's older brother (黃樹雄<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> is very jealous and use some tactics to stop his younger brother to get any supply. So at the end, 黃樹雄 become the leader of Lampe Berger. His younger brother been chased out and have to create another brand called Belair.<br><br>If after reading the history of Lampe Berger you still believe 黃樹雄 is an honest business man then I really got nothing to say.<br><br>Here is link of Next Megazine (HK) further investigation on Lampe Berger, Next Megazine is Hong Kong most popular megazine, if you still doubt this megazine is lying then I'm speechless as well:<br><br>http://www.geocities.com/joyfulluck/news_next.html</div>
