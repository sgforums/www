Its from d namecard offered by Raymond's assistant. Can't verify its 'physical' location cos dey nev brot me 2 d office.<br><br>JAPAN LIFE (JOINT VENTURE)<br>2 TAN QUEE LAN ST<br>PRIMERO PLACE<br>#02-02 S(188091)<br><br>Here's d job-ad i responded 2. Its from The STRAITS TIMES: Wednesday, May 5, 2004.Classified under column 689, 'OTHER'.<br><br>MGMT TRAINEES $3K. Dynamic &amp;<br>young. Overseas incentives trip.<br>ORD welcome. Tel: 91816296<br>hr_dept_04@yahoo.com.sg<br><br>We arranged 2 mit ysterday eve at Shaw Towers. We sat outside dis semi-cafe &amp; restaurant jus located in front of d cinema's ticketin booth. I met his assistant 1st. Dats d guy who answered my cal when i responded 2 d ad. We x-changed sum small-tok b4 he proceeded 2 intro me 2 his 'lao-ban'. Cant rem dis "head-man's "surname, probably cos i was tryin 2 hard 2 digest d turnover figures &amp; pics of himslf in a Japanese Mag. however i do knw his name is Raymond. Incidently, his other men (abt 5 of dem) sat in d table bhind us thru'out d interview. He even showed me his probable new coy logo design.<br><br>Raymond related some of his personal, past experiences 2 me. Dey included his early days of bein a carpenter (showed me his disfigured middle finger on his rite hand....i dink it was his rite), said i reminded him of 1 of his former 'generals' (who incidently 'betrayed' him......said he'll tel me d whole story in due time), told me he treats his colleagues s brothers (asked me 2 check wif anyone there in Asayo) &amp; dat loyalty was important 2 him. Sumwhere along d line he described how dis son of his father's fren, or old-neighbour betrayed him (yes, he used d term 'betrayed' again) after he 'took-care' of him. How his mos-abled man drove Mercedes 200 (1st hand) while he drove a Mercedes 220 (2nd hand) &amp; 5 of dem left him.<br><br>I asked insistently on d basic pay amount. He replied sumdin like:"one's thinkin is affected by his education......" ermmmm....can't recall evrydin he said but eventually it comes 1 loop &amp; ends wif:"......&amp; finally one's thinkin is affected by his experiences...." All very cheem stuff but ultimately, I stil nev found out how much he was gona pay me.<br><br>So I asked him d same ques again. Dis time d ans was slightly improved. He said sumdin like:"....in d old days, evryone was oni given a basic pay.....den it evolved in2 a basic-cum-commission pay structure &amp; finally.....it has evolved in2 a purely commission based wage.....for some coys 2 day"<br><br>Improved but not d ans I wanted. So bein d 'aggressive' man (dats wat he described me) i asked d same ques d 3rd time. WATS D PAY.<br><br>Dis time he ans:" How much do u dink u'r worth?" b4 i cud ans him he cont'd:" Commission is a more stable income den a basic salary although it defies common belief." den he changed his tone of voice (maybe d po piah stuck in throat?) &amp; proceeded:" Don't ask me how much i can pay u. Ask how much u can earn 4 me. I can pay u wateva amt u ask 4 but can u tel me how much can u earn?"<br><br>Den he cont'd;" I was approached by sumone 2 b a motivational speaker &amp; earn $500 an hr. Not bad 4 sum1 like me who stopped skoolin at sec 3. When dat guy left me (i dink he was tokin abt d son of his father's fren or neighbour) i made a loss of $2 million on d time i've spent on groomin him. I'm very glad i didn't suffer a heavier loss. $2 million I can stil 'tahan'. Same ding 2 day. I can guarantee u 2 show u d ropes if u'r eager 2 learn. I'm not afraid 2 fact dat theres no guarantee u won't do d same ding he did. So i'm actually d 1 at d losin end. Wat haf u got 2 lose? All u'v got 2 do is 2 find able men 4 urslf. I wil guide dem &amp; provide support &amp; instil in2 u d knowledge &amp; dat winnin 4mula from my experiences. &amp; in d end, if u dink we can't get along, u can set up ur own coy &amp; jus get d stocks frm me. U'r in a win-win situation!"<br><br>sianz....7:15pm liaoz....&amp; i stil nev found out how much i was gettin paid if i joined.....<br><br>pipi first or poot-poot??<br><br>[/quote]</div>

Let the police go handle the case if you really have doubts. In fact, many ex-employees whom have suffered from their policy of buying sales had reported this to the police from what I know. Though some of the comments here are that it seems that the police r not doing anything.<br><br>However, if the number of cases against this company is large enough, I'm sure they will take action.
