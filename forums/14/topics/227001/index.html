            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1. Unique Product.</strong> Is it a new product category? Or old? Is the product patented, or patent-pending? Or not? Choosing a company of New Product Category ensures that you do not face a negative price pressure. For example, many companies are doing callback and voip services- OSMS, ICENTEL, REDCOM, ESMEGEN- so they have no choice but to compete on price in a technology (I believe) will be made free. Also, don't bother picking something that competes on quality. For example, whether Melaleuca beats Amway is debateable, but people will always remeber than Amway came first in its Household Product category.<br><br><strong>2. Realistic Payplan. </strong> 50% payout? 65%? 90%? There's a difference between high compensation, and high compensation DISTRIBUTION. Well, a good company will provide you with many ways of earning. And more importantly, it must be achieveable quickly, with the correct incentives to make you want to achieve it. Look out for Fast Start Commissions, Good Retail Profits of at least 20%, Car Funds, Expense bonus, Profit Sharings, Team Volume Bonuses, Leverage Matching Bonus, the more the merrier. Many companies like to dangle a huge bait, but leave you to starve as you try to grab it. One company even claim to pay 91% (but in actual fact, pays in Ringgit!). Never be fooled by numbers. If in doubt, ask a neutral!<br><br><strong>3. Financially sound company.</strong> Are they financially secure? How many countries are they in? It is not so much an opportunity cost to join a company that is already in several countries, than one that is only in one country. Start small, end small. Start big, end big. One of the most prolific startups launched simultaneously in 12 countries! The big boys are all backed by some huge venture capital fund or another.<br><br><strong>4. Good management team. </strong> Are the top management experienced just locally, or internationally? What results did they bring their previous companies? Have any of these team members been a marketer themself? If so, such would clearly be a "for the marketeer" kind of company.<br><br>With all these said and done, a good company must possess all four qualities. Not simply a combination of two or three of them. Not sure if your evaluation is good? Ask! [/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>As you guys know I am in Bangkok now. Interestingly, I had my brush with MLM in Bangkok too, however it was an enlightening experience. Let me share.<br><br>Yesterday one of my friends, yes she is a thai, asked us (me and another group of people) out. When she brought us to an Amway mart I knew it was MLM. However instead of being pushy, she merely informed us of products that might be useful for us. Then she proceeded to do her shopping while explaining the various product to us.<br><br>I find this very relaxed manner of introducing people very refreshing. It was informative and not agressive at all. True, she might not earn the thousands like those in Singapore are earning, but she is doing not too badly too.<br><br>Perhaps this is Amway's style? This I am not to sure, but little wonder Amway is still around after such a long time. Their products are reasonably priced and they make you feel welcomed instead of wanting to suck your blood dry.<br><br>Not promoting Amway, just saying it is a much more enjoyable experience than those MLMs I have experienced in Singapore.<br><br>Regards,<br>BKKboy</div>

It will never sustain itself, based on their ever optimistic presentations, the pyramid should explode by the 6th level? But it never does, because of hidden policies that seeks to trick the unsuspecting newcomer. Policies like maintainence are dumb and only ensures that the company has a "reliable" customer base...<br><br>You could do well to check. There are lots more dumb terms and conditions...</div>
