            <div class='col-md body'>Good question.<br><br>Our co is a MLM using the direct buying concept.<br><br>Let me explain the differences :-<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conventional business</strong></span><br><br>Manufacturer --&gt; Agency --&gt; Wholesaler --&gt; Retailer --&gt; User<br><strong>    (M)                   (A)                (W)               (R)              (U)</strong><br><br>From Manufacturer to Retailer, everyone makes money. For instance a can of coke from manufacturer cost a few cents but we are paying so much.<br><br>Later<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Direct Selling(DS)</strong></span> came in,<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Direct Selling Co </span> --&gt; Stockist --&gt; Member --&gt; User<br>Manufacturer<br><strong> (A)                                 (W)               (R)          (U)</strong><br><br>A Direct Selling Co normally manufactures their own star product and sources from other manufacturers. They appoints stockist which distributes to the members where they can buy for own use or sell it to make profit. In DS, a large portion of the income comes from selling.<br><br>Is there a lot difference Conventional business compared with DS?<br>Not much.<br><br><strong>DS Concept : You buy from us, we give special price. You buy some more, you sell you make money.The more you sell, the more you make.</strong><br><br>Direct selling is good and many have suceeded <strong>provided</strong> they overcome 4 obstacles.<br><br>1) 97% Of the people don't like selling. How many people like to knock at people's door to sell soap powder? Definately not me.<br><br>2) Cost/Free. Your friend ask for cost price, so how to make money? Your uncle/auntie say try first, good then buy. Give first, hope they buy.<br><br>3) Delivery/Capital. Do you have time to be a delivery boy for all your members? If you member calls you up to get some product for them, are you going to collect money first or buy the product first? Hopefully they have money to pay you when you deliver.<br><br>4) Undercutting. An older member may have higher commission/discount rate compared with a new member. If you buy from the older member, you can get more discount lah.<br><br>Now back to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Direct Buying</strong></span>,<br>................................ <strong>Pay $$</strong><br>...................... <strong><span style="color: darkred;">[color=red]&lt;---------------------</span>[/color]</strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Direct Buying Co</strong></span>  ......    <strong>1 price system</strong>  ....... <strong>User</strong><br><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br>........................<strong> <span style="color: darkred;">[color=red]----------------------&gt;</span>[/color]</strong><br>.......................<strong>Deliver Direct(Courier)</strong><br><br><strong>            (A)                                                                   (U)</strong><br><br>DB does not manufacture, only Research and Development. Of course sourcing from other manufacturers. as a member, you pay direct to DB and the products delivery directly to your door steps.<br>With the one price system, everyone buys the same price, how to sell to make money? Buy yourself to use lah.<br><br><strong>DB Concept: You buy from me, I give you discount. You tell your friend to buy from me. I give your friend discount, you also get discount and on top of that, I pay you money.Help your friend to make money, you get more money</strong><br><br>From the different type of Co, you should be able to see where the $$$ comes.<br><br>Compare both DS and DB concept, which is better? You be the judge. Need to know more...email me at <span style="color: darkred;">benwong99@hotmail.com</span>.<br><br>Meantime, can anyone answer my questions on the legal issues?<br><br>Cheers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As expected, we always get such remarks. Some will see it too good to be true. Some will see to good to miss out.<br><br>I have never believe in any MLM b4, neither have any of my uplines but when I saw the real thing and the proven results right b4 our very own eyes, the same night I signed up and started the business.<br><br>Some people wants to see first then believe.<br>Some people see but still don't believe.<br>Some people don't want to see, don't want to believe.<br>Some people believe then see.<br><br>Which category are you in? I know this business is not for everyone and the fact is not everyone will follow me in this journey. People who wants more in life,have dreams and goals whether it be financial freedom, more time, more money, protection against job loss, early retirement, education fund and lifestyle, can actually achieve it in this business.<br><br>Do you like Saturday and Sunday? In this business, everyday can be a Saturday or Sunday, whatever you decide. Ever thought about it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> More time yourself, girlfriends, boyfriends and family.<br><br>Have you thought about your retirement savings or Residual Income -earn even when you stop working? Have anyone actually thought of retiring at the age of 25?30?35? or 40? Don't let Age of 55 determine your retirement. Let money decide when you should retire. Retire young and rich does not meant you have to stop working. You can work as long as you can, if you enjoy working.<br><br>Do you like the life you have now? Do you like what you are doing now? If yes, congratulations, good to know you are somewhere. If no, why not take a look at what we have to offer. I couldn't imagine if my introducing member was not presistence enough and force me go to have a look in this business, where would I be? I would still living my life day in day out without dreams.<br><br>Have you ever imagine earing a minimum of SGD40K a month? Imagine if I were to give you SGD40K this month, what would you do? Another SGD40K next month. Again on the following month? You like it? Cannot believe? Then have a look lah.<br><br>The difference between what you are today and what you want to be, is the choices you make. Only you can sign the death warrant to your dreams. How?

I know this business is not for everyone and the fact is not everyone will follow me in this journey. People who wants more in life,have dreams and goals whether it be financial freedom, more time, more money, protection against job loss, early retirement, education fund and lifestyle, can actually achieve it in this business.<br><br>Do you like Saturday and Sunday?

Have anyone actually thought of retiring at the age of 25?30?35? or 40? Don't let Age of 55 determine your retirement. Let money decide when you should retire. Retire young and rich does not meant you have to stop working. You can work as long as you can, if you enjoy working.<br><br>Do you like the life you have now? Do you like what you are doing now? If yes, congratulations, good to know you are somewhere. If no, why not take a look at what we have to offer.

            <div class='col-md body'>I would agree with antoh on the leveraging. If one could understand and make full use of it, dreams are achievable.<br><br>People like to comment "pyramid lah, this lah, that lah" but there is doubt on what they know what is a pyramid scheme. Seriously, do they really know what is the difference between pyramid and direct selling or pyramid and MLM. Could it be one have a bad experience on pyramid schemes and put the blame on MLM? Blame it on human nature if that is the case. Could it be one have been misled by the so-called friend to joined an MLM or out of giving face/obligation or didn't choose the right one? Blame it MLM or...?<br><br>I always like to find out from the people I meet why they make such remarks. There is always some bad experience behind. Rarely, there are cases without reasons, if so, these are the people who wants to get on your nerves,  just agree with them and they will shut up.<br><br>I can't change the mindset of people, they have to want to change. We can only be an agent of change.<br><br>I would recommend 3 good books that have change my thinking and life which is Rich Dad Poor Dad, Cashflow Quadrant and Retire Young Retire Rich by Robert T Kiyosaki. If you have the mentality of "Employee", these book will change your mindset. I dare you to read it.<br><br>After the reading 3 books, email me at benwong99@hotmail.com, I will recommend a few CDs/books that will help you make better choices.<br><br>The differences of what you are today and what you want to be is the choices you make. So make good choices.<br><br>Ciao.</div>
