Emcom or Sunshine-Empire is not a listed company, and just started this year therefore i don't think there will be any annual report.  But we do get some executive summary.<br><br>3.  The lots in Emcom is not shares (for your info).  You are not buying shares or stocks of the company.  Those you are buying is call investment lots, therefore if the emcom incur any loss you no need to bump in money.<br><br>About your question why big companys or bank is not involved.  I can only say there is bank and other company involved just that i don't have exact info about it.  There's reasons why this project is done in MLM form, here's 2 of them.<br><br>1.  Mouth to Mouth advertise is the fastest maketing to spread of a news.  For eg.  we already have more than 1 thousands plus investor with 3 months.  We want to create a prosumers market not just consumers.<br><br>2.  Our IP is a Networker therefore his project he always involved into MLM.  I asked before why too, and the answer was that he want all his networkers under his companies to benefit.  I know its crazy and no one will believe, but thats just the truth.<br><br>Out technology is true as our technology team (Taiyee) now is also helping another company call WeMax to build their Wireless project in GaoXiong, just for your info WeMax is also looking for partners to help them in their projects.<br><br>And all these is private project no govt aids is needed.<br><br>5.  I personally went there, and photos is also taken if you want to clarify i can show you.<br><br>6.  About the chq i can't comfirm too, so no comments.<br><br>Last dun worry this will not become a flaming session <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
