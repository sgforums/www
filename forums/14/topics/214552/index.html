            <div class='col-md body'>All Singaporeans to enjoy free wireless broadband access in public areas for 2 years<br>By Asha Popatlal, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 10 October 2006 2035 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE: From January next year, all Singaporeans will get to enjoy free wireless Internet in public areas for two years.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shared this and other initiatives at a dinner marking 25 years of infocomm achievements.<br><br>Mr Lee also painted a vision where IT businesses can grow and jobs created as Singaporeans get wired island-wide.<br><br>To make sure no one is left behind, he said money is going to be pumped in to help three groups - needy students, the disabled and the elderly get onto this IT journey.<br><br>For many Singaporeans, whether at work or play, their lifestyle - from using cell phones to instant messaging - is already digital.<br><br>The government wants to take one step further and make it all mobile.<br><br>So, from January 2007, it will be rolling out wireless broadband Internet in all public spaces, called Wireless@SG, for free, for the first two years.<br><br>Premium and higher access speeds will also be immediately available - but this will come at a fee.<br><br>"Thereafter, access is expected to remain highly affordable. So, with just your laptop or PDA, you can enjoy high speed connection to the Internet, send out instant messages and check emails and even make VOIP (voice-over-IP) calls," said Mr Lee.<br><br>Singaporeans will be able to surf all over downtown, major town centres, recreational areas like East Coast Park, and maybe even at libraries and fast food outlets.<br><br>Three operators - iCELL network, QMax Communications and SingTel - have been appointed to do this.<br><br>They will carve out the island into three areas, and complete their deployment by end-September next year.<br><br>The government hopes this will grow the broadband market from the current 50,000 users to about 250,000 users in two years.<br><br>Business-wise, a new office has been created to drive R&amp;D in the field of Interactive and Digital Media, one of three new areas of development for the Singapore economy.<br><br>The aim is to create 10,000 more new jobs by 2015 and contribute $10m to the economy, up from the $3.8m contributed in 2003.<br><br>It will target niche areas like creating games, which is already a multi-million dollar industry, within an Asian context,<br><br>"It was a leap of faith into the unknown when we took the infocomm plunge in 1981. The lesson from the last 25 years is that we must continue to track closely the changes around us and respond promptly when opportunities emerge. By the time a trend becomes obvious to everyone, we may have already missed the train," said Mr Lee.<br><br>Mr Lee noted that many global IT companies are already here whilst opportunities are now opening up in the region.<br><br>He said IDA will support promising local enterprises to grow globally and to build capabilities to deliver large-scale projects.<br><br>As Singaporeans race forward on the IT journey, Mr Lee says special interest groups must not be left behind.<br><br>At least 14 percent of households still do not have computers.<br><br>Under an enhanced programme, at least 10,000 needy families with school-going children can look forward to getting a brand new computer for less than $300, bundled with three years of unlimited broadband access.<br><br>This programme will be co-funded by the IDA that will come up with $12m while industry partners will contribute another $19m.<br><br>Special Infocomm Accessibility Centres will be set up to train the disabled, and senior citizens will get help to click their way through the IT maze. - CNA /dt<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>By end of next year this company won't even have a place to hang their hat in the whole of SG. They are being totally cut out of the pie in SG already. So do you think they can make it in Taiwan? They can fulfill the promise to their investors? $300 USD into $3000 plus USD in 3 to 5 years? I KNOW they will not be able to do so.</div>

They haven't even won the bid in Taiwan. And NTI is not the one building the whole thing also. They are just dragging people in to throw their money so they can give the other company whois supposed to be building the wireless project. SG also cannot get bid they wanna say they can get in Taiwan? Idle kids dreaming silly dreams. Your point is right also. Since NTI has been arouind for more than 3 years, Why don't they go straight to DBS for business expansion Loan, up to $200,000.00 and above. You know why they can't do that? lol.<br><br>Because they would have to show profit/loss statements for the past two years before qualifying for the loan, and now no bank in SG want to touch them with a ten foot pole because Mr. Successful Director Driving the diarrhea-BMW already owe more than $150,000.00 in bad debts, due to the previous failure of the Haunted Clubhouse at morington cresent. If you add BOTH "SUCCESSFUL DIRECTORS" together Their total combined debt more than $200,000 already. So the only alternative is?<br><br>Ask stupid people into NTI to throw their money to finance their half-fark project lor. So in the end promise people this, promise people that, just to get them to part with their money, with absolutely NO PLAN on how to fulfill those empty promises.</div>
