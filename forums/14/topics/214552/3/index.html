            <div class='col-md body'>I was in this place just last week. Firstly, 1 guy will talk to you and introduce you the company and all that crap. So after about 30-45mins, he ask got any questions and just ask me to sign the contract. I was like WTF...30mins and you expect me to put s$700 into it? So i told him i not really interested and i do not really trust what they saying. Then i ask for their Annual Report and all stuffs regarding the company. They cant produce it and ask me to go to their website to check. The Website doesnt even have any stuff regarding investor's relations. The guy tried to divert attention by saying they are accredited by the SG govt. by showing all those IDA documents and how the Blue Engine Company went to bid for the wireless project by SG govt.<br><br>So that guy begin to taunt me. It goes like this... "Wahh Lao, even a girl dares to sign don't tell me you, as a guy doesnt dare to sign". So what does all these got to do with sex? After realizing that i'm a hard target, that guy got another "senior" to try and psycho me. Talked for another 20mins plus and still did not manage to convince me. So that 2nd guy used the same method to taunt me. But still no use. It ended with me leaving the place without signing anything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually i've heard about all these companies but being the first time in these companies, i wanted to see what is it all about.<br><br>After all these, i went home and beginning to dig out more doubts about it.<br>- The place was filled mostly by youngsters.<br>- Failed to produce any annual reports when asked.<br>- If the said project is so good, investors would have come to them and not them going out to approach people for money for the project.<br>- Website got nothing about investor's relation (both sunshine and Encom)<br>- Bragging about 400 people going to taiwan to try out the system.<br>- Brag about how a malaysian datuk went down with 1 billion USD and give to director to invest in project.<br><br>Thats all folks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Yes most members is youngsters but most investor is older, and in middle age too.<br>2.  What kind of annual report do you want ?  From Emcom or Sunshine-Empire ?<br>3.  Hmm, insurance is good for us too, so why we need FA when we can go to the insurance company to buy ourselve ?<br>4.  Emcom has a section for Investor Relation, please look more into it.<br>5.  400 people going taichung is not brag, its real.  I just came back from taiwan and 4 flight is booked to go, my SQ 867 flight alone is 100+ people already.<br>6.  I am not too sure about this one billion USD chq as i only know about it but never saw it personally.<br><br>Conclusion is the person who bring you down and the manager who introduce you is not doing a good job enough, thats all ~<br>And they should not have make those remarks to you.  But please do not think everyone is the same.</div>
