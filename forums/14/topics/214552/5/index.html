            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I am new to this forum and I find a lot of flaming going on. I think we should jus concentrate on presenting the facts. As potential investors, everyone has the right to ask questions, cross examine the project inside out. Only a fool will invest without knowing the product well.<br><br>To start with, I am a investor with EmCom.Let me attempt to address a few issues in this forum.<br><br>1. There are questions on the legitimacy of this whole thing. I wish to state that when EmCom started out, it started out with an initial capital of $2Mil ( I will find the website to prove this). Any company with such a high start up capital has very strong backing behind it. Emcom is backed by Sunshine Alliance. A very big company with around 7 major companies in partnership with them. they also have major and diverse investment portfolios. A company so big and diverse will not want to tarnish its reputation by associating with a scam<br><br>2. People have been receiving their monthly renumeration without fail. Every single investor ( or at least the many i checked with). Yes, I know the returns are very high and people tend to be overly suspicious. Why are the returns so high? primarily because this wireless technology is the next in thing. Seamless wireless technology, where ever you go, not just a collection of hotspots.<br><br>3. The project in Taichung has been extremely successful so far and may even be completed months ahead of schedule. many investors were brought to Taiwan to test out the technology and it is working perfectly fine. Emcom has since expanded its reach to Taipei , Cambodia and many other countries. You may get regular updates at emcombeyond.blogspot.com<br><br>4. Emcom is currently planning to introduce a whole host of other services together with its wireless provision. These will be implemented in the long run and will eventually bring in more revenue.<br><br>5. Your investment is guaranteed under Singapore Law.<br><br>6. The last few lots for the Taichung project will be cleared by the end of this month. the returns for these last few lots will be three times the normal amount next month.<br><br>Hope I have been of help. Any questions, please PM me. Thank You</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am quite curious abt pt 5, as can be seen in the swisscash saga<br><br><blockquote>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has confirmed that Swiss Cash or Swiss Mutual Fund is included in the MAS' Investor Alert List (IAL). This is a list of companies or individuals that may be conducting activities not regulated by the MAS.<br>.<br>The list can be found at www.moneysense.gov.sg/check_our_list/Consumer_Portal_IAL.html.<br>.<br>By giving Singaporean investors the false impression that they are operating in Singapore or by sometimes using names similar to entities regulated by the MAS, these companies are able to attract Singapore consumers, the MAS' website said.<br>.<br>Consumers who deal with firms that are not regulated by the MAS will not get recourse to compensation if they lose money on their investments, the central bank said.<br><br>It added that the promotion of the fund seems to work via agents on a multi-level marketing or MLM system, which appears to closely resemble a pyramid scheme.</blockquote></div>

I know the general perception is once you go there, you will be 'psychoed' to sign up. This is not true. You will be there to be told information and to ask any questions you may have. This will be the best way to clarify your doubts. Should you request, you may be shown the copy of the contract itself to allay your fears. For those who are genuinely interested for more information on the relations talk or whatever else, please PM me.</div></blockquote>Excuse me, every damn company is registered under the Companies Act and has to submit their financial accounts to ACRA. This is the norm. Thus its bounded by the local laws, but not guaranteed by the local laws. So, again, what is guaranteed by local laws??<br><br></div>

NTI has gathered more than 40 million or more and its liability is only 2 million. Should NTI declares bankrupt, you can only claim up to 2 million from the  shareholders. Unless there is proper corporate governance in place to monitor/track them and should the directors be proven negligent, fraudalent and broke the law, you can then proceed with civil suits to claim damages (look up the NKF story). If there is no such system in place, do you think you can prosecute them under any laws in Singapore for any misconduct?<br><br>As for gurantees, if you wanna gurantee investments and you have over 40 million bucks in investor liability, how much do you think Sunshine need to have? The company would need to have over 40 million in cash reserves, gold or shares in order to promise this. If you can show us proof of that, dont you think you need to question why do they need  you to raise money through the MLM way in the first place?<br><br>Hope this will help you.</div>
