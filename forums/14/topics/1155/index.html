            <div class='col-md body'>To answer your questions:<br><br>1. Respect yourself, respect your partner and expect to be respected in kind.<br>2. As light travels faster than sound, so does one's appearance before their personality.  It's logic and pure human nature.<br>3. Attraction to particular aspects of a person is dependent on the individual.  Different people appreciate different things, and for some more than others, it's important.<br><br>And while we're on the topic, ever wonder why men love checking out women? Even if these women have partners? Or, if these men have partners?<br><br>Simply put, one's man's meat is another man's fancy.  It's our biological instinct to seek out the most promising mates for survival and the perpetuation of one's species, or in this case, genetic material.  It's not a question of fidelity, it's nature.<br><br>But control of one's emotion and instinct is what makes us human, which in this case, gives us the virtue of fidelity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One man's meat is another man's poison. How true that is... a girl may be the devoted, caring girlfriend, affectionate and spontaneous in her affections, and be openly communicative, and yet...a  man who seeks freedom and space of his own, who prefers to indulge in his career, finds her a burden and chore to be with.<br><br>It depends on one's priorities in life. At the start, it may be her warmth, her cheerfulness that attracts him, but the moment he sweeps her off her feet...he wants his own space, and even if she's the sort of girlfriend most other men may hanker after... he is unappreaciative of it, simply because his priorities lie elsewhere... coz he may prefer to spend time at his work, etc etc...  not to say he doesn't love her anymore, its' just that... she may want to spend more time with him, but he doesn't have that sort of time.<br><br>Clash of interest. And thus... even if 9 out of 10 men find her the ideal, girlfriend for them, he doesn't think she is a good girlfriend, coz he feels she's too clingy.<br><br>What makes a good girlfriend? You can list down all the qualities of what she needs to have, and yet... when you meet the person you fall in love with, sometimes you just don't give a shit whether or not she's a good girlfriend, as long as she's with you. They say that love is blind.... and sometimes, we just willingly blind ourselves to the faults of our partners.<br><br>------------------<br>"Old friends pass away, new friends appear.<br>It is just like the days.

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;what u say is so true... the part abt how  a guy may feel his gf is clinging becos he wants a lifestyle focused on other aspects<br>then what do u suggest the gal do?<br><br>Frankly, communication is the best way to deal with such a problem. Talk it out with him...tell him you cherish the relationship, ask him why is it he seems to want to keep a distance. Perhaps, without realising it, he is commitment shy - and if so... what's the real reason behind it?<br><br>Sometimes, men need a real wacking in order to realise they could just lose a perfectly beautiful relationship if they do not cherish it.<br><br>But ultimately, at the end of the day... two people in a relationship may be so different when it comes to prioritizing, that there's no way the two can be happy, unless one party changes his/her priorioties. That takes sacrifice. But not everyone can do that, without feeling utterly wretched and miserable.<br><br>As we all know... a relationship is about give and take. Some people give more, some people take more. How does one refrain from giving (love), if they are naturally affectionate? You can't stop yourself from feeling and caring for the other party. You can't stop yourself from feeling hurt when he prefers to spend his time elsewhere, rather than with you.<br><br>And perhaps, he can't stop himself from needing his own private space, and NOT wanting to spend more time with you.<br><br>In cases like these... perhaps, in the long term... the couple may not be absolutely suitable for each other. I do not propose a break up...because I believe that every relationship can be worked out, as long as the two people genuinely love each other and WANT the relationship to work. That means two sides putting in effort, time and care. That means...COMMITTMENT to make things work.<br><br>Alas, a lot of people give up half way... granted, tis always easier to start a new relationship on a fresh slate... rather than work on a draining, stale relationship. Even on the pretext of "love", many people just do NOT love enough, but we just continue to lie to ourselves that we do. Maybe this self-deception makes us feel better that we ARE capable of loving, instead of being selfish to our own wants and needs.<br><br>&gt;is it wrong to want to spend more time with your partner?<br><br>No it isn't. To me, it is a very natural expression of love. What's so unnatural about wanting to be close to your loved one?<br><br>&gt;and how when he doesn't want to do so?<br><br>Well... worst case scenario..sometimes, we just have to accept the fact that some people are so different, it's gonna be real difficult to stay together. One of you may end up truly miserable.<br><br>You can try to adapt to his mode of life style, but you may end up feeling lonely, detached...emotionally unfulfilled. Question is - how long can one last in a relationship where there is a lack of emotional fulfillment?<br><br>Weeks/months/years? I don't know...  but I sure know that it's potential for danger if someone else comes along and seemingly provides you with everything else your beau cannot offer. It could spell doom, gloom, and...*gasp* INFIDELITY. Don't risk it.<br><br>I know I said "everything can be worked out". But question is..."do you want to spend the rest of your life working it out???". Or would you rather go for someone who is seemingly "more suitable" for you?<br><br>------------------<br>"Old friends pass away, new friends appear.<br>It is just like the days.

I mean, yeah, your gal need NOT be a babe but at least must be PLEASANT in the guy's eyes rite? All those talk abt character is BULLSHIT!

LOOKS still come FIRST!<br><br>Also, a guy usually likes gals who are demure and homely I guess! It has always been the case. I hope I am NOT generalising.

Apparently, ALL my guy friends are like that! *SHRUGS*<br><br>They say, there are 3 categories of gals!<br>1) Can NV be my gf kind<br>2) Can ONLY be gf and NOT a wife kind, one I can only have FUN wif.<br>3) Can go for long-term relationsp kind<br><br>Usually the 3) category will be the DEMURE and GENTLE sort..... rite? *GRINZ* So wat? That means that ALL gals must turn demure and hmely b4 they can find a long term bf or a husband? *LUFFZ*<br><br>Hey guys! Wat are u all tinking? Wat's the attraction about demure and gentle gals?

            <div class='col-md body'>The statement that guys do go for looks 1st, I have to disagree. However I do agree that men do oggle at deserving women when they come along. That does not mean losing their focus on what means most to them. For those who have degraded us men in this topic by suggesting that boob size matter, let me suggest using your strong hand or visiting your friendly neighbourhood makeshift VCDs stall.<br><br>For the women who think all men are just horny b*****ds, how many of you can touch your hearts and say the qualities you look for in a partner are not at least 3 of the following charisma, credits, cash, condo and car?<br><br>The point I am trying to drive across is that one cannot make a sweeping statement against the opposite gender. We are all individuals, not all men think only of sexual appeal, not all women seek material qualities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This topic like appears in EVERY forum Ive been into.<br><br>KTE - kudos to you. at least you are honest.<br><br>to the guys who say character comes first..where have you been all my life coz Ive never met anyone even resembling you at all b4. Haha.<br><br>But I truly believe that guys go for sweet, demure girls. My ex used to say that all guys want 'face'. If you have got a bitch, like me, for your gf. Well, just guess how the relationship will turn out?<br><br>Am thinking I will be left on the shelf forever. Am not sweet, demure or even nice. Sigh.<br><br>I think its great that guys can actually say that they look for looks first in a girl. But if after knowing her, her character sux, no matter how gorgeous she is they will not be interested. come on, its totally true. I am the same. this kind of thing is you know I know but no one wants to say it out loud.<br><br>Hey, guys. those of u who go clubbing or pubbing. When u pick up girls at these places, what are u looking for? A conquest, friendship, sex or what?<br><br>If the girl gives you her number, would u feel that she is cheap coz if she can give u her number she can give it to a dozen more guys?<br><br>Juz wondering. Its a very interesting topic I feel. Cheers<br><br></div>
