I'm very good - better than Warren Buffett,' he declares, referring to the United States investment guru.<br><br>Mr Phang claims to control more than US$300 million (S$439 million) in assets.<br><br>'We acquire companies like you go to market buying beancurd,' says Mr Phang, a motivational speaker who claims to have over one million students worldwide.<br><br>'When I begin my seminars, my loyal participants would shout: 'Father, I love you!',' he says.<br><br>Mr Phang, 48, is a charismatic adviser to Sunshine Empire, a multilevel marketing (MLM) firm that has proven to be very popular - but also controversial.<br><br>Diversified business<br><br>BARELY 16 months into operations here, his MLM arm, Sunshine, was last month placed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS') investor alert list. This list names people or firms who may be conducting activities regulated by the MAS without authority.<br><br>Mr Phang, who works from a huge office in the Toa Payoh hub, is the founder, director and international president of Empire Group Alliance, a group spanning several Asian countries.<br><br>Sunshine is part of the group, but Mr Phang does not own it.<br><br>The group has interests in network marketing, entertainment, energy, real estate, telecommunications, health and beauty, insurance, and finance.<br><br>Its property arm, Empire Property Venture, is involved in several projects in Malaysia worth US$200 million. These include the 30-storey Empire State Tower in Kuala Lumpur, Sunshine Villa - which will house a medical centre - as well as a marine theme park with underwater accommodation in Malacca.<br><br>Empire Group's assets exceed US$300 million, he says.<br><br>Mr Phang is careful to emphasise that he 'will not harm anyone and my businesses are legal'.<br><br>He says it has taken five years to conceive Sunshine's business model, which he calls revolutionary and superior to others.<br><br>At Sunshine, people signing up as merchants under specific plans to shop on its online shopping platform get consumer rebates known as 'e-points', which can be used for online shopping or converted to cash. The rebates are not guaranteed.<br><br>Core belief<br><br>UNLIKE other MLM firms, Sunshine does not require its 'merchants' to meet a certain sales volume every month - part of its attraction.<br><br>Sunshine's online shopping platform reflects Mr Phang's belief in creating wealth.<br><br>'We have entered into an era whereby imagination is much more important than knowledge and creativity, much more effective than productivity,' he says.<br><br>Humble roots<br><br>MR PHANG'S vast business empire belies a humble beginning. Growing up at a vegetable farm in Lim Chu Kang, he worked hard to pay for his studies through various jobs, including construction work.<br><br>He left school after O levels and worked at a shipyard while studied for his A levels at night. A medical condition caused his left eye to go blind when he was sitting for his final exams at the National University of Singapore (NUS).<br><br>After graduating from NUS with a degree in economics and statistics, he joined the Chinese evening paper, Shin Min Daily News, where he worked as a features writer from 1984 to 1990.<br><br>He, however, found his niche in sales, starting at age 19 with door-to-door sales, selling AMC stainless steel cooking utensils, health items and other various products.<br><br>'I've sold everything. I'm a walking MLM dictionary. My aim is to grow Sunshine to be a global leading MLM firm with US$2 billion by next year,' he says.<br><br>He started MLM firm Number One Product, which sold magnetic mattresses, in 1990.<br><br>The Empire Group Alliance was set up in 2003.<br><br>Mr Phang is married with four children, ages 13 to 21.<br></div>

However, the news said that SE is a subsidary company of the Empire Group Alliance and if anything happens to SE, it will also reflect badly on his organisation. And also, If he is not related to SE in anyway, why is his face on the news.?<br><br>And also what do you mean by 'it is not a complete story without bringing in Emcom into the picture.' ?</div>

Came across the Newspaper this morning so decided to come Sgforums to take a look.<br><br>Based on what I understand about the media, I believe everyone should know that the media more or less tends to add abit more spice to any stories. Therefore,  James Phang made a casual comment, but because of that, the media made use of a simple phrase and bolded it. And also, I believe James Phang is one who converse more in Chinese more than english. Hence, I believe that perhaps the real meaning of his intention in this exclusive interview was lost in translation.<br><br>Well, based of the article, there is nothing positive or negative about this Prime story, it neither said that it is an illegal scheme nor did it promote this program.<br><br>But one thing im quite puzzled, if this whole scheme is a scam, unless there is a bigger mastermind behind it, I see no reason for James Phang( the president) to appear in the media. Because, if im a thief, I wont stand out and show everyone my face, let alone giving the interview. It is either James Phang is very confident about his idealogy or he is confident that his scam will pull off.<br><br>Cheers for this could be a revolutionary concept in the world right now or a biggest scam in the world after SwissCash. </div></blockquote>Well, Phang said that is the adviser, so no matter what happen, only the poor 28 years old CEO will face the Music, not James Phang.<br><br>JP siad that what he is doing is baove board ... remember what the Youth Challenge boss said when he was investigated?   "I am above Board" haha<br><br>You notice that all the companies are affiliates ... i.e. thery are seperate entities .... very smart JP, very well plan from the start ... well, he already said, I am better than Warren B. I am the MLM GURU, I am YOU FATHER ....<br><br>good luck for those who are still not awake at this last hour ... if I have have invested ... I will redeem every dame thing now, be it Cash or product ... PDAs , mobile phone as ... etc just GET OUT Fast .... empire can also collaspe<br><br></div>

(worth 300 mil, he claims), and well, if he is stupid, i dont think he is able to create such a stir up to an extend whereby in forums, pple are willing to spend their precious time talking about him (including me, ha!).
