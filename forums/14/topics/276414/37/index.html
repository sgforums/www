There were emotional scenes as many people broke down in tears after being told of the company's imminent closure.<br><br>"It's not right", some of the people, as young as 17, lining up at the counter to process their refund, said. "My parents invested almost all of their life savings in this scheme, now they can't even withdraw their funds".<br><br>Many investors have threatened legal action against the most visible people responsible for this farce, including the company's mentor and adviser, as well as the company's president. At press time, they were not available for comment. A junior manager of the company sneered, "do whatever you want, you can't do anything to us, we are united! Our managers are all driving luxury cars and making 5 and 6 figure monthly salaries! Come sue us if you dare!"<br><br>The attitude of a rat with nothing else to lose, standing on board the bridge of a sinking ship.

            <div class='col-md body'>I just read the TNP article on Sunshine Empire.<br><br>It mentioned that Sunshine Empire is not related to the companies like Emcom, Emall or Empire property Venture.<br><br>There is something very confusing about the Empire group Alliance (EGA).<br><br>Isn't Sunshine Empire a part of EGA? Together with Emall, Emcom, Empire Property Venture?<br><br>If they are totally unrelated, then why should Emall gave Sunshine Merchants 10% of their monthly turnover?<br><br>Or why should Emcom give Sunshine Merchants free call-back systems.<br><br>How come Sunshine Villa is for sale only to Sunshine Empire merchants?<br><br>Are there seperate contracts between the Merchants and Emall &amp; Emcom?<br><br>The generous monthly payout to Merchants are known as CRP or Consumer Rebate Privileges.<br><br>There is another payout known as CLP or Consumer Loyalty Privileges, which is (quoting from the SE Starter Kit) "profits generated from the worldwide effort of our Most valued Prime Status Independent International Merchants."<br><br>The CLP is as much as 60,000 epoints, which has not started yet.<br><br>What exactly is CLP?<br><br>I always thought it is future profits generated from the companies under the EGA, to be payout to Sunshine Merchants.<br><br>At least that is what I was introduced to, at the Toa Payoh Macdonald. That the only way to tap into the future growth of EGA is through Sunshine Empire.<br><br>In SE News section, there are headlines that seemed to indicate that the activities of the other EGA companies are connected to SE.<br><br><strong>Great News!
