            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I've a friend who is now working in this so called a company that are trying to absorb fund from the public retailer *Uncle auntie granny*.<br><br>They offered a few scheme where I think it's rubbish but attractive in marketing to greedy people.<br><br>Buy 1 GP for nearly S$12,000 and every month you can get back about average 10%<br>But you are not able to sell your GP back to company again. If people who doesn't know this They will keep on buying GP when they got the profit and Up till when the company starts to pay low return to the Gp that holder has, they can't sell it away and will stuck their money in the company, it can't be a shares to have a voting right to say anything. They are doing Taiwan 'Dan Shui' Islandwide Internet Wifi...<br><br>I heard about this project, but i doubt they will be doing this.<br>So my point to this company will be a Scam in the long term when they can't absorb anymore fund they will collaspe and run away, meanwhile they're earning ..... People who just buy 1 GP... Just leave it there and stop buying, So you will be getting back your 100% in 10months time.... So Please comment</div>
