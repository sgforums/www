Sunshine is part of the group, but Mr Phang does not own it.<br><br>MLM firms, which are legal here, typically invite people to pay cash for the right to market goods to other people. They also get cash for recruiting other MLM marketers.<br><br>Under Sunshine's scheme, people usually put down $12,000 to become a 'merchant', as it calls users of its online shopping platform offering thousands of goods, including health supplements, lingerie and electronics goods.<br><br>After signing up, they can buy Sunshine's online goods.<br><br>But they are also rewarded with potentially hefty cash rebates, though these are not guaranteed. Merchants can build their own sales force as well.<br><br>The scheme is structured in such a way that participants are not required to use the rebates to buy Sunshine's goods.<br><br>The cash rebates are based on Sunshine's global turnover. The option of converting the rebates into cash only makes Sunshine more attractive than other MLM firms where people must maintain sales quotas.<br><br>Sunshine also operates in Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, and has 50,000 merchants. It plans to expand to the United States by next year.<br><br>According to its marketing brochure, Sunshine projects global monthly turnover of US$100 million ($146 million) for December.<br><br>By Lorna Tan<br><br></strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Hmmmm, i thought only one project that got up, the rest still "on-going".<br>Wow, as bold as a lion, going after Uncle Sam Ass.<br>If CAD clears SE, oh my oh my oh my, better start going to Q at SE for a Lower Priced GP, before it surged to 20k a GP~"<br></span><br><br>off topics,<br>so far any "bad" news that posted by ST never get a slammed down? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

Inside the device in front of you are two antidotes for the poison coursing through your veins.

It's similar to the game you play as a MLM Merchant, the game of giving hope to the desperate. I think we can agree that your situation is desperate, so I'm going to offer you hope.

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Sunshine Empire is a network marketing company. It is not an investment company. It is associated with the Empire Group Alliance (EGA) and through EGA to other companies. However, Sunshine Empire itself is a solely a network marketing company.<br><br>2. Sunshine Empire is on the alert list by MAS and Malaysia Securities Commission. However, neither body has charged Sunshine Empire with any illegal or misappropriates activity.<br><br>3. Sunshine Empire believes in the power of leveraging. Hence it works in business association with other companies which are legally-unrelated to it. It is for the purpose of developing business opportunity and marketing positioning only.<br><br>4. Press reports on Sunshine Empire from the middle October have been garbled and inaccurate on the issue of Sunshine Empire and Empire Group Alliance (EGA). The media confuse EGA and other associate (but legally unrelated) companies with Sunshine Empire. They lump everything together and so allege that Sunshine Empire is financial investment scheme. This is untrue.<br><br>5. Sunshine Empire does provide its merchants access to information and business opportunities in companies that Sunshine Empire believes to be good investments. This is only access and information. It is NOT a part of Sunshine EmpireÂ’s operations or business. Nor is any investment transacted by, with or through Sunshine Empire.<br><br>6. Mr James Phang is the International President of and adviser to Sunshine Empire, but nor a director or shareholder. In his personal capacity, he is a consultant of adviser to several companies other than Sunshine Empire.<br><br>7. Sunshine Empire has been operating successfully, providing real tangible products on an Internet-based trading platform that yield healthy profit for its merchants. It is not a fraudulent scheme. If it had been, it would not be operating today.<br><br>JACKIE HOO<br>Asia Pacific President Sunshine Empire Holdings</div>
