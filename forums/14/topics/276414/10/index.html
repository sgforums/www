The only way that they can be informed is when they know it beforehand. And anyways, from what i researched, It seems that the whole interview was given in JP's "HUGE" office, and well, I dont think the reporters can so "gum gum ho" (right timing) barge into his office and directly interview him, and from what i know, it seems like JP pre-arrange and interview with him. Well, if not, how can they get in? Lolz.<br><br>But to think on the other side, if the MAS could not find any evidence against SE, then it would be a good publicity, just like what i said earlier in my posts, it is either SE is a big time scam, or a big time legal MLM company.<br><br>Well, Lets see how the story carry on. Definetely a company to "look out" for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Get rich quick<br><br>MALCOLM LIM used to earn over $3,000 per month when he was a teenager, by selling health products to his friends through multi-level marketing (MLM). Now in his mid-20s, he has quit the business for good because, in his words, "I don't want to be a legal conman."<br><br>Malcolm (not his real name) is among the thousands of Singaporeans who had been lured to join these schemes in the hope of getting rich quick. He made - but also lost - lots of money. Now he wants to "expose MLM's dirty tactics."<br><br>Malcolm reckons there are about 10 big MLM companies here, plus another 50 to 80 smaller firms.<br><br>Because of the recession, many people have joined these schemes - from clerks and secretaries to doctors, bankers and stock brokers.<br><br>What, exactly, is MLM?<br><br>Also called Network Marketing, it is a system of selling products - usually health supplements or beauty care products - through friends and relatives.<br><br>The emphasis is on building a large network. If you get 10 people to join, and each of them get another 10, you will have 100 people selling the products under you.<br><br>If each of the 100 recruits another 10, you will have 1,000. They are your "downlines". The commissions you earn from their sales can be substantial.<br><br>MLM companies commonly claim that a person could EASILY be earning $10,000 per month within six months.<br><br>"That's in a perfect scenario," Malcolm says. "It never happens in the real world."<br><br>They further claim that the products are sold at reasonable prices because shop rentals, advertising and other high costs have been removed.<br><br>Malcolm reveals that the typical profit margin is at least 500 to 1000 percent. The bulk of the profits go to the MLM bosses. Only about a quarter is distributed as commissions.<br><br>Pyramid selling<br><br>MLM is similar to "pyramid selling", which is banned in Singapore. But most have been modified to operate within the law and the Singapore government is now reviewing the ban, to avoid penalising companies that are legitimate.<br><br>Malcolm argues that the government should impose stricter controls instead. "Even if the companies operate legally," he says, "they cannot control what their members do."<br><br>Malcolm joined his first MLM programme when he was at the Polytechnic. "The response was fantastic," he recalls. "Young people are not interested in health products, but when you tell them they can make money, they all join.<br><br>"In three months, I had more than 1,000 downlines. I was a money-making machine for them.<br><br>"But as I rose up the ranks, I began to discover things that I did not know before. For example, the 'consultant' who made the presentation.... his big house and big cars, they are all sponsored by the MLM boss. It's a false front, to give the impression that he is successful.<br><br>"Once, I was aiming to reach the manager level. They told me I needed 8,000 points. I was doing so well that I could achieve 80,000 points. But if I did that, the extra 72,000 points would go to the person above me.<br><br>"So I slowed down my activity. Then, just before the month was up, they said there was a computer error and actually I needed 20,000 points. They use dirty tactics like this to prevent you from moving up."<br><br>Then there is a monthly maintenance. "Every month, you have to buy $200 to $300 worth of products. If you are in a higher level, you may have to buy more than $1000 worth.<br><br>"You either keep recruiting new people, or you keep buying. Otherwise, they forfeit your commissions."<br><br>Malcolm left the company and joined another. After attending more than 10 presentations, he thought he picked the best. It turned out to be even worse.<br><br>Ran away with money<br><br>"They cooked up a story that one of the shareholders had run away with the money. So they withheld about $30,000 worth of commissions and bonuses from me."<br><br>Is he sure the story was cooked up? Perhaps someone did run away with the money?<br><br>"I had friends in secret societies," he reveals. "They managed to catch this guy and he admitted that he took some money. But not all of it. About $2 million was missing, but he took only $500,000. The other shareholders must have taken the rest.<br><br>"To succeed in this business, you need to have absolutely no conscience," Malcolm says. "Do you seriously think they sell health products on the concept of health? Everytime I tell my customers how good the product is, my conscience keeps telling me what an asshole I am.<br><br>"I decided to quit. When my children go to school, I don't want their friends to say, 'Wah... your father is a legal conman!"<br><br>Published version in TODAY<br>was edited and cut by about half<br><br>Courtesy from <a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1682264&amp;page=23&amp;pp=15" rel="nofollow">http://forums.hardwarezone.com/showthread.php?t=1682264&amp;page=23&amp;pp=15</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>M E M O R A N D U M<br>To : All Merchants / Staffs From : Mr Jackie Hoo. Asia Pacific President Date : 24 October 2007 Re : PresidentÂ’s Message<br>Dear Our Valued Merchants, I am sure that you would all have read the Articles in todayÂ’s English Straits Times. No doubt also that many of you will also have heard many fearful things being said about our Company. Let me encourage you all by focusing your mind on these points:<br><br>1. It is a positive thing that the ST has presented a write up on Mr James Phang and the EGA conglomerate.<br><br>A.It is positive or negative , i think JP &amp; JH know the best ....<br><br>2. It is a positive thing that it is clear from the page 26 article that EGA does not own or have any part in Sunshine Empire (this means that the Group activities and companies are not affected by the Sunshine Empire activities).<br><br>B.Rubbish , sunshine is EGA , they are all under JP control . but all the group of company does not register under JP .<br><br>3. On the other hand, it is also a positive thing that by reference, Sunshine Empire is seen to be associated with a larger and substantial conglomerate, with an experienced mentor and advisor in Mr James Phang.<br><br>C.Meaning of Conglomerate .. refer to topic under pierre2084<br><br>4. It is a positive thing that the public awareness is drawn to Sunshine Empire by the ST Â– this is free publicity. Now everyone will want to know what is this Company? Â– This is the best time to sell to them that Sunshine Empire is a responsible company and that the business model works!<br><br>D.Rubbish again , there no free publicity in the world , and yr business model          work only when people invest . See how long yr investment can last.<br><br>5. It is a positive thing that the ST did not call Sunshine Empire a scam, or say it is illegal Â– it merely said that the public should Â“take careÂ” and that the Â“business model looks like a pure financial investment schemeÂ”.<br><br>E.Isnt it obvious when ST say ( TAKE CARE )<br><br>6. Over all, the ST article presents an opportunity and a platform for both EGA and Sunshine Empire to engage the public and educate them about the activities of the group and Sunshine Empire.<br><br>F.ST got say that meh ? or u say one . JH wake up yr idea.<br><br>Sunshine Empire Merchants we have taken a lot of efforts together to build up the business and the Company name. Let us not allow rumors and misunderstanding to undermine all our efforts. You shall also be seeing my official press response in the newspapers. I am working with the management team to engage with the MAS and the authorities to clear up any misunderstanding they may have and to have Sunshine Empire recognized as the responsible company and cutting edge business opportunity. Meanwhile, I call on all Merchants who believe in our business model, whose lives have been transformed by participating in Sunshine Empire to come forward and share your testimonial to encourage everybody! Together we shall bring our Company to new and greater strength! Yours Sincerely, For Sunshine Empire Holdings Jackie Hoo President<br><br>G.Rubbish again , JP &amp; JH group of scammers really taken alot of efforts                         together to build up the $$ business and the Company name.<br><br>Conclusion - Pls dont get involve with them anymore .<br><br>JP &amp; JH group of scammers what a nice move u all taken last  week , bulletproofing all yr merchants about the news paper .<br><br>There are more news regarding EGA coming soon ...<br>God bless JP &amp; JH group of scammers ..<br><br></div>
