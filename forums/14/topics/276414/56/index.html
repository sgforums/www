Emall is marketing Sony products such as PSP, PS2 and PS3. Still, I notice many prefer to redeem the Nintendo DS. The rumours and critics might be true. I indeed saw many SEA with the PSP and DS!)<br>Anyway, her best song was notably "The Power of the Dream" by Celine Dion.

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2/7<br><br>Here is part 2 of my review of the Â‘concertÂ’!!!<br><br>Macy Chen Mei Xin (Singapore)<br><br>Long live S-Pop!!! Support local talents! Be original! Say NO to piracy!<br><br>= 2.5 stars!!! (Singing Â– too sweet lah!)<br>= 4 stars!!!!! (Looks Â– she was wearing a Ballerina attire?)<br>= 5 stars!!!!! (For being Singaporean!)<br><br>I had no idea who she was initially, but eye candy is always welcomed.<br>A quick google reveals...<br>She is Singaporean.<br>She is 20.<br>She acted in some Ch 8 dramas recently like Â“Nu Xu Dang JiaÂ“.<br>She hosted some Ch U variety shows like Â“Do Shi Da Fa Xian 2Â” (Discovery Secret Agent)  and Â“Yuan Jia Lu ZaiÂ” (Way To Go).<br><br>If local tabloid reporters were indeed spying the anniversary event to exploit SE for more news, I would have suggested to them some tongue-in-cheek questions for Mei Xin, a fellow Singaporean.<br><br>1. Â“How do you feel performing in front of an international audience?Â”<br><br>2. Â“How do you feel performing for a Network Marketing company placed on the SingaporeÂ’s MAS Investor Alert List and currently being investigated by SingaporeÂ’s CAD?Â”<br><br>3. Â“Do you agree that a democratic governmentÂ’s regulations should use de-marketing on a private company so as to protect the interests of government-linked companies (such as banks)?Â”<br><br>4. Â“Should a media company which has close links to the ruling party negatively affect consumer preferences for a product that is marketed through word-of-mouth?Â”<br><br>5. Â“Why did you choose to be managed by a private media company rather than a media company owned by a state investment agency?Â”<br><br>6. Â“Is your management using SEÂ’s customer database as a platform to promote you beyond Singapore to neighbors such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea?Â”<br><br>7. "Do you agree that personal blogs should be removed and even fined by a private company if they misrepresent the company's policies?"<br><br>8. Â“What do you think of Mr BrownÂ’s latest podcast, a satire about SunÂ…Â”<br><br>9. "Don't you feel cold in this attire especially in Genting Highlands?"<br><br>10. Â“Is it true that your boyfriend is from SE Singapore?Â”<br><br>11. Â“Is it Steven Lim, that son of a *censored*???Â”<br><br>Okay, ignore the last question; I was kidding.<br>SEÂ’s public relations with the 2 biggest local media companies is really contrasting and amusing at times.<br>But then again, Popstar Media is a also a new yet promising Singapore Private Limited company as well. A good business collaboration, maybe?

            <div class='col-md body'>SUNSHINE   EMPIRE   IS   A   SCAM   AND   A   FRAUD <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>1) The managers &amp; presenters told potential investors oops members that they have the licence for the Tai Chung &amp; Taipei, they have the wireless projects, and they have the technology (i.e. Wifi + Wimax integration - claims that blue engine broke the code for integration).   Base on a 60% take up rate in Taipei,  Emcom should have a revenue of USD 84 million per month and if the take up rate is higher plus advertising and other revenues,  Emcom should have a revenue of hundreds of millions of USD per month.  So if SSE give a return rate of 1200% - isn't it peanuts.<br>People buy their story and withdrew from their banks, finance cos, insurance policies, credit cards and any other sources just to buy  GPs. Now the truth is out Taiwan government did not issue to Emcom or their partner Tayee the licence.  Now we have a overprice wireless project for Taipei.<br>So where is the big revenue &amp; big income.  Sold everybody a big dream.<br><br>The managers claimed  that Nuskin International took 20 years to reach the present sales volume but Sunshine Empire took only 10 months to achieve this target.  All due to the sales of GPs.  James Phang and gang is sitting on hundreds of millions of USD.  He should refund to anybody who which to withdraw. The game is up.  It is all over.<br><br>2) Now it is up to the CAD, CPIB, IRAS, etc.  to do the House Cleaning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
