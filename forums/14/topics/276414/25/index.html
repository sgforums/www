            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Observer82:</div><div class="quote_body">The video you are referring to features a BRM D.<br><br>Mr D is... I am glad to say, one of the better BRM in SE Singapore. He is in charge of the division JAC. 'JA' simply stands for a division 'founded' by Mr JH. 'C' stands for well, it simply is according to alphabetic order. Under the BIG J divisions are from JAA, JAB... all the way to JAH... JAI... if I remember correctly. JAC is well known for its cohesiveness as a team, strong support network, leadership by example. Not an aggressive network unlike... *censored*<br><br>Man! I love to criticize videos on YouTube especially that canadian chap, but that is besides the point.<br><br>A little history to share about Mr D. (Hi, Mr D, if you or any of your team is reading this, how's it going? Long time no see? Make it! ^.^ ) Whatever you see in that video is... well... romanticized and edited. It does NOT do a 27 year old business-man justice.<br><br>This man has really put in a lot of dedication since day one when he 'joined' NTI as a normal 'agent'. He is the epitome of 'silent leadership'. He has a disarming smile, presents SE in a fair, honest and somewhat humorous manner. He was a former motivational speaker from the Trainer's Club of NTI. Mr JP and Mr JH, I must say are damm lucky to find such a capable man under their wing and tutelage. It would be a shame if due to the poor leadership and poor media relations or PR or whatever you call it (Mr JP and Mr JH, are you reading this!?!), that Mr D's potential is undermined.<br><br>Poor thing, when he was 'fighting' (for position) in NTI, each time he hits a new rank, his critics would comment in the likes of, "Aye D! How come only BAM/BEM/BDM? Your downline, YJ, already BRM liao le!"<br><br>Ok, enough of history lessons. The video is a poor video. Poor effects. Poor resolution. Who was the singing coach? It fails in it's role to motivate people to strive for their dreams through sheer determination.<br><br>He's still a humble chap, no airs whatsoever.<br><br>(If you are wondering why the heck the video was even made, well it was a testimonial video shown during his award recognition probably in 2007 International Lions' Rally held in Hall 5 and 6 at Singapore Expo. Some one probably decided to archive it in YouTube for the public's viewing PLEASURE and to torture our eardrums of course. Rejoice video critics!)</div></blockquote>I assumed the D is Desmond.<br>Perhaps you are not sure about his past in NOP. Imagine walking into NOP with his 2 bars on his shoulder. LOL</div>

People encouraged to take ARMs when they can't afford it. Appraisers were pressured to overvalue homes.<br><br>But anyway, whether Sunshine Empire is technically legal or not doesn't matter.  It's just too risky an investment.<br><br>Of course, if you like making other people rich and buying other people BMWs, please go ahead.</div>

Thus i've only been reading and not posting<br><br>And many of you guys keep pushing for results results, SE has so many asia countries under it in just 12mnths whats more there are actually alot of success testimonies in the company. My dad and my sister's boyfriend for instance is really making alot of money and i mean money where they never dream of making in such a short period of time, which makes SE actually successful already, be it being a successful scam or legit business.<br><br>So only time will tell, i plead you guys stop posting childish remarks here and there. It's not gonna help solve anything.</div></blockquote>Hi Zolox777,<br><br>if 'results' means becoming a better person and achieving a better way of life (through network marketing business) and not just to become a slave to produce sales for SE, then... no one is pushing for 'results'.<br><br>NTI used to push for 'results'.<br>It is NOT profitable.<br><br>No one is pushing for results, at least not in SE. SE is well known for pushing for GP (or even to purchase 8 GP in a week), and to a certain extent and less encouraged, an SP.<br><br>I mean, come on! Give the traditional hard working "work cow work horse" agents who started out as a BM or SM a chance! They do not have the luxury of using an abundance of capital to create wealth quickly through the Prime CRP privileges. Disturbing, disturbing. The 'Rich and Not-So-Rich' divide is widening in SE and it is disturbing! Please, please, Mr JP and JH, listen to the people's sentiments!<br><br>Agent A purchases a SM for SGD 1240. No CRP. (Man, he better work hard!)<br><br>Agent B purchases a SP for SGD 3000. CRP from 10% of global profit sharing. (Can afford to slack due to the passive rebates!)<br><br>Agent C purchases a GP for ... you know how this goes and guess what, this is exactly what is being scrutinized by MAS.<br><br>Is CRP a rebate or a source of investment returns or income or some netizens call it an income disguised as rebate!<br>The ruling government (probably) thinks; "What the F***!? How are we gonna tax these rebates!?! *BattleCry* MAS, CAD, SPH battle formations initiated! (Illustration, please do NOT sue me like T T Durai!)<br><br>Do I believe that SE has many asia countries under it? Do filter the conglomerate's propaganda and exaggerated claims. Where was SE founded? Singapore. Number of Singapore 'agents' (according to ST) is merely 20,000. According to the Member ID increment in numbers (this was announced in a private meeting in the TPY training room, during the Emall Training in Oct 07), SE has reached over 90,000+ agents, meaning only 70,000 belong to the other Asian countries. Have you or your friends attended any of SE's international functions? They are primarily dominated by Singapore and Malaysia agents.<br><br>I know what you're thinking, did SE really make it in S.Korea!? South Korea has one of the worst and strictest rules in the MLM world! (Please insert proof of this statement!)<br><br>Bribery &amp; Pyramid Charges Filed in Korea<br>20 July 2007 Â– The JU Group in South Korea has set a world record for pyramiding?  Almost $4.4 billion U.S. dollars!  That is a world record! Federal regulators in South Korea indicted 27 people, including politicians and a newspaper publisher, on charges of taking bribes from South KoreaÂ’s largest multilevel marketing company, JU Group.<br><br>See? Even politicians are not spared! And I thought the MAS Alert List and CAD investigations were scary! Only the Korea incentive trip in 2008 will debunk the myths (if any) of SE's true expansion into the gold mine that is South Korea.<br><br>Speaking of South Korea... (goodness, this is getting nowhere.) When the SE official auditing and finance reports do crystallize in Genting in Nov 27-29. The sales figures are gonna be messy. I mean... Singaporeans snapping up GP from South Korea, Taiwan, Brunei etc. Why do the SG agents do that? Due to the differences in exchange rate of currencies and E-points. And it is an open secret that GP from country XXX offer a higher CRP due to the infant stage of EmCall in that particular country, thus no deduction of EmCall charges from CRP (66 e-points!). Shrewd business persons from SE. Shrewd...<br><br>What happens?<br><br>Singapore GP sales drop.<br>South Korea GP sales increase.<br>Overall SE GP sales increase/maintains/drops.<br>Misrepresentation of Sales figures.<br><br>Criticism. (Illustration: Wah L** eh. That SG agent friend of mine, he buy Korea GP for higher CRP! Ka*z, so not for EmCall or Mall points lah. Higher CRP! Basket! Then I buy Singapore GP lesser CRP than EmCall so many minutes how to use finish!? Mall points so troublesome to use. Want to buy a PS3 also don't have! Only have PSP! Someone bring in PS3 leh!) **Hint Hint**<br><br>It had been announced that CRP will be universal since August 2007, those of you who own multiple GP (you know who you are), would tell you that those countries without EmCall callback service, actually has a higher CRP (+66 E-points!). Is that fair? We would have to wait and see whether this coming CRP on Nov 10th, the truth. Did SE fix it? Universal CRP?<br><br>Is CRP same for all nations? (Same meaning same for E-points) It has got to be the same, if not, critics would say; "Why is the Prime CRP system creating such enormous volumes of repeated sales but multiple GP, the owner only needs 1 EmCall service (in fact, up to 10 users can share 1 EmCall account, sharing the free IDD and local minutes), then I cannot trade EmCall for Mall points? Unfair le!)<br><br>That is the cornerstone of EGA for you in a nutshell, solve the issues of repeated sales in NTI (or lack of it!) and create a new bigger issue by the CRP/Prime system.</div>
