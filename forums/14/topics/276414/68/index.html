            <div class='col-md body'>I'm digging out posts from 2003<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by DennisLam:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear all,<br><br>I am a student. I am writing this because I have just came back from the NTI Paris office in Shenton Way. I was asked to go there by a friend who was in turned invited by an NTI Paris employee. Now, after listening to 2 hours of drivel from the NTI employee, all I have to say is that NTI Paris is a devious and despicable pyramid scam, and I swear I will do everything in my power to bring it down before it harms more innocents.<br><br>Pardon me if I am wrong, but isn't the main concept of any business, MLM or not, to sell *products* and not to recruit people into the company for monetary gains? This was the overwhelming impression that I was given at NTI Paris. The employee who talked to me consistently refused to answer questions about the actual products (aromatherapy stuff) that they were selling, concentrating instead on the amount of money that I can earn each month by building up the pyramid under me. He emphasized very strongly on the fact that money is mainly made from recruitment; each time someone joins your binary-downlink tree, you get money from it. When questioned about what the company actually have to does for a living, he evaded the question, and zealously went back to talking about the immense monetary benefits of creating "business centers." He continuously points to the benefits of buying business centers and bringing in more people to the fold, going so far as to warn me not to spread the word too much, because as of now, I am "not sufficiently trained to advertise the company," and that the time will come when I will be sufficiently trained to advertise this business plan to further recruits.<br><br>Now this begs the question, if the business plan is so amazingly good that every employee become instant millionaires if they work hard enough, then why is there a need for such secrecy? Also, and the more pertinent question is, WHERE DOES ALL THIS MONEY COME FROM? Simple mathematics will tell you that it comes from all the people at the bottom of the pyramid, the people who have been sweet-talked into giving hundreds or even thousands on dollars to the company, with no hope of getting any returns either because the market is already saturated, or because the people at the top of the pyramid has run away with all the money. The NTI Paris employee frequently brings up the subject of "following your dreams" and "becoming what you want to be," as do most MLM employees in this thread. I encourage people to do their best in life too, and to strive to make as much money as they can, if that is indeed their aim. But the question is, AT WHAT COST? Is it worth it financing your dreams by bilking other people out of their hard-earned money? That is crime, and at a time like this, I cannot possibly condone such dastardly business acts.<br><br>The names "James Phang" and "Dato Dr. Eric Tan Eng Huat" was frequently mentioned during my talk with the NTI Paris employee. It was mentioned in such reverence, suggesting that they are saintly figures who have made it rich, and are interested in helping us commoners to be "part of the wealth" too. Believe none of this. If indeed they are aware of this, they are cheats indeed, and very malicious ones too. They are the rich who wants to get richer by swindling the poor of even more wealth. Charitable businessmen? More like decadent frauds. And the employees who use their names as part of the recruitment speech should be deeply ashamed.<br><br>Now you may ask, why am I so outraged? Am I working for another MLM that wants to see NTI Paris go down? No, I am not. In fact, I stand to gain nothing from NTI Paris' demise, if that occurs. But I do have friends who have invested much of their money in the scheme, and are prepared to further recruit more innocent people into the scheme to finance their earnings. They do not realize that the business plan is fundamentally flawed, or that the money that they get comes from people at the "bottom of the pile." It is never a Win-Win situation, it is Win-Lose; the people at the top of the pyramid gets richer, the people at the bottom gets poorer. And don't pull the curtains over my eyes by telling me that the pyramid can go on getting deeper forever ... a fool is born every minute, but a binary tree made up of "business partners" won't go beyond 50 levels even if you include all the people who have ever set foot on the earth, past and present.<br><br>There is never easy money. Not lawful ones anyway (excluding the one-in-a-million chance of a lottery ticket). It pains me to see my friends getting their money sucked into this deceitful scheme. And so I must speak out, before more people get cheated of their/ their parent's hard earned money.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, dennis' points mirror my sentiments.<br><br>However, after I gather the facts, I do not know how to pull my friends out. They are really brainwashed, coz most never seen other companies before, and seen the industry through the eyes of James Phang, who "taught" them how MLM biz "really should goes".<br><br>Unless one ventures to see few companies, it is very hard to appreciate how funny ntiparis is. Most believe in James Phang, in binary (totally), in how biz supposed to run nti way. I have friends who read success books and NM books. In many ways, even if we knew the funnny features of nti, how does one argue successfully with people who take out points from books? Like we knew army officers are running an event ineffectually, but cannot argue coz he knew how to make "logical' points, not effectual points.<br><br>Even if we present them the facts, two things might occur. Non acceptance and self denial. Remember, the truth is hard to swallow, and no one will admit they themselves are wrong.<br><br>Dennis, may I ask how you plan to bring the company down? Coz my conclusion is that to let the company falls and the suckers suckered, or the police catch up with them. I was just afraid some bad influence might lure them to join such companies again.<br><br>Few things to disclose here, and I hope people of AMH, ntiparis and NOP take note. There are links between these three companies definitely. How? Firstly, examine AMH methods of earning money, and relates them to ntiparis.Trace AMH boss history and you will find something. Secondly, note the points I tried to ask aWaken about AMH and ntiparis. NOP is the definite link to ntiparis, how ever you will want to read ST on Friday 19th Dec page two to know what is NOP.Thirdly, trace James Phang past buisness doings, and you will find something. Let me give u guys a clue, I may own this house definitely, but it is under my wife's name. In the eyes of the law, the house belongs to my wife, although I may have provided the money for it. When the house is eventually sold off, my wife gave me the money, but the HDB wouldnt care where the money goes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Lastly, to hell with scams.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

With the sales of properties limited to only SE members, Top managers would naturally have to 'lead by example' in buying those units. And in the old FAQ, all buyers must buy a minimum of 10 units. This must be so that they can push it to their downlines.<br><br>And since once the deal is signed, they have to start paying a month later, can you imagine how much they have to put in monthly?<br><br>Say for a $700,000 house, a SE member pays 5% over 18 months. (<span style="font-style: italic;">refering to KL Project as example</span>)<br><br>So in a year, it would have been $35,000 over 12 months = RM$420,000!<br><br>So every month, the SE member would have to fork out around S$20k to pay for his house.<br><br>SE Members will be practically putting back everything they earn initially into the Property purchase. Not only putting back whatever they earn... it will be worse because banks wouldn't lend money to a project that hasn't even started... so where are they getting the monthly $20k from???? Friends, banks, credit cards, company loans, insurance policies???<br><br>So if the house isn't built yet in 1 year and the company folds....<br><br>The implications are scary indeed!<br><br>I believe this will be a Everyone-Lose scenario.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nice analysis, abduct.<br><br>I can see SE only sells its projects internally. Okay... see this. Members had already pumped in 5 figure digits worth of money into Phang's pocket.<br><br>10K+ is no joke... how many people can afford it. And it claims the properties, in Melaka and KL are all brought by SE people. Take into consideration the costs of the units. Who in their right mind would buy? I mean, you had already pumped in 10K+, would you be willing to pump in more money? And basic logic tells you the more people you reach, the more units you can sell, am I correct?<br><br>As Brains said. EGA / SE / EPV has no experience in property development. Only experience in MLM and cheating, as records show.  The malay news article says the project costs "RM 600 juta siap dibina" (can anyone pls translate). And it is it's first few projects, and  they already make it so big. Where does SE get all this money? Bank loan? With no previous track record?
