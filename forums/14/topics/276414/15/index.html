Why not you tell us who in the Management to look for, without having to attend talks? Black sheep helping another black sheep.<br><br>If they do not allow then why ask the person to join in the first place? Isn't it a scam, even if it does not involve the company but it involved your merchant, you tried to scam a 16-year-old $300 without receipt and subsequently deny on ground of no paper proof yet he had been approached as a 16-year-old. As a company, should your staff err shouldn't the company take responsiblity as well? Are you going to investigate and hand him over to the police? No.<br><br>Yes, I have seen enough of this kind of merchants who resort to name-calling, jeering and peer pressure to get things done in MLM. Doesn't it sound so familiar?

If you had less friends than before you joined SE (other than those from SE) I am not surprised.<br><br>It is also dubious that JP had repeatedly failed to come clear with their so-called "investment projects", yet had the audacity to challenge the Government immediately like it owns the land. In the same manner, if what we have been saying had fallen on deaf ears, there is of course no improvements that SE can ever make because it is a closed organisation.<br><br>I don't even understand why you are even questioning a person's stand on an argument.

After waiting for so long for your reply, you are asking me to do something that we may have difficulty doing.  In the first place, no receipt / invoice.  There is no contract.  It is ones' words against another..  It will be a very long process.  I agree with Tamago that perhaps you can give a name from your organisation for us to bring the matter to.  If SE is a clean company, surely there is someone who is and willing to be responsible.  Afterall, this concern the Company.  Let the P.I.C. talk to us and find out if there are black sheep in the Company.  Best of all, find out if there are people using the company name to scam.  Get the culprit and make pubilc.  Then SE can clear it name..  Isn't this a good opportunity to do so, now?<br><br>Well, the decision is on you or rather SE now ...</div>
