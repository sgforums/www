Together with Emall, Emcom, Empire Property Venture?<br><br>If they are totally unrelated, then why should Emall gave Sunshine Merchants 10% of their monthly turnover?<br><br>Or why should Emcom give Sunshine Merchants free call-back systems.<br><br>How come Sunshine Villa is for sale only to Sunshine Empire merchants?<br><br>Are there seperate contracts between the Merchants and Emall &amp; Emcom?<br><br>The generous monthly payout to Merchants are known as CRP or Consumer Rebate Privileges.<br><br>There is another payout known as CLP or Consumer Loyalty Privileges, which is (quoting from the SE Starter Kit) "profits generated from the worldwide effort of our Most valued Prime Status Independent International Merchants."<br><br>The CLP is as much as 60,000 epoints, which has not started yet.<br><br>What exactly is CLP?<br><br>I always thought it is future profits generated from the companies under the EGA, to be payout to Sunshine Merchants.<br><br>At least that is what I was introduced to, at the Toa Payoh Macdonald. That the only way to tap into the future growth of EGA is through Sunshine Empire.<br><br>In SE News section, there are headlines that seemed to indicate that the activities of the other EGA companies are connected to SE.<br><br>[b]Great News! Hoping more valued merchants to get a full comprehension on <span class="large">our</span> development projects in Malacca, we are now moving to Hong Kong International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre.</strong> The <a href="http://www.sunshine-empire.com/download/sunshine_pos_30x20inw.jpg" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">poster</span></a> also showed both SE &amp; EPV logos.<br><br>Emcom has also thanked Sunshine Empire in their Sept 2006 newletter:<br><br>Quote: <span style="font-style: italic;">We would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the </span><strong>investments received from Sunshine Empire</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The timely investment has allowed for the project to be carried out smoothly</span>. Unquote.<br><br>So how does Sunshine does its investments? Is it part of the 'network marketing' strategy?<br><br>From this <a href="http://www.moneymakergroup.com/Sunshine-Empire-aka-Emcom-t105950.html&amp;st=915&amp;p=4395753" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">forum</span></a> a whole list of EGA activities including sensitive information was given out. No Merchant without actual information given to him/her could give such details.<br><br><span class="large"><strong>So what is the 60,000 e-points CLP and how is it actually computed?</strong> </span>[/b]</blockquote>i don't know how accurate i am in saying this, but from what i observe, SE is like the banker in the EGA structure. companies such as EmCom and Empire Property Venture are in charge of tendering for, securing and executing 'projects' such as the alleged Taichung wireless infrastructure and the M'sian property projects. these companies will also conduct business such as acquisition of listed companies, amongst others.<br><br>Sunshine Empire will provide financing for these projects through the "membership fees" paid by its 20,000 or so members and its other MLM activities. the members i.e. Sunshine Merchants will be rewarded through the profits generated from the successful projects under EmCom and the other EGA companies. this is the 'sleeping partner' type of SE agent.<br><br>this was the information i got from my friend when he presented the plan to me earlier this year. also, SE should be part of EGA, this point i'm quite sure.<br><br>the business dealings of Emcom and Empire Property Venture etc. are most likely to be lawful and legitimate, which is why only SE is currently being investigated. the only way the other companies can possibly be dragged into this whole saga is if SE's business practices is declared to be unlawful and these companies used the funds provided by SE knowing that the money was obtained through illegal means.<br><br>as for the CLP, it's something new to me, but it's consistent with JP's modus operandi of introducing numerous incentives and privileges to keep his 'ka kias' happy. maybe it's to purposely confuse the merchants further with a new program, such that they will spend all their time trying to figure out how to maximise benefits from these incentives rather than question the company's dealings.<br></div>

Rather, it appears to be getting the layman on the street to deposit their money in a company which then invests this deposited money in other businesses i.e. the 'pure investment scheme' which you read on the papers. such businesses are governed by the Finance Companies Act, which requires a licence be given by the MAS, as stated by laurence82 above.<br><br>another way in which SE could have breached the law would be to contravene the MLM Act. the MLM Act prohibits businesses which confers any benefit in the form of dividend or payment to a person who recruits or acquires one or more additional participants to the scheme.<br><br></div>
