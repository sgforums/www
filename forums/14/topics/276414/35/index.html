            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br><br>Just had lunch with a friend working in MAS, he told me SE is done for. He's making his comments based on his expereince with CAD whom he has worked with for last 4 years in cracking investment fraud schemes. As yes like what you mentioned, CAD already knows their stuff before moving in. The only thing CAD wants to find out now is whether is it a ponzi scheme or something else. Another words they just need evidence to sentence the company and they want to know what sentence the company deserved. Either way, someone has to be fined/jail. And either way, SE wont be able to continue thereafter.<br><br>Another interesting fact that was shared with me is that SE actually got some malaysian minister to come down and tap on video that an agreement is being signed for SE to build a water resort project in Malaysia etc after the NEw Paper questioned the validity of the projects.. The minister turns out to be only a mayor. And the joke is that if a country like Malaysia would want to build a water resort, why is it only doing publicity in Toa Payoh? There's not a single news in Malaysia covering the event except the news being covered by James Phang. Even the office of the minister of tourism in malaysia is unaware of this. If you want people to believe your story, just publize on the newspaper and the media will do what is needed to make pple believe.<br><br>And to Micheal123. yes i will still join SE if CAD clears them but from what i heard today, i think chances are slim.<br><br>Advice to all SE members - start pulling out your funds now. If CAD ever clears SE, you can put the money back in and still gain in the long run. Its always better to hold cash than to hold faith.<br><br>Hope these pple heed advice and go get the refund now. Heard alot of upline asking their downlines not to withdraw.<br>Dont forget your uplines already got their capital back, if you have not, please go withdraw.<br><br>One more advice,<br><br>If possible, you may want to withdraw any forms of membership with the company now.<br>When CAD goes thru the names, the same list of names will also go to Inland Revenue (IRAS) to check if these pple have been paying taxes. I doubt most SE pple declare any real taxes or any taxes at all.<br><br>Inland Revenue in Singapore has direct authority to access all personal bank accounts in Singapore. Dont play a fool.<br><br>When have we seen a company being so negative covered by the media for weeks and still eventually survive after all these is over? Channel 8 screened the programme on SE tonight at 1030, followed by various fraud cases. The media is obviously categorising SE with fraud. Why would the media have the guts to do that? Something out there must have given them the green signal.<br><br>Even if all the members choose not to refund, I doubt anyone in their right mind will still go queue and invest more money into the company in the next couple of months.<br><br>SE days are numbered. No Pro SE personel will post anything up here for next couple of weeks. Their only hope is a positive result from CAD's investigation. If CAD has been consistent as what my friend in MAS claim - JP's name will go thru history as a joke. And those who call him father, would be the joker's sons and daughters.<br><br></blockquote>From Brains again, in others forums <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Enjoy ~</div>

Prove of the high returns claimed.<br><br>And then what? We get people like "mlmlover" who juz do nothing but flame, flame, flame... Can't even get a decent reply. Now, after few months, still, no one had replied to our questions.<br><br>I've seen people in other forums shoot down a product, and worse thing is mod just closes it. Never ever in my life had I seen someone, or some company so fking boliao, childish to send people to forums to use guriella posting to flame people who try and expose them, or come in, say few "encouraging" words and vanish. So much for public relations.<br><br>James Phang deserves an Oscar for best director, best scriptwriter. Fancy bribing a mayor to pose as a minister to do groundbreaking for a none existant project?<br><br>Remember "Empire State Tower" in KL? One source said its at Jalan Rajah Chulan. I had already checked with my KL friend. He said that plot mentioned is very small, and unlikely to have a highrise tower built in it. Also it's far from KL city CBD. THEN, I saw another source which says it's at JALAN TUN RAZAK.<br><br>Wah, can shift the whole tower one ah? Any idea how much it costs to redesign a building, reapply permits and stuff? Planning permit, utilities diversion, etc.<br><br>Speaking of which, I can't find any info whatsoever about any of the so called SE's projects other than SE-related websites, blogs, etc.<br><br>I see them claiming to expand into fields like energy, tech, etc. Any idea the cost of infrastructure involved? A few millions. With NONE of the projects having taken off yet, why the hell promise the outrageously high returns?<br><br>I can see why James God and Father the Godfather Phang make people idolisehim. Its like how record companies plot out plans to make people idolise their singers. So that even if the guy makes a mistake, they'll surely be people who'll support them, say good stuff about them, etc. It's no longer a company. Most MLMs are almost cult-like.</div>
