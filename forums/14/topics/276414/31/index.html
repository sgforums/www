Each time they release a statement, people quickly point out that the story doesn't add up.<br><br>They are in deep shit because the best course of action for them is really to say, "No Comment." But they can't say that because confidence in them is shaken. And SE, which right now looks a lot like a pyramid schemes (though of course that is not proven), seems to be a confidence game.<br><br>So we'll see how the story slowly changes.<br><br>First: "Don't worry, you can pull out your money anytime. Why would we make this guarantee if the company is not doing very well?"<br><br>Then:<br><br>"You can pull out your money anytime. But no one else is pulling out. You'll lose big if you pull out. Lots of future earnings out there."<br><br>And then:<br><br>"Okay you can pull out. But you need to let us buy time by waiting a few weeks to get your refund. And now there's an admin fee to make you think twice."<br><br>And then:<br><br>"You better dun pull out. Have faith in God. If you pull out you are an evil person.

Just to ask, is the reporter reading this forum? If yes, thats good.<br><br>Here are some questions,<br>1) How can the government didnt take any action on this company (Sunshine Empire)?<br><br>2) If this type of company still carry on to collect money to invest in their whatever investment and pay such a high returns, then why the people in singapore still investing with the banks?<br><br>3) So does it means that this company (Sunshine Empire) is better than our Temasek Holdings? In terms of return?<br><br>4) Dont the government feel that this company is affecting the whole financial industry in singapore?<br><br>5) Does the police know that this company (Empire Group Alliance) is belonged to the ex-NOP boss James Phang who actually collected millions of dollars using Magic Kingdom project in the year 2002 and ALL the investors' money were gone at that time?<br><br>Hope the reporter can continue using media to bring this company down because its a threat to our people.<br><br>Thank You.<br><br></div>
