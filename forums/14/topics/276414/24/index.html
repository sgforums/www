            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Figures can be manipulated<br><br>and there are 1001 ways to look at accounts<br><br>Whats the point of posting one liners like 'Sales gone up by 20%!'<br><br>when a lot of things cant be proven or accounts not shown to the public?<br><br></div></blockquote>Hello Forum Friends.<br><br>From what I understand...<br><br>SE have not manipulate the sales figures since August 06. The problem is, this figure is first announced to the BRM during the weekly meetings and information is always lost in translation. Many a times, during big events like a rally, JP's lessons or some seminars, typically, these 2 would be announced;<br>- The number of GP that are sold for that month (SE seldom if not never mention the number of SP or BP sold)<br>- The monthly turnover (please not that turnover is not profit, it is the total gross sales figures and usually this is in USD)<br><br>I say 'announced' because these figures are NEVER released to the public. To merchants, it is always by word of mouth or by a notebook with info passed down from top. In some BRM's case, they do it in a more flashy way, they simply log in to their business account and show their sales figures to the downlines/merchants/associates or clients/prospects.<br><br>Problem: no official data or in black and white. why is this a problem?<br><br>because based on the IMAF (International Merchant Agreement Form), the CRP aspect of 'Prime' (BP, SP, GP) are calculated by 10% the monthly turnover of SE on the Emall platform, and then divided among shares to 'Prime' merchants.<br><br>One can actually google 'Sunshine Empire' and go view several blogs where agents compile the CRP figures since Aug 06. Unfortunately, due to recent media coverage of SE, it appears that the SE management is watching these blogs very carefully and have 'advised' some of them to be closed.<br><br>One of the best blog, a Singaporean agent/merchant from Malaysia originally, had a website, well known for its speed of acquiring news. Let's call this person 'IR'. E.g. this blog would have news right after a meeting and post it, even faster than the official SE website. IR would post IR's income and they are real.<br><br>Problem: IR posted her income from last year Aug 06 till present. IR joked it is a 'part-time job' and used terms like 'ROI up to 1200%' (Rate of Interest). She did not specify whether the income is<br>-passive or active<br>-resale or new sales<br>-primes or merchants?<br><br>Sadly, this blog/website has since disappeared (in early Nov). It would be rare to find a more informative website than this one.<br><br>There's actually no '1001 ways' to look at a SE account. What you see is what you get. Transactions are 'TFE' and income are 'Bonus'. You can't fake it.<br><br>The sales figures boasted by Christopher_RF that gone up by 20% is probably not fake. In SE, the GP has reached its mature stage of phase 6, or 7500 e-pts (S$12,000). Many SEA actually are motivated by the media coverage. Of course, one cannot deny the 'bullet-proof' methods that JH is imposing on the merchants. He has to. It is his job as the leader of SE. Of course, the skeptics would regard it as propaganda.<br><br>The upcoming Genting Incentive Trip for SE is really crucial for it's reputation for the long term. Finally, the annual reports, finances, auditing etc are going to be announced in black and white in this event from 27-29 Nov 2007.<br><br>Gee, I think I typed too much, please tell me if I provided any misinformation or was inaccurate. Just chipping in my 2 cents worth.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Do what is relevant!</div></blockquote>Disclaimer: I am tying this Post while watching TV so quite distracted and I realise quite alot of personal views so please do not flame me! :_)<br><br>laurence82, I really have to take my hat off to you. Please do note that there are people who appreciate your views; in or outside of SE. I am one of them.<br><br>Can you explain to me what is verifying an account? I need to do some research.<br><br>Here is some potentially disturbing info. When a new client/prospect/customer decides to purchase... say... a SM and GP (Silver Merchant and Gold Prime)... this person doesn't even need to produce his or her NRIC. (Good lord, I hope some BRM or 'big boss' of SE is reading this, and highlight to JH or admin. Things have got to change.) Meaning, any Tom, Dick or Harry can sign up as a fake identity, fake IC, fake age etc. It is only when certain administration requirements like account transferring that NRIC has to be produced. (e.g. today i wish to transfer ownership of my GP account to some one else, then i would have to produce NRIC.)<br><br>About the investment sources, SE is truly a shrewd business system. The general public is told that SE does the investments with other corporate units such as the TaiPei and TaiChung wireless city projects. The consumer does not bear the risk of these projects/investments. What is 'more or less promised' is the CRP which is linked to SE's monthly sales. It is the CLP that really makes a Prime sounds like a Ponzi/Pyramid/Money Game.<br><br>But what truly disturbs me is that one of the issue that is reported in the press is the CRP, the REAL highlight of a Prime; not the EmCall, not the Mall Points, not the Binary Marketing Plan.<br><br>Non of the projects (EmTaiPei, Empire Villa etc) are making profits YET. If they were, SE is under contractual laws to pay out the CLP on top of CRP. The interesting thing is, CRP and CLP is not given a time frame. They are simply given a maximum cap.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth again. Only the CAD can prove that SE's business model is illegal; not the media, not MAS or CASE or M'sia Security Commission. It seems that SE is well prepared for this legally. The IMAF (some call it T &amp; C), the SE Starter Kit, the online agreement; all these are carefully drafted out by SE decision makers and deemed legal by SE's lawyers. Whether CAD can find evidence to prove otherwise, is another story. I can honestly say that heads will roll. I mean, even a BRM can be terminated (by SE, EGA). Okay, you got me. I think IRAS will come in to when the dark clouds settle. They will be literally shouting, "Hey that BRM M with that Transformer Car you achieved, pay your taxes!"<br><br>I sincerely hope and appeal to SE, EGA, EmCom to be more transparent in it's finances.<br><br>"And another issue in which you have neglected to address is your fellow agent, like owners of these blogs, have blatantly make one liner unproven statements."<br><br>The owners of these blogs, some of them I know personally. I can assure you that as far as income is concern, yes, several SEA do make monthly profits of up to 6-digits in SGD. I say profits because as a shrewd SEA, you would maximise your income by clever formation of your marketing team. Those who know the Binary Plan well would understand better what I am getting at. I say profits also because the SEA would have to do personal sales (i.e. incur a loss first) as well. A GP offers 30 BC; it is very useful for 'balancing', multiple repeated income from one source (e.g. up to 4 times of SP 1 and SP 6 and/or 4 times GP Bonus). One single SP 1 is 100 E-points (SGD 160) and SP 6 is 300 E-points (SGD 480) so kindly do the math.<br><br>As I have observed in my previous posts, it is a good thing that perhaps JH and his leaders are watching the blogs closely to weed out misinformation. These blogs, they have their own personal business agendas; i.e profit driven goals. (E.g. SE is good. But, do not buy from division XXX or agent XXX. BUY FROM ME. Why? Because I earn more, I have flashy graphics, I have the latest info and I am good in Adobe DreamWeaver! I will misrepresent SE such that the Primes sounds too good to be true. Contact me via my HP, MSN, Skye, FaceBook, ANYTHING! Just buy from me! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) Darn it. That's why the world prefers face to face meet ups! No?<br><br>I personally hate to bring this up but here goes.<br><br>Despite what is marketed to the world, NTI was a failure. Sure, the binary plan was good. But the core product of aromatherapy, Oxy8 (and let's not even mention the courses!), they do not offer repeated sales potential. What happens? NTI 'forces' the maintainance plan, 30-50 E-points monthly compulsory of ALL AGENTS if you want any form of commission for the next month. The Maintainence money was used to purchase the core products, mind you. (Shrewd ^_^) What happens next? Still no repeated sales. Agents keep buying up BC, try to 'recruit' more agents. Okay, you know where I am getting at. The system cannot go on; at least not in a profitable manner.<br><br>In comes Sunshine to save the day with its CRP and Primes and what have you. Finally, long suffering agents really do make profits. And in a weird set of example led by JP himself, agents start to boast their income, cars and even singing prowess. It's a sad irony. On one hand, SEA should tell people how much they earn to be honest, upright etc etc. On the other hand, SEA should not tell to avoid taxes and jealousy.<br><br>Alas, another long post, I apologise, I was watching TV and typing this post. Where is the avenue/platform at which suggestions/feedback can be given to SE? Apparently, not many, unless you consider the biased and one sided meetings, small, medium or big.

I am glad to say, one of the better BRM in SE Singapore. He is in charge of the division JAC. 'JA' simply stands for a division 'founded' by Mr JH. 'C' stands for well, it simply is according to alphabetic order. Under the BIG J divisions are from JAA, JAB... all the way to JAH... JAI... if I remember correctly. JAC is well known for its cohesiveness as a team, strong support network, leadership by example. Not an aggressive network unlike... *censored*<br><br>Man! I love to criticize videos on YouTube especially that canadian chap, but that is besides the point.<br><br>A little history to share about Mr D. (Hi, Mr D, if you or any of your team is reading this, how's it going? Long time no see? Make it! ^.^ ) Whatever you see in that video is... well... romanticized and edited. It does NOT do a 27 year old business-man justice.<br><br>This man has really put in a lot of dedication since day one when he 'joined' NTI as a normal 'agent'. He is the epitome of 'silent leadership'. He has a disarming smile, presents SE in a fair, honest and somewhat humorous manner. He was a former motivational speaker from the Trainer's Club of NTI. Mr JP and Mr JH, I must say are damm lucky to find such a capable man under their wing and tutelage. It would be a shame if due to the poor leadership and poor media relations or PR or whatever you call it (Mr JP and Mr JH, are you reading this!?!), that Mr D's potential is undermined.<br><br>Poor thing, when he was 'fighting' (for position) in NTI, each time he hits a new rank, his critics would comment in the likes of, "Aye D! How come only BAM/BEM/BDM? Your downline, YJ, already BRM liao le!"<br><br>Ok, enough of history lessons. The video is a poor video. Poor effects. Poor resolution. Who was the singing coach? It fails in it's role to motivate people to strive for their dreams through sheer determination.<br><br>He's still a humble chap, no airs whatsoever.<br><br>(If you are wondering why the heck the video was even made, well it was a testimonial video shown during his award recognition probably in 2007 International Lions' Rally held in Hall 5 and 6 at Singapore Expo. Some one probably decided to archive it in YouTube for the public's viewing PLEASURE and to torture our eardrums of course. Rejoice video critics!)</div>
