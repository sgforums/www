There were emotional scenes as many people broke down in tears after being told of the company's imminent closure.<br><br>"It's not right", some of the people, as young as 17, lining up at the counter to process their refund, said. "My parents invested almost all of their life savings in this scheme, now they can't even withdraw their funds".<br><br>Many investors have threatened legal action against the most visible people responsible for this farce, including the company's mentor and adviser, as well as the company's president. At press time, they were not available for comment. A junior manager of the company sneered, "do whatever you want, you can't do anything to us, we are united!

            <div class='col-md body'>Point to Note: "I'm quite disappointed at the rebates paid out today as I was expecting a higher amount due to the publicity online and in the press."<br><br>Exactly. The publicity online and in the press not only got some people to demand for refunds, it also stopped the IN-flow of funds. Lack of IN-flow means the imminent end of a ponzi scheme.<br><br>SE agents keep trying to tell curious people that their sales went through the roof because of Lorna's articles. The internal SE memo circulating kept mentioning that it is a "positive thing". Of course, one wonders how it is a positive thing to be under investigation. It's like a man guilty of fraud smiles, nods his head, and says it is a positive thing now that the police have barged into his office and the accounts are going to be gone through.<br><br>Heard that SE is now saying they going to build casino in Macau too, and that if you lose, the money goes straight into getting a new gp for you. Haha.
