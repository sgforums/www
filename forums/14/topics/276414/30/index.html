            <div class='col-md body'>haha mlm is not really successful in US. its been doing well becuz of the market size. in the states, population is 200m+, singapore with 4m population, the market is pretty small and the products juz cant move fast enough. the plan in mlm juz focus more on recruitment as well so once every1 get recruited, yur salary stopped.<br><br>Amway has been investigated and cleared becuz they changed their way of doing business, they no longer booast about their income and provided real facts. quixstar has been exposed by cnbc on how they do business. statictis has shown that 99% failed. I was in Canada about 2 yrs ago in my high school when my fren started exposing me to MLM. but i haven touch MLM until last yr when my fren introduce me to Sunshine, lucky i never succumbe to his scheme.<br><br>You know, MLM is a good plan in theory of course, but when in real life., ppl juz the loopsholes to earn more income. i will encourage mlm if juz if, ppl have a better business ethic.<br><br>the reason why government legalised MLM not becuz it is no longer a scam, but becuz too much MLM company has been operating underground and there is no way to control them legally. instead of outlawing MLM, they legalised it and introduced the MLM body to provide guideline. when sometime cant be stop, u introduce laws to control. juz like the Prostitutes in GY. its not outlawed but controlled. and they are not heavilly publicized.  have u ever seen mLM encourage by gov, no right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You guys are wrong when you say that MLM is good when done right.<br><br>MLM is a fundamentally flawed business model. Even when you do it right, it's built into the system that a vast majority will fail.<br><br>This is why the average monthly gross income for "active" IBOs in Quixtar was $88. This is typical. And it doesn't even account for costs - the time spent selling the product and other expenditures. Not forgetting that most distributors buy their own product. Most distributors actually lose a lot of money.<br><br>There are tons of articles out there that explain the fundamental flaws of MLM. I will discuss 2 of the flaws.<br><br>The first is market saturation. When you recruit a downline, you are really recruiting a competing salesperson. In a normal company, people are hired to do sales but hiring stops when you have enough salespeople to serve the market. MLMs have no such controls.<br><br>The second is that MLMs are very inefficient. What is "passive income" as defined by MLMs? "Passive income" means you sit back, do nothing while your downlines sell. People who collect commission while doing nothing is very inefficient.<br><br>Let's take a look at this Businessweek article:<br><br><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/apr2006/sb20060419_388805.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/apr2006/sb20060419_388805.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"On a $25 grocery order, how much profit do you think we make?" he asks a group of new cashiers and stock clerks. "$12.50, $7.50, $2.50, or 75 cents?" Most are shocked to learn the correct answer is 75 cents -- and suddenly they understand the importance of watching costs.</span><br><br>That works out to an average margin of 3 cents on the dollar, or 3%.<br><br>Think about what this means. It means that as a reward for distributing goods, Walmart earns 3%. How much are all the distributors in an MLM rewarded for each product sold? Go sum up the percentages. And why would anyone want to pay such inflated prices? And do you really think it is the road to millions?<br><br></div>
