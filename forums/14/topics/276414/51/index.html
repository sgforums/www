            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>From Brian,<br><br><strong>China Photar - Emcom's acquisition</strong>.<br>(1) There's nothing wrong with a company paying out zero dividend and its normal to find companies in the GEMS category to declare lost. They are known as emerging companies, therefore they are purchased for future potentials. Emcom may have chose to purchased China Photar for its existing contacts/networks/infrastructures OR because its just cheap.<br><br>(2) Emcom purchased 73.85percent stake in the company, that is 73.85% x 588220000 = 434400470 shares at HK$0.017 cents each = HK$ 7384807.99 = SGD$1.48million, if they were to sell the shares at HK$0.295, they would have made SGD$24million from the transaction. BUT this has not happened. Emcom is still the biggest share holder in China Photar today as claimed by the website.<br><br>(3) If you follow all the announcement on the China Photar's website, there's extraordinary huge volume transacted daily and the company has month on month been requested by the stock exchange to explain why this is so. The directors have explained that its PURE market supply and demand and they have no knowledge of why. This is common as well for shares listed in hong kong, china, malaysia, indonesia.<br><br>(4) BUT if you read from <a href="http://www.chinaphotar.com/uploadfiles/20070712231610_705547.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinaphotar.com/uploadfiles/200...1610_705547.pdf</a><br>[size=4]The stock exchange has issued a warning that[/size] 92% of the shares in China Photar is being held by its 19 investors and directors (including Emcom), only a mere 8% of its shares is being traded in the market; another words only 8% of the total company's shares are meant to be purchased by the public on a day to day basis - MEANING The ONLY POSSIBLE CAUSE OF EXtraordinary volume to push up prices is by the owners of the company themselves.  This is a common underhand method used by sindicates to buy empty shell, push up price, create high volume to fake the popularity of the stock - attracts stupid speculators to buy the stock at high prices and then eventually deflate it.<br><br>(5) This method of making money is fast, shrewd and extremely LEGAL. The people who buy the stocks at the higher prices are made suckers and they cant complain. In Singapore, we rarely see such cases because MAS and our SGX (stock exchange) has much stringent rules and regulations.<br><br>(6) <a href="http://www.chinaphotar.com/uploadfiles/20070827153009_705547.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinaphotar.com/uploadfiles/200...3009_705547.pdf</a>  FOLLOWING from what i said in point 4, China Photar is pressured to increase the amount of shares for trading in the public to 25%. They make one of another holding company Modern China Holdings release holdings in China Photar to the public and thus increasing public offering to nearly 20percent in August.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>In any case, I do believe that there's nothing really suspicious about this transaction to purchase China Photar made by Emcom. Its a genuine business acumen that will be taken by any shrewd businessman out there.<br>BUT just a tot for you to take away: So How does James Phang make money if he didnt sell his stakes in China Photar?<br><br>Step 1: Collect money from SE<br>Step 2: Use this money to buy up his own shares in the open market.<br>Step 3: So you earn BOTH cash and still holds shares in the company!<br>Step 4: Repeat the process!<br><br>James Phang will never ever be caught by CAD because he's sitting on loads of money and he's only legally found in Emcom and not SE.<br></blockquote>Source = <a href="http://www.moneymakergroup.com/Sunshine-Empire-aka-Emcom-t105950.html&amp;st=1080" rel="nofollow">http://www.moneymakergroup.com/Sunshine-Empire-aka-Emcom-t105950.html&amp;st=1080</a></div>
