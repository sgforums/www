            <div class='col-md body'>bad news....<br><br>if someone is thinking of waiting until CAD settle the matter and the govt will help them to get their monies back, better think twice.<br><br>it is stated on the MAS website:<br><br><strong>Why should consumers not deal with unregulated persons?</strong><br><br>Consumers are strongly encouraged to deal only with persons that are regulated by MAS.  MAS' regulatory regime aims at safeguarding the interests of consumers by ensuring that only competent and professional persons may provide financial services.  If a consumer chooses to <strong>deal with persons that are not regulated by MAS, he forgoes the protection</strong> afforded under laws administered by MAS, particularly if these persons are based overseas.<br><br>so if anyone wants to get back anything at all, work at it early. good luck.</div>
