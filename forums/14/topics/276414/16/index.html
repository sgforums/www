After waiting for so long for your reply, you are asking me to do something that we may have difficulty doing.  In the first place, no receipt / invoice.  There is no contract.  It is ones' words against another..  It will be a very long process.  I agree with Tamago that perhaps you can give a name from your organisation for us to bring the matter to.  If SE is a clean company, surely there is someone who is and willing to be responsible.  Afterall, this concern the Company.  Let the P.I.C. talk to us and find out if there are black sheep in the Company.  Best of all, find out if there are people using the company name to scam.  Get the culprit and make pubilc.  Then SE can clear it name..  Isn't this a good opportunity to do so, now?<br><br>Well, the decision is on you or rather SE now ...</div></blockquote>Anyone in the right frame of mind, will choose this forum as the last place to post this problem, Call the management not the agent.

The announcement was posted on Tuesday under the heading 'EGA Leaders to receive GBO Awards from PM Lee'.<br><br>When contacted, Global Business Opportunities' founder Winnie Wang said the organisers have had second thoughts about the winners after reading reports on Sunshine in The Straits Times on Oct 24.<br><br>'We are shocked by the newspaper reports on Sunshine and are reviewing the winners of the two awards. We are convening a meeting next week to make a final decision,' she said.<br><br>A third award category - the Outstanding &amp; Leading Global Technological Awards - which has four winners this year, is unaffected.<br><br>Ms Wang said the awards would be given out by Global Business Opportunities' overseas and local chairmen and not by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, as stated in the Sunshine blog.<br><br>According to Ms Wang, Sunshine claimed that the blog was not posted by its management.

The announcement was posted on Tuesday under the heading 'EGA Leaders to receive GBO Awards from PM Lee'.<br><br>When contacted, Global Business Opportunities' founder Winnie Wang said the organisers have had second thoughts about the winners after reading reports on Sunshine in The Straits Times on Oct 24.<br><br>'We are shocked by the newspaper reports on Sunshine and are reviewing the winners of the two awards.

            <div class='col-md body'>i would prefer to see some guy ( representing SE ) to help origamist instead of all the flaming here and there. i believe this thread was set up to inform ppl and help them.<br><br>and i believe he is right in coming here to seek for help. he is human and he can judge from right and wrong, not because he ''is in the right frame of mine or not".<br><br>Under such media scrutinity, even though i have not been involved with SE before, one cant help but feel that there is something wrong with this company, of cux ppl will be bias towards it. i cant help but feel SE-side ppl like arh and chris_rf are so childish. By providing proof of what SE is doing totally clears my doubt ( and other ppls doubt ) towards it aint it? why flame? is this the right kind of Public relations the company shud have? especially so, even if u are coming to this forum on ur own accord, shudnt u have ur company's image in mind?<br><br>This made me prompt you what kind of seminars and school u have gone to, any proper marketting or business courses? an important and successful business not only needs good product but also be maintain good social relations and responsibility, but i do not see that coming from pro-mlm people here. Those seminars and meetings at ur offices only make ur have false enthusiams and hope of making big money only izzit? did u guys even finish ur poly class?<br><br>so many personal experiences have been posted in this forum and no pro-mlmer have given proper addresses to these issues. instead i got one from from ''emcom'' saying i am weak. yes i admit i can be easily persuaded but this experience has served a valuable lesson. however the kind of tactics some agents use are questionable and i hope the media will expose them. Wont that do justice to SE and other mlm as well? kick out those black sheep thats tarnishing ur reputation and prove that ur doing a legitimate business. Or ppl are just busy recruiting ppl for more money tt they dont care about morality and social responsibility.<br><br>just my thoughts.cheers</div>
