Some of these unregulated persons may sometimes use names similar to that of entities regulated by MAS.<br><br>Consumers should exercise care when dealing with these persons.

For those who work in the financial world, you will know very well MAS audits its financial institutions strictly. At the very least, you know the schemes you invested in or companies providing such schemes  have been audited and licensed. You have the basic level of guarantee and security in the products you invested in. You do know that your investment products are not some random scheme designed to scam you of your money or could lack financial strength because its not been verified by an expert third party.<br><br>For those who keep denying, you are blatant liars or big washed up ignoramus.<br></div>
