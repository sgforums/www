It all depends on which phases of Singapore GP you bought. As for SP, maybe you won't want to cash out since the sum is so... insignificant. Some BRM will also charge you 2% for administration in cashing out. Some will even charge you up to 7% to make a quick buck since Singaporeans can only cash out from their BRM from this day onwards, till CAD unfreeze SE's funds. This is in line with the new and improved e-wallet withdrawal system which will take 14 working days.<br><br>I am proud to inform you that once again, SE has went back against the Merchant Agreement Form and chose to give a lower CRP this month, perhaps to silence the critics.<br><br>Perhaps the 10% global turnover in your previous agreement form should have come with an asterix... saying JH can, at will, manipulate the cash rebates to protect other countries merchants and Singapore BRMs. Why can't he? He owns SE Singapore. He refuses to release sales figures for November 2007 in Singapore.<br><br>Please do not worry for the CRP for International GPs (Em Pin) and any OTHER countries is at 730.26 e-pts. Isn't it great to be a foreign talent?<br><br>Forget about asking your uplines. Please kindly approach your BRM for details. They will kindly assist you so as to use this chance to shine and also justify their 6-digit income. However, please expect the blame to be pushed on the following;<br>1. MediaCorp<br>2. SPH<br>3. MAS<br>4. CAD<br>4. All of the above<br><br>You may also want to note, BRM have been collecting GP from all other nations since August 2006, which is to say they are not really affected by the pathethic CRP for Singapore this month. Should SE close down in Singapore, no worries, Se will move HQ to Hong Kong.<br><br>Your kind BRM will also explain why even your Singapore GPs for various phases is all DIFFERENT.<br><br>For best results, please consult the BRM who likes to post/pose on forums and unofficial blogs in Room 7 of the Toa Payoh office. No worries, he has more than S$250,000 at least in reserve to pay for fines imposed by SE on his not-so-obedient merchants.<br><br>To the newly weds who bought Singapore GPs, congratulations, please approach your kind moon lighting property agents from HSR. I am sure 70-200+ e-points is enough to finance your housing loans for this month, as promised by your HSR-cum-SE-property-MLM-two-in-one agent.<br><br>To whom it may concern:<br>I am not so mean. I will not expose you. Maybe not yet. But, well done. 2 offices both in Toa Payoh, sell property and GP at the same time. Shrewd...

Because I have done my best to speak to influential people in SE but more often than not, my advise have fallen on deaf ears, especially to the 6 digit earning BRMs, GSDs and RSDs.<br><br>Am not sure if anyone remember my previous posts (no, not the unfinished SE concert review, but I will complete it!); I had written about the CRP system and I am somewhat disturbed that the weakness of this business module is exposed in November 2007; that is; the lack of confidence VS Singaporean's obedience to the political climate. Ok, nvm, I won't go in to that; the part of Singapore's government wanting a pie in businesses, specially profitable ones.<br><br>I will compile all the CRP for ALL COUNTRIES and post them for all to view in due time. I will also comment. For those who have PM messaged me, you know who you are, I do not believe that free speech should be restricted in Singapore; sorry. Go workers party!<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br>p.s.<br>Btw, SE as a Network marketing company can NOT do advertisement. If they do, there will be no more commission left!</div></blockquote>I am puzzled by ur P/S line.... do advertisement no money liao meh??? So do u think wif advertisement is better???/ and u get the same payout???<br><br>Not every company like that leh.....<br><br>At least there is one who advertise....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
