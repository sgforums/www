            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this is scary.<br><br>In most pyramid schemes, the early birds usually walks away winners while perhaps 50% of the people wil lose.<br><br>In SE case, everyone will lose!<br><br>This is because SE has a regular contests where they encourage everyone to 're-entry'<br><br>Examples are:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.sunshine-empire.com/download/Memo_Incentive%20to%20Genting%20&amp;%20Korea%2007.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.sunshine-empire.com/download/Memo_Incentive%20to%20Genting%20&amp;%20Korea%2007.pdf</a><br><br>Quoting..<br><br><strong>How to Qualify?<br>Within either Period 1 OR Period 2, any merchant who has fulfilled the following conditions will be entitled for a free ticket to Genting, or to Korea as well if you fulfill all the conditions! (Maximum of one ticket per person per trip)<br>Fulfill any of the following conditions and qualify for the trip to Genting plus a 200e-points transport rebate:<br><br>(a) Direct sponsor 4 new Gold Primes as your first generation in your network (all different names &amp; lines) OR<br>(b) Personal Sales (re-entry) 4 new Gold Primes as your first generation in your network OR<br>(c) Combination of (a) &amp; (b) to form 4 new Gold Primes as your first generation<br><br>And qualifiers for the Genting trip, as long as you fulfill any of the following conditions and you will qualify for the Korea trip too:<br><br>(a) Direct sponsor another 8 new Gold Primes (all different names) in your first or second generation in your network OR<br>(b) Personal Sales (re-entry) 8 new Gold Primes as your first or second generation in your network OR<br>(c) Combination of (a) &amp; (b) to form 8 new Gold Primes as your first or second generation in your network<br><br>All conditions must be fulfilled in either Period 1 or 2. Any new Gold Primes done in Period 1 cannot be brought forward to Period 2.<br><br>You need to re-qualify all 12 new Gold Primes in Period 2, if you only fulfilled the conditions for Trip to Genting in Period 1.</strong><br><br>Unquote.<br><br>So everyone will be encouraged to put back whatever they have earned!<br><br>Now I believe that even Top managers are not spared. With the sales of properties limited to only SE members, Top managers would naturally have to 'lead by example' in buying those units. And in the old FAQ, all buyers must buy a minimum of 10 units. This must be so that they can push it to their downlines.<br><br>And since once the deal is signed, they have to start paying a month later, can you imagine how much they have to put in monthly?<br><br>Say for a $700,000 house, a SE member pays 5% over 18 months.<br><br>So in a year, it would have been $35,000 over 12 months = RM$420,000!<br><br>So every month, the SE member would have to fork out around S$20k to pay for his house.<br><br>SE Members will be practically putting back everything they earn initially into the Property purchase. Not only putting back whatever they earn... it will be worse because banks wouldn't lend monry to a project that hasn't even started... so where are they getting the monthly $20k from???? Friends, banks, credit cards, company loans, insurance policies???<br><br>So if the house isn't built yet in 1 year and the company folds....<br><br>The implications are scary indeed!<br><br>I believe this will be a Everyone-Lose scenario.<br><br>If any SE manager is reading this .. please wake up.<br><br>In the KL project, SE couldn't even get the design and building location right, and already 50% sold???</div>

Is Phang Wah his real name? Maybe not. Since his brother's name has 3 characters, it's strange that his name would only have 2 characters.<br><br><blockquote><br>The facts 1 NOP Wen Xuan Cultural Artifacts Pte Ltd (the plaintiffs)<br>were incorporated on 15 December 2000 to acquire and take over as a going<br>concern, the undertaking and all the assets as well as liabilities of, NOP Wen<br>Xuan Cultural Artifacts (the firm), a partnership which was originally<br>registered on 17 November 1998 by two (2) siblings Phang Song Hua (Phang) and Phang Hock Chin. The plaintiffs have an authorised capital of$100,000 of which only $2.00 has been paid-up. The firm was officially terminated on 21 February 2001 but this fact was unknown to the first defendants who say they only found out after this suit was initiated. The Phang brothers were the original suscribers to the memorandum of the plaintiffs and Phang (who calls himself Hillary Phang) was also a founding director and shareholder. <strong>Phang Hock Chin (who calls himself James Phang) </strong> is the chairman of the plaintiffs. Phang is a self-styled geomancer who has three (3) outlets in Singapore for this line of business.<br><br>2 Leong Hwa Chan Si Temple (the first defendants/the temple) is located at No. 72 Shrewsbury Road, Singapore. It is registered with the Registrar of Societies and is the owner and developer (jointly with two [2] other parties) of a columbarium (the columbarium) situated on a piece of land at Choa Chu Kang, leased from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). By the time this dispute came on for trial, the columbarium had been completed with 100,000<br>niches for urns to hold the ashes of the dead. Chia Eng Soon (the second<br>defendant) is the abbot and trustee put in charge of the day-to-day operations of the temple by the first defendants' management committee. He is also known as Reverend Sek Meow Ee. The second defendant with his brother Chia Yoong Hui are the directors and shareholders of AsiaCorp Holding Pte Ltd (AsiaCorp) incorporated on 7 October 2000 as an investment holding company 3 By an agreement dated 14 September 2000 (the agreement) made between the first defendants and the firm, it was agreed that the first defendants would appoint the firm as Special Sales Agent (together with seven (7) other companies in the Four Seasons Group of companies), to market and sell 20,000 niches in the columbarium.<br><br>.....<br><br>(whole doc is few pages long)</blockquote></div>
