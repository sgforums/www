I posted earlier and cry for help on behalf of my friend.  I receive none.  Perhaps you can.<br><br>My friend's son ( 16 years old ) was " recuited " to join.  He had wanted to go home to talk to his mother (my friend ) for money.  The recuiters (3 of them ) encouraged and bring him to the nearest ATM to draw the money.  When my friend found out, she asked for refund.  SE claims that only Director can refund and that he is not free as he is flying around the world, very buzy.  My friend insisted and asked for the receipt which was not issued when money was paid.  They say receipt is not issued on the spot.  At 2300 hrs, the girl asked my friend to go down to collect the receipt.  My friend say she cannot just go down on the whim and call and it's already so late how to go down..  She asked to make appointment but SE just give her a Toa Payoh address and asked her to go down.  She asked for time and they say they cannot give because they don't know when they are free.  My friend say her time is precious as she have to work too.  SE claims that theirs is MORE PRECIOUS as they make MILLIONS by the minutes.<br><br>Without receipt and all supporting documents, I advise her to give up instead of fighting against the crooks.  Afterall they are already out to cheat.  Just treat the $300+ as a lesson learnt.  SE called again and asked her to go down.  In order to get a refund, she must listen to a talk given by the Manager or Director.  SO my friend say don't want to and willing to give up the fight.  SE say thank you for the donation....   I mean they really got the cheek to say that...   I am wonder and they bagger or what !!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>So you being a pro SE, please advise if the doing is right?  If not, can SE arrange for a refund without giving additional stress to innocent people...   If SE is so upright, why go on such a tactic.  For your information, all the call were make to my friend after 2300 hrs....   Does SE know the people need to rest and sleep ???</div></blockquote>cannot lar, give them 300 for fuk?<br>Lesson for your friend? then who is going to teach these crook lesson?<br><br>16 dont dare to write recipet, smart move ler ~ go court also lan lan<br><br>what if there is Ah Gong Ah Mah with their Coffin Provisional Fund all sink in one?<br><br>SE Agent?
