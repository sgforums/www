            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Redstone...<br><br>Reviewing the video at the EPV main page, I cannot find this video shot.<br><br><img src="http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a103/abductboy/melaka_project4.jpg"><br><br>It is still showing this:-<br><br><img src="http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a103/abductboy/m12.jpg"><br><br>and this (I change it from negative to white)<br><br><img src="http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a103/abductboy/m15.jpg"><br><br>This is the same as what is shown in the Malaysia Papers. I crop the photo:-<br><br><img src="http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a103/abductboy/themepark.jpg"><br><br>It would be that the 2 19 storeys tall Service Suites Buildings and Convention Centre will be built on 30 acres of reclaimed land.<br><br>The land has yet to be reclaimed and the artist hasn't even drawn it yet. Just look at the left building foundation.<br><br><img src="http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a103/abductboy/riglocation-1.jpg"><br><br>Anyone knows how long it takes to reclaim a land the size of 1200 units of 100sqm HDB flats laid side by side? And how much longer after reclaimation does one have to wait before we can built 19 storeys buildings on it?<br><br>I must also add that the beachline where the reclaimation will take place also runs along to other sea-resorts and condos, like Shah Beach Resort, Ocean Palms Condo, Klebang Beach Resort, Riveria Bay Resort etc.<br><br>Maybe some implications there as well.<br><br>The water isn't clear already as it is within industrial &amp; Straits water.</div>

I also showed in my photo that the Empire Sunshine Villa is out of the current hoarding location, and the piling machines are at a location that is a no-building land. (Red Triangle).<br><br><img src="http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a103/abductboy/riglocation-1.jpg"><br><br>The artist illustration here is also inaccurate. the Service Suites to the left has simply been cut and paste onto the plan. The jetty for the ancient ship has been crushed.<br><br>Again I urge EPV to correct the drawings and seeing tha so many units have been booked, with the instalment of a minimum $10,000 per unit starting 1 month after booking the units, it must be worrying for anyone to see my findings.<br><br>I know many people look at the Malacca project as investment. But you can't resell something base on a video, you need a real apartment on a real piece of land. Currently, you have sea water.</div>
