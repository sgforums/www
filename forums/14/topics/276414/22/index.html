He said NOP is now inactive.<br><br>Mr Phang said he knows many investors believe he is the 'dishonest businessman' behind the project. But he begged to differ.<br><br>'I'm a victim of the failed project too. I was the one who reported to the police when the project was abandoned...I collected over $1 million from investors but I lost more than $6 million. I was in debt because of this project but I've paid up almost all of the debt.'<br><br>He said the debt included paying off NOP's tax and banks' credit facilities.<br><br>Mr Phang said that his younger brother was the chief executive of the project, but declined to elaborate.<br><br>He said he never hid the information that he owns NOP. 'I'm not in the wrong and I'm not scared. I stand upright.'<br><br>In a letter in 2004 to the 1,000 investors, PT Magic Kingdom blamed the Sept 11, 2001 terror attacks on the United States, the Bali bombings in 2002, the Iraq war and Sars for the project's failure.<br><br>Only $16,931 was left in its coffers, it stated.<br><br>When contacted, the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) said it had received seven complaints on the failed project. In January 2004, Case met NOP representatives, who said they could not refund investors as it had suffered big losses in the project.<br><br>Investors were advised by Case to file their claims in Indonesia, where Magic Kingdom was incorporated. Some investors also filed complaints with the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD). The police were unable to respond to queries on its probe into PT Magic Kingdom by press time.<br><br>On Oct 24, The Straits Times cited sources as saying that Sunshine was being investigated by the CAD.<br><br>Sunshine has attracted the attention of the authorities as its activities appear to be like a pure investment scheme - but it is not licensed for such operations.<br><br>Incidentally, Mr Phang has recently claimed that Empire Group Alliance's property arm is involved in building a marine theme park, called The Magic Kingdom, in Malaysia.<br><br>lorna@sph.com.sg<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>'I LOST MONEY TOO'<br><br>'I'm not in the wrong and I'm not scared.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Empire Strikes Back<br><br>Much Maligned MLM company Sunshine Empire has hit back at her detractors in the strangest possible way: By actively seeking to prosecute an annonymous poser of a false article on an online forum.<br><br>Said the president of the company,"I will not stand by while the good name of my company is dragged through the mud by this person posting false information online while hiding behind a fake identity. Only The Straits Times and The New Paper is qualified to post negative things about us!"<br><br>When the poster of the satirical "article" was asked online by a fellow forumner if he or she was "worried" about being actively sued by Sunshine Empire for making comments online, the poser of the original "article" replied, "suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue meeeeeeeeeeeeeee lorrrrrrrrrrrrrr."<br><br>Apparantly the creator of the comical article felt the company under fire should have much better things to do such as restoring their reputation before their empty promises are shown up for what they are.

If investors choose to deal with persons who are not regulated by the MAS, they forgo the protection afforded under laws administered by the MAS,' an MAS spokesman said. MoneySENSE, a national financial literacy programme, has issued a new consumer alert to caution consumers against pie-in-the-sky investment schemes.<br><br>Titled 'If something is too good to be true, it probably is!', the alert cited Ponzi-style schemes as examples of quick-rich return proposals that consumers should steer clear of.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Ponzi schemes are scams where people are enticed to invest by the promise of high returns. The returns, however, are paid out of funds from new investors entering the scheme. </span><br><br>It all goes swimmingly until the flow of new funds start to dry up.<br><br>The alert can be found on the MoneySENSE <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/%20publications/quick_tips/Consumer_Portal_Alert.html" rel="nofollow">website</a>.</div>
