            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Well....benefit of doubt... Whether their project in malacca is real or not actually doesn't matter at all. We all know well with sme money you can all do wonders in neighbouring countries...<br><br>But personally i do not think they can use any amount of money to 'buy' any authorities in singapore. Can you? And they are so so stupid to challenge the authorities here and treat these departments like fools and idiots.<br><br>Not much public news latelyin SG because there are too many BIG OFFICIALS from MAJOR countries coming town to visit SG and  ministers...<br><br>SG gov will not allow medias (newspapers etc) to reveal too much bad image of the country. I am very sure once all Big Officials from Major countries leae town the relevant authorities will step in to clear rubbish. House cleaning.<br><br>Regarding any pojects which SE mentioned that they will be involve into are just marketing gimmicks to lure more victims.<br><br>Through James Phang Wah past records we can and sure know whatever hehad involved into any whatsoever projects will and sure FAIL. And never will any INVESTORS get any refunds. It will be fun though seeing what oher excuses he will give in near future....Nature disaster again? SARS?? Or current issue on OIL PRICE???? ahahaha.....but sadly....wonder who will suffer again.<br><br>My guess is soon they will declare many reasons of not able to pay....not able to refund....requesting investors to wait......(trying hard to dig from somewhere else and trying to use whatever means to drag so to make more profits himself and leave his poor CHILDREN to face the fiing squad from public and sg gov...)<br><br>Actually i realised they have been covering their ass by claiming they are MLM company and no inviting INVESTORS so that SG gov can't catch them.....But i was wondering if the SG authorities ever try doing a search or understanding of what SE is doing in asia? Out of SG they are openly marketing the company as an investment platform. All who joined were investors. I believe many who throw money into the company got no idea what the company is selling but only know they will  somehow get returns...<br><br>Soon once the company is ot able to roll anymore from fresh investors due to authorities catching up them.....many will cry or commit suicide....and some or most people will go knock on James Phang Wah's door in Westwood Ave and Jacky Ho's door in Jurong.

I have seen his pictures and could feel his pride and strength that he is a firm believer in himself and his abilities.<br><br>But remember that Datuk Lalex would have many staff under him.... and 1 of his staff would have un-intentionally made the mistake.<br><br>Here is my assessment of the letter.<br><br>1) the format looked like an extract from a magazine, that would explain the face of the CM on the letter.<br><br>2) being an extract, that would explain why the letter is so unofficial-looking, with no proper address<br><br>3) there is a mistake in that there is no letterhead, the State logo is placed below the date<br><br>4) the original letter in the website included a 2nd page filled with add-on photos of the CM with various VIPs including the Malaysia PM. The 2nd page has been removed.<br><br>5) I guess the concern is not that the content of the letter is faked. It is probably an extract of a magazine. If so, then the whole page of the magazine should be displayed.<br></div>
