Am not here to prove anything thou.<br><br>Oh ya,articulation is the key point, so what key factor are needed? anyway, I am also not afraid to point out contradictory remarks made by u.  Well, since you are saying that you have no contradictory issue, whats more can i say, you can deny all you want thou.  =]<br><br>i see no issue about me saying what you have quoted, it is just purely some points i pointed out based on observation and speculation, and similarly like you, base on how you think, and still very firmly saying that i am related to them :/. I don't know how you can do that, so do i have to let you see my ic whether my name is in their company?  Maybe this is the only way that  i can make u say that what u assumed was wrong all the while =D.<br><br>Am coming back for holiday soon.<br><br></div></blockquote>If you cant prove, then you cant say that I am denying. Clearly you couldnt articulate well, I am not sure how long you plan to bamboozle anyone.<br><br>Who did say you must be a member of the company only? Please re-read my post. Unlike you, I do not subscribe to 'confusionism'.<br><br>Secondly, will they let me check? I have something against a company that does not protect the integrity of its client data or with a database that is as leaky as anything like most IT people here pointed out.<br><br>I dont think whatever solution you offer me will lead to a resolution of this matter.
