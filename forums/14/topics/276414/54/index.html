            <div class='col-md body'>kyoshirou77<br>Junior Member<br><br>Joined: 03 Nov 2007<br>Posts: 301<br><br>Send Message  27 November 2007 Â· 06:08 PM<br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Hi,<br><br>I am a Malaysian and was recently (actually 3 weeks ago) introduced to Sunshine but havenÂ’t joined as a member yet. What stopped me was the negative press that I have been reading ever since I decided to do some research on Sunshine before I make up my decision.<br><br>When I came across this blog, I must admit I have even greater doubts now though I will still harbour the hope that all these negativity will be over once the SG CAD clears Sunshine. Why I harbour this hope is because the person who introduced Sunshine to me really earned a lot of money and I love to have that too!<br><br>This I address to post #89Â… Mr Jimmy, is it possible that the Â“letterÂ” is actually the speech given by the Chief Minister during the ground breaking ceremony? I did saw some pictures of the said Minister at SunshineÂ’s ground breaking event. However what I dont understand is thisÂ… if it is the speech then why is it dated 1st Nov instead of 11th Sep which is the ground breaking date?<br><br>This I address to anyone who may have answersÂ… I contacted some friends in Indonesia since apparently Sunshine is very active there and ask whether they heard about Sunshine or not. What I got from my friends are quite startling. They told me that back in 2002 to 2004 there was a company in Indonesia called Probest which apparently have similar business model like Sunshine. At their height, Probest was taking in millions of USD a day! Somehow, the Indonesia government found them to be illegal and a lot of members lost money. The boss apparently was charged but somehow managed to elude authorities and is in hiding now. The most startling fact was this.. my friends told me that this Indonesian named Borhan something was actually a partner of James Phang in NOP, one of the earlier reincarnation of Sunshine. Can anyone confirm or refute this?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Look at the time frame 2002-2004<br><br>In the end........................<br>http://www.firstmillionchallenge.com/sunshine-empire-too-good-to-be-true/<br><br><strong>After some easy investigations and simple research it is definite that this CONMAN James Phang Wah indeed is a business partner of Ex-Scam scheme creator Burhan Sofian (indonesian). And Burhan had went to jailed for a couple of months in indonesia before using money to buy some freedom. Their office was and by research is still in Grogor Permai Dr. Lathumenthen Jakarta.<br><br>And greediness gets better of Phang Wah knowing SCAM is the best way to get himself rich. Following the concept of how Probest scamming system Phang Wah had modified the plan and 3 years later now created Sunshine. Using ignorant children, brainwashing them to worship him making the platform look glamorous. Cheating the young followers and lying to the elders. But of cos greediness is still the key factor of why people went into this SCAM created by this man. Not all believe in him but just hoping to get rich in this difficult society. Very sad indeed....<br><br>There are still many naive youngsters in SG choose to believe in their 'father' but i hope these children and investors know deep in their heart that they will never be the children of this 'Father' because he is purely making use of them to make himself a superstar. And when all things collapse ....all will be on their own to face all consequences and their 'Father' will never appear to help them. This is because their 'Father' will be busy helping himself to get out of shit and got his own family (elderly father, mother, pitiful wife and four children) to take care of.<br><br>When Phang Wah's ex-project Magic Kingdom collapsed. He blame everybody and anybody except himself. Declaring he was also the victim and being the 1st person to had reported to the police (he thought was a smart move). He had even openly declared he had nothing to do with the project and flaming his younger brother was the CEO of the project Magic Kingdom. What kind of a brother is Phang Wah pushing all the responsibilties to his younger brother when faces pressure from the authorities and public? If he can betray his own Blood so why can't he betray his 'children' his followers?? He had done it before and he will do it again.<br><br>His own Blood has been trying hard to disown him. Youngest brother Hillary Phang Song Hua doing well as Fengshui Master in Upper Cross Street. And ex-CEO of Magic Kingdom Jeffrey Pang Hock Chin struggling in Carpenter Street managing a MLM company. What kind of a man who many called "Father" and respected when his own Blood wants nothing to do or link with?<br><br>Whatever it is Sunshine Empire will go down. If the authorities do not get to them then Phang Wah will self-destruct eventually as this Scam will not roll forever.</strong></div>
