            <div class='col-md body'>This is from a friend who has invested into Sunshine Empire and still in Dreamland...<br><br>Latest communication from Sunshine Empire to their investors...<br><br>-----<br><br>Also company has announced that the press has been indicating that we are under CAD investigations since Oct but the best thing was that we were initially not being investigated at all. So in order to prove that the company is not doing anything illegal or scamming ppl of their hard-earned money, they hv written to CAD thru their lawyers on 6 Nov, inviting them to come and investigate the company which they did on the 13 th of Nov. <span class="large"><strong>Right now, they are checking our accounts and hv frozen them so as to help them in their investigation, hence yr rebates would be delayed and held back in the meantime.</strong></span> They hv also called up a few key leaders to interview them and asked them about the company activities. So pls do not be concerned as the company would not close down as we are an int'l company operating in 10 - 11 other countries &amp; they are asking for our patience for the investigations to be over.<br><br>Also, in August, I hv mentioned that the company may remove the CLP (Customer Loyalty Program) of US$60K by end of the year and now it has been confirmed that in few days time, it would be removed completely and therefore new GPs would only get US$12K and no longer get to reap the profits of US$60K. So pls hold on to yr GPs as it is worth alot of money. Also pls note that business is as usual and ppl are still buying GPs in the midst of this negative and false media reports. So rest assured abt the status of the company and yr GPs.<br><br>To reiterate the whole company business model, we are simply a MLM networking company with real products such as Emcall and Emall products to redeem, just like any other MLM companies. We are not an investment company and you are not investing yr hard-earned money in this company. U are simply buying some of the products such as Silver Merchant and Gold Prime and getting monthly rebates just like any other company business who gives u rebates for using their products (eg credit cards rebates, discount card rebates, supermarket rebates etc). And we do not use yr money to invest in other projects but used them for other avenues such as paying staff salaries, office maintenance, research and development purposes etc. Our EGA has legitimate projects in Taichung, Condo in KL, Shopping Centre and Theme Park Resort in Malacca which hv been falsely claimed in the press as non-existent. Pls check out their EGA websites for more details. So pls hv faith in the company and do not be swayed by the mass media which hv been blown out of proportion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey all,<br><br>Please please keep sending all the info you have to sph AND tnp. You've got the emails attached to their articles, if you don't just pm me.<br><br>No point putting the info here for SE to read and then try react, we're playing into their hands here. Like previously in forums we read about Phang signing all the SE cheques despite being a mere adviser (plus being the president of ega which has NO relation apparently to SE), now SE is acting by doing their transactions online or smth, they're no longer going to use cheques.<br><br>Remember, for each new info you post here, you give SE the time to cover their tracks and have a good response once CAD or the papers flesh them out. So give all your info to cad and the press, I'm sure they welcome everything.<br><br>NetCruiser, you may want to list your source. Besides, can an internal memo really be done in such horrid english?<br><br>I'm in a rough patch with my gf now as she is in se. Somehow, she said that it's a good thing that even if some people may be asking for refunds, you still have students, uncles and aunties who dont read the papers to put their money in. That's all that matters coz then she can get her money back. I think that's quite disgusting and I really find it quite discomforting to know that someone I love can be reduced to such selfish behaviour.<br><br>Sigh. Which is why I hope SE goes down as soon as possible and stop killing and brainwashing the people in Singapore. SE keeps telling its merchants everything is good, they working to modify their ways along with govt and cad will clear their name soon. Imagine the number of arrogant youngsters who can't cope in the Singapore education system and then flaunt their bmws to everyone while sprouting rubbish to other ignorant youths and (prob illiterate) middle aged people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like the projects in Malacca, KL and Taiwan, where is the proof that they have lawyers inviting CAD to investigate them?<br><br>Second point, isnt it ludicrous CAD can be simply invited by lawyers to investigate about a company? Isnt CAD a pawn of SE, to be called at will to investigate something?<br><br>Third point, as an legal enforcement agency, since when its CAD's duty to clear a person or a company's name at invitation? They can prosecute or investigate upon a police report made or suspicions of a crime, but since when they will proactively try to clear someone's name?<br><br>Clearly, not for the first time, the roots of government and legal enforcement is made a mockery of and challenged<br><br>They should be hanged for acts of subversions.<br><br></div>
