Just to ask, is the reporter reading this forum? If yes, thats good.<br><br>Here are some questions,<br>1) How can the government didnt take any action on this company (Sunshine Empire)?<br><br>2) If this type of company still carry on to collect money to invest in their whatever investment and pay such a high returns, then why the people in singapore still investing with the banks?<br><br>3) So does it means that this company (Sunshine Empire) is better than our Temasek Holdings? In terms of return?<br><br>4) Dont the government feel that this company is affecting the whole financial industry in singapore?<br><br>5) Does the police know that this company (Empire Group Alliance) is belonged to the ex-NOP boss James Phang who actually collected millions of dollars using Magic Kingdom project in the year 2002 and ALL the investors' money were gone at that time?<br><br>Hope the reporter can continue using media to bring this company down because its a threat to our people.<br><br>Thank You.<br><br></div></blockquote>Like the NKF, it took a reporter to expose these scammer, is there something wrong with our legal system.  I am sure that there are many complains before the reporter started working on it ..   why need a whole sensation from the newspaper before the police take action ..  ???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fully agree - blatant scams like Sunshine should be exposed and suspended way before they can rake in their millions.<br><br>What is going to happen is that they will close and they will blame the media for bringing them down, and to all the aunties, uncles and retirees - "too bad, who ask the media go and jeopardize our image? our father tried very hard to build up SE for you all and he is now the worst of the lot! You think you lose a lot? He lost much much much more! Few hundred millions!"<br><br>Then james phang will split the money with some of his kar-kia, leave the rest for himself and happily retire with the biggest scam success of his life.<br><br>If they hold him accountable, he will turn around and SUE Sunshine (which incidentally happens to be jackie hoo hoo hoo's company as he is the APA plesident) since he is not a director nor shareholder.<br><br>Only difference between this and the Magic Kingdom scam last time is that with the money he's gotten, he won't have to do a scam for a long long time.<br><br>If you think about it he will actually be happy SE brought down so he can do damage control and shirk responsibility - it might be his goal in the first place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

Mr James Phang is the International President of and adviser to Sunshine<br>Empire, but nor a director or shareholder.

Sunshine Empire has been operating successfully, providing real tangible<br>products on an Internet-based trading platform that yield healthy profit for its<br>merchants. It is not a fraudulent scheme. If it had been, it would not be<br>operating today.<br>This is BULLS..... SCAM will operate as long as they are not exposed. SE only<br>been operating for 1 year. They make use of our government "so called"<br>super efficient for catching thieves.<br><br>anyway, i too lazy to criticise the statement becuz by now, you know<br>everything been come to light liao. btw for those defending SE or other bogus<br>MLM, when asked to proof, pls do not avoid question and start flamming ppl.<br>our poor lau, always kana bombed de. redstone so lucky, didnt get bombed.<br>haiz, anyway hope this will be an expensive lesson for the youngster like me in SE and hope the aunty uncles in there, with their hard earned money, haiz.....can recover. maybe we join forces and start a vandetta hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>

(Since its 10% of total global turnover)<br><br>Your turn over is quite close to the turnover at the neighbourhood NTUC, SHop and SAve is doing in half a month you know. Do you personally go up there and spend actively everyday? or you truly believe pple from SE go on line like crazy to buy lingerie,psp etc.. everyday?<br><br>Even if all your 20,000 singaporean members go buy a PSP each at $500, it only equals to 10million in turn over.<br><br>Which idiot will go emall to buy tons of Amway or another MLM products? You as well go join Amway instead of SE since you already have staff discount if you are from Amway. How much discount can you REALLY REALLY Save? 50%?<br><br>IF really so that all your 20,000 members go up and buy Amyway shampoo, detergents,vitamins bla bla bla, per member need to spend $10,000 every month in buying all this nonsense which you can buy MUCH MUCH cheaper at your nearest NTUC, watson, guardian to clock in $200million turn over. You think that makes sense?<br><br>SE members that i know, first thing they do when they get back capital is buy car. Not go emall buy things. Is there any cars that you sell online also?<br><br>Your emall only accessible to 20,000 members. You want to have a sales turn over of $240million every month, each person would need to spend $12,000 a month on shopping lo.. do you do that?<br><br>================================<br><br>Merchants have MORE SAY than SE in posting their products onto the EMALL. Without the merchants, EMALL is NOTHING. Therefore SE should be giving incentive for pple to come and sell things here than asking someone to pay a high premium price to set their stalls on the emall.<br><br>Do you know why u find other MLM products there? cos they are not popular to the mass audience and are only meant for MLM lovers! therefore it can only be sold via more non-popular media like your EMaLL which obviously reached out to MLM lovers like YOU!. Today if i want to sell something, why dont i place it at NTUC, watson, Giant, Harvey Norman etc.. why put in some pitiful emall with only 20,000 members when i have another 3.8million population out there that will buy from the bigger stalls? Therefore only the 'cannot make it' merchants will list their products there and pay SE a premium to help them sell.<br><br>think about it in the business angle. You will see.<br><br>===============================<br><br>SO do you still really believe that the merchants pay a high premium to sell things on your Emall like what JP and ya directors claim? How much premium you want to pay for an online store? 100k rental a month? thats the same price as a big store in takashimaya. If you are the merchant, which one makes more sense to you?<br><br>Without merchants, Emall is nothing. so who depends on who? Without the emall from SE, the merchants have thousands of other alternatives out there. you think about it.<br><br>===============================<br><br>Now to give you guys some figures to digest about the property business that makes you guys believe that SE is for real:<br><br>The 1000 lots apartments SE sold in malaysia were priced at 70kRM - 250kRM each (35kSGD - 125kSGD)..<br><br>Assume average out at 80kSGD each - 1000units X 80k = $80milionSGD - ASSUME that JP got a super good deal and built the whole entire apartment FOR FREE. AND 80million is all in as PURE PROFIT with ZERO Construction cost. AND i am also assuming that SE in Toa Payoh or Malaysia has workers and Big Cranes hiding behind the counters to build the apartments as such that they NO NEED TO SHARE PROFIT with another construction firm.<br><br>SE claims to have 50,000 or more members worldwide - so assuming that take out all the money and split, 80million divided over 50k pple, each member will get $1,600, thats only enough for 1.4 months of payment if you do your maths. Even if you work with 20k members, its only enough to pay up to 4 months. And SE doesnt go round building apartments and selling them off every month. And I am still assuming that the 80million is ALL PURE PROFIT with ZERO cost for constructing the apartment.<br><br>The rest of the property projects like the villa in malacca, water resort projects etc.. are all in the bidding stages OR in the very beginning of land selection (according to media report). Another words ZERO income.<br><br>So what kinda of business model are we talking about here?<br><br>Is there anything else that SE does or Emcom have that we do not know?<br>That's what CAD will find out for us.</strong></blockquote><strong></strong><br><br>Spotted at OhGenki</div>
