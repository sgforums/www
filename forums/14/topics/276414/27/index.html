This was so their allegations would not have to undergo detailed public scrutiny.<br><br>Ultimately, SCO's allegations were shown to be just smoke and mirrors. They also faced a lot of backlast from the journalists that they fooled.<br><br>This is the same situation. Basically, Sunshine does not want their claims to be examined critically.<br><br>Sunshine Empire does not want outsiders to be able to rebut their explanations as they preach to their faithful. I am pretty sure if they had any evidence at all (eg. signed contracts, etc.) they would immediately show it as it's essential that they restore confidence.</div>

From business perspective, companies should know how to manage these and salvage their reputation, if there is any shred of it left.<br><br>Unfortunately, it doesnt help that if the agents dont respond in a professional manner. Lets just say, nobody else beside the company and its members will care if the company is losing money from image problems, and if that even the members couldnt care less, there is less need to talk about right and wrong.<br><br>Actually, its always confound me that some business dont act like well...business, ie, marketing its products and selling them...but like some religio-political organisation where they think they have god-given rights and people are obliged to them<br><br></div>

If people who doesn't know this They will keep on buying GP when they got the profit and Up till when the company starts to pay low return to the Gp that holder has, they can't sell it away and will stuck their money in the company, it can't be a shares to have a voting right to say anything. They are doing Taiwan 'Dan Shui' Islandwide Internet Wifi...<br><br>I heard about this project, but i doubt they will be doing this.<br>So my point to this company will be a Scam in the long term when they can't absorb anymore fund they will collaspe and run away, meanwhile they're earning ..... People who just buy 1 GP... Just leave it there and stop buying, So you will be getting back your 100% in 10months time.... So Please comment</div></blockquote>Haha this Co. I heard it before but the person was taking to my 2 freinds I was sitting there to listen nia...<br><br>My two friends immediately buy the GP from them... It sound like scam to me...</div>
