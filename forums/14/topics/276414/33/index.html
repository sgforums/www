            <div class='col-md body'>Alessandro, read this:<br><br><blockquote><strong>If you have 20,000members (just using local statistics) taking 1200 a month - that means $24million a month is being paid out to you guys form the company.<br><br>Do you really believe that your emall platform can have sales of $24million X 10 = $240million a month? (Since its 10% of total global turnover)<br><br>Your turn over is quite close to the turnover at the neighbourhood NTUC, SHop and SAve is doing in half a month you know. Do you personally go up there and spend actively everyday? or you truly believe pple from SE go on line like crazy to buy lingerie,psp etc.. everyday?<br><br>Even if all your 20,000 singaporean members go buy a PSP each at $500, it only equals to 10million in turn over.<br><br>Which idiot will go emall to buy tons of Amway or another MLM products? You as well go join Amway instead of SE since you already have staff discount if you are from Amway. How much discount can you REALLY REALLY Save? 50%?<br><br>IF really so that all your 20,000 members go up and buy Amyway shampoo, detergents,vitamins bla bla bla, per member need to spend $10,000 every month in buying all this nonsense which you can buy MUCH MUCH cheaper at your nearest NTUC, watson, guardian to clock in $200million turn over. You think that makes sense?<br><br>SE members that i know, first thing they do when they get back capital is buy car. Not go emall buy things. Is there any cars that you sell online also?<br><br>Your emall only accessible to 20,000 members. You want to have a sales turn over of $240million every month, each person would need to spend $12,000 a month on shopping lo.. do you do that?<br><br>================================<br><br>Merchants have MORE SAY than SE in posting their products onto the EMALL. Without the merchants, EMALL is NOTHING. Therefore SE should be giving incentive for pple to come and sell things here than asking someone to pay a high premium price to set their stalls on the emall.<br><br>Do you know why u find other MLM products there? cos they are not popular to the mass audience and are only meant for MLM lovers! therefore it can only be sold via more non-popular media like your EMaLL which obviously reached out to MLM lovers like YOU!. Today if i want to sell something, why dont i place it at NTUC, watson, Giant, Harvey Norman etc.. why put in some pitiful emall with only 20,000 members when i have another 3.8million population out there that will buy from the bigger stalls? Therefore only the 'cannot make it' merchants will list their products there and pay SE a premium to help them sell.<br><br>think about it in the business angle. You will see.<br><br>===============================<br><br>SO do you still really believe that the merchants pay a high premium to sell things on your Emall like what JP and ya directors claim? How much premium you want to pay for an online store? 100k rental a month? thats the same price as a big store in takashimaya. If you are the merchant, which one makes more sense to you?<br><br>Without merchants, Emall is nothing. so who depends on who? Without the emall from SE, the merchants have thousands of other alternatives out there. you think about it.<br><br>===============================<br><br>Now to give you guys some figures to digest about the property business that makes you guys believe that SE is for real:<br><br>The 1000 lots apartments SE sold in malaysia were priced at 70kRM - 250kRM each (35kSGD - 125kSGD)..<br><br>Assume average out at 80kSGD each - 1000units X 80k = $80milionSGD - ASSUME that JP got a super good deal and built the whole entire apartment FOR FREE. AND 80million is all in as PURE PROFIT with ZERO Construction cost. AND i am also assuming that SE in Toa Payoh or Malaysia has workers and Big Cranes hiding behind the counters to build the apartments as such that they NO NEED TO SHARE PROFIT with another construction firm.<br><br>SE claims to have 50,000 or more members worldwide - so assuming that take out all the money and split, 80million divided over 50k pple, each member will get $1,600, thats only enough for 1.4 months of payment if you do your maths. Even if you work with 20k members, its only enough to pay up to 4 months. And SE doesnt go round building apartments and selling them off every month. And I am still assuming that the 80million is ALL PURE PROFIT with ZERO cost for constructing the apartment.<br><br>The rest of the property projects like the villa in malacca, water resort projects etc.. are all in the bidding stages OR in the very beginning of land selection (according to media report). Another words ZERO income.<br><br>So what kinda of business model are we talking about here?<br><br>Is there anything else that SE does or Emcom have that we do not know?<br>That's what CAD will find out for us.</strong></blockquote><strong></strong><br><br>Spotted at OhGenki</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By Kog.<br><br>Lie #1: "The information here comes from internet, therefore inaccurate."<br><br>Firstly internet websites are not necessarily inaccurate, for example, would you say government websites are inaccurate? Secondly, my sources of information are not entirely from internet, they are MAS, SC, ACRA, Whois, my contacts in a due diligence firm, Malaysia and Singapore newspapers. Unless someone is able to show these organizations are unreliable, my information is reliable. (P/S: When has ST ever said someone is an idiot in the papers?)<br><br>Lie #2: "No proof SE is scam."<br><br>I have proven SE is a scam in past comments. He has not been able to demonstrate a reasonable doubt in my proof. I repost here:<br><br>Suppose I am the prosecutor, I'd find those investors who have been approached, engaged by a large number of SE agents and have invested their money, as eye witnesses. I'd get sworn affidavits from them. I'd get any sales, promotion material given to them by the SE agents, bank transfer statements as physical evidences. I'd make a video/audio recording of a meet-up.<br><br>They will testify the SE agents informed them about the investment into a water theme park project, or wireless project, promised them a handsome return (R.O.I.). They will testify they invested a certain amount, and got back a return every month.<br><br>I will then show SE is not regulated to conduct such activities, SE's projects do not exist. It's easy, just get official letters from the relevant agencies to testify.<br><br>Once the SE agents are found guilty, i.e. offering investments into phony projects to public without license, SE management such as JP and JH can't disclaim responsibility, because<br><br>1. The money went into their pockets (SE corporate bank account statements from banks can be used as evidences to prove this). They have spent the money (e.g. to buy BMWs). This point alone is enough to convict them.<br><br>2. They oversee, supervise the operations of SE, so there is no reason to believe they are unaware of what their agents do. In fact there is information to enough for them to know their distributors or agents have done something wrong or illegal, but they did nothing to stop them.<br><br>3. (If evidences can still be found) SE published the sales, promotional material about the phony projects for the agents to use, SE managers, directors e.g. James Phang personally conducted the MLM seminars.<br><br>This blog (? This isn't a blog, is a review webpage) becomes famous because of SE? Yes I agree, what's your point?<br><br><a href="http://www.thelocalking.com/singapore/miscellaneous--others.../sunshine-empire.html" rel="nofollow">Source from LocalKing</a></div>
