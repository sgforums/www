THose children of his were as broke and when they successfully sucked tonnes of money greed drown them.<br><br>History had shown all similar SCAMs will NEVER last forever and when they hit their peak. Things will start to break down. As usual.<br><br>That's why James Phang Wah thought he can diverse the funds he and his children had sucked from public to re-invest into 'projects' so to hope the money will row and able to suck more funds using other platforms.<br><br>They must be rushing for time now as many Investors start to question on their legality and authorities breathing down their neck.<br><br>Very soon the authorities will close them down and soon pressure will come from all countries which SUnshine had stepped on. Investors will scream and demand refunds since Sunshine Empire claimed all investors are allow to do so.<br><br>By then owner of the company Jackie Ho will declare bankrupt and James Phang Wah will be on the run. Maybe most of those children of his in the company who had worshipped him will get involve into the dispute and charge for fraud or even cheating. And if you are in Singapore well be reminded that Cheating Case is a state crime and will be charge as cheating criminal. Jail will be the case result.<br><br>Good luck to all who are about to become bankruptcy, to all who already lost their hard earn money and to all who will be going to jail.    </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>DECEMBER 2007 NEWS<br><br>By 4 December 2007, there will be new price for GP, SP, and BP. There will be no more CLP (Customer Loyalty Programme) for those new GP, SP, and BP. All existing GP, SP, and BP will still follow the old plan. There will also be international account (called EM pin). The difference between EM pin and normal country account is that EM pin has no EmCall, but gives extra 300 epoint for direct sponsor, no need matching left and right. At the moment EM pin can not do any withdrawal, but Sunshine Empire is in the process working with a payment gateway to allow fund withdrawal.<br><br>Because of the CAD investigation in Singapore, for this time being Singapore merchants can not withdraw any e-points through Singapore local bank. All merchants are advised to talk to their uplines if they need urgent withdrawal. It is interesting to note that many merchants decided to do personal sales re-entry (purchasing more GP) during this time. It shows how confident the merchants are in Sunshine Empire.<br><br>This is obtained from some people who are well versed in Singapore legal matters: "CAD can not do investigation and stop the company from doing bank transaction for too long, because it will disturb the company operation and violate the law".<br><br>Starting December 2007, the fund withdrawal fee has been increased from 0.05% to 2%. No official news whether this arrangement going to be permanent or temporary.<br><br>Starting 2 December 2007, e-point transfer from one country to another country account is disabled. Merchant can still transfer to other account that is from the same country (example: SG to SG, MY to MY, ID to ID, etc) or to the international account (EM pin).<br><br>CAD (Commercial Affair Department) has gathered all the information required in their investigation. They have checked all that they have to check. Now they are interviewing some of the Sunshine Empire merchants to get more information. Sunshine Empire informed its merchants to fully cooperate with CAD. No official news about the investigation results and how long more it is going to take. Sunshine Empire has appealed to CAD to expedite the investigation process.<br><br>Sunshine Empire fully refunded some (very very small percentage) of the new merchants, who are affected by the media negative publicity. It is interesting to note that most of the merchants stay calm and running the network marketing business as usual. And despite the recent negative publicity in Singapore, Sunshine Empire latest monthly global turn over hit 100 million USD.

They all look like self glorfication of the project, rather than a proper promo video. Just some nice photos and "powerful" music, lots of lion animations. No mention of layout, finishings, etc. I have to comment that the projects are very poorly designed based on the floorplans I've seen. The Empire State tower's layout reminds me of HDB rental tenament flats. So poorly designed.<br><br>You might also want to take notice that the renders of the melaka theme park changed several times as well.
