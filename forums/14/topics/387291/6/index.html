              <p>Technically, MLM &amp; Network marketing are the same thing. MLM is a type of business structure, while network marketing is the manner in which the type of business is conducted. There is actually more of a difference and distintion in MLM/Network Marketing &amp; Direct Selling/Sales. </p>
              <p>There are two basic markets in the MLM/Network marketing world:</p>
              <p>1 - Warm Market  </p>
              <p>2 - Cold market</p>
              <p>There are three basic ways to enage each of these:</p>
              <p>1 - High Touch</p>
              <p>2 - Low Touch</p>
              <p>3 - Tech Touch</p>
              <p>All three should be eomplyed, however when one runs out of warm market, the most accepted method of attracting new potential business partners is through the internet, as the possibility of reaching more people in that forum far outweighs hanging out in public places trying to meet someone. Obtaining referrals is also a great way to reach out and acquire new prospects. </p>
              <p>There is far more to the process of getting someone into your business and enrolling them into a systematic approach to acheive success in the effort. Like traditional business, there will be many who fail as compared to the few who succeed. In the end, it is a function of how much are you willing to go through to reap the reward of committment ot the goal.  Are you a quitter, or are you one who is willing to do what it takes to succeed?</p>
              <p>The question was coined as how to attract more people once warm market has expired. FB is a great way to niche advertise - they offer ability to implement focused market advertising. Forums and online classifieds are also choice venues. The internet is a vast expanse of opportunity. </p>
              <p>A castle is built upon solid foundations with many materials, tools and support. Use them all in the process, but use them wisely as to what works for you. Not any single method is the modality to provide success for everyone, otherwise there would be only one way. It's a matter of following in the footstpes of succes, while also venturing through new areas to discover principles that bear fruit in the right nurting environment. This business is a journey and not a finality - it is always evolving, as is the way in which the business is conducted.</p>

              <p>Dear Plutoclub317</p>
              <p>Could you kindly <span style="color: #ff6600;">follow the rules</span>, guidelines &amp; allow this thread to serve it's core purpose to <span style="color: #ff6600;">allow users to Post Their Questions</span> first instead of giving answers when it is not needed.<br><br>If you want to post your views, please OPEN A NEW THREAD UNDER YOUR NAME and voice your views there. &gt;&gt; In this thread where I monitor, <span style="color: #ff6600;">I only entertain Facts and Nothing else.</span></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, i'll still need to point out a list of corrections.</p>
              <p>1. <strong>Network Marketing &amp; MLM are 2 completely separate terms</strong>.  &gt;&gt; If you disagree, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unless you are RICHER than Donald Trump or Robert Kiyosaki,</span> than I will salute you and believe your words. Else r<span style="color: #0000ff;">ead their jointly published book on "Why We Want You To Be Rich" </span></p>
              <p>In that book, chapter 17 which is the last chapter if i didn't remember wrongly, they NEVER ONCE mentioned anything about MLM is Network Marketing.</p>
              <p>2. Don't try to act like you know the industry.</p>
              <p>You missed out the <span style="color: #ff6600;">Luke-warm market</span> to begin with. Brush up on the theory first and focus on the basic theory, instead of trying to adopt the Amercian ways of learning the Advanced skills of martial arts but were never able to beat the Shaolin Monks/Bruce Lee in a fair fight (drug-free).</p>
              <p>Focus on the Basics, even the Japanese Drift King (Car tutorial video) says focus on the basics. It's the video on how to modify 86 (comes with English Subtitles) &gt;&gt; Just giving you examples of real-life just so you can FACE THE REALITY/TRUTH.</p>
              <p>3. Cold + Luke-warm + Warm markets are the generalized terms used by ALL Sales Professionals regardless of Insurance, Property, Network Marketing, Investment related products. | Even if you are doing simply PURE Offline Traditional Business, you also need to know the above 3 markets.</p>
              <p>Please at least understand the different industries and how they operate first if not make friends with people from these industries if you like to contribute Top-Quality posts (advices/ educating replies) to share with the public.</p>
              <p>4. Clarification on the engagement touch points..don't try to come up/invent your own terms..</p>
              <p>The industry terms of engagement touch points/methods/strategies used that share the same meaning are as follows:</p>
              <p>4.1: <strong>Social Media</strong> - Where it is through the use of Trust element via friends who knows each other to recommend products and services to each other and their 2nd/3rd tier friends if not common friends.</p>
              <p>4.2: <strong>Traditional Advertising &amp; Marketing/Branding</strong>: It is where repetition of consistent commercials to bring across a message and imprint the want into a need in the minds of clients to make them purchase the products/services.</p>
              <p>4.3: <strong>Digital/Internet Marketing</strong>: Through the use of technology to spread the word via riding on trends, followers, trusts and communities inclusive of targeting specific group of audiences looking for the specific products/services.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Word of Advice To Pluto</span></strong><br><br>I don't mind if you like to help out to share your knowledge, BUT please share only positive ones, I didn't edit/quickly re-post in my 1st thread doesn't mean I will not do it in this 2nd thread.<br><br>If you like to share your thoughts, please ensure you share only quality insights, which I feel from my personal point of view, you are still too much of a MLM addict and not a Netural Distributor, despite me replying to your posts over the last few months if not year(s) already by now.<br><br>If you want your views to be heard and accepted - Start Your Own Thread Please.</p>

              <p>Fallen - You are quick to cut the views of others. You site little of your own authority. It's easy to buy your way in when you have resources (Trump/Kiyosaki). As for terms - they are definitely not the same plain language, but refer to parallel principles of business. I am not going to belabor the issue. Suffice to say my points were not negatuive in the least sense. I praise you for bein the undisputed authority on MLM and network marketing in this forum. You shine with your wisdom. Just FYI . . . luke warm is only a transition phase. I repsonded in general - thank you for taking my contribution of the macro view to the micro application (4.1-3). And, by the way,  the terms high, low and tech touch have been around for quite some time. Where have you been? Nonetheless, I have not violated any rules or guidelines of the SGFORUM.

              <p>If those terms have being around for some time, kindly provide some links/resources so as to share the knowledge with the rest of us who are keen to learn more.</p>
              <p>As long as it's from a trustworthy source.</p>
              <p>While this thread is indeed under public-domain, kindly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">allow the thread to serve it's core purpose. "<strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Ask Your MLM Questions Here</span></strong>".</span></p>
              <p>What it means is that - If there's a question, any helpful, valid replies backed up by Facts if not are based on industry standard practices, please elaborate on those to educate and share the wisdom that you have with everyone of us.</p>
              <p>Without a question, no answer is required, as such no thread reply/post is needed.</p>
              <p>Like in the other thread that I didn't reply back, it's due to it being a benefit to the rest, and it doesn't contain any mis-leading information, thus I let it remain as the last post.</p>
              <p>Correction reply will be made if I feel that the reply is not helping the thread to serve it's main duty of providing netural replies to any questions posted.</p>
              <p>"Hijacking" word is used simply because </p>
              <p>1. Nobody ask any question, yet you post your own post of information that is uncalled for.</p>
              <p>2. History has shown that hijacking of panes happens because the criminals wanted to get something done thus they hijack the plane, not allowing the plane to serve it's purpose as a transportation vehicle.  Instead using the vehicle to hold the passengers captive.</p>
              <p>3. It is the intent that counts here. Your intention of posting (replies of your personal opinion) is not in line with the intent which I created this thread to be. <br><br>&gt;&gt; Majority of the forum users do understand this fact at the very least.</p>
              <p>The intent of this thread, once again is to help the public answer their questions with replies backed up by trustworthy source/reference, if not based on best industry practices that remains netural and helps the answers any questions being asked upon.</p>
              <p>If you like to share information and your valuable experience, do so at least in a new thread, where you can <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">have that intention made known in the Thread Title</span></strong>, so everybody can reply back to your thread.</p>
              <p>This thread is simply used to help new individuals to answer their questions.</p>
              <p>I do value any input as long as it's value and beneficial to the public.</p>
              <p>That said, I do welcome any questions that's related to network marketing industry.</p>
              <p>Moving forward, kindly avoid mentioning any company or their brand to maintain the neutral tonality of this thread.</p>

              <p>Hi Fallen. </p>
              <p>I recently joined a MLM Company not too long ago. I invested 2k (a Large sum from my savings) into this business. At times I get really negative about this business and sometimes really motivated to do it.</p>
              <p>As new Distributors, we were taught to form a team first. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sometimes I dont feel comfortable to prospect my friends to join. I </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">do not have sufficient knowledge in this business and whether it could be done yet I am asking them to join me for a sum of 2k? I just felt that I am just dragging my friends down with me. </span></p>
              <p>Additionally, I really hope to learn and actually be finacially independent. What should i do?</p>

              <p>When you mention "not long ago", I suppose your 5 working days / 7 days refund period has already passed right?</p>
              <p>If yes, than try to learn as much as you can from them (milk them dry to fully make your $2K worth)..get them to teach you anything and everything.</p>
              <p>If you feel negative, congrats, it's your own concious telling you that you're uncomfortable doing this "type" of business/industry = You're not cut out for this network marketing industry. Period.</p>
              <p>As New Distributors, the 1st step is ALWAYS (without fail regardless of what company) to find out and know what products you are first buying in (as a customer/distributor.</p>
              <p>2nd step is to find out how these product or range of products help &amp; benefit you.</p>
              <p>3rd step is to find out other like-minded individuals like you with similar product (not sales/recruiting) experiences who's happy with the products (don't necessarily need to be the identical product). &gt;&gt; They can be your up/down/sidelines as long as you and your team are in the same network (umbrella)</p>
              <p>4th step is to get results as a happy customer first (so you convince yourself mentally, physically and emotionally) that it works for you, than only start sharing* with other people</p>
              <p>Share = briefly touch on the topic with people whom you know, and keep the topic light, let them know you're a user/customer of this product (not a distributor**) so if they/their friends needs more information they can get back to you for more details.</p>
              <p>This step = Fishing/Throw Baits out &gt;&gt; If fish (prospect) bite, you need to gradually learn how to reel them in without allowing them to let go. [On-Job-Training Experience and Knowledge with guidance from your uplines]</p>
              <p>5th step is then to teach them (the new customers - paid individuals) how to correctly consume these products.</p>
              <p>Make sure they are not healthy so the products works with results, else you sell to a healthy individual, they see no results, you get no repeat sales.</p>
              <p>If you are unlucky, the health customer will complain because there's no "results" as a healthy person can't get any more healthier than he/she is already.</p>
              <p>6th step is to follow up with your customers to get them to share their concerns and issues with you as a customer/consumer (not distributor).</p>
              <p>This way you will gradually be equipped with more FAQs for trouble-shooting of technical and product specific questions like a walking company products dictionary.</p>
              <p>Of course help only them who help you or in your own network only for FRIENDLY Competition.</p>
              <p>7th step is to duplicate and repeat step 1 to step 6.</p>
              <p>PS: The above steps are necessary for you <span style="color: #ff6600;">to build a Recurring Income Based on Product Sales</span> which will take at least a few months before you start seeing some money (after you found the suitable products you can see results on yourself)</p>
              <p>I will not teach/share with you the steps on Recruitment (Bulk Sales) yet since you can't pass your own hurdle.</p>
              <p>If your direct upline(s) are not teaching you the correct methods to succeed in the company, you can try to jump ranks and ask your your uplines X 5 levels above for the real training.</p>
              <p>How I learn is I always stick the my highest upline(s) for the really basic of the basic sales training..</p>
              <p>You need to show face and show commitment before they (highest uplines) will allow you to directly contact them if you show potential of becoming the next leader, else you're on your own which leads to how to spot opportunities in network marketing industry..but that's another topic for another day..</p>
              <p>I hope I've answered your question. If still in doubt, feel free to clarify.</p>
              <p>* - Sharing = Share only when the timing and conversation is revolves around similar topics or if you are skillful enough to convert topics into the direction you want it to be.</p>
              <p>Share not Tell. Tell = sharing something that your friends or person whom you're speaking to is not interested..so don' waste your time nor effort in a person whom already mentally "shut" to your pitching.</p>

              <p>What my company do is that they teaches and encourages its new distributors to make as many appointments as they can through all their phone contacts and facebook contacts. This is the part where I feel its wrong. You call everyone in your contact list regardless of whether you think they are suitable for this business?</p>
              <p>My direct upline which is quite new is calling everyone he can and i am hearing really awful comments from our mutual friends that he is doing this MLM Business. He is really creating a bad reputation among people he knows. Yes I must agree that the products are pretty good as i have tried them but is this the right way to do the business? I personally feel that we should find the people whom we think is interested in our products and suitable to this business before prospecting them so that you not piss everyone off by contacting your everyone you have seen or met before. Please help me!  :(</p>

              <p>Hi Fallen, I am back.</p>
              <p>What my company do is that they teaches and encourages its new
              distributors to make as many appointments as they can through all
              their phone contacts and facebook contacts. This is the part where
              I feel its wrong. You call everyone in your contact list regardless
              of whether you think they are suitable for this business?</p>
              <p>My direct upline which is quite new is calling everyone he can
              and i am hearing really awful comments from our mutual friends that
              he is doing this MLM Business. He is really creating a bad
              reputation among people he knows. Yes I must agree that the
              products are pretty good as i have tried them but is this the right
              way to do the business? I personally feel that we should find the
              people whom we think is interested in our products and suitable to
              this business before prospecting them so that you not piss everyone
              off by contacting your everyone you have seen or met before. Please
              help me!  :(</p>

              <p>If you feel it's wrong, don't do it. Period.</p>
              <p>Quote/Reference your immediate upline's negative result as case study.</p>
              <p>However you will be on your own if you still wanna adopt the approach I recommended earlier to build a recurring income from product sales. &gt;&gt; This approach is exactly what Top Fortune 500 Network Marketing Companies globally are doing to generate 5 digit incomes and beyond; including local established companies too.</p>
              <p>As for what your company practise suggest, follow it at your own risk if you are willing to put your reputation at stake.</p>
              <p>In the past, I also followed their practise, and it turn against me BIG Time, left with bad reputation I had to explore other ways to make appointments.</p>
              <p>the reason for such massive Appointment Making is like Insurance Companies, leveraging on New Distributors' network of friends (come down to company based on trust) who are potential prospects to the business at the distributors' expense.</p>
              <p>While company gets free publicity (bad publicity is still better than no publicity), while new distributors stand to gain nothing.</p>
              <p>Moreover, new untrained upline's are using new distributors networks of friends as guinea pigs to improve on their skills. </p>
              <p>However for some companies, upline's with no experience are barred from doing presentations untill they reach a certain quota and will still leverage on new appointments to gain experience either way. &gt;&gt; Just that damage is lesser at this stage.</p>
              <p>Yet the cruel fact is: Majority if not all of the companies use this step as a start, only difference is who the presenters and who will do the closing and convincing that will determine the difference between leaving with a good/bad or netural impression on your prospects.</p>
              <p>Proceed with caution if you value your friends and not have them loose their trust in you.</p>
              <p>Speak to a SENIOR upline who you can reach and have him/her understand your situation than figure out something that suite you yet doesn't cause you to loose/spoil your reputation. &gt;&gt; If you're lucky enough to find such an upline.</p>
              <p>Else weigh your priorities and see if you want to continue learning from them who doesn't have your interest in mind. Or leave the company and explore other options with lots of homework done first before you join again in a similar/identicalindustry.</p>

              <p>As for my company, only those with experience are allowed to do the presentations. Therefore, I think they will leave a bad impression.

              <p> As for my higher uplines I think they are okay, maybe nagging and persistant at times, just that I dont know whether I should trust them. Besides learning from them , i want to understand the business more thats why I seeking for your advices as well. What they always share with me is to share this business in a right way which my direct upline has failed to done so, resulting in a negative outcome. Do you have any tips for me so that I do not make the same mistakes? To so call share the business in a right manner?</p>
              <p>Lastly, one more question. My company also have sharing and grouping sessions weekly whereby sometimes sucessful distributors with certain positions in the company share their experiences and success stories. They are really inspiring and convincing but is every word they say true? Or is it part of this business strategy- to make up success stories- to motivate their distributors? They mention things like having acheiving such high incomes in just short period. Is it really possible in MLM? </p>
              <p>I know that to so this business you need to be really positive but I just want to understand more about the culture and strategies they use instead of following everything blindly. Thanks Fallen. Looking foward to your reply. :)</p>

              <p>I don't understand why you have no 
              confidence uplines/presenters if you claim they have the experience if 
              you said the company only allows experienced individuals to do 
              presentations.</p>
              <p>As for the word trust, when you are doing business,
               you have to learn at some point of time to place your trust in a 
              person, an entity. The issue is that you have to learn how to determine 
              who can earn your trust, that comes with experience, and to accumulate 
              experience, you need to learn from your own or other people's mistakes.</p>
              <p>You will not grow unless you allow mistakes to happen.</p>
              <p>As
               for contacting your cold market of contacts, ask your uplines to teach 
              you how to convert them gradually to luke-warm and to hot market. In the
               company sharing session, those successful leaders will share, but you 
              too must learn to differentiate which methods best suite you due to your
               personality and impression your friends have of you.</p>
              <p>As for tips to you, I can't provide you specific instructions since I don't know what is your's and your company's situation.</p>
              <p>Getting
               higher income in short period of time is possible, but only the top 1% 
              of the thousands can do it, thus changes are slim.</p>
              <p>There's lots of
               factors required to work together to get the 5 digit income, which you 
              come to learn in time (few years down the road - when you climb the 
              corporate ladder in traditional business) to come.</p>
              <p>Positive/Negative, it's all up to you.<br><br>If you stay positive without doing your homework and prepare for the worst, you will fail.</p>
              <p>If
               you remain netural or negative and do your due deligence and research, 
              your chances of success will be slightly higher than the rest who are 
              positive.</p>
              <p>If you want to understand the culture and strategies, 
              you have to participate to understand why things works this way or that 
              way &gt;&gt; That means you have to take some level of risk to gain 
              something in return.</p>
              <p>People fail because they watch things happen and do nothing.</p>
              <p>People succeed because they make things happen.</p>

              <p>If you have no confidence, arrange to use your sidelines/upline's as dummy prospects and talk to them untill you can talk like as if you're drinking water. Have your presenters review and grade your performance when you feel you're ready.</p>
              <p>You juz mention the prohibited word for a newbie who dunno how to counter MLM.</p>
              <p>Check with your company on the standard industry pickup lines for you to follow.</p>
              <p>If your company is serious and knows what they are doing, there should be a guide list if not a booklet for New Distributor Orientiation (NDO) for you to reference. </p>
              <p>If there's no such thing, good luck in taking your own notes.</p>
              <p>Rule #1: If you can't convince yourself why the product ornopportunity is good, you can NEVER convince others.</p>
