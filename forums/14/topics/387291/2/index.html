              <p>well i do know that..but my actual question is: what does that (your thread reply) have to do with this thread?</p>
              <p>moreover, you are neither contributing/replying/asking a question, and it is not related to the thread subject in anyway.</p>
              <p>so why post a unrelated post in this thread to begin with? Increase your posts/thread reply numbers?</p>

              <p>join any mlm company not because of whatever promises the sales agents told you, but rather instead join any company only because you can identify and aline yourself with the company.</p>
              <p>in simpler/layman terms, will the company be able to help/assist you in reaching your goal (with or without) your sales agent's involvement.</p>
              <p>there are many other alternatives besides MLM fyi, just look around first and explore..there are lots of employment which are all hands-on too.</p>

              <p>ok, i wish to stress out that MLM is a perfectly legit business and one that can lead you to financial independence if you have the tools to help you succeed.</p>
              <p>The industry is getting a bad rep is really because of the way the business is being done, not because of the business model. So quit putting generalize statement that <a href="http://heiderhassan.com/category/network-marketing/decoding-the-prospect-mind/">MLM is a scam</a> when clearly it is a misleading statement. With regards to people saying it's a pyramid scheme, c'mon enlighten me please.</p>
              <p>Yes, it is true the top(MD, VP etc) earns the most but that's just about the same as anywhere in the world right? BUT, the beauty of Network Marketing is that it allows you to build your own "pyramid". The question is which part of the pyramid do you want to be at? So instead of having to work 100% of yourself, it's always better to have 1% of you working spreading across 100 people.</p>
              <p>But if I am being perfectly honest, that's not the reason why people are against MLM.That's just pure ignorance and lack of understanding. Instead, it is really because it doesn't allow you to become a legit entrepreneur.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>a) You don't own anything (products, downline, company)</p>
              <p>b) The only way that you are able to stand out from the competition is by standing side by side with your uplines and "duplicating" what he is doing.</p>
              <p>c) <a href="http://heiderhassan.com/category/network-marketing/network-marketing-systems/">No automated tools/systems</a> (that creates REAL leverage; when you teach others the same thing, you literally have a franchise)</p>
              <p>If your only weapon in Network Marketing is your phone and your ability to withstand rejection, you're fighting tanks with sticks. And as the 21st century unfolds, the problem's going to get worse, not better.</p>
              <p>This means you'll be <a href="http://heiderhassan.com/2010/06/19/black-belt-recruiting-review-%E2%80%93-is-it-all-hype-or-the-real-deal/">forced to recruit everyday</a> for the lifespan of your business just to combat the constant attrition that will plague your organization thanks to Google.</p>

              <p>You know what? Let's get off this episode and move on to the main topic. Yes, we both know that going on the discussion will make things worse.</p>
              <p>Moving along, that said, I have a question.</p>
              <p>You seem to be answering alot of people's question with regards to the industry. Given the amount of money spent in educating yourself with real business and marketing knowledge which I respect, are there are advice(s) would you give for those who are striving to make it big?</p>
              <p>Are there any specific niches that you specialize in or any monetization strategies that you are currently implementing? We sure would like to know.</p>

              <p>Based on your reply to date, if you really want advice to make it big, it will still be the same reply, stick with the basics.</p>
              <p>Don't build castles in the air. &gt;&gt;Meaning to say, anybody can buy a Ferrari to drive. But without the skills and experience to drive and control the car, a new inexperienced driver will crash the car in no-time.</p>
              <p>Seond, regarding your technical question about my directions and strategies, it is classified as SECRET.</p>
              <p>Reason being so is simple common sense for business minded people, if i find a goal mine, i will want total control and help people who will help me. I will not spread out the word and let competitors fight over the rights of the gold mine and reduce the amount of benefit which I can in-turn provide to those people who I think deserve to be helped.</p>
              <p>You being new, and not really know the rules asking me questions in my post, I'll just repeat what I said in the past for the benefit of other newbies inclusive of you who may have questions.</p>
              <p>In this forum, I will only address general questions, doubts and queries, anything which I consider to be advanced questions and technical stuffs maybe discussed via PM or in person face-to-face provided the other party knows his/her stuff (knowledge) and exchanged will be made.</p>
              <p>As for my strategies, they are considered to be Classified and Business Secrets which will affect my future income. Having said that, it's Zip for my strategies.</p>
              <p>When the time is ripe, the tree will bear fruits and benefitting most if not all of those involved.</p>

              <p>Topic Not Related to Thread Subject in Anyway.</p>
              <p>Verdict of post : Not Helpful, Posting Nonsense</p>
              <p>Agenda of user's post: Criticsing others without knowing that when a person points a finger at others, 3 others are pointing back at themselves.. (blame others without blamming themselves)</p>
              <p>Nature of user: Naive, gullible, irresponsible (Based on his reply)</p>
              <p>Observation: You are obviously not a ex-mlm agent..based on your reply..it's more of a victim than coming from a agent perspective.</p>
              <p>I think you fall into either of the following categories:</p>
              <p>1) Paid $, but didn't follow through the lessons to learn</p>
              <p>2) Didn't pay but claims you yourself is from this company when you have yet to even join any mlm company</p>
              <p>3) You got your presumed identity from your others (by hearing their complaints/doubts) than coming over online to complain.</p>
              <p>Whatever your case or perspectiveand agenda is: Create a new post if you want to complain, this is the wrong place..either or..you can go to another thread of mine to post your complaints (against your "supposed upline") and i'll reply accordingly.</p>

              <p>If you want to compare LFI against normal work there's 1 &amp;
              only difference: getting a paid job doesn't require anyone to pay
              $10++ to sign the contract. So, why should we pay (LFI) $10++ jus
              to help sell their product?</p>
              <p>I was from LFI before (I think I still am now but inactive) and
              I must say that the products are good. The only thing that disturbs
              me is that my uplines (whoever they are) are earning my sales
              commission, which I think is not fair because whatever I sell
              and they'll get money (while shaking legs). Then they
              state that I (as staters) can too be like them; just need to
              recruit people (mostly naive, gullible friends) and
              expand my network which in turn, me earning money easily.</p>
              <p>Which boils down to 1 question: IS LFI SUPPOSED TO PROMOTE
              BETTER HEALTH OR IS THAT COMPANY A PLACE FOR ORDINARY
              PEOPLE TO EARN COLD, FAST CASH THE EASY, UNETHICAL WAY?
                </p>
              <p>I'm not here to blame LFI because that company believes in
              better health for everyone, which I'm cool with that. IT'S THE
              'EMPLOYEES' (some of them) ARE THE ONES MAKING LFI A PYRAMID-SCHEME
              COMPANY.</p>
              <p>All I want is for those who join MLM to stop recruiting
              naive, easily duped friends. If you (sales associate) believes that
              the product is good, let your friends try them and see the results
              INSTEAD of MISLEADING them to join your network just for your own
              SELFISH dream of being rich.</p>

              <p>Typical example of a rookie trying to teach a newbie..</p>
              <p>The pot calling the kettle black..</p>
              <p>When i adviced you to stick to the basics and learn the basics..there you are here trying to advice a complete newbie who knows nothing..while it is with good intentions..but your actions will lead to more issues in future complicating things..</p>
              <p>for you yourself lack the basic understanding of MLM..</p>
              <p>the only difference between you and that person crust is that you have being given a crash course on MLM without the basics while crust learn nothing yet.</p>
              <p>advice only when you're clear..you don't teach when you still lack the basics. else it will be the blind leading another blind..</p>
              <p>follow-up on the ferrari example..you can buy one if you are super rich, but upon purchase that time, you have yet to get your class 3 license yet, and you want to advice other people who are also still learning/ yet to even attend any lessons for driving..</p>
              <p>when you're trying to help others despite the fact that you are not licensed yet, the advice you give will only complicate things and speed up the progress of those newbies of crashing the car against the war not only endangering himself/herself but also pulling many other innocent people (inclusive of the driving instructor beside the newbie) along to the path of hell..when the actual fact is they should not even be doing practical test without first passing the theory test..</p>
              <p>So focus on learning the theory test first..if you really want to help..the best help from you is not to advise people based on your current understanding of MLM.</p>

              <p>Yup it's legal, the only problem is the MLM companies use people to advertise their products or to expand their business and rarely use traditional modes of advertising (TV, Radio etc) Some do but not as prevalent as the traditional business.

Plus, why waste so much training resources the distributors right?</p>
              <p>But right now Google is clamping down on all the "money making opportunities" advertisements on their Adwords.</p>

              <p>Though it's a good medium to build their brand, most mlm companies don't resort to advertising their business on TV etc. Besides, advertising such money making opportunities on TV will be counter productive as people are skeptical towards these things.</p>
              <p>The idea of an MLM company is they are using people to establish their brand. I'm sure you agree that the best way to build a brand is through a satisfied customer right?</p>
              <p>That said, you do see occasional advertisements on TV, like LFI and it's Just Diamonds, Amway and their cosmetic ads, even Herbalife advertised on our MRT once.</p>
              <p>But you just don't see it as often but when the company is undergoing expansion overseas, then there's a higher chance of it appearing in the media.</p>
              <p>It's all about keeping the cost down. </p>
              <p>Just look at it this way, the company pays the distributors as their "advertisement" in the form of compensation plans. So why spend even more money on ad campaigns?</p>

              <p>Heider..just some corrections..instead of a 50/50 answer why not you ask your uplines more before you attempt to answer this question..gain more information first in future before attempting to reply, don't cause others to fail their university project due to a poor quality reply for lack of proper infomation.</p>
              <p><strong>based on what I know</strong>.. advertising is perfectly legal..who would say no to profits? having said that, MLM is just another business entity which is legal and therefore able to advertise.</p>
              <p>the real reason why companies don't advertise is due to a results delivered by advertisments as compared to results by direct sales agents.</p>
              <p>advertisers are just like the middle-man..the company takes the money, delievers the message across via the whatever platforms available via their means and don't actually care for if the advertisement have any impact on positive or negative ROI.</p>
              <p>why most companies use sales agents instead of advertisements is primary due to the customer service aspect...an advertisement cannot share the benefits of the products (which come mostly in consumerable forms) unlike the sales agents who are active/walking advertisments that can cater the type of advertisments specifically to the needs and wants of a prospective user/client in solving their concerns and doubts first before pushing the product across in closing a deal.</p>
              <p>an advertisement will only spread the news of new products, but look at shopping centers, the reason why customer service consultants/ service support staffs are hired in beauty products sales counters, hospitality venues and services is precisely of the fact that benefits of advertisement is limited and big brands know that fact thus they emphasis a lot of product, customer service training etc.</p>
              <p>a customer sales staff can cater the advertisement (verbal ads via first understanding what individual clients wants) before answering in a manner that will please the individual customers' demands.</p>
              <p>sales staff can provide more benefits than an ad due to delivery of quality service (increasing the positive impression in the brand, as well as the individual sales staff plus ensuring a possible repeat sales)..so using mlm companies using sales agents is in-fact killing multiple birds with one single stone.</p>
              <p>while on the other hand..advertisement is not only costly and does not help in ensuring potential clients/existing clients to remain loyal to the brand nor can it promote any service to meet up to the heavily competitive sales industry to secure a much larger pool of clients.</p>
              <p>personal touch or face to face communication is what builds the relationship with customers and just this point alone is sufficent to answer your question.</p>
              <p>I hope the you (yamamoto) get a clearer picture now with answers to both your questions.</p>

              <p>MLM is NOT a GET RICH QUICK business. Anyone who tells you that does not know about or respect what MLM is.

              stick it out. Success
                                      in MLM (as with any other business) is partly a 
              mental attitude as
                                      well as a result of ACTION over a sustained

              <p>There are a few factors that contribute to 
              one's success in MLM
                                      - in no particluar order, here are some:</p>
              <p>- belief in and use of the product or service
               you offer</p>
              <p>- knowledge of your business and its history 
              &amp; the
                                      compensation plan</p>
              <p>- continued application of a proven system - 
              OR USE OF ONE to
                                      help in one's marketing efforts (see

                                      with ANY MLM business effort)</p>
              <p>- surrounding yourself with people who 
              encourage rather than
                                      discourage your efforts</p>
              <p>- developing a community of people oriented 
              to the same goals
                                      and purpose</p>

              <p>People have to keep in mind that success in 
              any endeavor usually
                                      comes over a sustained period of time and 
              effort. It does not come
                                      in 2 or 3, or even 6 months, but rather over 
              time.</p>
              <p>I have included a great youtube link to Tim

              <p>Hey, new user..</p>
              <p>Did you not read or understand basic english and not follow rules in the first place?</p>
              <p>Of all places, when my first thread posting suggest this is a Question &amp; Answer thread, there you are trying to show-off your "rich" intelligence of the industry when no questions was posted nor any answer was requested..yet you force it onto other people's threads for your own benefit..</p>
              <p>Verdict &gt;&gt; User observed to be extremely poor with customer service nor is he/she able to comprehend the rules/guides of sales and servicing plus without even following the basics rules.</p>
              <p>Recommendation: Don't even trust/try asking this distributor of any knowledge when this user shows little to zero knowledge to begin with.</p>
              <p>This is a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>typical example of a hard-selling tatic</strong></span> where agents force their information against a client who isn't showing any interest in the topic yet forcing the poor person to listen to a load of junk much akin to raping a lady against her wishes by forcing himself on her like a desperado.</p>
              <p>Advice for this user: Stick to the basics first before you even attempt to sell anything. Learn first!!</p>

              <p>Dear the_fallen:</p>
              <p>Do not mistake my response to "YOUR" thread as a hard sale
                  tactic, when I have offered nothing for sale. If you refer to the 
                  resource
                  reference or the link provided, be assured it's only for the benefit of 
                  and as a resource to others,
                  as I have no distributor affiliation with either. One is a discourse on 
                  whether
                  people really FAIL in MLM, while the other is a system tool that I personally use for my MLM business, it is not an 
                  MLM. </p>
              <p>The purpose of a forum is to share one's experience, thoughts and 
                  advice on
                  a topic. To encourage constructive participation is the goal, rather 
                  than to
                  berate or belittle others – I believe there is another forum for ranting
                   and raving. Though I
                  am a “new user” to this venue, do not assume lack of intelligence or 
                  experience
                  – to do so is only to reveal your own ignorance. If you take issue with 
                  one's alleged incompliance with a rule or guideline, a gentler approach
                  might be more welcome and received as encouraging, rather than the 
                  HITLER's
                  posture you assume, which might only serve to discourage some. Yes, I 
                  have only
                  recently discovered this forum, but you have no clue as to who I am and 
                  make
                  some very abrupt, naive assumptions.</p>
              <p>I am clear on your HARD SELL influence on this MLM forum. You need to
                  understand, however, you are not the only authority on the subject. 
                  Before your
                  blood begins to boil, I claim no authority, though I can and will 
                  contribute
                  only to the extent of my experience (whatever that may be). And, you 
                  need not make
                  assumptions as to my intelligence either, as you have no clue and lack 
                  personal
                  knowledge thereof. Further, your “verdict” lacks any credible, nor do 
                  you possess
                  substantiated evidence of my sales/service ability. A wiser approach on
                  your part might be to get to know me before you initiate blind 
                  assessment of me
                  and others, as I have seen is a consistent theme you deploy in some of 
                  the
                  other posts in this forum.</p>
              <p>The very nature of public forums is to promote and provoke 
                  discussion. The MLM
                  arena serves as a catalyst to share knowledge with and teach others to 
                  elevate themselves as leaders, people who accomplish things and succeed.
                  The forum should not be used as a hammer to drive down nails of 
                  discouragement.</p>
              <p>I approach the subject with a servant’s mentality, as there is much to 
                  learn,
                  as well as the occasional opportunity to mentor. So, before you go 
                  around
                  making blind assumptions and conduct public lashing of others, perhaps 
                  you
                  should ask a few questions of your own and enlighten yourself prior to 
                  acting in your capacity as
                  judge, prosecuting attorney, jury and executioner . . . all in one.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I will read though the forum rules once again to ensure I 
                  am compliant
                  in my response and contribution to the forum.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>any explaination = excuses for failing to follow the rules.</p>
              <p>the more replies you give = the more excuses you make = reflects on your  incompetency in the subject proper.. period.</p>
              <p>FYI: watch videos of Donald Trump's The Apprentice if you don't understand the basics of business</p>
