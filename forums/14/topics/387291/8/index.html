              <p>Thanks for the reply fallen.</p>
              <p>Well from what I understand (or think i do) in my few months with them a few years back, it seems like those that really excel in this business will change company eventually. Maybe the good ones from LFI is working for other companys now.</p>

              <p>Do you mean key factors in making a person to be successful?</p>
              <p>If that's what you're referring to. It can be summarized in a few simple points (long story short)</p>
              <p>1. Follow the right person (company/system don't fail, it's the person who leads and create the system that fails)</p>
              <p>2. Don't join MLM because of Money (which can be made in every other trades, join it because you like to succeed in a group and hang around successive mentors, leaders and even entrepreneurs).</p>
              <p>3. Flexibility in Business (if the business is not flexible enough to cater to the mass, don't waste your time, as it's not going to work). E.g: when was the last compensation plan changed, did it change for good or for the worse?</p>
              <p>4. Find a person who's willing to share and advise you before you sign/pay for anything. Do Not Make Any RASH DECISION to join on the spot if you are unsure if it is suitable for you.</p>
              <p>The sales person must be able to share "What's In It For You" and not What's In The Company That Can Benefit People like you.</p>
              <p>There's a difference.<br>If you like to learn/chat more, we can discuss privately to help you make an informed and wise decision.<br><br>If anybody would like to get FREE Consultation, kindly PM privately. Than we can arrange to meet in person. No Strings Attached. I'm just helping those people who are seriously looking for Neutral Advice.</p>

              <p>The poll will not benefit anybody to start with and will have no-conclusive results.</p>
              <p>Reason being: People join a business/company for many different reasons and your questions are too generic.</p>
              <p>There's no specific group that you like to ask?</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p>1. First timers who knows nothing about network marketing/mlm.</p>
              <p>2. Joining network marketing companies for the second if not third time and more already</p>
              <p>3. Joining a friend as a customer or as a distributor etc..</p>

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I wish
              to join an MLM; however, I am not sure what is the rules and

              sceptical. </span></p>
              <p>If the company I wish to join is a member of DSA - Direct
              Selling Association, USA b<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); line-height: 1.231;">ut
              they are not a member of DSA Singapore / dsas. Can I still join and
              grow network here in Singapore ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">So when
              come to rules &amp; regulation, I want to make sure whether joining
              this company would be considered as illegal or will I be fine as a
              result of joining this network marketing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Another
              question is, would you be able to advise how to tell if this is a
              legitimate company and not money game ? </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I really
              appreciate your advise as I'm new to this. Btw. I also have PMed

              <p>I've replied, if you need more clarification, it's much easier to meet up and discuss. Personally I prefer that option as we both can learn from each other instead of being a keyboard warrior and learn little, bites and pieces here and in chunks instead of a full understanding of the whole picture.</p>

              <p>Thanks for respecting the rules I laid out. In consideration of that and to show appreciation/graditute, I've provide you with a advance level reply as compared to usual entry level response.</p>
              <p>Here it goes: In any business (regardless of MLM/ Tradditional), if it's FREE, there's sure some downside to off-set for the free entry as with all business, the common goal is to generate Business Revenue.<br><br>That said, for a FREE opportunity, it doesn't hurt to listen and find out more information, BUT don't think that I will join as the objective is to listen to find out what are the trade-offs in such a FREE Offer that you're proposing.</p>
              <p>The point on 40 years, it got me thinking, Brand is established, trust, creditability is there BUT down-side is little/no opportunity to survive in growing your network/business in the countries that's already have a presence being a New Comer/Player in the country.<br><br>The key is "Expand Locally" which we all know Singapore is a SMALL MARKET, so it's EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to surive on Singapore contacts without relying on overseas expansion which is what season industry players are looking at as one of the many points in the checklist to cross-check against.<br><br>This are the 3 pointers max that I am willing to share at a Free Online Sharing at the moment. If anybody like to learn more, just PM or meet in person so we can both learn from one another.</p>
