              <p>Thanks for your reply, the_fallen. The true issue is not any failure to read on my part but rather your desire to muscle up on the slightest misinterpretation or side bar that may be offered from the gallery.</p>
              <p>I applaud your intention to help solve problems. Some are more qualified than others, yet I believe most people sincerely want to be of help. There is no need to strike them down – they could be the person who offers you a hand while you find yourself slowly drowning. My advice to you . . .  generate a more pleasing approach to your “authority” on the subject and people will respect you more as a person, and not one who talks down to them. No doubt I observe you possess a measure of knowledge, though your people skills need a little honing.</p>
              <p>As for “YOUR” thread, yes . . . you make the rules in your own kingdom, but you are now in public domain. No one said I did not like it either (read my post) . . . this is again a false assumption on your part.</p>
              <p>And, to the contrary, my original post has no confusing issues in it. If there are, feel free to controvert or rebut my discourse. Everyone has and is entitled to an opinion – at least where oppression does not reside. I simply have and am entitled to my own in this public domain.</p>
              <p>I am the first to admit I am not perfect and I do make mistakes. Let me formally apologize to you for having not perfectly conformed to the thread’s primary intention. Again, I said I would read through once more to ensure I do not violate the TOU of SGforum. You might do the same – pay special attention to the area that says: Posting any material which is knowingly false and/or defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person's privacy, or otherwise violative of any law.</p>
              <p>Finally, let’s get over the “off topic” banter and get on with productive and beneficial contributions. You might find I can indeed offer constructive input. I would rather cultivate a respectful friendship than to continue on the erratic path being carved.</p>
              <p>PEACE – P. Pluto</p>
              <p>PS - And remember . . .in your own words . . . . “the more replies YOU give = the more excuses you make = reflects on your  incompetency in the subject proper.. period”.</p>

              <p>well, it seems that you may be good on public relation skills but not good in terms of direct sales and anything related in this industry as you have yet to show that you understand the market at the moment based on your context of your reply.</p>
              <p>but i've seen quite a lot of users who are fakers in attempt to put on a mask as the real deal trying to spam/mislead complete innocent clueless users in here..thus my approach is to protect them at all cause..fyi..i don't mind being the bad guy having nasty impressions on people..</p>
              <p>at the end of the day..i've done the best of my limits within my abilities to help protect anybody against inferior advice in direct sales industry with ill-intentions.</p>
              <p>good guys are often being trampled upon and bullied..that's why the rich always hires lawyers to get back at their traitors/competitors for information stealers, run-a-way with money employees etc..</p>
              <p>while you display a good command of english which is a plus..but it doesn't mean that you can sell well..gain some real work experience in the sales industry and you'll understand what i'm talking about..</p>
              <p>especially when you seen a low educated salesman out-win and out-smart, outsell a uni graduated saleman..</p>
              <p>i don't deny that fact that i personally really lack in people skills, but i am what i am..right..i do admit it and just move on with it..why try to be mr perfect when i know what i'm doing.. in fact, you're not the 1st person who said that anyway..</p>
              <p>just another advice for you.."you cannot please every single soul and customer out there" thus you just need to admit your own weakness and move on..</p>
              <p>while it sounds simple, but its difficult for students who have yet to step fully into the adult working society to comprehend that without actual experiencing it for themselves..</p>

              <p>AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPLY. . . . . LET'S BREAK IT DOWN PARAPGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH:</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - well, it seems that you may be good on public relation skills
                                          but not good in terms of direct sales and anything related in this
                                          industry as you have yet to show that you understand the market at
                                          the moment based on your context of your reply.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - AGAIN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF MY DEIRECT SALES CAPABILITY AS 
                  YOU AND I HAVE NOT EVEN DISCUSSED IT, NOR COURSED MY HISTORY IN THIS 
                  INDUSTRY. INTERESTING YOUR COMMENTS COME FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEONE
                   WHO HAS NEVER GIVEN A HISTORY OR SUCCESS OF YOUR OWN IN THIS 
                  INDUSTRY.  IT SEEMS THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF YOUR COMMENTS COME FROM A
                   PERSPECTIVE OF AND DESIRE TO CRITICIZE COMPANIES AND PRACTICES, OR A 
                  DESIRE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT A COMPANY. WHERE DOES YOUR EXPERTISE COME 
                  FROM, the_fallen? YOU GIVE NO BASIS FOR YOUR EXPERTISE AT ALL.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - but i've seen quite a lot of users who are fakers in attempt to
                                          put on a mask as the real deal trying to spam/mislead complete
                                          innocent clueless users in here..thus my approach is to protect
                                          them at all cause..fyi..i don't mind being the bad guy having nasty
                                          impressions on people..</p>
              <p>I INVITE YOU TO ASK MORE POINTED QUESTIONS THAT WILL REVEAL NOT ONLY 
                  MY COMPETENCE, BUT PERHAPS ALSO YOUR OWN. AGAIN, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY 
                  POST IN WHICH YOU GIVE BASIS FOR YOUR EXPERTISE. IF YOU HAVE ANY, YOU 
                  SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO OPENLY PROVIDE IT.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - at the end of the day..i've done the best of my limits within my
                                          abilities to help protect anybody against inferior advice in direct
                                          sales industry with ill-intentions.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - THE REAILITY OF IT IS THAT ONE REPSONE TO A QUESTION DOES 
                  NOT EVEN BEGIN TO PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR EXPERTISE IN A GIVEN SUBJECT 
                  MATTER. YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT ALL WHO ANSWER IN
                   "YOUR" FORUM. THE OTHER REALITY IS THAT YOU WILL FIND IN DUE TIME THAT 
                  THERE ARE MANY WHO HAVE AUTHORITY AND "MUCH MORE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU" TO 
                  REPSOND TO QUESTIONS IN THIS FORUM. IF YOU RELFECT ON MY ORIGINAL 
                  RESPONSE TO THIS FORUM THERE IS NO ILL-ADVICE. I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU TO 
                  REFUTE (POINT BY POINT, RATHER THAN A GENERAL DENIAL) ANY OF THE ISSUES 
                  THAT I PRESENTED AS BEING CONTRARY TO GOOD ADVICE (IN YOUR OPINION).</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - good guys are often being trampled upon and bullied..that's why
                                          the rich always hires lawyers to get back at their
                                          traitors/competitors for information stealers, run-a-way with money
                                          employees etc..</p>
              <p>I REPLY - I AGREE THAT GOOD PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET TAKEN, BUT WHO 
                  IMPLIES ANYTHING ABOUT LAWYERS OR PEOPLE WANTING TO RUN AWAY WITH INFO AND/OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS? IT IS YOUR BLIND ASSUMPTION.  I CERTAINLY 
                  HAVE NEITHER DIVULGED, NOR IMPLICATED ANY OF THE ABOVE.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - while you display a good command of english which is a plus..but
                                          it doesn't mean that you can sell well..gain some real work
                                          experience in the sales industry and you'll understand what i'm
                                          talking about..</p>
              <p>I REPLY - AGAIN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO I AM, NOR THE EXTENT OR DEPTH 
                  OR MY EXPERIENCE. YOU MAKE BLIND ASSUMPTIONS AND BASE YOUR ANSWERS ON 
                  SPECULATION. GET SOME REAL FACTS, SIR!!!! GET TO  KNOW ME BEFORE YOU 
                  BEGIN TO MAKE SPECULATIVE ALLEGATIONS!!!!!</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - especially when you seen a low educated salesman out-win and
                                          out-smart, outsell a uni graduated saleman.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - YES, I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE NOT EVEN GRADUATED FROM BASIC
                   SCHOOLING WHO ARE MILLIONAIRES IN BUSINESS. BTW, I HAVE ALSO 
                  EXPERIENCED THE MILLIONAIRE INCOME. I ALSO HAVE POST GRADUATE DEGREES 
                  AND HAVE EXPERIENCED SUCCESS IN BUSINESS. THIS SUCCESS STILL DOES NOT 
                  GUARANTEE SUCCESS IN LIFE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT ENTAILS? THERE IS A 
                  LOT MORE TO IT THAN SCHOOLING. POSITIVE APPLICATION OF LIFE AND BUSINESS
                   EXPERIENCES ALLOW ONE TO GET AHEAD IN LIFE AND BUSINESS. BEING ABLE TO POSITIVELY AFFECT THE LIVES OF OTHERS IS A MEASURE OF SUCCESS.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - i don't deny that fact that i personally really lack in people
                                          skills, but i am what i am..right..i do admit it and just move on
                                          with it..why try to be mr perfect when i know what i'm doing.. in
                                          fact, you're not the 1st person who said that anyway..</p>
              <p>I REPLY - I HAVE ALREADY RESPONDED IN MY PREVIOUS POST THE MIRROR 
                  IMAGE OF THIS REPSPONSE. AND I APPLAUD YOUR ADMISSION OF YOUR 
                  IMPERFECTION. I HAVE PREVIOUSLY DONE THE SAME.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - just another advice for you.."you cannot please every single
                                          soul and customer out there" thus you just need to admit your own
                                          weakness and move on.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - WELL SAID . . .I AGREE FULLY!!!! YOU SHOULD ALSO OBSERVE YOUR OWN ADVICE.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - while it sounds simple, but its difficult for students who have
                                          yet to step fully into the adult working society to comprehend that
                                          without actual experiencing it for themselves.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - AGAIN, I AGREE . . . . PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET TO 
                  KNOW ME BETTER BEFORE YOU MAKE BLIND ASSUMPTIONS. I HAVE MORE THAN 30 
                  YEARS EXPERIENCE IN SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AND HAVE MADE SOME VERY 
                  RESPECTABLE MONEY IN THIS INDUSTRY . . . .EVEN AS A SIDE BUSINESS. I 
                  CURRENLTY HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN MY ORGANIZATION FROM WHOM I GET 
                  PAID A MONTHLY RESIDUAL INCOME AND I THINK I AM WELL-QUALIFIED TO OFFER 
                  ADVICE (AT LEAST ON THE SURFACE) IN MLM. </p>
              <p>CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN YOUR MLM ORGANIZATION? DO
                   YOU EVEN HAVE ONE? IN THE END, IT IS NOT IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE MANY 
                  PEOPLE IN A MLM UNDERNEATH YOU. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
                   BUSINESS AND WANT TO ALWAYS LEARN MORE. ADMIT YOUR IGNORANCE, AS DO I, 
                  AND YOU WILL ALWAYS BE IN A POSITION TO GROW!!!!!! YOU MUST ALLOW 
                  YOURSELF TO GROW AND LEARN.</p>
              <p>BASED ON SOME OF YOUR RESPONSES IN OTHER THREADS, I SEE THAT YOU 
                  RESPECT PEOPLE LIKE TIM SALES. DID YOU KNOW THAT TIM SALES FAILED IN 
                  MLM, BUT IS ONE OF THE TOP MENTORS AND TRAINERS IN THE INDUSTRY???? DID 
                  YOU KNOW THAT TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN IN MLM BUT IS A PROPONENT OF THE 
                  INDUSTRY? HE, PERSONALLY, HAS NEVER BUILT A SUBSTANTIAL ORGANIZATION. MY 
                  POINT IS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MLM TO OFFER SOUND 
                  ADVICE IN BUSINESS. EVERYONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED MISTAKES HAS SOMETHING 
                  TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF OTHERS.</p>
              <p>MY ADVICE TO YOU . . . . SETTLE DOWN A LITTLE AND BE WILLING TO 
                  ACCEPT AND RESPECT THE POSITION OF OTHERS. THERE ARE MANY VIEWS AND MANY
                   WHO HAVE MUCH TO TEACH. YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT, BUT 
                  ALAWYS BE OPEN TO THE INPUT OF OTHERS. EVERY ONE HAS AN OPINION, JUST 
                  LIKE YOU!!!! IF YOU DISAGREE WITH WHAT ONE SAYS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 
                  THE VOICE OF RETIRTIBUTION. IF YOU DO TAKE ISSUE, THEN BE BE RESPECTFUL 
                  AND BE SPECIFIC IN YOUR REPSONSE.</p>
              <p>I WILL OFFER THAT YOU HAVE NOT MADE ONE SPECIFIC REBUTTAL AS TO ANY 
                  ISSUE I RAISED IN MY INITIAL POST. YOU'VE MADE ONLY GENERALIZED 
                  REBUATTAL WITHOUT ONE SPECIFIC REPSONSE. AT LEAST HAVE THE RESPECT TO 
                  RESPOND IN POINTED FASHION. </p>

              <p>AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPLY. . . . . LET'S BREAK IT DOWN
                  PARAPGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH:</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - well, it seems that you may be good on public relation
                  skills but not good in terms of direct sales and anything related
                  in this industry as you have yet to show that you understand the
                  market at the moment based on your context of your reply.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - AGAIN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF MY DEIRECT SALES CAPABILITY
                  AS YOU AND I HAVE NOT EVEN DISCUSSED IT, NOR COURSED MY HISTORY IN
                  THIS INDUSTRY. INTERESTING YOUR COMMENTS COME FROM THE PERSPECTIVE
                  OF SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER GIVEN A HISTORY OR SUCCESS OF YOUR OWN IN
                  THIS INDUSTRY.  IT SEEMS THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF YOUR
                  COMMENTS COME FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF AND DESIRE TO CRITICIZE
                  COMPANIES AND PRACTICES, OR A DESIRE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT A COMPANY.
                  WHERE DOES YOUR EXPERTISE COME FROM, the_fallen? YOU GIVE NO BASIS
                  FOR YOUR EXPERTISE AT ALL.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - but i've seen quite a lot of users who are fakers in
                  attempt to put on a mask as the real deal trying to spam/mislead
                  complete innocent clueless users in here..thus my approach is to
                  protect them at all cause..fyi..i don't mind being the bad guy
                  having nasty impressions on people..</p>
              <p>I INVITE YOU TO ASK MORE POINTED QUESTIONS THAT WILL REVEAL NOT
                  ONLY MY COMPETENCE, BUT PERHAPS ALSO YOUR OWN. AGAIN, I HAVE NEVER
                  SEEN ANY POST IN WHICH YOU GIVE BASIS FOR YOUR EXPERTISE. IF YOU
                  HAVE ANY, YOU SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO OPENLY PROVIDE IT.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - at the end of the day..i've done the best of my limits
                  within my abilities to help protect anybody against inferior advice
                  in direct sales industry with ill-intentions.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - THE REAILITY OF IT IS THAT ONE REPSONE TO A QUESTION
                  DOES NOT EVEN BEGIN TO PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR EXPERTISE IN A
                  GIVEN SUBJECT MATTER. YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT ATTEMPT TO
                  DISCREDIT ALL WHO ANSWER IN "YOUR" FORUM. THE OTHER REALITY IS THAT
                  YOU WILL FIND IN DUE TIME THAT THERE ARE MANY WHO HAVE AUTHORITY
                  AND "MUCH MORE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU" TO REPSOND TO QUESTIONS IN THIS
                  FORUM. IF YOU RELFECT ON MY ORIGINAL RESPONSE TO THIS FORUM THERE
                  IS NO ILL-ADVICE. I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU TO REFUTE (POINT BY POINT,
                  RATHER THAN A GENERAL DENIAL) ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT I PRESENTED AS
                  BEING CONTRARY TO GOOD ADVICE (IN YOUR OPINION).</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - good guys are often being trampled upon and
                  bullied..that's why the rich always hires lawyers to get back at
                  their traitors/competitors for information stealers, run-a-way with
                  money employees etc..</p>
              <p>I REPLY - I AGREE THAT GOOD PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET TAKEN, BUT WHO
                  IMPLIES ANYTHING ABOUT LAWYERS OR PEOPLE WANTING TO RUN AWAY WITH
                  INFO AND/OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS? IT IS YOUR BLIND
                  ASSUMPTION.  I CERTAINLY HAVE NEITHER DIVULGED, NOR IMPLICATED
                  ANY OF THE ABOVE.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - while you display a good command of english which is a
                  plus..but it doesn't mean that you can sell well..gain some real
                  work experience in the sales industry and you'll understand what
                  i'm talking about..</p>
              <p>I REPLY - AGAIN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO I AM, NOR THE EXTENT OR
                  DEPTH OR MY EXPERIENCE. YOU MAKE BLIND ASSUMPTIONS AND BASE YOUR
                  ANSWERS ON SPECULATION. GET SOME REAL FACTS, SIR!!!! GET TO 
                  KNOW ME BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO MAKE SPECULATIVE ALLEGATIONS!!!!!</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - especially when you seen a low educated salesman
                  out-win and out-smart, outsell a uni graduated saleman.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - YES, I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE NOT EVEN GRADUATED FROM
                  BASIC SCHOOLING WHO ARE MILLIONAIRES IN BUSINESS. BTW, I HAVE ALSO
                  EXPERIENCED THE MILLIONAIRE INCOME. I ALSO HAVE POST GRADUATE
                  DEGREES AND HAVE EXPERIENCED SUCCESS IN BUSINESS. THIS SUCCESS
                  STILL DOES NOT GUARANTEE SUCCESS IN LIFE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT
                  ENTAILS? THERE IS A LOT MORE TO IT THAN SCHOOLING. POSITIVE
                  APPLICATION OF LIFE AND BUSINESS EXPERIENCES ALLOW ONE TO GET AHEAD
                  IN LIFE AND BUSINESS. BEING ABLE TO POSITIVELY AFFECT THE LIVES OF
                  OTHERS IS A MEASURE OF SUCCESS.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - i don't deny that fact that i personally really lack
                  in people skills, but i am what i am..right..i do admit it and just
                  move on with it..why try to be mr perfect when i know what i'm
                  doing.. in fact, you're not the 1st person who said that
                  anyway..</p>
              <p>I REPLY - I HAVE ALREADY RESPONDED IN MY PREVIOUS POST THE
                  MIRROR IMAGE OF THIS REPSPONSE. AND I APPLAUD YOUR ADMISSION OF
                  YOUR IMPERFECTION. I HAVE PREVIOUSLY DONE THE SAME.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - just another advice for you.."you cannot please every
                  single soul and customer out there" thus you just need to admit
                  your own weakness and move on.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - WELL SAID . . .I AGREE FULLY!!!! YOU SHOULD ALSO
                  OBSERVE YOUR OWN ADVICE.</p>
              <p>YOU SAY - while it sounds simple, but its difficult for students
                  who have yet to step fully into the adult working society to
                  comprehend that without actual experiencing it for themselves.</p>
              <p>I REPLY - AGAIN, I AGREE . . . . PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET
                  TO KNOW ME BETTER BEFORE YOU MAKE BLIND ASSUMPTIONS. I HAVE MORE
                  THAN 30 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS AND HAVE MADE SOME
                  VERY RESPECTABLE MONEY IN THIS INDUSTRY . . . .EVEN AS A SIDE
                  BUSINESS. I CURRENLTY HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN MY ORGANIZATION
                  FROM WHOM I GET PAID A MONTHLY RESIDUAL INCOME AND I THINK I AM
                  WELL-QUALIFIED TO OFFER ADVICE (AT LEAST ON THE SURFACE) IN
                  MLM. </p>
              <p>CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN YOUR MLM
                  ORGANIZATION? DO YOU EVEN HAVE ONE? IN THE END, IT IS NOT IMPORTANT
                  IF YOU HAVE MANY PEOPLE IN A MLM UNDERNEATH YOU. WHAT IS IMPORTANT
                  IS THAT YOU UNDERSTAND BUSINESS AND WANT TO ALWAYS LEARN MORE.
                  ADMIT YOUR IGNORANCE, AS DO I, AND YOU WILL ALWAYS BE IN A POSITION
                  TO GROW!!!!!! YOU MUST ALLOW YOURSELF TO GROW AND LEARN.</p>
              <p>BASED ON SOME OF YOUR RESPONSES IN OTHER THREADS, I SEE THAT YOU
                  RESPECT PEOPLE LIKE TIM SALES. DID YOU KNOW THAT TIM SALES FAILED
                  IN MLM, BUT IS ONE OF THE TOP MENTORS AND TRAINERS IN THE
                  INDUSTRY???? DID YOU KNOW THAT TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN IN MLM BUT IS A
                  PROPONENT OF THE INDUSTRY? HE, PERSONALLY, HAS NEVER BUILT A
                  SUBSTANTIAL ORGANIZATION. MY POINT IS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE
                  SUCCESSFUL IN MLM TO OFFER SOUND ADVICE IN BUSINESS. EVERYONE WHO
                  HAS EXPERIENCED MISTAKES HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS
                  OF OTHERS.</p>
              <p>MY ADVICE TO YOU . . . . SETTLE DOWN A LITTLE AND BE WILLING TO
                  ACCEPT AND RESPECT THE POSITION OF OTHERS. THERE ARE MANY VIEWS AND
                  MANY WHO HAVE MUCH TO TEACH. YOU CAN TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT,
                  BUT ALAWYS BE OPEN TO THE INPUT OF OTHERS. EVERY ONE HAS AN
                  OPINION, JUST LIKE YOU!!!! IF YOU DISAGREE WITH WHAT ONE SAYS, YOU
                  DON'T HAVE TO BE THE VOICE OF RETIRTIBUTION. IF YOU DO TAKE ISSUE,
                  THEN BE BE RESPECTFUL AND BE SPECIFIC IN YOUR REPSONSE.</p>
              <p>I WILL OFFER THAT YOU HAVE NOT MADE ONE SPECIFIC REBUTTAL AS TO

              <p>well, you can be and maybe previously a millionaire status..but ask yourself one thing..if you are really successful yourself..why would you want to lower yourself to this forum in particular direct sales?</p>

              <p>Hey the fallen, I would just like to ask what are your opinions on online MLM vs offline MLM?  online MLM are things like GDI, trafficwave(you can google them if you want to find out more) while offline MLM are companies like Amway, LFI , VE, Herballife and the rest.</p>
              <p>If one wants to venture into the MLM industry, wouldn't starting an online MLM be easier rather than an offline one?</p>
              <p>I say this because I am in an offline MLM company for close to 1 year already, but only started becoming inactive few weeks to a month ago, because I did not like the way they were doing things. Because they went mainly by 'recruiting' rather than sales, and whenever I invited my prospects down my uplines would do the presentation and they would always push a start-up package at the end which costs a bomb!! And I always feel bad at the end because I know that there is a way to start the business with 0 or very little cost, but I can't do anything about it because everyone else does almost the same thing over there. They claim that it's sort of like 'opening franchise', since if you want to start a proper traditional buisness you would also have to put down a sum of money in the form of maybe rental or stock.</p>
              <p>But well, obviously to me, MLM may have some similarities to buisness, but eventually they're still 2 different things altogether, so I could not accept that reasoning. And I become inactive because I couldn't accept their way of thinking, though I still try to do some sales on my own (From my own start up package)</p>
              <p>I ask the cons and bias against offline and online MLM, because I haven't totally given up on MLM yet. I just feel the core of MLM is still proper, except that people inside MLM shares the 'opportunity' much more than they share about the products, which I feel is wrong.</p>
              <p>I do hope that my way of thinking is wrong and maybe I just have a close mind, Could you enlighten me ?</p>

              <p>if you really want to learn the real deal, focus on purely product sales for a start regardless of whatever company you are in.</p>
              <p>Do it your own way, you need not necessary follow your uplines/advisor's guidelines if you and them holds different perspective and views..</p>
              <p>Having said that, by not tapping on your upline/mentor's help, you are taking up the role of multiple roles in before, during and after sales closing/presentation process, which increases your chance of learning real business basics.</p>
              <p>If you want the short-cut way of doing MLM online, i would advise you against that idea..as you have yet to learn the basics of business whereby it is based on sales of products, failure to close sales on your own offline means that you cannot duplicate the same process online given the fact that you may not have master the basics of sales yet.</p>
              <p>On top of which, online marketing is on a different ball-game fyi..it requires some crucial adjustments which only season/experience industry players knows. </p>
              <p>The best situation which you should do right now, is to focus on purely product sales and get statisfied customers coming back to you automatically without you calling them.</p>
              <p>Instead of agent follow-up on clients, you have have the client bugging/follow-up on you for more product(s) re-purchase/updates to be considered master the basics of sales.</p>
              <p>Once you are successful in doing this, than only can you move on to the next stage.</p>
              <p>I hope I have answered your questions.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Fallen - You have a very dizzying intellect, to say the least. You should really try to first understand the psychology and principles of people before you begin to make blind assumptions, which you are quick to offer. That is my "GET' with you more than anything else. Your BLIND assumptions without first deriving basis for your "harsh" criticism, much less your attempts at education of others.  I do not believe there is one point in my original post that any "guru" in MLM would take issue with or refute. That is where I take issue with you! What if I told you that buried in very credible writings this is exactly what even Trump has recited? You seem to be a disciple, so where does your logic find reason to controvert it with blanket statements that do not even address my post in point by point rebuttal? It seems to me that unless it comes from you there is no basis for the reasoning in anyone's responsive post and therefore no credibility. Give me a break!!!! There are numerous mentors in this industry who echo my sentiments. Go do YOUR homework, then we can talk. True, this is "your" thread, but I am still waiting for some indication that you have any authority whatsoever in your advice. You have never offered any. Anyone can talk a good talk, but where is the proof of your walk? Please do tell of the incredible successes you have had in this industry. Anyone can be a good study and recite principles, but there is a BIG difference between practical application or experience and theory based on observation. You are quick to assume and assert lack of business etiquette on the part of others, but then you have NO CLUE. It is EASY to accuse and persecute in a forum that lacks substantiation. And, by the way . . .anyone who has had any measure of success will tell you of their failures along the way . . . . remember Trump? Failing forward allows one to GROW and keeps it real in pursuit of success. Stop cutting people to the quick and you will find more amenability in the forum - i have read other peple's repsonses to your sharp rhetoric - it is not becoming, nor is it favorable to you. I have asked before for "freindly" discourse, but you continue to persecute. Not a very good way to make friends or enlighten in positive ways . . .but somehow your last post makes clear that is not what you are here for. Let's not banter or jockey for position . . .that is not what I am after here. I trust it is not your position either (or is it?), as this is not an issue of being a "top dog". True colors always come out in the wash.</p></div>

                          <p>Kakaboo:<br><br>First, MLM is a globally recognized form of business. So do not doubt that validity. Second, online and offline marketing in the MLM arena are two different beasts entirely. Although one may compliment (and often does) the other, they take on and require different approaches and strategies.<br><br>Offline MLM is more in the realm of “personable” approach, whereas online MLM is a strategy traditionally employed to the blind cyber-masses through use of online system tools.  They both have their pros and cons and can often be (and are) employed in conjunction with one another. The most successful of MLM strategies promotes and teaches implementation of both.<br><br>The MLM business is dual facet: 1 – it takes the bona fide offer of a product or service; AND 2- it’s promotes recruiting others into a business model whereby efforts are designed to duplicate for success – this is the very nature of “multi-level”. Traditional success in MLM does not come without the other. While the_fallen may offer sound advice, be aware that the whole premise and concept of MLM in the first place is to promote an environment in which the concerted efforts of many support the sustenance of many through promotion and sale of products and services in demand. If it was solely an issue of retailing product, you might as well open a retail establishment and make a go of it on your own as a retailer or be in direct sales.  It would seem that is a much more certain approach, don’t you think?<br><br>Certainly, in MLM you are in business for YOURSELF, but not BY YOURSELF. It is a tenant that products must be sold or no one gets paid, but the “real” wealth in MLM comes from creating an organization that duplicates successful efforts in retailing products/services, AND recruiting others into the business. J Paul Getty once said that in order to accumulate wealth one must employ the efforts of many as opposed to the one – in other words, “it is better to have the efforts of 100 people rather than to expend 100% of your own.” That is how MLM works – it is called leveraging.<br><br>While venturing off on your own without mentorship is seldom recommended, it is sometimes an option when you are dissatisfied with the tack your upline is taking. Truly, however, if it is not working, you have to assess why that is the case. But then, is it working for them? If not, then you may be keen to go off on your own. If it is working, then are you really paying attention and employing methods you are being taught? Some people are stronger at retailing, while others are better at recruiting and sharing the opportunity – some are competent at both . . . .it’s just the nature of the business.  However, both facets must be present (and pursued) for achieving true success in MLM, as it is designed.  No wealth in this business ever comes from pursuing only one facet of the equation . . . and it does require YOUR effort.  Acquire the right attitude, learn the right skills and develop the habits required of successful business application and you will succeed if only you do not give up. READ THAT LAST SENTENCE AGAIN. Ultimately, these are leadership skills. Master these and you will be well on your way to doing well in MLM. There are numerous resources available to you.<br><br>Ultimately, online sales are totally different than offline/personal sales. Online sales typically come from a planned internet marketing presence that employs a systematic approach, while offline sales come from your own personal sales ability - you are the mouth piece – but again, there are skill sets required in both disciplines. Online and offline sales are very distinct of each other, but can also be very productive and financially powerful when pursued in tandem.  In either case, the point of MLM retailing is to streamline the cost of marketing and sales in a person to consumer fashion rather than traditional establishment to consumer channels. This allows certain benefits to you as the distributor, as well as the business. Both have the same goal – sales of product – but with the caveat that the multi-level establishment is really the distributors &amp; agents, rather than a storefront.<br><br>Every MLM business is unique and has its own philosophy in sales and recruiting – it’s traditionally called a "business culture". Finding a company with which you can indentify and work within (and believe in) is your primary goal. When you can find your “home” and learn to live within it (and when you have acquired skill sets) you will be more comfortable in what you offer to your customer/clients (whether it be products or an opportunity) and you will tend to be more successful in your efforts – whether online or offline. With a measure of comfortability comes a level of confidence that begins to feed upon the process in cyclical fashion. This allows you to breed success along the way.  Caveat – don’t be afraid to fail . . .it’s part of the learning process. Trump once said if he had to start all over again he would do it with MLM because of the nature of the business in that you can enlist the efforts of many to accomplish your goals.  If you offer good products/services, the rest comes with your enthusiasm and zeal for what you are doing and you will grow an organization of people who will help you along the way. . . . Good luck!!<br><br>Wishing you success . . . P. Pluto</p>

              <p>Fallen - You have a very dizzying intellect, to say the least.
                  You should really try to first understand the psychology and
                  principles of people before you begin to make blind assumptions,
                  which you are quick to offer. That is my "GET' with you more than
                  anything else. Your BLIND assumptions without first deriving basis
                  for your "harsh" criticism, much less your attempts at education of
                  others.  I do not believe there is one point in my original
                  post that any "guru" in MLM would take issue with or refute. That
                  is where I take issue with you! What if I told you that buried in
                  very credible writings this is exactly what even Trump has recited?
                  You seem to be a disciple, so where does your logic find reason to
                  controvert it with blanket statements that do not even address my
                  post in point by point rebuttal? It seems to me that unless it
                  comes from you there is no basis for the reasoning in anyone's
                  responsive post and therefore no credibility. Give me a break!!!!
                  There are numerous mentors in this industry who echo my sentiments.
                  Go do YOUR homework, then we can talk. True, this is "your" thread,
                  but I am still waiting for some indication that you have any
                  authority whatsoever in your advice. You have never offered any.
                  Anyone can talk a good talk, but where is the proof of your walk?
                  Please do tell of the incredible successes you have had in this
                  industry. Anyone can be a good study and recite principles, but
                  there is a BIG difference between practical application or
                  experience and theory based on observation. You are quick to assume
                  and assert lack of business etiquette on the part of others, but
                  then you have NO CLUE. It is EASY to accuse and persecute in a
                  forum that lacks substantiation. And, by the way . . .anyone who
                  has had any measure of success will tell you of their failures
                  along the way . . . . remember Trump? Failing forward allows one to
                  GROW and keeps it real in pursuit of success. Stop cutting people
                  to the quick and you will find more amenability in the forum - i
                  have read other peple's repsonses to your sharp rhetoric - it is
                  not becoming, nor is it favorable to you. I have asked before for
                  "freindly" discourse, but you continue to persecute. Not a very
                  good way to make friends or enlighten in positive ways . . .but
                  somehow your last post makes clear that is not what you are here
                  for. Let's not banter or jockey for position . . .that is not what
                  I am after here. I trust it is not your position either (or is
                  it?), as this is not an issue of being a "top dog". True colors

                  consultation services that you should be charging people for money 
                  (since you said you used to be earning millionaire income)</p>
              <p>by 
                  coming in here, forum, where it is the newbies, and not yet successful, 
                  you keep bragging and show off your intellience and A1 grade 
                  english..when the fact is that I  using layman english to be understood 
                  by the masses..</p>
              <p>first understand than be understood - go think about what it means..</p>
              <p>3)
                   by coming down into the forum..it is akin to saying that your skills, 
                  and knowledge is no longer appliable in the millionaires society as you 
                  cannot generate any real money in millionaires circle already thus you 
                  want to come in here to show off, and more importantly, you keep forcing
                   your replies, visions onto the people who don't want it be begin with..</p>
              <p>that
                   tells me the way of your business ethics, why you were only "ONCE A 
                  MILLIONAIRE" and not millionaire who is constantly increasing and 
                  growing your wealth.</p>
              <p>when I said "don't get into the mud to fight 
                  with the pigs" i was expecting you to understand the intention of the 
                  phrase which equals to "don't fight for food with the beggers when you 
                  have a ready spread of food on the table being a rich successful 
                  person..something along that line.." but yet you want to make yourself 
                  look stupid to go snatch the food from the beggers not allowing them any
                   food making them go hungry.</p>
              <p>yet you said "even pigs need grooming" that 
                  tells me that your level of wisdom is limited..you do not groom a pig 
                  when you are the pig farm owner with multiple franchises, you just need 
                  to hire others to do the job for you..simple phrase you also don't 
                  understand..it clearly illustrates traits of a failure who insist things
                   their way..</p>
              <p>4) when <a href="/users/239771">Kakaboo</a> clearly indicate that he/she would need my reply without asking for 
                  your reply..you  still force your way through in giving a reply without 
                  being asked of..</p>
              <p>this clearly shows one thing..your few decades of
                   success is not based on what you created yourself but it is just plain 
                  luck that got you in there at the right time, place and connects..</p>
              <p>when
                   you are showing off your huge extentsive of networks and success..ask 
                  yourself this qn "how many of the recruitment were really done by you 
                  yourself"</p>
              <p>while MLM is based on leverage, without proper sales 
                  basics and understanding, even if you are the world richest guy, you 
                  will not be be happy..</p>
              <p>Just refer to the Barang Barang furniture 
                  store with multiple stores over Singapore..it was intially successful, 
                  but yet it still closed for good..due to high overheads and insufficient
                   sales nor profits..</p>
              <p>why you are here lowering yourself instead of
                   thinking of ways to earn back your Millionaire Income clearly tells me 
                  and everybody else that your information is out-dated and thus you are 
                  no longer competitive if not you will not be here in this forum..</p>
              <p>even if you are successful, you should start a new thread and have them going to you for your advice, and solutions..</p>
              <p>your
                   actions to-date of forcing yourself in..answering questions without 
                  being asked of you shows me that you are the type of guy which my 
                  ex-uplines spoke of.. the type of millionaire who hangs around 9 other 
                  beggers trying to look impressive while allowing the beggers to waste 
                  his wealth and money away..</p>
              <p>what you should do is as a millionaire
                   before, hang around with your 9 other millionaire friends, if not 
                  multi-millionaire friends..discuss ideas on how to make more money..and 
                  help do some charity..instead of doing actions which only ruin your own 
                  reputation..give back to the society la..</p>
              <p>5) clearly given your 
                  profound/complex english, it shows that you are a really intelligent 
                  person..but could you kindly look at your last post??</p>
              <p>It is freaking squeeze packed into one whole big paragraph..in the response that you replied to my post..</p>
              <p>while you may have knowledge, and experience but you lack wisdom &gt;&gt;go ponder about it and ask yourself..</p>
              <p>6) why you are successful in your previous/current mlm company is a matter of luck..</p>
              <p>fyi:
                   there are many reasons why people are high up in a position..some 
                  political marketing reasons as well..having a simple person without any 
                  knowledge being a millionaire as a good testimonial is also a excellent 
                  marketing &amp; branding testimonial which can help generate tons of 
                  profits in return..</p>
              <p>so the reason why you are on top 
                  there..probably is just to make up the numbers only..so don't come here 
                  and show-off in front of me..</p>
              <p>don't build castles in the air..</p>
              <p>7)
                   This applies to other newbies and industry players too.. Kindly learn 
                  from this wonderful example of a Pluto..for he clearly has being a 
                  excellent example of what not to do... and more so as a once successful 
                  millionire made by mlm industry (if he isn't a clone/faking identity; or
                   if he was a millionaire businessman and pretending to be a millionaire with credits 
                  to mlm (business and mlm are two different industries) &gt;&gt; since whatever i learn to-date..the roots most is what i
                   picked up from ex-uplines yet he failed to understand the basics..might
                   some-how suggest he is a fake else a out-dated)</p>
              <p>being clouded by his past glory, he is staying in that past 
                  moment of glory without realizing that he is no longer earning that kind
                   of income..yet expects people to respect and listen to him without 
                  reflecting on what went wrong exactly..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly &gt;&gt;
                   From this point onwards, I will really blacklist and ignore all your 
                  posts...since you displayed the worst actions, behaviors which a senior 
                  upline (given you claimed to be) would actually behave..it is abnormal 
                  in fact in a industry for such behaviors..</p>

              While your reply is lengthy you still do not get why I am here . . . . .
              
              Primarily, in this thread, it is because I recognize your advice lacks sound basis. Agreed . . . Kikaboo asks for "your" advice. HOWEVER, it is NOT sound advice for MLM. I am merely rebutting your reply.
              
              Case in point: while you advise Kakaboo to stick with only basic sales you ignore the whole premise of MLM - to promote organized effort of a group of people interested in the success of an organization (their own) - which, in MLM, requires BOTH sales AND recruiting. 
              
              Why do you not just tell him/her to open a retail establishment or go hawk on the street, where he/she will learn real skills of a salesperson rather quickly and does not have to involve the recruiting facet of MLM? Commissions on sales can be earned in practically all sales environments. Perhaps a company employing DIRECT sales might be more suited - Melaleuca, for example, promotes this type of "referral based" retailing strategy and does not emphasize so much of the recruiting element. 
              
              People learn by observation and participation - MLM provides a classroom for both retailing and recruiting, in most cases. Upline are traditionally (and should be) interested in downline success. Yes, there will be successes and failures along the way - it happens in every business (including your reference of Barang). HOWEVER, change is a constant and when people do not analyze or make adjustments in recognizing change, failure can loom on the horizon. 
              
              As for my coming into the "pig pen", you obviously refer to the charitable position of giving back - we all started at the same level and we only grow and prosper by giving back - it is called contribution and the only way it works. You contradict your own self by not even recognizing that is why I might be here. You make assumptions that I am a broken record, though you have no clue whatsoever. I give back to the community and even donate my time to serve food at charitable events, or work with underprivileged. I give clothes and other items to the needy, while at other times I offer advice - yes, based on my own experiences. 
              
              You should really stop making blind accusation when you know nothing of what you say. These words to you are charitable advice.  Besides this, various points of view always cause people to ask more questions, thereby getting to the real answer(s). Can it cause confusion . . . . perhaps, but again the true colors all come out in the wash of knowledge. Reason and clarity always prevail once the curtains have been opened.
              
              By the way, do you know that some pigs do get groomed by those who take pride in their prized future stock - you obviously confuse the difference between a pig and a hog - PIGS GET NICELY FAT, WHILE HOGS GET SLAUGHTERED. It is better to groom and breed a pig for success than to see it raised solely for the meat house  - that is the dirty hog's domain, which invariably provides nourishment for others. Yes, even a hog can have a positive impact. The sad reality is that many do end up on death row . . . . just as in MLM. Perhaps if we encouraged more people and groomed them with SOUND advice there would be more FAT to share. I am not here to fight with beggars, but rather to offer a free meal - could it be charity?
              
              Most would agree that "Plain, A1 grade English" is the easiest understood . . . . otherwise we would be teaching something different in school. I use no technical or difficult words, lah. And whether I squeezed my post (to you) into one paragraph or not, you still get my conversation. Layman or not, I think most people can understand what I write. 
              
              Do you assume you deal with and post your "advice" to idiots? They have the technical ability to get online and post - they must have some intelligence to understand what they read - do you not agree?
              
              Most of what you write (especially about me, since you do not even know me) can be summed up as follows - IGNORANT AND FALSE. You continue to make unsubstantiated  assumptions and would do better not to hang your arguments on one word. You also confuse riches and wealth and place too much emphasis on one over the other - again, sad. This shows your lack of competence and confidence. Further, there is nothing in my reply to Kakaboo's post that is above a "newbies" capability or understanding and, even more so, all of it is above board and matter of fact. Practically anyone is capable but for the fact there is no effort to command the skills required of the effort to reap the rewards.
              
              "Luck" or skill in the arena???? Perhaps one or the other might favorably rub off on someone looking for either. I do not dispute that sometimes "luck' is an element of success, though even true capability and accomplishment is often confused or seen as luck. Nonetheless, even luck has elements of putting oneself in the right place, at the right time, for having done "something" proper to be rewarded with the "luck's" blessing. Could you be confusing "luck" for "chance"? More often this is the case when people like you make blind assumptions and do not know the facts.
              
              By the way, Business and MLM are not two different "industries" as you state. This is confusing to your readers and further shows your lack of even basic "business" knowledge. MLM is an industry with recognized business forms - it is business. You seem to be confused or truly just do not know. Go back to Business 101 - Business is an "Economic system in which goods and services are exchanged for one another or money, on the basis of their perceived worth. Every 'business' requires some form of investment and a sufficient number of customers to whom its output can be sold at profit on a consistent basis." An example of two different industries are like oil production and food service. They are both industries which contain recognized forms of business and its entities (ie: oil production = BP and food service = McDonalds), just like MLM is an industry with recognized business entities, such as Amyway.  
              
              Further, you obviously know little about business ethics. You berate, belittle and try to tear down anyone who appears to have any knowledge or desires to make a positive contribution to the forum. Your thread has not been hijacked - it has merely drawn the observation and attention of others who have chosen to participate because of its "public forum" nature. 
              
              You should learn respect for others, as you seem to have none. Sound business and its practice are built on amenable, contributing relationships. (Wow . . .that sounds like a great thread topic.) While you are quick to challenge the credibility of others, you have NEVER provided a basis for your own. Sad that you use this sort of tactic to make yourself look good. Anyone can criticize. See how easy it is?
              
              You opened this PUBLIC FORUM THREAD . . . . and I am simply making a contribution that opens people's eyes as to other points of view. You say people should take my posts with a pinch of salt . . .I say they should perhaps take yours with only a grain. You obviously have much to learn about business and business etiquette.

              <p>If the word is the same meaning as what is explained in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati than I suppose it's a 50/50 answer to your question.</p>
              <p>The idea of this word/term isn't wrong..it has good intentions in it but majority of the people understand it the wrong way..nothing more than that actually.</p>
              <p>The same thing applies to anything and everything in fact. In business, polictics, war, or basic survival instincts it is a necessity to use partially of what is explained in it.</p>
              <p>To make money, it is purely based on ideas, movements, campaigns to allow clients/people to accept the brand, products and services. Strategies is part and parcel of that word..</p>
              <p>But before you go off-track..that word is more towards advanced users/players in business context whereby it's more of a conspiracy thinking needed, stay close to the basics for starters.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure if I have answered your question, so if you don't understand what I've said, kindly let me know what you understand based on my reply so I can pose a reply to aid your understanding.</p>

              <p>It depends..</p>
              <p>it is a doulbe-eddge sword/weapon..</p>
              <p>A weapon (sword/gun) in the hands of a police is used to protect the civilians, but if it is in the hands of terrorist, it becomes a killing tool.</p>
              <p>The weapon itself cannot do anything. Likewise for iluminati..it depends on how you want to use this theory/word to help or to harm others.</p>
              <p>Lawyers, doctors, spa, health centers are actually meant to help people solve their problems but if they harbour any ill intentions, they also use the same knowledge wrongly and get in trouble with law itself.</p>
              <p>Like lawyers running away with clients' money, doctors over-prescribe medicine, didn't do proper medical checks causing patients' allergy/death; spa cheating clients money than close down, health/fittness center giving pushy sales tactics to earn commission for every package signed by the clients..</p>
              <p>I hope the above examples can help you get a clear understanding..it is actually your agenda or intentions in your own mind which makes the difference between doing good/bad..</p>

              Hi Ken, perhaps you might feel that it is non-related to MLM, but to me, it is related.
              
              To answer to your question:
              
              If you want to work on something, I need to know if you have the related knowledge of MLM and what do you have in mind at the moment? 
              
              Use PM [Only if you think it involves details which should not be made known to newbies/skeptics in MLM industries] to discuss if you see any need.

              <p>Hi the_fallen,</p>
              <p>I, the minor guy, will like to share with you mine slightest knowledge of mlm. Do correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Multi-level marketing is a leverage point system. It is use as to recruit newcomers to be part of the company. On a neutral stand, I'll like to comment that the system manipulate recruiters to enter the mlm company so as to do sales. Some people do not like this "flaw" system due to the recruitment policy or the membership fee policy. Likewise, many others said that they lost friends to mlm companies. This is not the way it should be. Mlm companies earn their money through direct sales, ignoring internal factors such as recognition and training. These mlm companies manipulate the newcomers as well as higher rankings to do sales. In this way, there seems no difference between direct sales!</p>
              <p>What more is that in mlm companies, you do not have a business by yourself, but have a business for yourself. Mlm companies business revenues/incomes mostly goes back to the boss and major shareholders themselves. To most people eyes, Mlm= Hard Labor Workers yet to Least Labor Bosses. [Apology for Caps]</p>
              <p>I, the minor guy, has just a thought of Franchise (which probably never come true), do not have any plans of business. I'm now currently in Republic Polytechnic (R.P) racking my brain on what should I start out for business. [Defintely not mlm structure or competition base]</p>

              <p>Hi the_fallen,</p>
              <p>I, the minor guy, will like to share with you mine slightest knowledge of mlm. Do correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Multi-level marketing is a leverage point system. It is use as to recruit newcomers to be part of the company. On a neutral stand, I'll like to comment that the system manipulate recruiters to enter the mlm company so as to do sales. Some people do not like this "flaw" system due to the recruitment policy or the membership fee policy. Likewise, many others said that they lost friends to mlm companies. This is not the way it should be. Mlm companies earn their money through direct sales, ignoring internal factors such as recognition and training. These mlm companies manipulate the newcomers as well as higher rankings to do sales. In this way, there seems no difference between direct sales!</p>
              <p>What more is that in mlm companies, you do not have a business by yourself, but have a business for yourself. Mlm companies business revenues/incomes mostly goes back to the boss and major shareholders themselves. To most people eyes, Mlm= Hard Labor Workers yet to Least Labor Bosses. [Apology for Caps]</p>
              <p>I, the minor guy, has just a thought of Franchise (which probably never come true), do not have any plans of business. I'm now currently in Republic Polytechnic (R.P) racking my brain on what should I start out for business. [Defintely not mlm structure or competition base]</p>
              <p>Warmest Regards,</p>

              <p>Based on your thoughts &amp; understanding of MLM as shown in the above short brief..<br>It seems that you may not have understand the full picture of the industry.</p>
              <p>While you asked of forming partnership in earlier post..and understanding you're still in the thinking planning stage..you'll need to explore the subject more in depth. [Read up past threads which I've may commented if you want to get a better understanding of the industry.]</p>
              <p>I'll not do business/partnership with people of no related knowledge. Nonetheless, thanks for your interest. To begin with, I started trying to answer other people's questions of MLM to learn it myself and to help others FOC at the moment.</p>
              <p>Since you're from RP, are you into your final yr? Feel free to ask questions if you want in here. I'll advice you accordingly on how to maximize your learning curve using PBL style since I myself was once a RP student. I used it (PBL) to increase my MLM knowledge and expertise in this area and you can use it to learn more on any other subjects of your interest.</p>
              <p>But do take note that if your questions go beyond MLM and related business questions, I'll stop answering those to keep the contents of the postings (questions and replies) relervant to this MLM Forum as the subject if it is within my own thread. [To keep it related for newbies to understand the industry easily without getting tricked into paying their precious $]</p>
              <p>If it's not related start a new thread in other forums (like Chit Chat) or something else so it will the discussion can be of anything under the sun. (Just give me a hyperlink to the new thread if you decide to start one else just continue in here).</p>
              <p>Should you continue in here, rephrase your questions of business to suit MLM and business related topics.</p>
              <p>Btw: Don't belittle yourself as the minor guy or something..if you're here to seek/get advice, just voice out your concerns will do.</p>

              <p>May I know if all health products offered by MLM in Singapore are regulated by which government authority ?</p>
              <p>Are the products required by the authorities to be certified as not containing any harmful ingredients and safe to be consumed?</p>
