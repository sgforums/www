              <p>Nice try on trying to get backlinks from 3rd party websites.</p>
              <p>The blog article doesn't describe the actual reality of network marketing industry in Singapore which is a completely different place as compared to other countries (due to major scam network marketing companies in the past of Singapore).</p>
              <p>Such over-positivity doesn't really gel well with Singapore's direct selling.</p>

              <p>I agree about the past scam network marketing companies in Singapore which have tainted the image of the profession. And I'm sure every country has its own share as well.

              <p>Hey Bro, if you're telling me that a company provides a program that allows sales distributors the flexibile of not carrying stocks..</p>
              <p>My interpretation/understanding of what you mean is that</p>
              <p>1) this company allows distributors to redeem their stocks anything, from 1 day to 1 month and even 1 year later right?</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>2) do you mean they (true networkers) can join the company without even making any product purchases?</p>
              <p><br>My next question will be: What are the main concerns that you have in this company?</p>
              <p>A) Low repeat sales?<br>B) Low/No Experienced Networkers?<br>C) Unsure of how to improve the business generally | Need NEW BLOOD!<br>D)ALL OF THE ABOVE?</p>

              Hi Fallen, a little more detail for your sharing and am not trying to sell anything here.. 
              
              This program don't deal with products like supplements or beauty products, it's Chiropractic where you sign up yourself as a member (lifetime membership) at $500 that comes with 
              â€¢ One Posture analysis report
              â€¢ One Chiropractor Consultation with doctor
              â€¢ One Chiropractic adjustment 
              
              A maintenance fee of $228 every month to get adjusted 4 times a month and a week's supply of bone supplement included.
              
              The program is unique that chiropractic is now made affordable to people because the normal cost of a session outside is priced at $100-$120 or even more, if we based on $228 for 4 sessions a month for the program, they only cost $58 per session 
              
              Bring two friends in and help them bring another 2 friends each, you can get adjusted free for life and passive income of up to $6.7k every month when people start to intro more people in, the comm plan is very attractive compared to many other MLM companies out there.
              
              Networkers don't carry products but get adjusted for better health because our spine needs alignment just like a car needs to align it's tyres every 3 months.
              
              My concerns are that I am given a top node based on my good relationship with the owner (Nicholas Chia, you can google him) but am stuck with no networker to help me grow the tree, my downlines are all friends and relatives of mine and they are enjoying the program now but don't think I can achieve more with friends and relatives. A true networker with his network will push this into another level and we can share the fruits at the top. These are my concerns, await your good advise. Thanks

              <p>Bro, there's a reason why only certain products and services can be done and successfully implemented using Network Marketing via Multi-Level Comission Payout Structure.</p>
              <p>The company that you're working for currently belongs to a Medical Industry. Have you seen/heard of any Hospital/Medical insitutions offering referral schemes for medical businesses?</p>
              <p>Not that I know of any. The services are not FMCG to begin with no repeat sales potential with very limited and SMALL Market of customers (only sick patients with backbone specific are potential customers)</p>
              <p>Your market is limited. VERY LIMITED. No experienced networkers would be interested based on the 2 points above not to mention many other considerations that a networker are looking at.</p>
              <p>I may be wrong solely because I have no domain expertise in medical industry such as the market demand and supply but from networker's perspective.</p>
              <p>We'll take it via PM for private discussion since we both know Nicholas. You can PM me separately for more discussions.<br><br>Lastly: FYI: I will not post such Sales/Compensation Related information on public area, such details are better left private.</p>

              <p>Well the company have since being closed permanently.</p>
              <p>Based on what i understand, it seems that there's a shift in management difference in the company directions thus they went spilt.</p>
              <p>The company have rebranded, and from what I personally seen during a Supper gathering, the current crowd of what's left behind the "LFI Company" that have being rebranded to E**** brand is consist of only gullible youngsters who have little or no society working experience thinking. No adults nor seniors were spotted (with the exclusion of the past few LFI Leaders that remains behind).<br><br>Please note: Names have being censored to remain NEUTRAL and keep this thread primarily a general thread to answer about industry related quesitons.<br></p>
