              <p>Hi guys! I'm new in this forum and would like to share what I feel about MLM. No, I'm not here to recruit/sign up anyone just to be clear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the_fallen, thank you for creating this post and helping out everyone here. Not many people are willing to help nowadays.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, I feel all MLM are equal based on income opportunities regardless of being a pioneer or 100 deep. Sure, the income/growth ladder may be different but if built on consistent basis will reap the same rewards in the end. Which is, more time and more money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course I can't say the same for certain black sheeps scamming the MLM industry but at the same time I wouldn't mention further. I believe you know who they are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rule of thumb when diving into the MLM industry is to always expect resistence from people around you. Learn at a consistent basis and always remember that it takes time to make a profit or even break even from your MLM business.</p>

              <p>If you're just concern about the MLM structure, don't worry, there are other industries that also adopts MLM structure in their ranking and payment as well.<br>Insurance and property both uses the same multi-tier rank structure to reward leaders to groom new leaders and coach them to succeed and be independent.<br><br>There's no need to be concern about that structure, simply put it, it's just a system that rewards the referrals. Why say No if you can get paid for referring a customer to a business?<br><br>Do well known major brands pay referral fees? No they don't with the exception of paid engagments of hiring celebrity artist, bloggers to endorse, promote to market to their network of fans and followers.</p>

              <p>Do you feel it is ethical and sustainable in through MLM?</p>
              <p>I learned Merchandising and I do learn that retail outlets earn profits through mark up of prices, sometimes up to 10 times or even more, which I believe is where retail products gets their profits.</p>
              <p>Does MLM works by marking up the prices by a lot? </p>
              <p>Is the main revenue of MLM companies through their mark up of products or referral income, (referral specifically to referral of new distributor who need to pay)? </p>
              <p>There are arguments of people saying MLM is not sustainable because due to the commission, the prices have to be a lot higher than competitor's product that are not functioning in MLM model. So is MLM sustainable? Can it be? (After having to add in the commissions of the uplines and all?)</p>
              <p>To me I felt insurance companies can sustain the high cost in commissions because I think it invests its money and gains a lot back. But I cannot understand how can normal MLM companies selling and having revenue from products can sustain the commissions?<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              <p>MLM, correct me if I am wrong, I personally felt MLM has a tendency on hard selling approach, to extend of being untruthful in sales pitches. </p>
              <p>I am guessing this is the reason why, a lot of people felt it was unethical. </p>
              <p>Can MLM stand alone without hard selling? Or they are usually very tied together?</p>
              <p>I have be very honest, I am not supportive of MLM, however I am interested to learn more from one who feels MLM works. </p>
              <p>My reasons are as follows:</p>
              <p>1. I am really not sure how sustainable with so many levels of commissions it need to pay out. How to have a balance between an attractive price, an attractive commissions to distributor and an even more attractive commissions for uplines to be motivated to recruit. Will it be more expensive than its competitor not working in MLM approach?</p>
              <p>2. I feel that the products have to be comsumables that are fast moving for it to work. Is there a certain industry that works better or cannot work with MLM?</p>
              <p>3. Won't there be an oversaturation of distributors and staffs? The company just keep multiplying and keep recruiting, then won't sales of each individual be smaller, sharing the same market? Oversaturation of products in market?</p>
              <p>4. Won't it be very hard to sell because everyone heard it and had somehow bought it? E.g Insurance, people already have insurance and now, trying to get more policies and moving to younger and younger target market. </p>
              <p>I am asking these questions not because I am interested in this industry, these doubts and questions on ethics deters me and further more I haven't seen a product that I felt is good using MLM sales model. However, I do want to hear from people who have better opinions of MLM on my doubts.</p>

              <p>Lastly, what are the main difference between Ponzi Scams and MLM and how to spot one who is actually a Ponzi Scam?</p>
              <p>I noticed previous companies that are quite notorious and failed is because they gave a guarantee, guarantee earn of interest. </p>
              <p>Any clear warning signs? </p>
              <p>Or can a MLM just overnight become a scam, why Ponzi Scams are legal in the first place?</p>
              <p>Sorry if my questions has been asked before, this forum is really a tad too lengthy. </p>
              <p>I also heard of my previous classmate who invested in a wine business, name will not be disclosed for neutrality, which guarantees him of earn money and he was persuaded with a certain projections. Reason being, wine will definitely earn money with time, but if I am not wrong, he earns back his money quicker by introducing people in. Is this case a MLM or more of a scam?</p>

              <p>Do you feel it is ethical and sustainable in through MLM?</p>
              <p>I learned Merchandising and I do learn that retail outlets earn
              profits through mark up of prices, sometimes up to 10 times or even
              more, which I believe is where retail products gets their
              profits.</p>
              <p>Does MLM works by marking up the prices by a lot? </p>
              <p>Is the main revenue of MLM companies through their mark up of
              products or referral income, (referral specifically to referral of
              new distributor who need to pay)? </p>
              <p>There are arguments of people saying MLM is not sustainable
              because due to the commission, the prices have to be a lot higher
              than competitor's product that are not functioning in MLM model. So
              is MLM sustainable? Can it be? (After having to add in the
              commissions of the uplines and all?)</p>
              <p>To me I felt insurance companies can sustain the high cost in
              commissions because I think it invests its money and gains a lot
              back. But I cannot understand how can normal MLM companies selling
              and having revenue from products can sustain the
              commissions?<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              <p>If you ask me for my input, i would say it depends on what you're exposed to throughout your network marketing journey. <br><br>There's always 2 sides of the coin, the Good and the Bad, it's just a matter of which side are you on.</p>
              <p>Substainable or not, it's not up to us to decide, it's up to the market to decide based on market demand and supply. You'll need to determine if you're hopping onto a fad or a trend. <br><br>Marking up prices is a standard business practice to generate profits; how high depends on the franchisor agreement / master distributor/licensed owner's preset retail price etc..there's also business considerations like overheads and operation expenditure etc..<br><br>Pertaining to the main revenue of network marketing companies, it depends on the compensation plan setup of respective companies hence subjected to your own observation.<br><br>Arguements or not whatsoever, let's cast it aside and look just facts.. It's a business, and business's ultimate goal is to make profits, without which, the business will fold and close down permanently if it can't substain itself.</p>
              <p>To substain a business is to manage the cashflow and liquidity of the business, which is off-topic from network marketing already. That you can leave it to the finance department to handle, don't need to be worried over issues that's beyond your scope of work, work within your means and your resources.</p>
