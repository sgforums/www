              <p>It depends on which company is that.. those legitimate ones will havce the products regulated by HSA (Health Sciences Authority)</p>
              <p>Actually, it does not matter whether the products are offered through Direct Selling or in the shops.. the products will have to be certified as they are all a form of sales to the customer.</p>

              <p>It is not required by law for MLM companies' products to be regulated by govt related bodies. Correct me if I'm wrong (but do show the link to URL reference to govt site so I can learn too)</p>
              <p>If they do show verification proof, count it as a bonus.</p>
              <p>If you are in doubt, you can always ask the company service staff to show proof of product certification done by HSA (Local Govt). You can always call the HSA hotline to verify if the company is speaking the truth to make sure you are not buying the products claiming to be HSA tested.</p>
              <p>If they show FDA (that's the USA Govt)..so don't be misleaded by companies which shows FDA.</p>

              <p>But I do get PMs from people with general questions. (If you're new to MLM, just kindly pose your questions in this thread, and I'll make it on this thread, so that the reply is made public for all others who may have the same questions in mind as well.</p>

              <p>However, should you have any nast experiences with MLM, kindly divert your frustrations in another thread of mine  <a title="Write Your Complaints Against MLM Agents Here" href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/14/topics/359405">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/14/topics/359405</a> which I'll address to the issues in there.

              <p>From the search results which returned to me..</p>
              <ol>
              <li>No search results returned on ACRA for businesses registered in Singapore</li>
              <li>Facebook profile info considered little if not zero with the 
                      exception of young sales distributors and rally 2010 which shares 
                      similarities of a mlm model</li>
              <li>Sharing same strategies used by MLM companies to retain sales distributors loyalty via outings, rally etc.<br> </li>
              <li>They are heavily hiring permanent employees as sales 
                      representatives which offers training (maybe they are using different 
                      model, should be in beta/testing mode to determine if current model of paid distributors are possible or not)</li>

              <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Most likely to be a sister company testing out the new model
                       of MLM using Paid Sales Distributors with strong company as financial 
                      backing of Redwoods Advance Pte Ltd of big MNC clients. (I think Redwoods should originate from Malaysia as their website data states the use of Malaysia address)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In a Nut-shell: <span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes.</span>  It is a newly startup MLM company using a revised salaried* approach to attracting youngers to join the company.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>* - Refers to information that i presume/assume to be true as there's
                       no way for me to verify it against sales distributors/employees of this
                       company.</p>
              <p>PS: Correct me if i'm wrong in any way, or inform me if there's a opening to this company for a appt etc: i'll like to find out more info myself too.</p>

              <p>1. do you join direct selling company because of your friends or do you see yourself with a future in that company?</p>
              <p>2. if you said you have guidance from your friends, than why are you skeptical of it?</p>

              <p>4. are you in the business for money or for knowledge and how do you think you can tap on whatever is offered or "promised" to you from your friends?</p>
              <p>the above questions will help me first understand about your current situation first, before i offer a suitable solution/advise based on your situation..and not the generic solutions to address general issues.</p>

              <p>Whats the difference between network marketing and MLM?</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>network marketing in public's understanding represents mlm.</p>
              <p>but my understanding of network marketing is pieced up from each individual word by itself.</p>
              <p>meaning to say everybody can learn networking skills such as public relations, building rapport with people, than using the positive network of relationship built over time to do soft/subtle marketing of him/herself regardless of the products or services or selling themselves.</p>
              <p>mlm is a franchise automation strategy used by companies and even businesses with minor adjustments to remove the negative stigma from it only.</p>
              <p>MLM is only a top-down marketing approach, where the leader say, the followers/team members can only agree. Period. Like wise for CEO, Management to give instructions and buy new products to sell, distributors can only accept and make the best out of it without able to change anything.</p>
              <p>it's a "good" place to train and practise business skills with the proper guidance, but majority if not all of the distributors are corrupted to the core already focusing only on Money and not learning the real business aspect of the company in customer servicing, follow-up, sales presentation, cold-calling, individual, group and mass training cum presentation, handling troublesome prospects etc.</p>
              <p>there's a lot more benefits in those, but only a very tiny percentage of individuals wil be able to succeed in learning those core sales skills required to make money.</p>

              <p>Refer to the post that I replied to a previous inquiry on the same company as of 12th Jan 2011 4:13pm.</p>
              <p>I did a search, apparently, they company website is still providing very little if not non-related company profile description..with contents over generalized..</p>
              <p>As for facebook photos, it shows typical young playful company with based on their casual photos taken.</p>
              <p>As for the positions that they are hiring, i presume that they are indeed adopting dual approaches to differentiate themselves from average direct selling companies.</p>
              <p>PS: I cannot confirm that they are a MLM company, but from the Facebook pictures, it seems that the seminar/award recognition/presentation cermonary is similar if not identical to what all other MLM companies.</p>
              <p>They business model is a hybrid: Combination of past company in Raffles Place that shifted to Enous plus a portion of Events Management as a disguise.</p>
              <p>The only actual positions they are hiring are Administrator Assistant (immed vacancy) &amp; Sales Management Trainee.</p>
              <p>The former is a Full-time salaried job, whereas the latter is a commission basis job. &gt;&gt; Purely based on what I think of their business model. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Management Trainee is just another gimmick position which is sales as Sales Management Trainee which is to sell products than get a commission.</p>
              <p>Whatever they are doing, their award presentation, based on the stage board in a couple of their picture tells signs that they are just a franchise branch from a foreign company, as they are standing on stage with prizes hang around their neck.</p>
              <p>This question was posted to this thread a few months already, and the positions are still the same, if not with more fanciful positions for hire.</p>
              <p>If it's a traditional business, the positions would already be filled by now, since it's almost a year already.</p>
              <p>The fact that they are still hiring, means that the percentage of them being a Network Marketing Company is over 75% at least.</p>
              <p>Plus their online recruitment methods are not done properly with their incomplete company profile in my own personal thoughts is too generalized and tells nothing about the company.</p>
              <p>Since all businesses requires Sales &amp; Marketing, Advertising &amp; Promotions, so their contents tells little to nothing about the business. If a business isn't open about what they are doing, what do you think of such a business? I'll keep the comment to myself and let you all reflect and think if you want to even consider such companies.</p>
              <p>PS: There are lots of other companies like these..so be careful.</p>

              <p>A general guide.</p>
              <p>Not all positions/opportunites are created equal.</p>
              <p>It depends on your perspective and perception towards directly and converting negative into positive.</p>

              <p>Hi, i have been invited to a MLM company to be a biz partner. i do have some question wrt the legitimacy of the biz.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This question is wrt paragraph 2(c)(i)</p>
              <p>story: This MLM agent told me that i needed to pay a one-off sum of money to buy their products to sell. Subsequently, if i needed to sell more products, i will just have to being the customer to the warehouse/shop to buy it. She claims that the purpose of this one-off payment is so that i prove myself, to the company, as a serious entrepreneur who is willing to work hard to succeed. She also says that this money represents a start-up capital that every biz will have to pay.</p>
              <p>Q: is this the above practise legal? Do most other MLM companies practise this as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This question is wrt paragraph 2(c)(iii)</p>
              <p>Story: the agent said that part of my mission is to recruit and train more biz partners into the company. After training a certain number of people, i will be promoted to a rank which promises passive income. She claims that this income will continue coming in regardless if i or those that i recruit, make any sales at all.</p>
              <p>Q: Is the above legal? Do most other MLM companies practise this as well?.</p>

              <p>Story: The MLM company that i was invited requires no contract whatsoever. There is also no mention of this gurantee.</p>
              <p>Q: Do other MLM company practise this law? Is there a contract that all you (MLM agents) signed before you are considered an MLM agent?</p>

              serious entrepreneur who is willing to work hard to succeed. She
              also says that this money represents a start-up capital that every
              biz will have to pay.</p>
              <p>Q: is this the above practise legal? Do most other MLM companies
              practise this as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This question is wrt paragraph 2(c)(iii)</p>
              <p>Story: the agent said that part of my mission is to recruit and
              train more biz partners into the company. After training a certain
              number of people, i will be promoted to a rank which promises
              passive income. She claims that this income will continue coming in
              regardless if i or those that i recruit, make any sales at all.</p>
              <p>Q: Is the above legal? Do most other MLM companies practise this
              as well?.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This question is wrt paragraph 2(c)(vii) and 2(c)(viii)</p>
              <p>Story: The MLM company that i was invited requires no contract
              whatsoever. There is also no mention of this gurantee.</p>
              <p>Q: Do other MLM company practise this law? Is there a contract
              that all you (MLM agents) signed before you are considered an MLM
              agent?</p>

              </p><p>1. The practice of Bulk Purchase for network marketing companies is a standard practice international, unless you are exceptional lucky to meet 100% ethical independent distributors who only encourage you to buy just 1 bottle/unit of product inclusive of membership fee.</p>
              <p>Bulk purchase serves a couple of purpose.</p>
              <p>I - Shows individual capabilities/commitment<br>II - Allows both upline (the person who recruited you) and the company to make profits from your bulk purchase (sales of products)<br>III - You with lots of products, will be pushed/financially motivated to push for sales, in order to recoup your 'Investments', thus fast forward your learning curve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Mission/Job Scope of Independent Distributors are as follows (across all network marketing companies)<br><br>I - Sell more products to end consumers (create active/recurring clients who like the products)<br><br>II - Recruit and train more downlines to sell more products<br><br>III - Train up more sales leaders to expand group sales, in return for each respective leader's advancement into the higher rank or hit quota for company incentives.<br><br>IV - Over the years of exploring companies, all compaines are only FOCUSED ON SALES TRAINING, only 0.000001% will concentrate on actual Business &amp; Personal Development as an Entrepreneur.. | I'm the exceptional case, thus I don't earn from Network Marketing due to being too ethical.<br><br>V - Never do what they tell you to do (Don't follow blindly)..Join them only if you see/ can align the company's direction in the same direction as yours..don't try to fit into a company that force their will/goals onto you..&gt;&gt; This spells incomptability/Job Mis-Match<br><br>3. MLM Agent VS Independent Distributor</p>
              <p>Read the clause clearly..no company/business in the right mind will immediately declare and allow new recruits without going through the training and proof themselves to represent the company and as such increasing their risk of unable to deliver.</p>
              <p>That is why majority of the company sales are made in-house..where senior trainers/sales leaders can make sure correct representation/message are carried across.</p>
              <p>All "MLM Agents" are legally classified only as Independent Distributors, thus they cannot handle Counter Sales, Admin, Management documents, which are handled by Full-Time staffs.<br><br>The term is used because they are considered <br>A) Full timers<br>B) Part timers<br>C) Free Lance Basis<br>D) Clients &amp; Members</p>
              <p>The word INDEPENDENT states he/she cannot represent the company in anyway BUT they can help to sell the company products in return for a commission for every single sales made, which is why all agents push for SALEs to the extent most become Black Sheeps which consist of 95%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Guarantee<br><br>Network Marketing like any other businesses, doesn't promise any guarantee with the exception of financial investment products, which they still have to sign agreement to undertake and risk involve and discharge the company/bank of the risk involved.<br><br>Nobody/company will provide any guarantee.</p>
              <p>The best guarantee you can get is to learn how to select the 0.0001% Good Leaders/Mentors/Coach to show you the ropes with practical examples and hand-holding of coaching.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I didn't even read the clause of the link you provide, as I know how the industry from the inside out (excluding the management/financial/admin side - full time employees)..from the perspective of a Independent Distributor.<br><br>I hope my replies answers your questions..Feel free to ask more questions if you're still in doubt. </p>
