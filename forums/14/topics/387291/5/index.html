              <p>Network marketing is also known as multilevel marketing or MLM.
              After finding a proven network marketing success strategy, you are
              able to set yourself up for life.</p>

              <p>Clarification:</p>
              <p>Network Marketing is a industry, it is a profession, just like Insurance, Property.</p>
              <p>Multi-Level Marketing is a business strategy, just like viral, word-of-mouth marketing.</p>
              <p>There's a reason to why professional entrepreneurs and business investors such as Donald Trump, Robert Kiyosaki use the word network marketing and not mlm in their books has their reasons..</p>
              <p>Study and try to understand about the business more before you try to direct traffic from the thread which I'm trying to help individuals to get pass those black sheeps..<br><br>Think hard and learn more first..</p>

              <p>I understand what you are saying. However,</p>

              <p>are all against the law as stated in the clause. I understand that MLMs may have to use the above tactics to earn a living.

It isn't ethics im talking about here. these requirements are indeed in the law.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The practice of Bulk Purchase for network marketing companies
              is a standard practice international, unless you are exceptional
              lucky to meet 100% ethical independent distributors who only
              encourage you to buy just 1 bottle/unit of product inclusive of
              membership fee.</p>
              <p>Bulk purchase serves a couple of purpose.</p>
              <p>I - Shows individual capabilities/commitment<br> II - Allows both upline (the person who recruited you) and the
              company to make profits from your bulk purchase (sales of
              products)<br> III - You with lots of products, will be pushed/financially
              motivated to push for sales, in order to recoup your 'Investments',
              thus fast forward your learning curve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Mission/Job Scope of Independent Distributors are as follows
              (across all network marketing companies)<br> <br> I - Sell more products to end consumers (create active/recurring
              clients who like the products)<br> <br> II - Recruit and train more downlines to sell more products<br> <br> III - Train up more sales leaders to expand group sales, in return
              for each respective leader's advancement into the higher rank or
              hit quota for company incentives.<br> <br> IV - Over the years of exploring companies, all compaines are only
              FOCUSED ON SALES TRAINING, only 0.000001% will concentrate on
              actual Business &amp; Personal Development as an Entrepreneur.. |
              I'm the exceptional case, thus I don't earn from Network Marketing
              due to being too ethical.<br> <br> V - Never do what they tell you to do (Don't follow blindly)..Join
              them only if you see/ can align the company's direction in the same
              direction as yours..don't try to fit into a company that force
              their will/goals onto you..&gt;&gt; This spells incomptability/Job
              Mis-Match<br> <br> 3. MLM Agent VS Independent Distributor</p>
              <p>Read the clause clearly..no company/business in the right mind
              will immediately declare and allow new recruits without going
              through the training and proof themselves to represent the company
              and as such increasing their risk of unable to deliver.</p>
              <p>That is why majority of the company sales are made
              in-house..where senior trainers/sales leaders can make sure correct
              representation/message are carried across.</p>
              <p>All "MLM Agents" are legally classified only as Independent
              Distributors, thus they cannot handle Counter Sales, Admin,
              Management documents, which are handled by Full-Time staffs.<br> <br> The term is used because they are considered <br> A) Full timers<br> B) Part timers<br> C) Free Lance Basis<br> D) Clients &amp; Members</p>
              <p>The word INDEPENDENT states he/she cannot represent the company
              in anyway BUT they can help to sell the company products in return
              for a commission for every single sales made, which is why all
              agents push for SALEs to the extent most become Black Sheeps which
              consist of 95%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Guarantee<br> <br> Network Marketing like any other businesses, doesn't promise any
              guarantee with the exception of financial investment products,
              which they still have to sign agreement to undertake and risk
              involve and discharge the company/bank of the risk involved.<br> <br> Nobody/company will provide any guarantee.</p>
              <p>The best guarantee you can get is to learn how to select the
              0.0001% Good Leaders/Mentors/Coach to show you the ropes with
              practical examples and hand-holding of coaching.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I didn't even read the clause
              of the link you provide, as I know how the industry from the inside
              out (excluding the management/financial/admin side - full time
              employees)..from the perspective of a Independent
              Distributor.<br> <br> I hope my replies answers your questions..Feel free to ask more
              questions if you're still in doubt. </p>

              <p>point 1 - making members buy products..is what every new business does in order to survive..</p>
              <p>point 2 - benefiting from new recruits (i rather say new product sales) is what keeps the business moving..without growth, the business will bleed and close shortly after..</p>
              <p>even govt plus MNC/SMEs are taxing/benefiting from individuals (non-tax payers indirectly as well) in the forms such as taxing vehicles owner for every single litre of petrol/disel/green energy they purchase..business tax, gst tax, service tax, all are imposed onto non-tax players isn't it?</p>
              <p>point 3 - money back guarantee - does studying academically, guarantees success? no, it doesn't even guarantees employment if a person has a bad working attitude.</p>
              <p>does F&amp;B business have money-back-guarantee for food that doesn't suit individual's taste buds? no..as different people have different preference..</p>
              <p>like wise for network marketing..individuals who want to learn how to succeed using their approach should weigh the risk and sacrifice that they have to take..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm not defending networking marketing..i'm just trying to clarify and let you look from a neutral perspective..where logic and facts matters..it's happening everyday around us, just that most of us choose to ignore/turn both eyes off the those facts..</p>

              <p><strong>There's No Such Thing as FREE LUNCH in the world.</strong></p>
              <p>To get something, we first have to do something.</p>
              <p>There's nothing such as no selling yet get the rewards.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 1</span><br>Even those on govt support or community/low-income welfare scheme, they did to do something (ask for help/ fill up application form) in order to let other volunteers know of their presence.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 2</span><br>Even beggers who does "nothing" but sits around public places needs to do something. They also work hard for the money. <br><br>I- They did to travel to high traffic venues early to position themselves for prime spots to increase their income from donations. (Early Bird Gets the Worms)<br><br>II- They even did to make an effort in displaying their weaker sides or how they ended up in such a situation (Story telling using Visual and Audio/Speech) to make their point across.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example 3</span><br>Those high income earners also need to use their brain, and sell to clients, targetted high value clients to get pay-rise/commissions.</p>
              <p><strong>Back to the point</strong><br>Network Marketing will always be the way it is unless and until significant amount of success stories are made available publically..which isn't done locally yet..thus it will still be a industry that's not popular in Singapore.</p>

              <p>If you want to earn $10K fast, go into sales after you graduate - within few months if you prove you can deliver results where sales is concerned.</p>
              <p>There's quite a couple of companies offering management trainee positions on newspapers..</p>
              <p>There's a handful of companies offering such opportunities.</p>
              <p>Don't bet/waste your time on your friend who claims to be able to earn $10K only after 4 months.</p>
              <p>Those companies are still growing and expanding, so no worries, when you graduate in 1-2 years time, they will still be hiring..</p>
              <p>Their clients are corporate clients, and they sell on-behalf of those brands..</p>
              <p>Thus that way you can learn the real stuff - the art of selling.</p>

              <p>it's good to Plan ahead, but it isn't good to worry too much.</p>
              <p>Worrying before u even start puts u already at an disadvantage. </p>
              <p>Negative thoughts will amplify inside you thus speeds up ur the speed of what u think of which creates more obstacles for yourself.</p>
              <p>Based on ur reply, its clear to me that ur perception of network marketing is to keep doing recruitment which is mis-matched</p>
              <p>Take a step back and relook at the options and choices you have.</p>
              <p>If its still within he sales cooling period, ask for refund. Your present mental state isn't ready for such a sales industry yet.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself if you are doing it for the money or to learn business?</p>
              <p>If it's the former, quit, if it's the latter, continue and push on.</p>
              <p>There's a lot to learn in this industry, you can't make a single penny if you're not keen on learning the business.</p>
              <p>Learn the business and you'll get the money eventually.</p>
              <p>Chase the money and you'll end up nowhere before you know it. </p>

              <p>While Internet Marketing does increase the possibility of increase potential list of prospects from cold (stranger) markets, the ability to consistently generate leads also depends on your online website information and the reputation of the site that goes with it if there's any negative reviews on either Online or Offline.</p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> Please read the 1st post on this page 5 of mine reply on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">clarification of Network Marketing VS MLM.</span> </p>
              <p><strong>Word of advice:</strong> Don't build your castle in thte air. From the way you offer advice, I sense that you're concentrating too much on Recruitment and not Talent Grooming, which as a distributor who knows what he/she is doing should be doing to generate multiple streams of income via over-riding commission. &gt;&gt; That's actually what Insurance &amp; Property agents are doing, but not seen in majority of the companies that I've being to.</p>
              <p>Focus on building and improving on your basic selling and customer servicing skills. These is what's really important to generate long-term recurring business in any business.</p>
              <p>Focusing on recruitment is only a fast start temporary measure only. If you're hardworking enough, go study the business model in terms of SWOT and relook at how you can study the business and learn the ropes of the business.</p>

              <p>Well, I know just enough to be working for company to help business increase their web traffic.</p>
              <p>Moving on to 2nd question of yours.</p>
              <p>Sharing tips on how to promote offline network marketing scheme online..<br><br>As much as I like to help, but I can't, it's classified as Internet Marketing Question which is slightly off-topic, and it is also considered to be a professional service and solution that are being marketed professionally on a corporate level from SMEs to MNCs, thus I choose not to answer that question.</p>
              <p>I hope that answers your questions.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the link.</p>
              <p>If you read and review the quality of the post..it's a Poor Quality. Nonetheless, thanks for the effort.</p>
              <p>Reference Pointers:</p>
              <p>1. Date written in year 4 sept 2000 - outdated</p>
              <p>2. Article of content is NOT Recognized by the website themselves (fine-prints)</p>
              <p>3. Social Media Mentions - countable number of such implies the poor quality.</p>
              <p>4. The question itself is broken into a couple of sections, which isn't reflected clearly and use of 3rd party and 1st party perspective creates confusion in the question.</p>
              <p>5. There's a lot of low quality contents that's too naggy to reply make a point. Not direct.<br><br>6. Despite the claim of the article author's authority in the niche, just easily spotting these many issues with this single page article goes to show that we can question the author's claim to be even the considered experienced in the industry as a insider.</p>
              <p>7. No use of Industry terminology/words. - Article is too much of a layman expression to the extent the context of the article is poorly written with no additional value.</p>
