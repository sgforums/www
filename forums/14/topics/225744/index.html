            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, i've got many doubts about this line of job and hope u all can help me clear.<br><br>I wish to know how many of you think MLM can take over your full time stable job? And if MLM can earn big $$, why don't people just quit their job and be full time MLM? Also can a MLM company last long enough until we retire?<br><br>I personally think that MLM is like sign on SAF. If any time we wish to back out and find a better job outside, will the HR be impressed if i wrote in "worked in XXX MLM company" ? Just my 2cents worth of thoughts, hope u all can correct my thinker if this is not the case.<br><br>And according to my friend who is in a MLM company, he told me alot of things only insider knows. It would be too long if i type it out, if response is good i will type it out along with my many questions. Thanks people.</div>

If you like keep forcing ppl to buy your products or invest in your project and say nasty remarks when they don't want, of cos you lose your friends. So what if your upline like tell you to work hard, you are not working for him anyway?</div>
