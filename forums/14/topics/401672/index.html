              <h1 class="storyheadline">Act against MLM firms hiring students</h1>
              <p>I READ with great interest Madam Isnani Norasiken Mohamed Ali's Forum 
              Online letter ("Prevent MLM firms from recruiting students", last 
              Friday).</p>
              <p>I am a former student who had been approached by multi-level
               marketing (MLM) teams to join their companies.</p>
              <p>After my O levels a few years ago, I received numerous calls
               from MLM companies asking me to go for interviews.</p>
              <p>There was a company that dangled the position of "manager" 
              as a bait to students. In another instance, I was told that I could earn
               "big bucks" that would allow me to buy luxury cars. This MLM company 
              even showed those going for the "interview/briefing" a magazine that had
               sales staff standing beside luxury cars.</p>
              <p>When I asked if I could have a chat with these "successful 
              sales staff", I was told that they had left.</p>
              <p>Is this a gimmick? I don't know.</p>
              <p>At that time, I told myself that if the job was so 
              profitable, why were there still people working in various industries 
              for less than $1,000 a month, when students, some even younger than 18, 
              could 'earn' salaries to buy luxury cars?</p>
              <p>Many of my friends went into this field to give it a shot. A
               few months later, many did not make a profit. Some even lost money due 
              to the "start-up package" they had to buy.</p>
              <p>Until now, I wonder why the Ministry of Manpower does not 
              step up its rules on such tactics to entice students. Shouldn't the 
              authorities regulate how MLM firms recruit staff?</p>
              <p>The authorities should make it clear that such tactics are 
              not allowed to be used on youth, especially school-going students. Why 
              has no action been taken?</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Be sceptical of MLM firms' claims</h1>
              <p>I SHARE Madam Isnani Norasiken Mohamed Ali's concern ("Prevent MLM 
              firms from recruiting students", last Friday).</p>
              <p>When my cousin was a student, he joined a multi-level 
              marketing (MLM) company and spent more than $2,000 of his savings to buy
               imported products. He was told by an MLM recruiter that quick profits 
              could be made by recruiting his family members, relatives and friends to
               do the same.</p>
              <p>A few years ago, I was invited by my cousin to a talk given 
              by the MLM company. I was inundated with lots of data and diagrams to 
              show that by working hard in the business, anyone could retire by the 
              age of 35 or 40. The value of certificates, diplomas and degrees was 
              undermined.</p>
              <p>Later, I discovered that the company's chief executive was 
              in his 50s and still working to convince the many present to join him to
               "succeed together" and become a millionaire. I was sceptical and did 
              not join the company.</p>
              <p>Now I feel sorry for my cousin, who is still a full-time 
              student and has problems selling the products he bought years ago.</p>
              <p>Students must always bear in mind that no matter how good a 
              company claims to be, a good formal education is still a prerequisite to
               succeed in today's world.</p>

              <p>Is this a gimmick? I don't know.</p>
              <p>At that time, I told myself that if the job was so profitable,
              why were there still people working in various industries for less
              than $1,000 a month, when students, some even younger than 18,
              could 'earn' salaries to buy luxury cars?</p>
              <p>Many of my friends went into this field to give it a shot. A few
              months later, many did not make a profit. Some even lost money due
              to the "start-up package" they had to buy.</p>
              <p>Until now, I wonder why the Ministry of Manpower does not step
              up its rules on such tactics to entice students. Shouldn't the
              authorities regulate how MLM firms recruit staff?</p>
              <p>The authorities should make it clear that such tactics are not
              allowed to be used on youth, especially school-going students. Why
              has no action been taken?</p>

              <p>As for companies hiring underage students..</p>
              <p>you may not know the system in different companies..</p>
              <p>some act as referrals thus they didn't sign up anything with the company yet get paid for future sales in the event if their referred client buys a package thus the client is than helping the student opening a account instead of the student buying a package..</p>
              <p>in such cases, this is attractive to students as they don't need to fork out anything.</p>
              <p>there are tons of different strategies for marketing, depending on what you are exposed to only..</p>
