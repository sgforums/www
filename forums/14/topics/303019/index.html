As mentioned by the previous member, at the beginning they will inform us about the amount that we need to spend (about $350) which i think it was okay.<br><br>But after awhile, I asked them more detail about the program membership and it shocked me, because the amount we should spend is about 18K+++ (Crazy).<br><br>Luckily I keep on rejecting their offer and at the end i managed to "escape" from that building. For your information, the voucher given to you worth for USD$1000 is not true. First, you have to pay USD$10 in order for you to get the passcode before you can purchase the item. Second, they will not ship the goods because we are in Singapore (in other words, they can only ship the good for US/Canada teritory only).<br><br>My advise: Dont waste your 90 minutes time to go there and listen to their presentation, because is not worthy at all and you could lose your SGD18K+++ which you can invest for other things.<br><br>Address of the company: Discovery VIII International, Tong Building #18-02 (in between Lucky Plaza and Paragon - Rolex Building)</div>
