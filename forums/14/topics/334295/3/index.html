              <p>Well, I don't know the details... They never really taught me
              about the products at all, main reason why I quit VE... You should
              ask a VE personel to get a real answer...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I would like to point out here one of the reason some
              companies chose to market their product thru MLM... Unlike generic
              products off the shelves, most products marketed by Network takes
              quite some time to explain and have benefits that are need some
              explaination.</p>
              <p>That's why these products are best marketed through Network
              Marketing because it allows a one on one explaination between the
              seller and the buyer, same goes for insurances. It would be hard to
              advertise these items in a 20 sec TV advertisement or a sign board
              on an MRT.</p>
              <p>Now the problem with most network marketers is that they try too
              hard and go and talk to everyone they met. This will result in most
              of the potential customers going uh-huh~~ ok~~ because they are
              simply not interested at that point in time... So, in the end its
              simply trying to dind someone who is interested and willing to
              listen to the seller...</p>

              <p>So one to one better lah. Instead of doing it how normal businesses would do. MLM companies do not want to spend the money to advertise their product to try and 'steal' business from bigger well known companies. Besides, the way they price it, and the products they claim to sell also CMI.</p>
              <p>Not getting it checked, or investigated or researched. Manufacture already sell. People kenna con, or die also nevermind. Earn money can already right?<br><br>Also, Insurances HAS to be done that way because it is a lifelong life and death investment. There are clauses and whatnot to clarify and understand.</p>
              <p>Just stop and think for a moment. Why do you want to work so hard and try to cater and shit. When you can just set up a shop, put up some banners and posters and get people to come to you. If it's good, word will spread. More business. Simple. And lagi best, you want to start this kind of company despite knowing what would happen.</p>
              <p>Eventually you want to earn money right? If not start a business for what? That's not smart business. There are many ways to do business, and this is not one of them.</p>

              <p>And sadly enough. This business method has failed. Mainly due to other idiots who take advantage and exploit it.</p>
              <p>So if you still care about your so called business. I suggest you start working hard. There's no short cut to wealth. Look at well known businessmen. You get the idea.</p>

              <p>I am still waiting to see a hard example of something which you "know for a fact" works. Please, could you educate us?</p>
              <p>A lot of the explanations I have heard for MLM products love to use psuedoscientific words. "active ions". Please lah. All ions are active. The world is full of ions, exactly WHAT ions are we talking about? And how do ions carry NUTRIENTS? Do you have any example of a product which you think really works? I would like to look at the explanation for it.</p>
              <p>And do you know anything about economics and market forces? IF a product works, it WILL sell. Do you know the mechanism for aspirin? Do you know exactly how different types of antibiotics work on a molecular, or even a physiological level? Does the general population know, or do they even care? All they know is that aspirin will remove pain, and antibiotics can clear bacterial infections. Essentially they WORK. And what do you know? Nobody has to convince them that they need it.They sell with minimum effort.</p>
              <p>You asked a question about why people don't want to listen, and we are trying to tell you. Ironically, YOU don't want to listen. </p>
              <p>In fact, I believe you honestly believe in your product, and perhaps you really want to help people. And that is great - I can definitely respect that. But I think you are misguided and misinformed. If you are prepared to read in-depth about how human physiology works, you will find that a lot of the claims for MLM products are too wild to have any kind of credibility.</p>

              <p>If you can't explain it in a few sentences why this product is good for your health, isn't it too complicated for your body also? I'm not saying that this product is bad for health, but if you can't explain it in simple words, how are you going to sell? Are you going to take something in your body that you don't understand or don't need?</p>
              <p>Sometimes I wonder if marketing schools are teaching students the efficient way to market their products. This VE trainer is indeed 'eyeing only for sales'. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>To Mohamed F.</p>
              <p>The reasons People don wan to listen when u talk is because they wan to listen to what they like to hear. And if u could link to what they like to hear and ur sharing of ur MLM.. den u master some level of going to the top.</p>
              <p>ANyway.. anyway.. in MLM forums.. i advise is best to discuss the problems thru email or msn n not over to forums.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I would prefer u would just go outside to meet ur prospects and talk abt biz and not over forums. In forums talking abt biz.. is just like wasting time (for me la) I don know the others.. (maybe got try got chance) but usually ends up 0.</p>
              <p>anyway gd luck to U :)</p>
