              <p>One of the most irritating thing in this business is before you talk the other party will close their ears one...</p>
              <p>Haven't even say what are you offering, they don't want to hear... The first person to listen to me was my mother... She is willing to listen and now she no longer has her arthritis...</p>
              <p>She spent thousands of dollars on doctors only to end up with "you need to go for operation"... dotz leh... lots of money on diagnosis only to hear this... then I offer her something for $200/- and she got better in 3 weeks compared to months that the doctor promised her...</p>
              <p>I try to share with others but only one is willing to listen... note, its not they don't believe, its that they don't want to listen in the 1st place... wonder why most people are like that...?</p>

              <p>Coz most people's mind are not open enough, and they are fixated towards a certain belief based on what they hear or experience from others which they deem similar..</p>
              <p>Fixation is a common problem that most people have.. that is they are too attached to a certain habit or belief and will stick to it no matter what etc..</p>
              <p>So anyway there's no need to worry or waste time with people who not willing to  listen.. just look for those who are open minded enough to listen.. We cant change people's mindset.. as long as you have a clear conscience and dun force or cheat.. and are open on what you do.. nothing to be worried bout..</p>
              <p>It's normal :)</p>

              <p>Try working on your skills of convincing with facts, then work on your persuasion skills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You also need to portray yourself as sincere &amp; patient, else nobody will listen to you in the first place.</p>

              <p>I know for a fact that most MLM products works... some are more expensive or impractical, but the ones that are perfect for everyday consumer, how is the product going to sell if no one knows about it...</p>
              <p>Hyoscine Butylbromide gurantee will work, but will you buy it off the shelf? no right... a doctor will recommend it for you then you buy from pharmacy...</p>
              <p>Same goes with some MLM products, it works but no one knows about it... so someone need to sell it so others will buy...</p>
