              <p>i think there's a general impression that MLM are scam companies. Set up shop, recruit people, preferbly young, and try to make as much money as possible. The recent SE saga was very sobering to the general public.</p>
              <p>But let me say this, it's not just MLMs. Even people are wary of banks now.</p>

              <p>So I guess I can come to a conclusion... MLM can be done by anyone but it is not for everyone.. To be an MLMer, you need to be an employee, a salesman, a marketer/advertiser, a supply Chain manager and a manager to your downline...</p>

              <p>Well, I don't know the details... They never really taught me about the products at all, main reason why I quit VE... You should ask a VE personel to get a real answer...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I would like to point out here one of the reason some companies chose to market their product thru MLM... Unlike generic products off the shelves, most products marketed by Network takes quite some time to explain and have benefits that are need some explaination.</p>
              <p>That's why these products are best marketed through Network Marketing because it allows a one on one explaination between the seller and the buyer, same goes for insurances. It would be hard to advertise these items in a 20 sec TV advertisement or a sign board on an MRT.</p>
              <p>Now the problem with most network marketers is that they try too hard and go and talk to everyone they met. This will result in most of the potential customers going uh-huh~~ ok~~ because they are simply not interested at that point in time... So, in the end its simply trying to dind someone who is interested and willing to listen to the seller...</p>
