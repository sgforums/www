            <div class='col-md body'>i haf my primary reservations abt mlm nt cos they r unethical ...<br>bt rather, they strike me as pple obssessed with the pursuit of wealth. In e process, they have neglected some things that constitute their existence in life as a human being... for example.. friendship and family ties.<br><br>Yes, its true that many of them r unethical... it's no hidden fact that lying and scheming are some of those skewed values glorified in e trade. More notably, these pple r soo pragmatic. They are nice to you solely cos you rake in e<br>revenue for em, regardless of your worth as a person. Network marketeers have been reduced to no more than money-spinning machines, whose worth is measured in terms of the PVs they generate. How do i know that these pple r unethical? Simply cos of my rather brief stint with a network marketing company. It's not uncommon to hear abt such stories concerning this trade, either from my friends or relatives. Try telling your manager that u have no appointments, recruitments and see how he reacts.<br><br>If you wanna noe more abt my reasons for adopting such an anti-mlm stance, please read mlm observations.<br><br>I'm nt gonna name these companies cos these will just generate much controversy without any fruitful action being taken. ALMOST ALL of them are like dat, and that's y i warn pple to steer clear from e industry in general, as it has been tainted by random complaints and e general public is still found unreceptive to this new industry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree some of these mlmers are ruthless on the people.  But the term unethical is used very loosely these days...see Michael Moore's propaganda film.

But again, life still goes on..<br></div></blockquote>It's nt an excuse... its a valid and good reason to hate mlm. surely you wouldn't want your friends to capitalize on your friendship? And you'll be surprised, how this trade can really redefine a person's values and sense of purpose in life, so much so that he becomes a totally diff person, willing to sacrifice friendships fer the sake of money. perhaps "betrayal" is e wrong word to use... "capitalize" would be more appropriate tho in some extreme cases, there is betrayal.<br>i do agree with you when you say that its a good thing to have a desire. In fact, it's e seed of a desire which has driven many pple such as Bill Gates onto e path of success. But in mlm, its not just a desire, but an obsession. Being so obscured in your relentless pursuit of wealth is definintely nt alright.<br>erms... abt that success part... i didn't get to try out long enuff to know... i left soon aft i realised e bad side of it. i'm nt a person who would want to remain in a career that wld gradually lead me to abandon what's important to me, neither wld i embark on something that would cause me to compromise on my character and values, however attractive e offer may sound. Even if i were to succeed, i wld have gained nothing and lost everything.<br>i didn't say ALL of them sucked, i said almost all sucked. there's a diff. And even e straits times agrees with me. i read in an article abt e downsides of network marketing. It stated that network marketing involves capitalizing on your human relationships just to earn money. And lying and cheating r common characteristics found in many of these companies. A vast majority of pple i know who joined e trade and left told me that they were asked by their uplines, on more than one particular occasion, to lie just to achieve their agenda.<br>i admit i was once guilible and dumb enuff to trust these pple just cos they were my friends. i have learnt from my mistake n i'm nv gonna trust these pple again.<br>perhaps i may sound ultra anti mlm in my arguments, but its just to get my point across more effectively. I'm nt really bitter against this trade and frankly, i've forgiven my friends who have introduced me. It's nothing personal. i do not hate e trade, i just dislike and disapprove of it. And what am i so vehemently against mlm? The reason lies in e countless no of lives being destroyed, figuratively speaking, by mlm.<br>hmm... i've watched michael moore's films and i think they r really well documented, highly controversial they may be... but whn was e word unethical used? which film r u talking abt? his first or second? perhaps you can enlighten me in this aspect.</div>

It's pretty informative, v analytical, soaked in satire and sacarsm. OH my gosh?? u mean he's actually pro-communist?? i only tot he was anti-bush, pro-democrat. who's o reilly by e way?? haha... but with e presidential elections just round e corner, he could very well be e next person responsible for a president's downfall.  yea... i dun have a fond impression of him either... i find his seditious documentaries somewhat subversive... but i very well admire his boldness and courage in initiating such a blatant and outright challenge to e bush administration. i wouldn't call that propaganda, cos propaganda is a method used by authoritarian and totalitarian leaders to brainwash pple oppressed by their regimes. So Moore's film is nt propaganda, but rather going against it.</div>

Thats so true.<br></div></blockquote>yes yes... it may sound unbelivable to you... but mlm is a twin effect of e famed reality tv show, survivor, where pple seek to outwit, outplay and outlast in order to inch ahead of e competition. i have always been a staunch believer in e phrase "e obessession of money is e root of all evil", and mlm only strengthens my conviction in it, as the love we have for our fellow mankind can be obscured by e greed for wealth.<br><br>Mayb it's just cos e population is so small here, e mlm market is rather saturated in that sense, which explains e rationale behind marketeers' behaviour. As e competition heats up and e market becomes incompatible with e tiny population, pple tend to become more aggressive in their efforts to stay afloat in the industry. perhaps these pple have been so brainwashed by e company, they do not realise they have ended up capitalising on human relationships in an attempt to get more wealth. it's precisely cos of capitalism and free market economics that a culture of greed prevails over here. By the way, i dun see what's wrong in using these excuses as long as i am able to prove my stand. It's precisely cos these excuses are so significant and<br>valid that they are still used over and over again... because it has always been a major fallacy in mlm and it will continue to be.<br><br>From what i see, you are still under e impression that i'm just a sore loser using this forum as an outlet to vent my hard feelings and frustrations of the industry. As i have said twice over, i have absolutely no hard feelings whatsoever. my primary reason for posting all these threads to to warn pple against e dangers and cons lurking behind this industry, beneath e facade of a brilliant compensation plan. As the generations of e 60s and 70s have took to e streets to protest against Nixon's role in e Vietnam war, and how e Americans are demonstrating against Bush's tough stance against e Iraq fiasco, are of which are negative forms of rebellion, i see this forum is a postitive form of rebellion.<br><br></div>

If you dun believe in the product or you dun think you can do the business, I suggest you don't do it .  If your manager gives u one kinda face when you have no sales or prospects, then he is NOT being professional but hey!

Its just a matter of finding the right company if you are in MLM. Just like in traditional working, you find yourself a company with prospect, gd Boss, gd colleaagues, you will be happy in the environment and a good salary too.<br><br>Network marketing is a method of selling by word of mouth... If you dun believe in the product or you dun think you can do the business, I suggest you don't do it .  If your manager gives u one kinda face when you have no sales or prospects, then he is NOT being professional but hey! Even if you work in sales industry, you did not bring in any new customers or did not manage to sell the company's service, your manager won't be happy too... but professionalism is important even in MLM.<br><br>In MLM, you have to persevere and work hard too... and just like working in any company, you are educated on product knowledge, PR skills etc...

Some are positive and some are negative.<br><br>If it's a good business or product, I am sure your friends will introduce to you but if you dun wish to join, I am sure your friend should understand the meaning of "NO"<br></div></blockquote>i do agree with you when you said that we should find a positive work environment, which is precisely why pple shld stay away from e industry. Bt many network marketeers strike me as arrogant pple, often boasting abt their past successes. well, sad to say, i'm e least impressed. my manager didn't give me a face, but from what i saw, many pple who had no appts were simply ignored. so much so fer being a helpful company concerned with your personal growth. well, they seem more interested in how much r u capable of raking in fer them. And the term "brother" is a term very loosely used to address pple working in e same company, symbolising a close bond shared between them. Bt once that person leaves e company, nobody ever bothers to enquire abt his well-being. Is this what brotherhood is all abt? My manager calls me occasionally, bt loosely concealed under e guise of "how r u doing" pops e pragmatic question "when will you be back?".<br><br>And can mlm really bring in a good salary? in mopinion, E time and effort spent is simply not worth e remuneration. don;t you ever forget - only 2% of mlmers are earning. why, even a person with a psle cert commands a higher salary than 98% of all mlmers! as quoted by one forerunner, why rely on mlm when you have a stable job. i think this is very true.<br><br>do you really believe that if you persevere, you would succeed? What r your basis fer such thoughts? i know of so many pple who have persevered, are persevering and most probably will continue to hang on. I feel so sorry for them, as they have wasted their time and effort in a futile search fer success, simply cos they were made to believe that perseverance is e sole factor to success. What a lie. While it is undeniable that perseverance is essential, what is more important is you finding where your giftings and talents lie and tapping into them. This belief is only as good as it sounds. It is utopian, and if you continue believing in that, you will find yourself harbouring false hopes. So many networkers have a whole lot of potential and talents buried deep beneath them, but because they were made to believe in such a lie, they spent their lives rotting away in a frantic search fer uplines and willing customers.Why is it that out of so many pple who persevered and gave their best, only 2% emerged?<br><br>perhaps history teaches us a lesson or two. MLM to me is like communism, embraced and idealised by many at first, only to collapse shortly aft. MLM in sg is an inherently doomed system cos of e small population that we have here. When Mao Zedong came into power, he appealed to e people's "will" to solve China's burgeoning economic deficit which proved detrimental in e long run. little did he realise that success is nt just attained via sheer willpower, but on a combination of other factors such as abilities and resources. and singapore, being a tiny red dot on e map with only a pop of slightly more than 3 million, cannt provide mlmers with a substantial income. Even such, many of us are still unreceptive and doubtful abt such an industry. It can only be done as a sideline, nt a career.<br><br>MLM is a good way to make money. In china, mlm is such a thriving business that many undergrads are quitting universities just to scramble for a share of e mlm pie. Your uplines make it sound so enticing on paper, with all the talk abt e baby boom. strange that they shld tell you how many baby boomers are there in e world, when your target is only e population in sg. With such intense companies and so many companies in this business, seriously, how much can one mlmer earn? For all that you have learnt in e company abt business, haven't you realised that resources and numbers, rather than perseverance are essential?</div>
