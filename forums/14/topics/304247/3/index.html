              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Conned Business or not, it really depends on how you interpret it.  Be it MLM or any other business, chances of getting conned is there.  It's really up to you to study the business plan &amp; think of it, whether the plan itself is substainable or not.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">Even for myself, my friends have been spreading MLM to me for years already, but I was never keen in them, as those products are either only target at a narrow market or way out of reach for most people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">It's only until recently, I myself decided to enter into this business, as I found one that is more practical &amp; substainable.</span></p>

              <p>Hey .. I just sign up to join a saving program in Gold that works like mlm. Works like a saving bank except this one is in real tangible saving. Gold never loses its value over the long term.</p>
              <p>Doing it more for my saving and posterity since nowadays, inflation is so high and most of our saving are robbed through inflation.</p>
              <p>This program has got to one of the best and one of a kind in the market.</p>
              <p>MLM or not, nowadays everyone needs an additonal source of income.<br>Cannot depends on one salary. Once oil price hit 150 and above, another round of inflation is coming.</p>
              <p>It is based on a saving and not consumption model. Good credible people and leadership. Always conduct webinars.</p>
              <p>Those keen please let me know.</p>

              <p>Hi D-TEG,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not all MLM are bad. There are though but there are some who are sincere and truthfully good.</p>
              <p>I am in a MLM company called CNI. you can check out the website at <a href="http://www.cni.com.sg">www.cni.com.sg</a></p>
              <p>Till date, 19 years in the business, they have produced 55 millionairres. 1 of them is my uncle. I cannot bluff you as this is true and you can always come to his house and see for yourself the house and cars they had give him. I am his downline and we work like share partners. In the era where things are getting more expensive, it is time to make money and MLM are not out there to cheat people's money but too introduce quality products at affordable price so that everyone lives healthily and wealthily.Even though you buy from hypermart out there, they do not accumulate your points and give you bonuses. But CNI do. If you want more information, be glad to share with you. and the membership fee cost only $30 and you get Royal Jelly 1 box free which aims to encourage people to try that as it is anti-cancer and remedy for all sickness and diseases.Especially good!</p>
              <p>On top of that, CNI is the only company in Malaysia that has certificate from Malaysia PM as a genuine business.</p>
              <p>Please browse through their origin website (Malaysia) at <a href="http://www.mycni.com.my">www.mycni.com.my</a>. Btw, the busness is Malaysian Breed and therefore the closest to understand what Asian needs. And you can relate to the items very well.</p>
              <p>Email me at <a href="mailto:vodkavogueberry@hotmail.com">vodkavogueberry@hotmail.com</a> to know more.Will be glad to introduce you more abt the MLM business.</p>

              <p>Hi D-TEG,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not all MLM are bad. There are though but there are some who are
              sincere and truthfully good.</p>
              <p>I am in a MLM company called CNI. you can check out the website
              at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cni.com.sg">www.cni.com.sg</a></p>

              millionairres. 1 of them is my uncle. I cannot bluff you as this is
              true and you can always come to his house and see for yourself the
              house and cars they had give him. I am his downline and we work
              like share partners. In the era where things are getting more
              expensive, it is time to make money and MLM are not out there to
              cheat people's money but too introduce quality products at
              affordable price so that everyone lives healthily and
              wealthily.Even though you buy from hypermart out there, they do not
              accumulate your points and give you bonuses. But CNI do. If you
              want more information, be glad to share with you. and the
              membership fee cost only $30 and you get Royal Jelly 1 box free
              which aims to encourage people to try that as it is anti-cancer and
              remedy for all sickness and diseases.Especially good!</p>
              <p>On top of that, CNI is the only company in Malaysia that
              has certificate from Malaysia PM as a genuine business.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Hi Midlusionz,</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">First, CNI encourages their members to try their products and experience for yourself the goodness of their product (which i exactly did) and when i am impressed with the wonders, without realising, i was promoting to my friends who had similar problems. You see, when u buy e.g. XXX brand outside and finds it good and then you recommend to ur friends, do you get anythg from them? Here in CNI, you earn when you friends buy it. They will obviously ask you where u get it and u will tell them that u will get for them and indirectly, you can promote them to join members under you. You then register for them and order their orders under them. So, their purchases go straight under their name and they earn right from their first purchase. Btw, the membership fee is so affordable at $30 only!</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">For sure, CNI is fair. you see.. Before my uncle becaming a millionairre, he had 6 millionairres downliner. So, it does not mean, u do well, ur upline will automatically gets it. They have to work equally hard. But do not forget, ur uplines are like your supervisor, manager, GM and your CEO above you. You do ur work the most, ur upper mgmt delegate jobs to their subordinate. You worked hard, they only plan and see the big picture. They work less but earn more than you. Its almost the same as MLM. The downline works and the uplines earn. What they earn is only a minor percentage of your sales. What they do (after reach a certain level) is to manage their downlines. They will have to do regular meeting and ensure that all their downlines succeed together. They CANNOT succeed either if their downline dont. So, it's a fair scheme where all will move up together. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I always held home party to invite friends over. My uncle will come and do the products demo to open the eyes of the people that the products they r using outside are not as quality as ours. Our products are quality and affordable (coz its in Msian Ringgit - labor and rent cheaper). But no worries, all of our products are GMP and HACCP certified. And on top of that, our products are insurred RM1 million for consumers to claim if they experience otherwise when using our products. (Coz its proven excellent). </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Our products in total are abt 300 items and counting more. We are encouraging people to change brand to a more quality one. Everyone is a user. They buy shampoo, detergents, toothpaste and etc from XXXX mart. Do you get bonuses for what u spent (Abt 18%)? Nope. But here you get. And your points accumulate! Means, if Aug and Sep you spent 400 pts each but Oct you dont and Nov you spent 200 pts. On 1 dec, you already accumulate 1000pts and you are already a bronze dealer and you get bonuses. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Where can you find an MLM that has accumulated pts? Dat is why, CNI can produce 55 Diamond millionairres in JB and Spore. On top of that, there are abt 200 members at Diamond level which is pnly one level down from Diamond Millionairre. Means, by 2010, there will be more than 250 millionairres in just 20 years of operations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">CNI is also very relevant, all members are invited to their birthday bash which is held in Stadium Putrajaya, KL. There, you will be gathered and meet with over 600,000 dealers in Asia. (BTW, CNI has ventured to HK, America, Asia and many more)</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">So, the choice is in your hand. BTW, CNI is la isted company in Bursa Saham. (Shares in Msia terms, like STI) Their annual profit is abt 50 million per year. So, you can rest assured that the company is strong. Not only that, yearly, they will donate an amount to society. They also will set aside education fund for your kids to apply. And there are only 10 levels to be a millionairre. Once you reach the 6th step, you will earn your first car. At the 5th step, you will earn a 5 days 4 night trip to indonesia. All for free. You will get a house and 3 cars upon being a Diamond Millionairre.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">And I have seen all this coz in the meeting, that is open to all. You will sit in a room with CNI millionairres and executive levels. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Where can you get to mingle with CEO or owner of your working company? Here, we are fair. We dont care if you a doctor or lawyer outside. Right here, everyone starts from 0. You climb your way up. And let me tell you this. On average, it takes 7 years for a person to get to the millionairre stage if they work hard and commit on a part-time basis. Can you be a millionairre within 7 years working outside?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I will not explain more than this unless you are really interested to give this a try. Common, you suffer 2-3 years, but enjoy for the next rest of ur life. But i must admit, not everyones eyes will open to accept MLM. Can you imagine, if everyone joins CNI, who will be poor? who will be cleaning the trash? But that's not the point. CNI is open to all. Up to u to judge and analyze the concept. As long as you are a positive minded. You will join due to the benefits and the chance they provide for u to become an entrepreneur with very minimal risk (of $30 sign up free which u will get $35 worth of Royal Jelly products) So, u risk nothing actually! But you get healthier life! For sure.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">What i normally do, with a downline of about 10 people and their own downlines.. I will come and do products demo for them for free. They just need to gather guests to their place. I'll come and do demo and the people who came to purchase items or join members will be under them. I earn nothing upfront but only through commission of MLM system. So, its fair! Lastly, CNI only gives commission up to 7 generations. Beyond that, you do not get anythg. So pls, dont tarnish your mind set bcoz of other failed MLMs. Not all are the same.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you open ur eyes big enough, MLM do not use any marketing plan. We market their products. That is why they can afford to give huge sum of commission. You dont see that, sadly. Have you ever seen a MLM company advertising in TV, radio and etc? There might be some MLMs but definitely not CNI.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Again, it's up to you.. If really CNI has marketing plan, I would not even want to tell you here. Coz, read the rules! No advertising.. Marketing and advertising is related.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, not everyone can understand MLM. Can u imagine everyone succeed in MLM.. who will do the normal jobs like admin, waitress and etc?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This also shows that you are a negative-minded individual, bcoz of 1 failed path, u shun all other possible path. :(( Well, it's ur judgement. I wont force nor judge you. But to be succeed, you need to fail a lot of times. I failed in Amway, Avon, SKL, WBG but I didnt give up. Bcoz, rooted in me. I noe MLM is good. So far.. CNI is the longest I have stayed and have climbed upwards. For the others, I have not climb any stair up yet. Maybe.. CNI are affordable and really do wonders! ;))</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another thing, you should not hate Bel'airians as they are in this business to earn money like everyone else. If you hate them, it is the same as you hate thousands of brands in Shop n Save, Sheng Siong and etc. Its the same, your friends are like promoters in this hypermart, trying to promote you good and quality products to improve your standard of life. But, with a bonus point.. U get to earns points for every thg you buy. Sooner or later.. points accumulate and you will promote to friends the wonders you gain and u get cars and house.. In those hypermart.. Imagine for 20 yrs u be loyal to them, what can they give besides rebate, discounts and free items? Can they give u chance to retire early? Car or house? *wink* What else referral points for saying good word of mouth to ur neighbours or friends.. So, think for a moment..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I respect your opinion and I would not go further than this. I believe, everyone has their own opinion. But I hope, not limit to MLM.. But if you ever fail once in life, do not make it a statement to stop trying. God's Willing, one day with your determinaton.. You will make it far! :))</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, thanks for sharing and nice knowing you. :))</p>

              <p>Ever wonder why ppl are so negative about MLM? Anyway do u know what's the real meaning of MLM? In the states MLM really do work because of the population over there ..</p>
              <p>Tell me how sure r u that your company will hit into the oversea market with the products u guys got .. What's so special about the products? I am not diss-ing the products ya .. To  be a successful  company  .. U gotta have a unique marketing plan (Not the normal kind ya, if u get wat i mean.. MLM is not about just selling products like salesman and get comission or w/e out of it ..) and a unique product which other ppl do not have .. Judging from the products the webby u provide.. I dunno how special is it. </p>
              <p>And yes, i know a person who have MLM network in phillipines, thailand and malaysia he earn alot each month and when he quit i ask him why is he doing this .. He said the market has already grow small so ya.</p>

              <p>At the end of the day, if u join MLM companies, u risk losing your friends. Because there haf been cases where they keep bothering their friends about the MLM products until they are fed up.</p>
              <p>U can be successful. But only a few make it. A good friend of mine who has real experience in MLM says "Only 5 out of 100 make it to the top".</p>
              <p>My friend eventually stopped working in the MLM industry and he changed job. Bear in mind he is not your average MLM person. His income has hit thousands b4.</p>
              <p>Conclusion - u can join, but if u wanna join, u must have the drive to be the best, if not, just look elsewhere for money.</p>
