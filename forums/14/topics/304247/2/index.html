In the ended he ended up nowhere(no friends joining) and till now he is damn embarrass whenever we talk about the MLM issue, because I have asked him not to join in the 1st place and he choose to believe his friends in joining.

              <p>After so many comments, i am happy to say that if i ask
              logically, people here will reply me nicely. Less Sunshine threads,
              i suppose they are public enemies be it in or out of the
              industry.<br> Anyone can enlighten me if joining MLM is going to end me up lonely
              and friends and family will leave me, choking up debts. Is it the

              <p>Thanks for the concern, i will really consider it carefully. I am just wondering MLM will leave you no friends? But i still in contact with them no matter what they do. At least i won't avoid them. Because i felt that if my friends wants to open Chicken Rice stall ask me to invest and then i say no money or not interested and he opens the stall himself or with other people, i must avoid him or hate him because he got business for me but i did not believe? Or i will never ever to buy Chicken Rice from him? I just puzzled. My friends in MLM still but we still coffee and drinking. Sorry if i offend anyone with my words.</p>

              <p><br>i give you one example.</p>
              <p>if ur fren sell chicken rice the normal way, you would hav probably just spread it by the word of mouth, asking other frenz to come support and eat. but if ur other fren who thinks it is nt nice (personal preferences), dey he or she may not come back again and dats all.</p>
              <p>if ur fren sell chicken rice the MLM way, well, you may probably need to "pay" a "membership" fee to join. with high cost of membership, maybe u will go all out to promote the chicken rice because for every member u get, u earn commission, somemore when ur downline also can do work one, u also earn money. so it goes on...HOWEVER, if the chicken rice sux to the core(even if it is nice, some pple may nt find it nice), you will not tell other pple dat it sux (because you have paid a membership fee, and u wan to earn it back), so maybe u will start to lie and con other pple into buying your chicken rice. so when pple (ur frenz) feel conned into joining the membership, dey will wan their money back and refunds.</p>
              <p>Dats the crux of the problem, if your fren sell chicken rice the normal way, if others think it is nt nice, dey will just nt come again and dats all. if your fren sell chicken rice the MLM way (after being enticed to join the membership), some pple, after joining and felt conned, will find ways and means to get their membership fees back. Who will wan to pay for something dat dey do not like and hates? in the process of getting back, frenship will hurt because each refund means ur fren, the boss, will hav lesser capital to buy chicken to cook chicken rice AND (I STRESS THIS) pay out the commission for the network~</p>
              <p>Chicken rice, nice or nt, just eat u noe. but those wad magnetic product la, blah blah blah, u will nt usually noe it immediately. so dats where MLM's most crucial part is. From wad i heard and wad i noe, if u really wan to be in MLM, be prepared to be ruthless and nvr be soft hearted till the day u decided to get away.</p>

              <p>as we all know...there are many bad and good, cheap and expensive chicken rice MLM(s) in the market...I believed that there surely you can find some nice, reasonable and affordable one. </p>
              <p>example...if you bought a full basket of egg, we can't just simply will throw away the whole basket, criticised it just becoz of one bad egg in side the basket?</p>
              <p>anyway, just for your info...it's refundable (within 60days) for both membership and products if you are not satify. this is just to share my experience and view for those who are keen, looking into MLM biz...nothing else.</p>
              <p>However, I would suggest...pls...pls do some study, market research, talk to your friend, your love one or somebody who in this MLM(s) market etc before you intend to take up the membership to avoid any sad memory.</p>

For me, I have experiences in one of the so called "MLM" company listed on the main page. I can say that I learn alot of things down there because they have a educational program that actually teaches you how to be a leader in the biz world and my company is not doing it in an MLM way.</p></div>

              <p><br>Hi D-TEG,</p>
              <p>I have tried a MLM company before, last time when I recruited someone to join under me, I do not feel happy, coz I myself do not have confident at the company, the product and the marketing plan, that time I was 'greedy' and just wanna make money..with such attitude, of course I failed :(</p>
              <p>The one that I am now working with for the past 1.5 years, I am enjoying the product, enjoying the part time income. Sometimes, even though I couldn't recruit people under me, I am still happy coz I am making profit thru retailing. My viewpoint of MLM has changed dramatically from before.</p>
              <p>Saying all these is not to 'attract' you to join me, just wanna share that MLM DOES work as long as the company and the product are good and you are willing to put in hard work and strive for it.</p>
              <p>If you wanna know more, feel free to call me at 97530458.</p>
              <p>You are such a humble and teachable guy, you can be successful in whatever business you do.</p>
