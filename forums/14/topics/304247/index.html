I have a friend who says that MLM is just a business with a different concept, i wonder how true and how acceptable it is here in Singapore, apparently i suppose the feedbacks are negative.<br>Laurence, you said some companies, to your knowledge who are those people selling cheapo stuffs at exorbitant price so that i can avoid those.<br>In your statement that i quoted i also realise that there might be some good ones also, you surely seem like a old timer in this industry from the post i read from you.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by redstone:</div><div class="quote_body">In MLM, the desperation can drive one to do all sorts of desperate things, like mass msging people on friendster, myspace, etc. Or to give them false hopes to 'retire early', etc. It's like saying.... I buy toto, i strike $1000 first time. I see people striking 10K, or better yet $15M, and I become a professional Toto buyer? The notion is that the probability of success is low, given the current image and reputation of MLM. Money? At the cost of ethics, friends (trust me, you're going to make tons of people hate u), and 'face'? </div></blockquote>Hm. Good point and thanks i learned something. But the rate of 4D or TOTO is beyond control logically. As for what i heard in MLM is the probability of success depends on you, and being pioneer is important. But how many are pioneer company? Some will still claim they are pioneer after 5 yrs. So thats where i am puzzled. I heard that World Direct Congress Group or what crap is coming to Singapore to elevate the mentality of people here about MLM. Will there be an impact because if it does i would want to be on the train, i heard its going to be as big as IMF in 2006.<br>Any comments? Don't mind me asking rubbish as i really want to learn something from the old timers here.</div>
