              What I can say is that none of these companies are doing money game, so they are pretty legal more or less. It's very hard for anyone to tell you which one is the best because that person has to went to all these companies (also he has the knowledge to judge), is currently not in any of them (or else he will be biased towards his company) and is not anti mlm (or else he will give the type of answer 4justice gives) The best is for you to go to these companies to find out more yourself. It's a bit of time consuming but it's worthed it as it's a long term thing for you.
                  
              One advice- don't decide before you went to all the compaines. Some will try to brainwash you not to go to other companies for being fear that you will be more attracted to others' plan. But if they are really that good, they should not be afraid. Find out as much as you can from as many and different sources as possible before making your decision.

              <p>such methods are not recommended for a rookie like you when u don't even know the very basic...</p>
              <p>don't try such shortcut methods..when u learn and understand more about it first..than you'll take the shortcut..</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">hint: newspapers reports of scams related will be helpful for your ONLY IF you can related it to MLM and the type of people..</span></p>
              <p>Note: From my personal point of view..if you want to be successful..</p>
              <p>There are at least a few things which you need to know it yourself first even before you attempt to join or listen to any company's presentation speech..</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Those who don't know why they are doing it for will not succeed..</span></strong></p>
              <p>That's the main tip which I can give you.</p>
              <p>Last and foremost..Don't believe what those presenters personally promise you..See and observe with your own eyes..If nessary..test them yourself..</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">In Short Summary:</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) Know yourself inside out.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) Know what you need.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) Know what you want.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Figure out these 3 points first before considering any MLM companies..</p>
              <p>Don't waste your time and money in MLM companies if you don't understand what I mean..</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">ask your friends who are in such companies to let you make an appt to talk to their superiors/leaders about choosing a company..</span></strong></p>
