I am no one now.... MLM althought I lost some money.. from it.. I was responsible to say...

            <div class='col-md body'>Not just that. Theres a whole world of mlm business out there. Do you know that even legal business is mlm'ed in the United States? Not just software my fren... The trouble with Singapore is that its too slow in acceptance of new business channels.<br><br>DO you know that mlm is most successful in Japan and Korea? This is because their culture allows them for very effective communication and trust between neighbours and families. Within a year, 25 year olds who started Amway in Japan, are at diamond lvl, driving posh cars etc etc.</div>

I'd buy a non-MLM pdt any day, as long as it's value-for-money, unlike lotsa MLM products. Remember, there's no free lunch in this world. Earning loads of money in MLM means that somebody have to pay for these services, where i still don't see any products that's really solid and best in the industry such that it deserves to be sold at a premium.

Third, people join in less because they like the product nor have a good impression of the products, but more because they just want to make money - loads of it. Fourth, even if the products are very very solid, almost all the companies do not have a cap on the number of people allowed to join, ultimately resulting in fierce competition among networkers for business of the same products since there are so many of them and thus, their individual income as a whole is still very limited. Fifth, there's a great sense of aversion to MLM'ers among the general public due to very inethical sales tactics and highly questionable promises. If a great no. of people have a negative towards you, the odds of making a good buck are against you, since your potential gains ultimately depends on the decisions of the general public.<br><br>The general health of MLM companies remains to be vague and very much mysterious, since almost all of them are not listed in the stock exchange.

Again, as i emphasised many times, in the business world today, size and revenue are not the main measures of good business. Profitability measure against industry and quality of services and products, plus cost efficiency are the mainstay. It is always ridiculous to see people measuring large, non focused companies like Wal Mart, against companies with focus on specialised products and niche market, or to be correct, on few markets, such as Microsoft, Amway and other such companies. Do you know in Singapore alone, many companies are changing focus on mass market to quality service, products and niche market. I can tell you heck a lot about companies such as Pestbusters who goddamned compromise their profits in exchange for quality and training. Such ranking of size of companies can only make their way to magazines such as Times, rather than serious business journals such as Harvard Business Reviews. Companies are asking for troubles by having narrow minded vision of targetting just size and revenue.<br><br><blockquote>Yes, some people do make money in MLM, but how much?

So far, none could provide legitimate statistics on how the MLM industry is doing. I seen many people only pick a handful out of the possible few hundred direct selling companies in SG and make a judgement. Heck, in last year Straits Times, they admitted they couldnt even get the right estimates of people working in this industry. And, like the Coke theory, everyone guess the cost of these products. Unless the stats come straight out the company, how can you be sure these industry observers are absolutely right?<br><br>Something worth heckling about your comments on products sold at premium. While some argue costs are lowered by elimination of marketing intermediaries, others are also right to say its being raised to cover the commissions due to these distributors. Seriously, any businessmen wouldnt care whether its right or wrong to set prices at preimum, but rather, whether these premium prices suits market demand, Again, these are the fundamental flaws of price costing, than the marketing channel which is MLM. Its basic business laws that boss should match their prices to achive demand, and keep the company going. I wonder how can anyone attribute this breaking of fundamental rule solely to MLM? This is hillarious....<br><br><blockquote>The 'MLM is the next wave' hype just reminds me of the dot.com boom and ultimately very fvcked bust.

No way!</blockquote>Yes, this is true, which actually contradicts your first few points. Until someone make a thorough observation of the whole industry, I would never speculate on these few aspects you touch on, whether its good or bad. Thats why I make my judgement or arguments solely on specific or individual companies, than making a generalisation of the whole industry as you have done.<br><br><blockquote>At the end of the day, business success cannot run away from these fundamental factors - desirable products at a desirable price, good marketing(MLM may come into this, but it's subjective), good accessibility, and ability to keep costs low. Forget these, and you can forget about everything else.</blockquote>This whole paragraph is damn true, but it sticks out sore thumb when someone read through your whole post.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know how MLM works but as a consumer, I can tell you that its products are OVERPRICED.  I bought these products just to "patronise" my friends and relative.  I don't need to pay for costly anti-aging creams when I can get Estee Lauder, Lancome, etc. from the cosmetic counter.  My colleague sold me a box of pregnancy vitamin at $130+ but my gynae advised me not to take as I am already taking her recommended pregnancy vitamins at only $30+ - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same ingredients</span>.  Two bottles of aromatherapy I brought home gave me allergies and I threw them all away.  Then, I was invited to a seminar about skin problems by a professor.  As I stepped into the hall, the members were singing, clapping and with music playing very loudly.  I was shocked!  It reminds me of the cult church that I had attended in my younger days.  Also, why do you need the "professor" to explain the epidermis and structure/layers of the human skin when it is common knowledge? Isn't it questionable that a "professor" is standing on the stage to explain and encourage its members to sell their products?  Shouldn't a professor be doing research??  Some product is marketed and labelled to look like it is from U.S. or France but in fact from Taiwan!  One day, I gave a dressing down to my friend who brought an MLM sales person to my home!  Trying to sell many products from his catalogue, one of them is the "purified water" that uses special equipment and certified at a cost of thousand+, instalment avail too.  The benefits?  "purified water" for health.  I see no harm with drinking boiled water from our tap water resource.  At least we get hydrated!  How can you justify the cost of that?  Of course, after that there usually is some demo to convince you, like testing the different water from tap, boiled water and their own purified water.   It is the same with my relative who try to sell me a special washing detergent.  Then there was this herbal vitamin that costs a bomb - the ingredients you can find from fresh food!!  Because he is selling based on information from the files and folders, it really tells you how far this person know about the product (textbook!).  Because of me and my child's allergy problems, I am always researching, and even scrunitizing every ingredient that may not be suitable for us.  My advice?  Buy MLM products IF you can Afford it, or NEED it to SAVE your life!  Or unless you are patronizing your friends like me!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Not so. Again, as i emphasised many times, in the business world today, size and revenue are not the main measures of good business. Profitability measure against industry and quality of services and products, plus cost efficiency are the mainstay. It is always ridiculous to see people measuring large, non focused companies like Wal Mart, against companies with focus on specialised products and niche market, or to be correct, on few markets, such as Microsoft, Amway and other such companies. Do you know in Singapore alone, many companies are changing focus on mass market to quality service, products and niche market. I can tell you heck a lot about companies such as Pestbusters who goddamned compromise their profits in exchange for quality and training. Such ranking of size of companies can only make their way to magazines such as Times, rather than serious business journals such as Harvard Business Reviews. Companies are asking for troubles by having narrow minded vision of targetting just size and revenue. </blockquote>I did not really comment on the quality of the business with regards to the paragraph in question. And since when did i say that size and revenue = good business? However, Wal-Mart is still indeed a good, efficient and highly profitable business anyway. If I ever mention Wal-Mart(which I did), it is always because of its very efficiency and ability to keep costs low and hence passing the benefits to the consumers, beating the competition, while still remaining highly profitable. The message I was sending was to bust those in MLM'ers who hype a lot about how you could be the next billionaire in MLM, giving unrealistic expectations. Joining MLM is not the only way, nor proven to be the most effective way, to be rich and successful.<br><br><blockquote>Again, its your observations. So far, none could provide legitimate statistics on how the MLM industry is doing. I seen many people only pick a handful out of the possible few hundred direct selling companies in SG and make a judgement. Heck, in last year Straits Times, they admitted they couldnt even get the right estimates of people working in this industry. And, like the Coke theory, everyone guess the cost of these products. Unless the stats come straight out the company, how can you be sure these industry observers are absolutely right?<br><br>Something worth heckling about your comments on products sold at premium. While some argue costs are lowered by elimination of marketing intermediaries, others are also right to say its being raised to cover the commissions due to these distributors. Seriously, any businessmen wouldnt care whether its right or wrong to set prices at preimum, but rather, whether these premium prices suits market demand, Again, these are the fundamental flaws of price costing, than the marketing channel which is MLM. Its basic business laws that boss should match their prices to achive demand, and keep the company going. I wonder how can anyone attribute this breaking of fundamental rule solely to MLM? This is hillarious.... </blockquote>Read the word 'if'. I did not say definitely that MLM is inefficient.  What I meant is t hat selling through the alternaltive MLM should be made efficient, esp against traditional methods, for it to be really viable.  The demand of course is dependent on quality(which the QC and management involved is responsible; nothing to do with whether it's MLM or not), desirability(this come into market research; MLM or not does not matter in the research) and marketing n sales tactics involved. The maim aims of selling thru MLM are to provide a better and more personalised service(depends on the product; certain commodities such as toothpaste, household items, vitamins, etc, do not really need such a service) and to better the cost-effectiveness(don't you think this is an advantage has an effect on price? Price competitiveness is essential too in many fields of business)) of the promotion and distribution of the same products via the traditional way. If the MLM firm do not meet such requirements, MLM itself could be redundant, and may be non-viable. And of course, MLM is not necessarily more efficient when compared with traditional methods.<br><br>It's also true that many MLM companies manage to sell overpriced products(and hence what i call 'premium') because of pushy sales tactics, fabrication of lies about their products and the fact that it comes together with the signing up because its many promises. A lot of people I know involved were not willing customers, or that they found out they were cheated after buying the products. Obviously, there are indeed too many bad eggs in the industry. I am also more wary than I usually do when it comes to MLMs, because of so many such cases.<br><br><blockquote>Again, this paragraph clearly shows your perceptions</blockquote>I was specically referring to most people who join MLMs due to peer pressure and hype they promise, without any real understanding of the business and structure of the companies involved. I do admit that I went too far and quite off the line when I said that it's 'fundamentally flawed' though; I was making a sweeping statement on the whole industry. I retract this statement, and apologise for any misunderstandings and distortions made.<br><br>I do admit that my writing skills are not that good and often awkward. Again, I apologise if anyone has misunderstood any of what I have written due to my deficiencies in my writings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway, laurence, I was googling for sites mentioning 'NTI' and got my way here. You confirmed my doubts on NTI after reading your posts, among other good ones also. That's why I'm here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, MLM to me is just another way of doing sales and marketing within a company. Certain things essential - method of prodution, quality control, research and developement, etc - don't change and are independent of whether the coy is MLM or not.</div>
