Do you guys think selling skincare and grooming stars could bring you much much more than the 7 million they pump in? Is it feasible to pump in 7 million dolars in such companies?<br><br>of course that example is only given by one manager, if you take the rest in concern.. imagine how much money is pumped in to support this ploy. it is impossible to sustain their bussiness in respect to the ammount of money pumped in. <br><br>i guess this is another hit and run scam after all</p></div>

              <p>Profits? Oh please.. they make me laugh.</p>
              <p>Emcom. First they say want to build wireless network in singapore, so enthusiastically recruiting ppl based on this, then later? Vanish... Later say want to build wireless project in Taichung. Then? Vanish too.</p>
              <p>EPV... Malacca resort project. Design changed at least 3 times, after it's been sold. Empire state tower in KL, abductboy and others had already proven that the nothing can be built on the site.</p>
              <p>Emcall... the callback thing is very unreliable and inconvinient. I would rather call directly on a regular telecom.</p>
              <p>And I wonder what happened to Emall/Emwealth which indirectly claim sales of more than few hundred millions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no comment for the others because I havent read/heard of them before.</p>

              <p>During the Sunshine Empire 1st Anniversary Celebration (the final and only one) held in Genting Highlands in 2007, James Phang and Jackie Hoo was being held up in detention and assisting in investigation by the Commercials Affairs Department [CAD] of Singapore. Their passports were held by the police and could not escape.</p>
              <p>David Phang (brother of James Phang and accomplice) announced in the Sunshine Empire Concert (held in "Arena of Stars", Genting Highlands) that he was busy in Singapore as his mother was sick and resting in hospotal.</p>
              <p><strong>This is a lie, publicity stunt and cover-up.</strong></p>
              <p>The instructions from Jackie Hoo to all BRMs such as Lee Yong Chew (Fake Name used to scam people = Ken Lee), Rick, Yuan Jie (David), Mei Qi, Alex Au etc, was to safeguard this information of James Phang being locked up by the police.</p>
              <p>Top priority was to ensure confidence of GP investors in the Taipei and TaiChung Wireless project (now both proven to be non-existent) and not to upset the Sunshine Empire Agents outside of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The secondary priority was to shift attention of CAD, MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) to investigate other MLM companies such as EnYouth, Long Far and CosLab. Jackie's rationale was EnYouth was most similar to NTI; LongFar and Coslab's products and marketing plans was most similar to Sunshine Empire's unauthorised and unregulated investment schemes (Gold Prime, Silver Prime, Bronze Prime, EmPin). Agents were told to call CAD, MediaCorp to report the alleged crimes of these companies.</p>
              <p>This was also the time that the internationl GP or EmPin was formulated to save Sunshine Empire Singapore. (Later on, EmPin's pay out proved to be worst than any other GP, SP or BP. Now EmPin is a defunct product and investors are still waiting for a refund)</p>
              <p>One month later, James Phang's mother really died. Agents, Managers, Downlines were all expected to attend the wake and funeral to prove their loyalty to James Phang and <strong>attendance was taken</strong>. It is a EGA tradition to make even a wake/funeral to be a business related function. Small division meeting were even held during the wake to boost sales in order to compensate James Phang's lost.</p>

              <p>Serves him right... its scary how people still believe in someone with a track record of failed projects owing investors hundreds of millions.</p>
              <p>I always hear SE ppl say "who never fail before". This is not a case of if ppl fail before, its a case of someone deliberately scamming people. Proven track record of excuses. Force ppl to go funeral? Most pro...really cult. May someone else die too.</p>
              <p>Best thing? Say emmax "is doing very well", somemore have money to start entertainment business, conventions, etc... but no money to return people?</p>
              <p>Observer, I had started numerous threads at Hardwarezone forums. Maybe you could post there too.</p>

              <p>In 2007, SE people liked to go YouTube to search 'Sunshine
                                  Empire' to show clients those scam videos of 'Danshui', "wireless
                                  taiwan" and even a fake Ma Ying Jiu letter. You search 'EmMax, NOP,
                                  NTI, Sunshine' on YouTube, you see the truth on YouTube. You even
                                  get to see the MTV that Jackie Hoo made to brainwash teenagers back
                                  in NTI...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHlBa29E1Z8</p>
              <p>Sabrina (JAC) made this video for Daniel Tan (JAC) and Ken Lee
                                  Yong Chew (JAB) to brainwash the younger agents. More to come. Still searching for that
                                  elusive 'Car Achiever' video. Will also upload James Phang MP3
                                  quality audio training. His speeches used in various talks have
                                  been unchanged since the 90s in NOP, NTI, SE, EmMax. Always playing
                                  the same old tune. You will be amazed at his brainwashing tactics.
                                  e.g. using a BDM, Miss Yinzi's singing and young children to sing about
                                  'fillial piety' and 'family'; to preach that you must scam a lot of money to
                                  be a worthy person to face your parents. Destructive values.</p>
              <p>Will not want to comment on James Phang mother's death. I do
                                  believe in karma. James Phang's dauther, I pity her though.</p>
              <p><strong>Sabrina, wake up please.</strong> You don't have to be
                                  loyal to James Phang to be a fillial daugther. Your belief system
                                  is corrupted by too much 'blind motivation' by your upline, Daniel
                                  Tan, who he himself is brainwashed by Jackie Hoo and James Phang.
                                  And your BRM, <strong>'Ken' Lee Yong Chew (NRIC: 8040039Z), is a
                                  psychopath with records in IMH (Institute of Mental Health) for

                                  Disorder and early Psychosis; imprisoned for 2 years in Queenstown
                                  remand for an unknown crime and have also been charged in court
                                  twice for drunk driving.</strong> Ask the man himself. Ask Joanne
                                  See Hui Jing (ex-finance), what kind of character does Ken Lee Yong
                                  Chew has? Even better, ask his mother and sister. Your BRM used up
                                  the money he gets from clients for EmMax plans for prostitution and
                                  Gambling in genting casinos. Just ask his most loyal lackeys who
                                  finally seen his true colours and left Sunshine Empire. Ng Chun
                                  Kiat, Stanley, Alan, Alex... etc etc. You can even ask Meiqi and
                                  Ming Jie, old two-headed lackeys who still wants to scam people from EmMax to
                                  join their Palm Tree Seeds scam in Malaysia.</p>
