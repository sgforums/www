            <div class='col-md body'>The "side effect" is due to the cleansing process in the body by the product.  Most of us have toxins and some medications stored in our body, eg. panadol for headaches, sleeping pills, and slimming pills.<br><br>The product is all about Cellular Nutrition, not just multivitamins, proteins and minerals.  Cellular Nutrition gives nutrition to each and every cells in the body so that the existing cells will be able to produce and multiply healthy new cells.  In order to achieve that, the C.N will clean the body's cells.  People who has past history of taking medication or even slimming products like Extrim or Xando, will experience extreme discomfort during the detoxification period, which will only last for a few days.  After that, the product can fully work on the person's body.<br><br>The CN will also clean a person's villi's in the body, so that he/she could absorb good nutrition better.<br><br><img src="http://academic.pgcc.edu/~aimholtz/AandP/206_ONLINE/Digest/Images/villi.jpg"><br><br>In your small intestine, there are finger like protrusions called villi.  If you look it up in the dictionary, itÂ’s under Â“villus.Â”  When the villi are damaged, your small intestine does not aborb nutrients.  Your appetite increases. You crave fats and sugars because they are the easiest substances for your body to absorb.  You become fatigued because your body is not getting the proper nutrition.  Your body starts to think itÂ’s starving.  When your body thinks itÂ’s starving, it starts storing fat instead of buring fat!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about the "side effect"....<br>If the product doesn't give any of such effect, there are three possibilies :<br>1) You are perfectly healthy all your life.  You have not taken any medication in your whole life.<br><br>2) The chemical in your body has already been purged out.<br><br>3) The product is not detoxifying your body.  No cleansing of chemicals and harmful stuff stored in your body.  So the product might not be even working on you.<br><br>I learnt about the no. 3 ten years ago when my friend was taking pure Barley Grass drink to replace her meals (I'm not sure whether that's the correct way of taking the product actually).  That time, barley grass wasn't so common in Singapore.  We didn't see so many stores selling that.  It was only available, when first launched, at some shops selling vegetarian food and supplement.<br><br>She said she wants to detox her body because she wants to switch to vegan.   For a few days, she was experience diarrhea or something.   She said this is a healthy sign as her body was going thru changes for the better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok.  I shall post the article here... courtesy of JWorld.<br><br><strong>Why Is It So Hard To Lose Weight?</strong><br>Have you ever wondered why the older you get, the harder it is to maintain your weight, let alone<br>lose it?<br><br>There are people that work out everyday for an hour a day and eat low fat foods, and they still canÂ’t get those extra ten pounds off.  As they get older, they notice that their cravings for fats and sweets increase.  They get more illnesses.  They have more physical problems.  TheyÂ’re tired all the time.<br><br><strong>Is There A Solution?</strong><br>In your small intestine, there are finger like protrusions called villi.  If you look it up in the dictionary, itÂ’s under Â“villus.Â”  It is through these villi that abosorption of nutirients from your food takes place.  Through the years, your villi get damaged and break off.  Things that damage your villi are:<br>*stress  *alcohol  *additives<br>*airborne  *toxins like exhaust fumes *medications *smoking *fat *preservatives *drugs *salt<br><br>As your villi continue to become damaged, it becomes increasingly difficult for your body to absorb nutrients.<br><br><strong>So what happens when your body is not absorbing the nutrients out of the food?</strong><br>First of all, you start needing more food Â– your appetite increases as do your cravings -  because your body needs more nutrients.  You also start to crave fats and sugars because they are the easiest substances for your body to absorb.<br><br>You become fatigued when your body is not getting the proper nutrition.  When your villi are not healthy, your body thinks its starving and stores instead of burns your fat.  You may be saying, Â“Well, I eat really healthy and I eat low fat food and natural foods and I take vitamins.Â”  Some of you may even be working out at the gym.  Even though you may be doing all these things, you can still be experiencing the symptoms I just described.  The underlying problem is most likely absorption.  No matter how much good food and vitamins you take in, if your body is not absorbing them, then itÂ’s a total waste.<br><br><strong>Weight Control from The Inside Out</strong><br>To get your weight off and to keep it off you need to feed your body on a cellular level.  Your body can then repair and rebuild the villi to the healthy state it was in when you were younger.<br></div>
