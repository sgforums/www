            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, the so called side effects is actually referring to the cleansing process.<br>You must give your body time to adapt to the process and drinking at least 8 glasses of water or more or whenever you could will help in the process as it helps in removing the toxins from your body. Even if u are not on any products drinking water has to be a norm for all of us to cleanse our system. Herbalfe goes further not only in cleansing but also helping your cells for maximum absorbtion of nutrients to help your body function more efficiently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Incase u guys wondering HBL product works or not. well it works for me very well.<br><br>2003 dec - i  weight at 100kgs in 10months i totally lose 25kgs, all the symptom i went through before - giddy, conspitation, infact i also have knee pain due to my gaut issues, initially thought due to the shake which is soy protein ( as gout ppl cant eat soy bean products ) but now totally gone.<br><br>So if it doesnt work, just very simple reason - cheating and dont forget we today overweight or underweight is not overnight problems , it was accumulated frm yrs. so if it takes a yr or 2 to reach a desire weight is worth it. I almost give up, but each time i see those testimonial , i tell myself if they can do it, so can i.<br><br>by the way shapework will be launching. so i will lose and shape up some more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>herbalife change my life.<br><br>want to kwn more how i do it, just ask me, here.<br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
