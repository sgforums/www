            <div class='col-md body'>Good for you guys if you all choose to believe that guy who many said to be believe to have betrayed his coy.<br><br>In the first place, leaving Venture Era to start on another coy is not actually wrong. I am ok with that, since the boss of VE also ventured out himself earlier on. But the thing that is hardest to accept is as follows:<br><br>1. healthwise was not started after he left VE. It was already there for quite a few months after he left. Nothing much to say, but if you all understand wat it implies....<br><br>2. It just does not seem right when you leave you try and try to recruit all the topman from VE (which in the end only 2 left with him) when you are leaving for another coy.<br><br>3. Spread all sorts of rumours none-stop after he left. Making those 2 person that left with him continously harressing those in VE that some pple has already joined them but in fact those pple din even know all these were happening.<br><br>I must say that this guy is really very smart. He is extremely good with words and tatical speaking.<br><br>Just a quote for those who believe him.<br><br>"Never follow a dog that once bit his master"</div>

We have heard it in the forum umpteen times about whether a coy is good or bad. In fact, eventually its nothing much to do with the coy but just some pple there.... Its true that those so called ISO or watever coy cant cheat you but that doesnt mean those pple there wun have a way to blur you..... Being brainwashed is not a form of con..... in fact no one actually threaten or forced you with a gun to do those stuff.... you were just made to believe that its correct and stuff.... But then again, I am not on the negative side on MLM, in fact I'm slightly inclined to the positive side of it. Its really a good learning ground to polish yourself up but you have to follow the right person. Someone you can trust with.... else, your there to suffer.... getting poorer by the day... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>Singapore MLM cannot make it one lah...
