Thats why I frown upon bosses having companies or sub-companies, especially in MLM. History has never shown any to be successful, plus many are usually scams. They are profiting more, instead of focusing on distributors welfare and self developement. A feature that is essential but lacking in many, many MLM or in fact, also traditional companies.<br><br>Btw, this having sub companies or so applies in ntiparis. Diversification wise, AMH.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>How u know his is a subcompany?</div>

We do not want fly-by-night-type of distribuors to go all round trying to recuiit prospects and at the end tarnish our image as well as theirs.<br><br>Regards.</div></blockquote>newbizopp, remember what I wrote about posting for prospects in the net. Of the reasons, from experience, is that tendency you will get fly by nite distributors from net, as opposed to family and friends. I am not saying ur biz is dubious or anything, net friends bond take longer time to build and nurture. Well, you might succeed, just that not as well as other methods.<br><br>Wish you the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I do not dispute that MLM is in a pyramid form but for one to refer it as pyramid is inappropriate and may confuse people. MLM may be in a pyramid form but it is definately not a pyramid scheme which is a get rich quick scheme. Of course, there are those who claims they are MLM but are actually pyramid scheme, so better learn how to differentiate which is which. Take care.<br><br></div>
