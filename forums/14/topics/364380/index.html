              <p>Hi All! It has been donkey years since i last login to my account here..Lolz..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just wana ask and chat around. Knowing what MLM is, i'm just interested to know if there's anyone who is in the "business" for a long time since and still doing it? What i meant is loving his/her MLM business and still persevering in doing it till today?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a few MLM friends whom i tried convincing in the past. Some had left the business since but some are still doing. I had a friend still doing Amway but never asked her how she is doing now. Reason is being whenever i talked to her on msn, she will become very defensive and in the end our conversation got heated up and nothing will come out of it. Thus, i did not get any answer i wanted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm just curious will anyone do this business for years and still believe in it?? No offence to MLMers but i'm not here for flaming.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone has any comments or feedbacks welcome. :)</p>

              <p>i wouldn't say that majority of the mlm distributors will continue to do mlm after a few years.. in fact after a few months..</p>
              <p>they will run out of exhaustion already loh..since you have being viewing it, i suppose you know what i mean, so i ned not spell it out clearly ba..</p>

              <p>Well, actually im not realli interested in the positive side of MLM, but rather the "other" side of it. lolz..Just happened to browse thr this forum and after viewing some of the topics here, got me the curiousity to wana know y the hell is MLM still "surviving"? Guess everyday someone will be bornt and like insurance, this continues its business. But 4 MLM, this continues the cycle for them of forever stuck in its stage of coming and going, trying to reach a stage where till today i dun think someone has reached...wahaha..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, im not saying insurance is like MLM. I feel that it is the only viable and sucessful sort of network marketing out there. Just that new people will let the business continue to grow and run..</p>

              me in Amway....already 5 years loh....hahahh.... :)
              Me never really wanted to build the business, just like to consume stuffs, etc, got only 2 downlines....and never even got into 3 percenter....
              
              hahaha....but I am happy....also happy that upline never pressurize me....cuz ultimately it IS you OWN business...if next time you become interested and wanted badly to bring up the business, you will automatically become very motivated and active one...but just not now with me. :)

              Oh...by the way, Singapore got 2-3 diamonds liao loh....estimated to be earning over 10k per month. But then they got over 3 legs of 24-27 people each, which comes up to about 100 people under. 
              
              The idea is some will become successful quickly, some will become successful over super long times like over 5-10 years, while some is just not their piece of cake or cup of coffee, like me.....heheh...me not really like to sell or do marketing.

              <p>ok..good for them..guess they must have been in the business 4 a number of years already. Their 10k a month should be active income right, coz if their downlines do not perform, they will not get their income as well..</p>

              <p>1 more thing, are their downlines all in SG? Amway has business around the world and their downlines must have been from other countries as well, as from my honest POV, SG is too small to be able to have downlines of more than 100 people, based on law of averaging...lolz</p>

              <p><br>If the business is built well and correctly, it can be passive income... coz when most people use the Amway products, they are likely to continue to use it coz of its economical value, quality and uniqueness.. and with the demand from millions of people around the world every day, it can only get better :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, there was a 15% growth in the annual sales for 2008, which is a recession year.. :)</p>
              <p>It's possible to build internationally, however, 100 people is not a lot.. for eg, Singapore has 5 million people, take away 100 or even 1000 or 10000, the number is still close to 5 million.. it's even possible to be Double or Triple Diamond or Crown even in SG alone.. :)</p>

              <p>Yes there are 5 million people in SG. But out of these 5 million, how many have income to start with? Only those in the working society. So u minus off the children and retirees, how much are you left with? Out of these, how many believe in MLM? Even if so, how many of these who believed in it can actually make it and do it? Something to ponder upon yeh?</p>

              <p>Yup, by looking at their catalog, it will seem quite expensive.. when the 1st time I saw it, I felt the same way too.. However when you understand the concentration of the products and how to use wisely.. esp for home care products, the cost per usage is less than what is sold outside.. that is also why such products are distributed through this marketing channel, where they have people to explain and to share the correct usage and economical value of each product.. if it is on the shelf, the amount will scare people off.. :p</p>
              <p>I also agree that most wont do, and majority dun believe.. and this is correct too.. coz if all do, then nobody will be the hawker, barber etc.. so it's only for those who really want to do it.. And for example, to be a Diamond, you only need to help 6 to make it.. of coz, to find, teach and help these 6 may take some time.. but well.. it's only 6.. and not limited to the Singapore market :) Even 5, or 10 years to build a good foundation.. and have 20k passive per month, it's up to each individual to decide for themselves if it's worth it :)</p>

              <p>No offence but i'm sure 10 out of 10 people who gambles think that they are the 1 of out 10 who wins, coz there's a chinese saying "9 out of 10" loses in gambling...</p>

              <p>Actually, it's not about whether the company is American or not, most imptly it must have a good track record and able to last.. otherwise there's no point putting the effort into building it..</p>
              <p>And as long as you get what you deserve, it doesn't matter who else makes money.. not our business.. most imptly is the plan has to be fair to everybody. :)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I heard bout this too..</p>
              <p>Firstly, the basis for comparison for a member is not accurate, unless the member can be deemed active, when most companies report the average earnings, they include all the members, including those that signed up just to get products at  lower rate..</p>
              <p>But most imptly, the main difference is that in a casino, it's mostly based on luck, there is very little control over how much you can win etc.. whereas here, it's mostly based on the effort and how much you put in, with only a small percentage of luck, meaning that there is more control by each individual. Thus the comparison also doesn't seem right at all :p</p>

              <p>Hi :)</p>
              <p>I also read this before plenty of times..</p>
              <p>In fact, I normally do extensive research before embarking on anything, including both anti-mlm and pro ones etc.. coz I do not wish to make a hasty decision which I will regret in future. Thus it is important to read both sides to strike a balance.</p>
              <p>What I actually found is that most people who are anti are due to a few reasons.</p>
              <p>1) Joined for quick and fast money, which is not possible for a genuine business.. coz it takes time to build the foundation.</p>
              <p>2) Joined the wrong company, which requires large investment and is a sort of money game etc.</p>
              <p>3) Listened to people who are doing it the wrong way, that is, being pressurized and thought all are the same etc..</p>
              <p>There are also those who are anti because of stories that they heard like the above and thus became closed-minded.</p>
              <p>I was lucky to be introduced to the right concept early and thus I am able to research and make a more informative decision regarding the business etc.</p>
              <p>If the company that you are partnering with and the team that you are in have high moral values and integrity, and the relationships with your friends and families become better, plus being well-respected by people not in the business.. this is a good business.</p>
