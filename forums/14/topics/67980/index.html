            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hara Kiri</strong><br><br>The Japanese do not use the above term at all, they call the ritual 'seppuku', which is rarely the gory act of Western imagination. Almost invariably the suicide's 'best man' was in attendance, equipped with a freshly sharpened sword. Sometimes the suicide's head was whipped off the instant the knife entered the abdomen; other times as soon as he picked up the ceremonial knife - that gesture of intent being sufficient to satisfy the senior for whose benefit the silly ritual was taking place. 'Seppuku' is now illegal in Japan.<br><br>Yp, another topic to clear few myths in the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

First, the patients need to be kept warm, and contrary to popular opinion, alcohol usually lowers the body temperature, the warm flush it produces is really the effect of heat leaving the body. Secondly, one of the main problems with shock is the disruption of normal blood supply to the vital organs, and alcohol draws blood away to the skin, hence 'boozer's flush'. Finally , if the state of shock has been induced by a fall or an accident of some kind, you dont know if there are any internal injuries which could hardly improved by sousing them in spirit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Aborigine</strong><br><br>Although many would argue the point vigorously, aborigine does not, by definition, refer to the native population of Australia in particular.The first people to be so called were the Latin tribes of Central Italy, and of Latin derivation itself, the word simply means ' the beginning '. The OED makes no mention of Australia at all in its definition of the word but simply states that it describe people, animals or plant life indigenous to an area. So, the Australia native is an aborigine, but an aborigine is not necessarily an Australian native. One could equally describe Scots native to Scotland as aborigines, although such a foolhardy exercise in semantics would be unwise in the extreme in a Glasgow pub at closing time.</div>

It does not mean to attack someone physically; it is assault merely to threaten or to attempt the use of violence, even if no contact is made. Under the right circumstances just shouting and screaming at another person is sufficient to constitute an assault. The charge of battery is added as soon as physical contatc is made. In theory, shouting at someone and then pushing them aside is assault and battery.</div>
