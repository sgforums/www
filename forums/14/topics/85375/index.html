            <div class='col-md body'>Is this the Company addressed in Desa Petaling KL last year ?<br><br>Don't believe them. It's actually owned by a big MLM Scoundrel, Steven Lai, the owner of a suspended healthfood GMP factory by the governement around 2 years ago for producing a "slim-ten" equivalent products in Malaysia.  The "multi-millianaire" background is just a scam.<br><br>I know everything about this Company and with proof that they are not honest at all, totally. Too long to give you the details here, unless you can leave me your contact number or e-mail address, and whoever try to get you in, please STOP him from the business before he got hurt !</div>

Or is there already one?</div></blockquote>As of now there is not govt watchdog.<br><br>As for now we have CAD to investigate pyramid schemes. However, CAD is a multifunction commercial investigative dept, so as to their effectiveness in getting rid of pyramid schemes are unknown.<br><br>The DSAS is not a regulatory watchdog either. Its just a group of legal direct selling companies which abide by regulations and ethcial rules, and advises the public. It will be safer to join companies under DSAS, but after I seen company like AMH which manage to get in, i am already quite disgusted with the slack entry procedures.<br><br>So far ,as to whether there should be a specialist regulatory watchdog with investigative and executive powers, i would love to see such body being set up<br><br>However, one must see that there will be problems with such body. Most of the companies we labelled as a disguised pyramid schemes arent effectively breaking the law. They still sell products, they dont clearly earn money from recruitment. There are no provisions in the MLM Act whch seriously define exactly what is legal and what is not.<br><br>Those who study law will know its up to the court to inteprete whether a particular MLM activity is illegal or not.<br><br>Besides, its not up to some one else to point out whether a company products is marketable, whether a ra-ra session is a brainwashing session, or what seems to be a high pressure selling method may seems otherwise to others.<br><br>If not set up properly, we end up with another watchdog like CASE, which can only mediate if both parties agree to negotiate. They are not an arbitrary watchdog with authority to regulate or punish. So if one party becomes guai lan and refuse to negotiate, CASE is helpless.<br><br></div>

He seems unwillingly to provide more details. Insist i meet up w/ him if I  want to know more. Dunno why he cant send the details of Monarch Worldwide over email...then tell me he know of this new company opening soon so if interested can join him but he will only recruit leaders,but oso unwillingly to reveal anything on the new company....</div>
