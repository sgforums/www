            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, beside in other threads what I said about the industry and choosing company, mlm is actually also a personal business. One of its characteristics is that it run between traditional business and new age investment business<br><br>Traditional business requires effort from beginning till maybe death. If you dont get good employess, succesful marketing strategies,etc, your business might fail, incurring high losses and debts. Otherwise, you may be rich, but still working from day to night, abandoning your family and personal life enrichment and stuff.<br><br>Investment as purported by Robert Kiyosaki, into real estate, stocks,shares etc, is good, as it allows you to retire early and enjoy personal time with your family and friends.But it requires a lot of skills,knowledge and instinct and stuff to know what to invest, how to make your money go into an 'auto run' mode.<br><br>MLM a personal business packaged for any ordinary guy to be successful. Everything is already set up for you, enabling you to just follow the company system in selling and sponsoring. At early stage, like first two or three years, may require big effort on the networker, like your friend, who are running till midnight to do her business. We should be saluting him (if he found the right company), because he works hard for his future and even retirement. After the first few years, he should be earning comfortably, plus his network is already mostly on auto run mode, so he have lots of flexible time to enjoy family life and to work at the timing he wants, not from 8 to 5.<br><br>Anyway, in a good MLM company he should be still working after he becomes successful, just that he works at his own timing, training his network people, helping them to do presentations, and stuff. Plus, in a good company, he should,not only himself a leader, his downlines should be leaders too already.Meaning, any questions and problems faced by new distributors should be filtered by the leaders down there already, giving your friend less headache even when he is successful. Plus all the interacting with people is seriously enjoyable.<br><br>Lets not forget mlm is a people to people business. It develop you to forge better personal relationship with others, especially in Singapore, I must aplogise for this, where we dont even emphathise with people having depression. Strait Times report.<br><br>Well, tibirg, as long as your friend is not brainwashed, have hostile attitude, aloof and stuff, encourage him.Give him your support as a friend, cos he knows what he wants and to do it. Cheerio!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's very true that in MLM you can see people change. Some will still remain the same, it's not because the system it's not workable. To be succesfull in any MLM, as leaders, we would look for people who meets 3 criterias 1) want to 2) willing to 3) teachability. The most important criteria is no 3. Why? No one on this earth can change a person unless he himself wants it.<br><br>When a person who meets the 3 criterias, you will see the transformation and if the personal development program is solid, we should see a very successful and respected leader. I have seen many grown in our business and there are also sucessful in their full time job just because of the personal development program. The way they see things in a positive manner, increase in confidence level, excellent communication skills, handling rejections/problems and so forth.<br><br>Certain MLM companies are people focused and it's not just money. If you plan to go into one, choose wisely, because you do not want to waste you time on the wrong company. Everyone say this is better or that is better, but the decision is yours.<br><br>I have seen many new MLM companies collapse in just a few months. Those joined them have wasted their time and lost their believe in MLM.<br><br>Try and look for a tape/cd by Robert Kiyosaki : A Perfect Business? If you don't trust MLMers, then you can listen to Robert.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who wan to know more bout wat the hell is Network Marketing, pls give urself some time to view the following URL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> :<br><br>http://www.mlm.ch/<br><br>(copy and paste it in ur link)<br><br>u will find answers to :<br><br>1) How Network Marketing, this biz concept comes about?<br>2) Why Network Marketing products so expensive?<br>3) Why are their products so good?<br>4) Why people mistaken it as pyramid scheme? etc<br><br>Find out more answers from there. Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies. Jus take a look at the newspaper for the past one month, alot of articles is focusing on NETWORK MARKETING, and they also teaches us how to prevent from bad companies. if u wan to know, read the straits times forum on MLM and chinese lianhezhaobao on last sunday 18/01/04.<br><br>Most imptly, its not the money that counts. Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>
