The main reason of this is mainly after I went to the office and follow their program and introduction, there are a few questions they cannot answer.<br><br>1. Why the contract agreement does not have reference number, uses photocopy A4 paper, terms and condition of contract only mentioned and support the company and none for buyers but why the company did NOT stamp or signed each agreement ???<br><br>2. Where are the terms and condition that support or right? None. Why only 1 party sign contract agreement (us) so how can you claim this agreement when 1 party?<br><br>3. They company could close and declare bankrupt and we have no rights to claim anything worst if SC also dont support us then how?<br><br>4. If its a profit making machine in this superspeed then why not just grab IPO??? or atleast take loan from international finance banking and pay lower interest then paying to the people at super high interest?<br><br>There many points they cannot answer my dear friends so becareful take your risk okay cause if they closed down out of sudden (ie earth quake destroy their facilities) you cannot take into court because there are no AGREEMENT, sign by both parties, stamped and honoured by legal.<br><br>I conclude this with as A Stupid Risk Taker Investor of the Year 2007.<br><br>TQ</blockquote><a href="http://forum.lowyat.net/topic/457168/+40" rel="nofollow">Sources Click Here</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I never had any vested interest in the First or Second Magic Kingdom, but do you think now it is possible for someone to actually gather the people who lost their money then at the time to come together and have legal representation (like Raffles Town Club) to sue James Phang for compensation and damages? I still know people who have kept all the documentation from Magic Kingdom last time when they bought the memberships.<br><br>If James Phang now claims that he or NOP is not responsible for the first Magic Kingdom going down the drain and not fulfilling their promises, will he also not claim that he has nothing to do with Sunshine Empire and also not responsible for Sunshine Empire not fulfilling their promises to those investors now? So who will current Sunshine Empire investors sue when things go down the drain?<br><br>That person would be the one whose name and face has been put as the face and president of Sunshine Empire, Jackie Hoo.<br><br>Why this "Empire" has so many small companies registered can only be a decoy. The one which is adversely affected will be closed down and these people will just pop up again a few years later with another scheme.<br><br>Kudos to The New Paper and The Straits Times for bringing this back to the attention of the public who it seems does not really have a long term memory when it comes to investing their money in people of dubious track record.<br><br>There's no SARS, Bali Bombing or Asian Financial Crisis to blame this time.</div>
