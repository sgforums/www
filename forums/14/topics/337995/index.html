              <p>It depends on who would want to buy it... Hundreds of dollars maybe be expensive to some but a good deal to others...</p>
              <p>You say $300 is very expensive... I say $300 spent on a Samsung 22" LCD monitor, which I am going to buy later at SITEX, is a good deal... if you friend is smart enough about how to market and sell her products, she can make it... buy whether its easy or difficult is another thing...</p>

              <p>Quite impossible for the bottom to equal the top earners in the
              long term. Not for a pyramid. I've done mlm b4. It's still possible
              to earn good money, but u need to have the patience. Develop ur
              network, study the company's product, system &amp; payout
