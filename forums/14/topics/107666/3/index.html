            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Anti-Networkers,<br><br>I have read through the topics and stories you have told. Actually... you cant say it's a CHEAT or SCAM... WHY?<br><br>If you say what NTI is doing is a SCAM then I tell you.. all the insurance ageny companies in singapore also a SCAM?<br><br>Do you recall years back when Insurance started. Many people also say what SCAM and stuff...<br><br>Infact Insurance or Real Estate also... do earn from people's money? if you are saying earning money from others is wrong.. then what about Insurance?<br><br>They earn.. actually.. 50% what you pay as a premium every month leh... worst then MLM rite?<br><br>then if.. you break the policy you dont even get back money sometimes... from insurance...<br><br>But I am not saying insurance is bad... but... just trying to show you the relations towards MLM.<br><br>People do fail in MLM... and I do agree... not because the company is bad or.. the product is not good... is the person who introduce to you the company?<br><br>Why do I say that is because, they did not bother to explain what NTI has to offer clearly and simply just briefly tell them.. how to join how to earn and stuff..<br><br>BUT I ask you all... since you all are so commited to REALLY close down NTI... why dont you see other companies like AMWAY and 4LIFE? all of them are also MLM...<br><br>Just differents is... the way the people do the selling and recruiting....<br><br>if... so.. MLM is so illegal why isnt it banned? do you know.. there are generated sales of up to $4.4 billion dolloar just by MLM?<br><br>So... that's my point of view.... even thought I am a Networker myself.. I DO NOT WANT TO CHEAT MY FRIEND... cos to me.. friendship is still more important then the business...<br><br>You can ask any of my downlines.. and they all agree...<br><br>It all comes down to one thing...<br>the person who introduce u didnt explain clearly... what MLM is all about...<br>and... he was a selfish.. upline manager to only... think of himself to earn....<br><br>to be frank.. i also dont like NTI culture.... and the way they operate... but.. I can see.. it helped me.. and my friends to be a better business person... why not?<br><br>The REASON why.. they make appt.. tell you not to SAY MLM.. is because of you people.. who didnt put in effect in the business and didnt earn and spread the word MLM cannot EARN..<br><br>Actually is not cannot earn.. is either you lazy to work for it... or want to earn a quick buck..<br><br>Just ask you self.... r u really cheated? or was it a scam...<br>read through about the insurance part again and think twice before you comment about MLM....<br><br>I hope.. this reply will help answer some question that all the ANTI MLM people have...<br><br>For those reading the forum...... if you dont believe... what your friends say to you.. then what more do you need to believe what people say in the FORUM? wahah..<br><br>they may be people from other MLM companies.. who just want to make the company bad? that is also possible..<br><br>I am just saying my 2 cents and not pin pointing anyone...<br><br>Good Luck in your Life... and hope you will find something meanful from this reply....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys if u allowed me to just share my thinking, the reason why u all think NTI is so bad is because u either loss money in it or ur fren does.  So let me ask u if u earn money will u say all this?  anyway even in a same company there will be diff group of people in it, and diff group got diff style of doing the biz, not everyone is doing wat u all mention.(pls view the past posts to know).  i am not speaking bad of u all, but wan to ask u all a fair question how long have u or ur fren do the biz?  1 yr or 2 yr?  if its just few months i think u all should not say all those unfair words, that means u all dun understand the industry and NTi at all.  Well i cant deny that james phang have a really not good backgroud from NOP, pls its a past, dun keep bring up the past, do u wan someone to keep bringing up ur past if u did something wrong that time?  pls flame me if u all want, it will just show that u all are just in mature, so i wun mind.  try to think in a netural side.  Seriously look more in details to both side before u give any conclusion. dun assume u know everything just because u know their way of doing biz and courses. Anyway i wun post anything here again, so dun bother to reply anything.  just look and think.<br><br>lastly i am not a agent from NTI anymore, dun ask me why quit its personal problem... so i am just giving as a neutral party..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree.<br><br>A church will always gather a following as long as there are people willing to go there everyday. It involves faith, whatever kind of it, and not on expectations of tangible rewards. Anyway, I think that the majority of people who keeps going there just want to have some fun and be happy(a self-deception sort) and nothing else. I do think CHC is cultish and make many shallow, if not misleading, claims to their members. Intellectual suicide? Yes. But evil? I think not.<br><br>However, for MLM companies, the fundamental reason why people join is that they wanna earn some income. However, for scam companies, money as a whole flows out of the pockets of the people involved rather than flowing in. The only thing that keeps it going is due to recruitment(and cheating their $$$) and MORE recruitment of new members. It's like a house of cards, something unsustainable, waiting to fall one day. Sooner or later, so many people who feel cheated will leave and incite others to stay away, such that no one will join anymore. Without any decent products to sell, the income stream of the uplines is effectively dried up, ultimately resulting them to lose money also and hence the system fails. It's not a matter of whether NTI will fall, but when.<br><br>This is shown again and again in pyramid schemes, and scam MLMs.<br><br>In short, people who are brainwashed do not necessarily know it themselves - they could probably be even happier by the fact that they are being brainwashed - but people sure knows it and hates it when they are losing money! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why no one talks about turnover rate? Or the number of people that came pleading some of our forumers for help on getting refunds? Or that loyalty and supports does not equate to credibility?<br><br>nti's main strength in staying alive is because of its ability to draw in new groups of gullible young teens. Consider the rate of number of teens entering JCs and polys, NS and ORD personnels. Like I said, with regards to nti previous plan, it draws on recruitment rather than continual or repeated sales. Once the previous batch of people gather what they are in for, they left. But there are fresh groups of young teens that can be drawn into the company.<br><br>As for the comparison between CHC and MLM companies, the only similarity i can note of is the charismatic approach taken by both groups. Otherwise, its unfair to compare spirituality and business.<br><br>As to whether CHC is a scam, a religious cult or whatever, best comtemplate this issue in another forum, the Eternal Hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wilson pls dun spoil the industry with NTI....... Thanks. Network Marketing is not forcing your friends to take out their hardearn money to invest and pushing them to further harm others, lastly it will not teach their ppl to kneel down on the street to beg for sales. if by doing this then what my friend so call is successful, then i rather be a failure in life.</div>
