They are increasing the amount to join this stupid coy, and decreasing the payout. You will feel wtf.<br><br>None of those members are real, all is hyporcite, if you have any friends from NTIparis, end it. Not only they will cheat you, they will also be a liability for you! Every month they will have to give maintainence without earning a single cant(kinda idiotic or something), and that period they have to be so stingy and poor that you cannot bear with it. Maybe for a couple of months or so is okay, but listen up, it will be long term!<br><br>NTIparis can no longer be trusted or make money, because those pyramid heads is nailed onto their seats to cheat kids, they will never give up their seats so don't dreams to become on of those unethical scum ass! Their membership fee is increasing, as well as maintainence, however their personality is decreasing. They like to cheat on themselves, think alot, but not work alot. Idling in the coy like some rich kids, but they can't even feed on themselve.<br><br>You wont see anyone defending for NTIparis here, never, because NTIparis have disgrace the entire MLM companies. Furthermore, they are so shameless that they don't regard sgforums.com as a matter, they say they love to be condemn and never condemn people, this is a fact. They have no evidence to defend themselves.<br><br><strong>TO ALL NTIparis MEMBERS:</strong><br>Entering this coy will never have good endings, trust me<br><br>***NTIparis never dreams now, cos it will never happen for them to be successful, they now fantasy***</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow this coy is coming up with new plans...<br><br>And this new plan sure benefits those jerks on the top...<br><br>Account and maintainence fee have tremendously increased!!! It makes having a account in NTIparis simply a liabilty instead of asset. Really, not worth it.<br><br>People are getting more and more intolerant with the nonsenses NTIparis does, major decline of people joining this coy, therefore they increase the maintainence to make sure they are able to continue paying the instalment of their BMW.<br><br>Stupid and selfless thinking will lead to end of NTIparis...

Why don't I kill your parents and say "No offence thru, bro." You can't compare sony with NTIparis, it is a real great insult to sony company. Besides when you buy sony products, you pay for it willingly and on air or advertisement, sony have proven itself's trustworthy. Totally different from NTIparis, before you join, i bet you have been heavily brainwash, I dont blame you, because you are young and they are trained scum to do such physcoing.

But today, sorry, job we NEED NOT pay any amount of sum to the coy and for business or investing, we pay, but will have returns unlike there.<br><br>Think about it yourself... Did your upline keep pestering you to open new accounts? Because NTIparis totally lost their trust and waving white flags already.
