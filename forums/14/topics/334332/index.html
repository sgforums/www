              <div>This video is rife with logical fallacies. Tim Sales states, for instance, that the comparison to casino odds is taken out of context. Yet he takes it out of context by refusing to note how the comparison is drawn from a critics' understanding of the geometric recruitment model. When he finally does mention the model, it isn't in reference to the casino odds, but just to state that in an article he once read someone said the model leads to failure.</div>

              <div>When he mentions the article about the recruitment model, he doesn't refute the point made by the author by making any direct attempt to disprove it. Instead, he just points out that the author never tried it, and therefore must be unqualified to criticize it. He then compares math to science, as if a mathematical concept and a scientific theory are the same thing. I know of no mathematical concept that, once proved mathematically, has been disproven mathematically.</div>

              <div>He points out that people who write about and/or teach certain subjects do so because they can not do what they write about and/or teach. Setting aside for a moment his calmly stated insult, he is also implying that education is useless. He's pitting education against experience and asking people to choose only experience. He fails, or refuses, to mention that each can build on the strength of the other. Companies who seek employees look for both qualities.</div>

              <div>Another logical fallacy he makes regarding the article he read is that by suggesting that the author has no experience in MLM, that his or her observations on the exponential recruitment model can not possibly be accurate (another reason to undermine education). Yet the validity of a mathematical concept does not depend on anyone's opinion or experience. If it expands at a geometric rate, with a corresponding market shrinkage, it does so regardless of anyone's wishes or experience.</div>

              <div>Maths is meant to show an unbiased reading for those who succeeded vs failed. That is all it should be used for.

              <p>From your tone, I believe that even if I give you thousands of evidence, you will still not believe me...but I will still try...</p>
              <p>Every MLM company encourages you to get a starter kit to fimilarise you with the product... That will act as tool to begin your sales... If someone gives up half way because he can't make any sales the first few attempt, his investment is lost then he will say that this MLM business cheat me of my money...</p>
              <p>Compare that to someone who invested on the starter kit, then was able to make sales coz he never gave up, he will be saying this MLM business is a good investment...</p>
              <p>So it depends on who you chose to listen to...</p>
              <p>Like the video says... there are people who tried to get into many things like dieting, pro golf, martial arts and "failed"... why should MLM be any different...</p>

              <p>Every MLM company encourages you to get a starter kit to fimilarise you with the product... That will act as tool to begin your sales... If someone gives up half way because he can't make any sales the first few attempt, his investment is lost then he will say that this MLM business cheat me of my money...</p>
              <p>Compare that to someone who invested on the starter kit, then was able to make sales coz he never gave up, he will be saying this MLM business is a good investment...</p>
              <p>So it depends on who you chose to listen to...</p>
              <p>Like the video says... there are people who tried to get into many things like dieting, pro golf, martial arts and "failed"... why should MLM be any different...</p>

              <p>Got one MLM company which starts with a V told me that... but I quit that company coz of their dirty tactics and questionable product and waste my time...</p>
              <p>But I've found another company which my friend brought me to and love it... For one thing, it doesn't have a cult like culture like the other company... everyone is someone else's friend... We are also told never to do sneak or forceful sales... and we must disclose the fact that your reward is based on your result... gurantee $10,000 within 3 months is not impossible but if you can produce such results...</p>
              <p>but the main reason why I chose this company is because it cured my mom's arthritis... I guess I owe that to the company...</p>
              <p>Salesmen get basic pay...? Means they do nothing still get paid???</p>

              <p>they still have to attend briefings, feed back to their company... so they do not do nothing and get paid...  their sales would usually make the main bulk of their pay...<br><br><br>anyway one more thing... in mlm everyone is your enemy.. not friend..  i dont see why you guys see each others as friends.. you are all selling the same products to the same market...  only your uplines might regard you as a friend, what about ur sidelines?</p>
