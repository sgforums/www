            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Everybody,<br><br>Thank you for replying, be it to be negative or positive.<br><br>I am Singaporean Chinese. Previous one post, to be frank is my testing post, with a bit of idea to share with you guys out there. I was surprise to see so many reply and views. That really makes me happy, becos it is really active here.<br><br>That is why 95% and 5% rule in the world comes in. Majority of people don't know how to tap to resource available outside of Singapore. The figure of 2k a month is just a make up story. But i believe it can be true. My friend, only put, USD$50 into a website, about 2mth later, it rolled to about $1.9k. It is the system within making it work. In US, alot of website is using MLM system, which is powerful and reliable. There is definitely a lots of set back in traditional MLM system, that everyone have to find a downline. My friend's website tat he invest in makes it that, downline is feed by the system. Some people may have know such system. Good System will be dupicated by many website definitely. I had invested in it too.<br><br>When so many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme" rel="nofollow">Ponzi-scheme</a> in US makes the market so hard to believe it is true whether there is so many easy money out there. For your info, there is such thing like High Yield Investment Program(HYIP) in there, that kind of program issn't an easy way to earn. Becos the program pay too fast till till a certain extend, the website will close down, and people will lost all their money that they put in. But if you are an entrepreneur, i would recommend taking this as a course to learn how to earn and lost money. Becos you can learn how to take risk. If you can't afford to lost, then stop dreaming to be an entrepreneur, even you are one, you will lost many opportunity even it is within your reach. Since you can't do it good, why waste time there, get a nice job and be an specialist. You can earn alot. But i have to let you know that, even you are entreprunuer, you are just a high class employee only, then who is the employer???<br><br>Is the MONEY. You will keep on working and thinking for money, trading your time and energy for money. So what is the best way to earn???<br><br>Be an INVESTOR. So what's so great about an investor? When an opportunity arrived in front of him, they just need to THINK, CALCULATE, WALK, PRESS, WAIT.<br><br>1)THINK- Think how to do to earn, may be just think how much you can afford exclude to those daily expense, or even need to eat bread for few days, which me and my wife really did it that way.<br>2)CALCULATE- calculate, how much you can earn from 1 round of investment.<br>3)WALK- walk to ATM<br>4)PRESS- Transfer money<br>5)WAIT- wait for money to come in<br><br>Everyone can do that, we didnt use anything different from any one. We only giving more trust to people, more daring to let people handle our money and look more into the bright side. We are still struggling now, becos we are now reserve money for future investments. There is definitely many setbacks. But we are glad that, have have gain back from negative bank account, and things is getting better. We are the very few that do things very abnormal i would say.<br><br>I am here not to sell anything. Just to share with you guys, as a Singaporean, there is something out there in the world to explore. In Singapore, we are bring up in a way, EFFORT equals TIME equals MONEY, try use least time to earn the most, or else it will still be the same even 30years down the road.<br><br>If u are positive, u will attract opportunity. If u are negative, opportunity will just have to stay outside your doorstep, and eventually go off.<br><br>I really have to tell you guys there, don't restraint yourself in singapore, if you want to make big money. There is plenty of gold out there. And don't think of going out of singapore if you want to make money too, there is a thing call internet, which run at speed of light. And you can reach to Big Mass....that's y I am here, 200 plus views within a few days, which i don't think i am a good writer here.<br><br>I am going into full time internet marketeer from the start of this month after a termination of my contract, becos i know i can't be a good worker, i have my own way of life style that i want to achieve. I want to be a responsible husband, son, and may be a papa, which i can't afford to let my time wasted working for other people's business.<br><br>ok Enough talking from me, i would like to know everyone from here, who is negative and positive of the idea i am saying. Please PM me, if you think we can be friends. If you are one type like me and my wife, let me know, so that we can find the financial freedom recipe, and share around the public.<br><br>All the best.<br>InternetMarketeer</div>

True<br>But there are enough fools in this world for this scam to work.<br>Ref today's The Sunday Times 22 April 2007,  (Malaysians lost millions to online scam, says paper).<br>I am sure Singapaore too have some fools.<br><br>This is how it works.<br>You deposit your "investment" to an account in a Malaysian bank.<br>And you register yourself online. Giving your details and bank account no.<br>Then depending on the amount of your principle, exorbitant interest would be credited to your bank account. You would be elated, you bank in more, and also spread the good news. You are getting your returns as promised.<br>When sufficient fools have deposited in the the Malaysian account, to the tune of millions of dollars. The account suddenly closes, and the "investors" are left in a lurch. The early birds get their interest back, but loses the principle, the later joiners loose more.<br>Police investigations will reveal that the Malaysian account is open with fake identities.<br>So its true, you get exorbitant interest for your deposit.<br>But the catch is that you lose your principle amount.<br>And the internet marketman, with his wife, runs off laughing, to another bank with an e-barrel full of money.</div>
