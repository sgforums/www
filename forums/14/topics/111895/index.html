            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;"></span>seems like someone is jealous of NTI .. wonder who is this idiot who makes him self happy by tarnishing the reputation of other NM companies.... avenging angel, avenge what, your lack of courage and guts to do NTI? laurence82, so old already and bearing a grudge.... not everyone knows you two are in a MLM company, totally diff from NTI... only lamers who have no say in society would post and talk about useless nothings about network marketing companies... network marketing is legal, in case you haven't been diggin your ears and eyes from all the rubbish you posted, think before you post, you'll just be downgrading yourself to a level where no one would want to bother about you.... i really pity the way you feel....haiz..</div>
