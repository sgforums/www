However were u from AMWAY Singapore?<br><br>Firstly, AMWAY Singapore opened in Apr 2002 thus 2001 it was not in Singapore yet.<br><br>Also, it's marketing plan is prob one of the most comprehensive in the market, it covers a lot of aspects and if you can build it well, it will be a stable business. Thus, I would say it is not difficult or easy, but how you look at it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>No matter how I look left look right compare prices etc, I fail to see why the products are expensive. I only see more economical quality products which help me to save money since I am getting those anyway, and getting a better product is definitely better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>However, a lot research have to be done to truly understand the business of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers<br></div>

May i ask you which system are you referring to?<br><br>Amway has many business system, some are good , some are not so good. Some teach you to build network , some ask you to do hard-selling . All the business system focus on different thing.<br><br>but in short , there is only a couple of good system around that teaches the value of life. One of them is BWW (which stands 70% of amway population). The value and teaching from this system is unbelievable. They really focus on building and bringing the best out of you so that you not only succeed in this Amway biz but also in Life and anything you do.<br><br>If you want to know more, feel free to drop me a mail at signupforsgforumspremiermembership@sgforumsbagus.com. I am more than grateful to share.<br></div>
