U must have at least an A-level or Diploma Cert. If u r a scholar(special paper), your chances will increase by 50%.<br>2. Talk 2 your PC abt. it n b more "on" in front of him.<br>3. I do believe your ECA record helps.<br>4. Peer Appraisal does have a certain weightage, so treat your peers well.<br>5. U need not b super-fit, as I had seen pple who juz got a pass in their IPPT into OCS.<br><br>Btw, I'm from the 19/95 OCC n my vocation is an OCS Infantry Instructor. OCS is not as xiong as what many pple think, but it stresses alot on the 7 core values. i.e. Loyalty 2 country, leadership, Discipline, Professionalism, Fighting Spirit, Ethics n Care 4 soldiers. One of the incentive is the $500++ allowance.<br><br>To all serviceman still in their BMT phrase:<br>When I looked back 2 my army life, all I can remember is my BMT life n not the days as an instructor whacking pple. BMT is the best part of my life, thou' it is xiong(40th SAR Mono-intake), it is memorable. U do push-up, fatigue, duties,.....2gether n u will never experience this kind of cohensiveness 2gether again. Treasure your Platoon, section-mates, coz this is the oni period of time in your 3yrs of service whereby u will have this kind of feeling.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Max_rian (edited 27 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who r officers/specs in the Army and refuses to belive that a PTE can fuck an higher rank personnel. Here is what i got to say ----------------------------&gt;<br>When an unit controls LFA/Ranges, he/she controls whichever units get to use which ranges/LFA and on which day.<br>Which means, if your unit is located in the east, that unit can allocate u a range/LFA that is in the west. And choose the date allocated to u on an Sat and Sun or best, public holidays(which means u burn your weekends)Or even reject u to give that area to other units. And when u r having your range/LF, we can choose to disrupt your training session which means you will get to go back to your bed late in the nite.<br>Not only that, that unit also controls where u can do your training (be it a life run or other training areas)<br>There r other things which that unit controls which r essential to your units' training. But thats alot to digest for now.<br>--------------------------------------------<br>I am not showing off or trying to be arrogant. But just want to push a msg to officers and spec. "Do not abuse your rank."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would just like to remind u all that it is a chargable offence to disclose any military secrets to anyone, even your love ones. Be very careful..<br>To those officers who posted here I'm sure u all know that..<br>The net is not a safe place to tok about such things. Even though u r all SAF personnels what makes u so sure no one else reads this topic?<br>Pls stop what u are doing or else there may be serious consequences...<br>just one thing to point out<br>U may think that ur anonymous on the net but u r not<br>and the more u reveal about yrself the easier it will be for us to track u down<br><br>------------------<br>"If YoU fAiL tO lOoK bEyOnD lOoKs,<br>YoU fAiL tO aPpReCiAtE tRuE bEaUtY"<br>Â© Copyright 1999 FriesÂ® All rights reserved.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Fries (edited 29 April 2000).]</div>
