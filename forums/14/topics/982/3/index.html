            <div class='col-md body'>u mean OCS and SiSPEC is not tough ? wanna come and try ?? NOwadays in BMT, life is getting better. Now, u can't knock a recruit down for more and 20 pushups in half an hour...etc etc.. u know wat punishments we get in BMT just exactly one year ago ?? I think its better you all find out. THen u ask yourselves again if BMT now is tough. I really wonder if SAF are training soldiers.. or they are just training a bunch of weaklings.</div>

My elder brother heard it when he was in BMT ('91). My cousin heard it when he was in BMT ('85). It's the same thing over and over again. Everyone thinks the next generation is weaker.<br><br>What is the minimum standard that would satisfy you? The kind of BMT that YOU went through? But guys 2 or 3 years your senior would say that's also bloody relak, compared to what THEY went through. And so on and so forth. Where do you draw the line?? What do you want - hard-nosed 60's era Israeli instructors firing live rounds a few inches over your heads? A horrific training regimen when you go for your ICT?</div>
