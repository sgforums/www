I do correct them on the spot, letting them know that such action will cause mistrust and unhappiness to the people coming for interview. I think these inexperienced recruiters do pay a heavy price to learn.<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>2) Why are ur products (the water filter) so grossly overpriced? U guys mentioned the filter out in the market now is worth $1.4k. I forgot what u guys said abt ur product being superior than theirs, which is why u guys priced it at $1.8k. Which leads me to my third pt...<br><br>my reply:<br><br>Different people see the need of the product different. For my family, we do see a need for the water filteration and mineralised water for our body daily needs, that is why we are willingly to invest the money for the family. Of course, some people dont see the need thus definitely wont want to spend that amount of money on the filteration.<br><br>I think that the product presenter do play a important part to explain the need worth value of the products. I understand that most product presenters presenting in the office are considered junior and inexperienced presenters still learning and practising. I apologised for the bad impression given to you.<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>3) A BGM earns 40% commission off one sale, isn't it? That's not including money from ur downlines' sales, managerial and car bonuses and training bonuses. Am I correct to assume the product is in fact only 20-30% of its retail price? If not, ur company is willing to make a loss in order for their employees to benefit? Cannot be the case right? So it's either ur business plan is a bogus or the consumer is exploited for big profits.<br><br>my reply:<br><br>BGM earns 40% commission from the PV, not the retail price. The 40% do included in downline's sales, training bonus etc. So, in fact only 30% of the filteration retail price is paid to the distributors. The business plan can be very easy to calcaluate and understand but provided the plan presenter can explain very clearly across the table. I think it is our plan presenter poor explanation that made you misunderstand our business plan.<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>Still, I'm impressed u guys require no initial investment and provide free training. Then again, without basic pay, the least u guys can do is provide free training. Perhaps, u should make things clear on this forums once and for all, rather than hide behind an email to defend ur company. Make ur views known.<br><br>Thank you for your compliment. I understand that basic pay is always a concern. I wish to address the issue because MLM is a business concept and every distributors are self-employed, meaning like a retailer, contractor, freelancer, taxi-driver etc. MLM is not a job and thats why there are no basic pay.<br><br>I hope you can feel free to message me directly should there be anymore valuable feedback.

            <div class='col-md body'>Edit: Paiseh, I've received ur msg le. Sry to jump to conclusions. Anyway, here's my updated post.<br><br>To Answer 1: I doubt it so. U mean u'll tell ur trainees to phone recruits and tell them "Hey, we're an MLM company, come if u want to earn big bucks fast." No right, cos' u guys are also aware of the MLM hate going around now. And she sounded quite 'computer generated', probably something she had been trained to say. Remember those poly guys I mentioned in my first post? They also probably got the same misconception of an 8-5 job and came to ur office. But they got more guts than me and left prematurely. Seriously, I think it's not the recruiters' fault. More to blame on the programmes on how they were trained to speak to potential recruits.<br><br>To Answer 2: I feel this answer satisfactory. Good for u and ur family if the product works for u.<br><br>To Answer 3: For this, I muz apologise cos' I was half aslp by the time they explained the business plan. PV is $900 - $1000 isn't it? Even then 40% of that amount still comes up to alot. I wouldn't knowingly allow u to reap $400 off the sales for an unmarketed and unpublicised product.<br><br>I know, I can see the ISO and positive demonstrations and stuff, but there's no media coverage or solid proof to show it works. What if I bought them and it doesn't work for me? At least a newspaper article or 2 written by neutral reporters who tried the product would set my mind at ease.<br><br>And we wouldn't noe if an additional percentage of the sales goes to the company for expansion purposes etc. I still feel that the retail price is unjustifiable. I would only be satisfied if it drops to $1.4k to remain competitive with the current water filters out there. And not to mention the fact that the current water filters in the market have established history, consumers' trust and substantial market share, which justifies their prices, unlike urs.</div>

Which leads me to my third pt...<br><br>my reply:<br><br>Different people see the need of the product different. For my family, we do see a need for the water filteration and mineralised water for our body daily needs, that is why we are willingly to invest the money for the family. Of course, some people dont see the need thus definitely wont want to spend that amount of money on the filteration.<br><br>I think that the product presenter do play a important part to explain the need worth value of the products. I understand that most product presenters presenting in the office are considered junior and inexperienced presenters still learning and practising. I apologised for the bad impression given to you.<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>3) A BGM earns 40% commission off one sale, isn't it? That's not including money from ur downlines' sales, managerial and car bonuses and training bonuses. Am I correct to assume the product is in fact only 20-30% of its retail price? If not, ur company is willing to make a loss in order for their employees to benefit? Cannot be the case right? So it's either ur business plan is a bogus or the consumer is exploited for big profits.<br><br>my reply:<br><br>BGM earns 40% commission from the PV, not the retail price. The 40% do included in downline's sales, training bonus etc. So, in fact only 30% of the filteration retail price is paid to the distributors. The business plan can be very easy to calcaluate and understand but provided the plan presenter can explain very clearly across the table. I think it is our plan presenter poor explanation that made you misunderstand our business plan.<br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>Still, I'm impressed u guys require no initial investment and provide free training. Then again, without basic pay, the least u guys can do is provide free training. Perhaps, u should make things clear on this forums once and for all, rather than hide behind an email to defend ur company. Make ur views known.<br><br>Thank you for your compliment. I understand that basic pay is always a concern. I wish to address the issue because MLM is a business concept and every distributors are self-employed, meaning like a retailer, contractor, freelancer, taxi-driver etc. MLM is not a job and thats why there are no basic pay.<br><br>I hope you can feel free to message me directly should there be anymore valuable feedback. Thanks!<br><br>=============<br><br>I think I have answered you directly to your issue.

Keep studying and gaining knowledge... That comes to another point, the manager told me that fresh uni graduates earn max up to $2k a mth only while they can constantly earn beyond that. Machiam trying to deter me to study and making me do business full time. For the sake of every naive guy in this forum trying to earn it big thru MLM, now's 21st century, it doesn't work that way. U still need that knowledge and abilities to tackle bigger business plans. U can't possibly keep relying on ur broken ENGRISH to eke a living for a lifetime. Yea... So... Pursue knowledge and dun be naive to think there's an easy way, guys!<br><br>Dun say my language power leh... I'll blush...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Arrr, but I dun have thick skin so I can't do MLM. I can't talk with a straight face, like nothing's wrong and everything's good, when I noe my company and I will make 50% or more profits off him/her. If the buyer is an arrogant rich kid, knn I'll be happy to rip him off la! But 99% of Singapore's population is made up of the humble down-to-earth average household living in HDB. I juz can't do it.<br><br>Eh, juz joking niaz... Dun take it so seriously... But really wad, u talk like MLMer then got my full fury... Now u say u're not... I feel guilty of bombarding u leh... enquiries seem like a normal guy to me, despite being in MLM, so he wun be next la... Unless he goes the cliched route of saying "U can get ur BMW in 2 yrs! 8-5 boring, this job is freelance, u can work from home and earn more than 8-5! Ur dreams will come true!" then knn I bomb him and I wun even spare his bones...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On a sidenote, enquiries have PMed me abt my concerns regarding his company liaoz. I feel that his answers are satisfactory so I shall rest my case with VE for now.<br><br>enquiries, as I said on my PM, pls educate not only ur business group but the rest as well. I notice certain typical bogus MLM trends in my 2 hr stay in VE, which is why I was a little agitated in my initial posts.<br><br>I mentioned abt the misleading recruitment phone call, ya? If any of my close friends get false hopes of landing a stable job in VE after listening to a phonecall from a VE recruiter, VE will definitely have hell to pay. (at least on this forums. Relax... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>Also, pls dun make ur recruits too over optimistic. The manager who discussed the business plan with me made it sound like 'tian yi wu feng' plan of gaining riches and mentions a car name at least once in every 3 sentences. What they didn't address is the low success rate and the high dropout rate as well. Not everyone is suited to do sales or specifically MLM sales. Pls offer both sides of the story to give recruits a full picture.<br><br>Another bogus MLM trend I notice in VE is that the recruiter is over zealous and eager to make u stay. Without my consent, she immediately set an appointment the NEXT DAY. For a jobseeker, it's too good to be true, right? Well, luckily, I'm slightly better informed. They should spend more time to actually do the damn interview to decide if I'm suitable or not. What if I'm a criminal or whatever and u guys juz blindly recruit? Goes to show that u guys are in need of quantity like most MLM companies to build a bigger pyramid, and not quality.<br><br>I also acknowledge the fact that black sheep are always existent in a company, no matter how good it is. Hope u would take action on what I've highlighted and I believe VE would be one of the better MLM companies out there. (Why I always type long posts ah... Argh... Can't help it...) Cheers!</div>
