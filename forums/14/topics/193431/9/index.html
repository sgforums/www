            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe this is so interesting. I think having had a 2 hr experience at VE warrants me the most basic of opinions too? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> MLM style is liddat wad. Optimistic. Persistent... I want to say 'disillusioned' but let's keep it neutral for now, shall we?<br><br>So we can't really blame the VE guy mentioned in the blog for being 'si chan lan da'. If he gets more downlines actively involved in the business plan, means he gets more potential commission from his enthusiastic and optimistic downlines. Maybe he's really committed to the company and wants it to prosper, that's why he's so enthusiastic abt his business plan? Nah, I doubt so. Everyone in MLM is only concerned abt their own wealth.<br><br>Yea, and I also agree with TIB that VEers should stop telling newbies to concentrate more on work than studies. Studies should still be priority, esp. in a education driven society like ours. On this aspect, it's a really bad influence. Before long, parents will go visit the company to make a scene. As I told enquiries before, allow the newbies to see the whole picture instead of juz cars, money and success. Furthermore, new recruits don't even sign a proper employment contract. U could slog ur way to BGM and ur boss finds u too threatening and banish u from the company. U have absolutely no case against them without black and white evidence. Leading me to my last concern...<br><br>I think VE should rework their employment scheme and fire those NSFs and regulars. It's juz not right to recruit them. With all the hate against MLM nowadays, u may not know when some gutsy fellow will report the case to the police and raid the company. If the NSF or regular is in the office, suay suay tio dai ji.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>hey everyone<br><br>kind of wondering why the big deal over VE..<br><br>I got a confession to make...i'm currently working<br>in  VE..but inactive for two months now...cause i'm busy<br>at the moment..ferst of all i've try all their products..free<br>..hoho..cause i know how to talk people into giving<br>or purchasing for me...lets face it..i'm a singaporean..<br>and majority of us are labeled KIASU am i rite?...so back<br>to the point..like i said i used the products...and yes it works..<br>BUT...yes there's a BUT..not all the people feel the effects take my<br>family and relatives for instand...all feels immeadiate effects except for<br>some of my uncle and aunties...so overall the number of combines<br>families of both my parents side acummalate to 39 people..<br>out of 39..12 does not feel immediate effects..but felt the effect<br>after prolonged usage..so what i'm trying to say is that not every one<br>will feel the effects..(i'm using the travel size mattress as i'm typing cause<br>my back hurts too much..i sprained it at the gym)..<br><br>secondly..about how VE works...<br>to be honest with you guys...i think most of the people there<br>are too engrossed in their dream that they perform badly in their line..<br>its not wrong to have dreams..everyone has dreams..but remember that<br>towards a dream there are two routes to take..one is positive and the other<br>are the opposite..many VE people have taken the wrong route..all they care<br>is acheveing their dreams that they recruit people more to help them<br>in sales...but they never really help..instead  pressurized them<br>into doing sales...this is wrong...you guys never thought of their feelings..<br>that is why many left VE...help them..understand them..give solutions to their problems..not just work..personal problems too..you're the upline..you have to be respectable,caring..not being crazy on being promoted..heck i don't even care if i was'nt promoted...i rather not be promoted then see my downlines struggling with no one to help them..my manager place two queen mattress under me to help me promote(to increase my quota)..that is why i respect him...now how much are you willing to do something like that..no i'm not asking you to be a hero or something...just a little will do..guide them not brag to to them how you acheive that position..and to the the downlines of VE<br>if your uplines ask you to do something..like for exp. calling people down to meet them and they give you a phone technique or what so ever...and you can't seem to get anyone to come down...stop doing what you are doing right now..if it doesn't work means it will never work..don't always follow blindly...what..don't tell me that you belive in the slogan..'every rejection will bring you closer to acception'..what..wait for 100 people to reject you then you get one positive one...think about this..ther are many more ways you got to learn to become a true mlm person...and sadly the managers too are not ready why...they promoted too fast to learn the real way of doing buisness..i got a downline who was ill...he asked me he will go back to the office in two days...but  i said no...i told him to take two week or more days off..i don't care what my manager says or scolds..heck i rejected thier calls most off the time..i'm not going to let my downline going to the office sickly..what if somethings crops up and his condition became worse..whose going to answer..have a heart...don't think about yourself only..your downlines are not slaves...and a real mlm company is all about being slave free from the government and others..think about it...<br><br>VE products are unique and it works(i've been cure of insomia..and about time too!!)...<br>its not a scam...but you guys don't do the job the proper way thus blacklisting the company name...managers and uplines are pressurizing the downlines are now common in VE..stop doing so...one day your downlines are bound to quit...and remeber when they quit..they will have a negative thought on VE..and tell their friends about this company..how not to join this so on and so fourth..now i can see that the negative comments posted here all have connection with VE...through their families,friends or even themselves..this shows how badly you perform...a real mlm person would never let this happens...change and you will find yourself not just acheiving your dreams but becomes a better person... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>this post is not to defend VE but merely sending a msg to all VE people..<br>as you can see...thanks for all the feedbacks no matter positive or negative..all are helpful for me to be a better mlm worker...thanks you guys..may god bless all off you.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </strong>[color=darkred]<br><br>P.S:my apology to those who are offended..i'm only trying to make things rite..<br>and just me alone..one person can't do much..it's up to you to decide...i'm sure other networkers will agree with me....i accept PM so don't hesitate to msg me...</div>

Even though his parents are seemed to be convinced on the exterior, in actual fact they told me friend again and again to resign. Until now, he's still inside.<br><br>To quote whatever he've mentioned inside his blog:<br><br><blockquote>Hmm.. Speaking of VE here, i find that i have not always been letting people know that i actually worked there. I always trying to find excuses to reply back to all my friends that i see how first whether i working this coming holiday etc etc.. <strong>Actually we go there do business rather than work, got difference one.</strong> But still, i ask myself this question: Is it really scary to let people know what kind of industry i'm doing? Yea, i believe a number of you here would have some negative thoughts about this industry, i have experienced it in my previous class. What i got back are a mixture of thoughts. Some gave me moral support, some have their neutral stand, and some even persuaded me to quit while the dreams i plan ahead is already there. More often than not, they will keep on asking me how much have I earned so far, and from there, they were trying to convince me to quit. <strong>It's like they expected me to earn at least a 3-figure sum of $$$ when i have not even put much of my effort in this industry. Even most of my relatives have extremely negative thoughts and 1 of them even made me cried and feeling damn upset. My relatives were saying that i should finish my studies first and then get a "DECENT paying job". Everytime i hear them saying these 3 words really makes me very du lan, very fed-up. Guys, tell me, would i be able to achieve all my dreams if i only continue to stay in this fucking 3 words with the word DECENT? And the fact that the standard of living and expenses in Singapore is getting freaking higher and higher really makes me tempting to ask this question even further.</strong></blockquote>I wonder what can I do to convince him that MLM =/= You'll definitely achieve your dreams.<br><br>==<br><br>One more question here and I believe it's pretty interesting as well.<br><br>If in the event that a MLMer whose position's a manager actually left the company and went to apply for another job as a manager as well. I wonder how's the applicant supposed to reply when the employer actually ask them what do they do as a manager inside VE. Seriously, are they going to tell them they sell magnetic therapy products etc inside and get the managerial position job? Cant be what right even if you have the necessary requirements for that job..<br><br>I mean, what skills do you have besides managing your downlines, selling products yourself and achieving that car? I wonder if VE people write reports on their sales to their uplines..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well well guys relax man no need for sure heated argument. anyway i m new to this forum. but let me break down somethings to u guys. i dun dare say VE is godly neither do i say itz sux. we r all given the right to say our POV and perception. a pt to pt out is tat NO and i mean NO company in this world can claim tat all the employees r upright or a bunch of crooks. there r bound to be black sheeps. NO one can deny tat rite?? wat's the pt of me saying this?? itz just to let everyone noes tat VE is not prefect but itz a new local company out to do biz using a networking style. which is very common nowadays. ur argue abt putting VE in front of study i believe ur have ur pt. study is impt i agree. to those fighting for the car incentive in VE, the incentive is there but there is no need to rush for it. Y?<br>becuz finish ur study u still will have time to fight for ur car.<br>i see names of VE ppl in the forum, even though they dun noe or even they noe wat can they do? they can onli take the comments and improve but pin pointing someone out in a forum is really not a gd idea aft all. give tat poor guy a break, all of us make mistakes. it may be just 1 for his mistakes. he learn frm it and go. so wat if u drop out to get his car. itz his choice. for everything u do there's a price to pay. diff ppl have diff measures of the price to pay, u just see if itz worth it. since he thinks itz worth it then he do it. but if u dun think so then u can chose to study first then fight for car. nothing wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
