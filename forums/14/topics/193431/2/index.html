            <div class='col-md body'>I have more medical books in my library than you have VE products at home.

Get your logic right.<br><br>I feel that you came in to the forums highly combative and you should at least show some basic courtesy to engage MOSposterior in a more positive manner than to just dismiss him the way you did. It shows your ignorance and inability to handle matters that you do not comprehend.<br><br>It is now apparent to me that you have not learnt anything from VE as you have not learnt how to handle people, manage situations, establish a positive climate for a fruitful debate and to be able to control yourself from embarrassing yourself and your company.<br><br>You can now go re-clone and try again.
