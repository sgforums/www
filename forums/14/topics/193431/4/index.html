Well if you go to ebay or yahoo auction, you could see people selling mattress too.  Anyway we also dunno whether they can sell anot right, cold call means calling strangers how can be friends and relatives.  Anyway find friends and relatives is also right la, usually we will say that they share with someone they know more.  Just like you see something good, you will share with your friends and relatives before going to stranger ma.<br><br>Anyway i did not say drop out means is not good in MLM, i am saying since they drop out, must be something they dun feel good about the company ma.

Well if you go to ebay or yahoo auction, you could see people selling mattress too.  Anyway we also dunno whether they can sell anot right, cold call means calling strangers how can be friends and relatives.  Anyway find friends and relatives is also right la, usually we will say that they share with someone they know more.  Just like you see something good, you will share with your friends and relatives before going to stranger ma.<br><br>Anyway i did not say drop out means is not good in MLM, i am saying since they drop out, must be something they dun feel good about the company ma.  So if we just listen to one sided story, aren't it the same as hearing from those who is against MLM and not listening to those doing MLM ?<br><br>Just my 2 cents.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone.<br><br>Seems like bad stuff about Venture Era's popping up again after so long. It's now the school holidays and the company's obviously recruiting more people. And MORE YOUNGER PEOPLE THAN THEY SHOULD. If you guys dont believe me, do check out blogger search and browse through some of the blogs which bear accounts of Venture Era.<br><br>I'm not one of them and have never been part of them, but me friend's one. He's still inside however not so much active after been away from there for so long. He's either a Marketing Agent or a Marketing Executive now but I dont know his exact position. He was thinking through about whether to join them back after being inactive for so long and continue inside, because it's somewhat a 'rare business opportunity' that he shouldnt miss (in fact I believe MLM is now about to oversaturate).<br><br>Looking at the current situation of Venture Era as mentioned in here.. Is it true that they are going to move out of Robinson Point soon? Is Venture Era not doing as 'good' as they thought they should back then?<br><br><strong>AND PLEASE ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY IN VENTURE ERA TO SPEAK UP. DONT JUST PUSH THEM DOWN WITH WHATEVER BENEFITS OF MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING WHEN WE DONT KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING INSIDE.</strong><br><br>Legacy, you said you've visited Venture Era a few times and it seems ok to you, for this I believe you. But when was your last visit?<br><br>wealthseeker, please continue. I really wish to know more about what's now happening inside because one of me friends' still inside. I havent got much news about him anymore now that he doesnt mention much about Venture Era inside his blog now..</div>

I went for a few talk too, and i have friends who drop out from it too.<br><br>I am not saying what you mentioned is wrong, i am only merely telling you not to drop to an conclusion so fast without listen to both side of stories.  I did not say you should not say what you know, if you read the replies carefully, i only ask you to not drop to an conclusion with only stories from your friends.<br><br>Anyway i am not defending VE, i am just speaking in view of MLM.
