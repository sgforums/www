I think the way you were posting highlights the negative aspects of several local companies, but yet you declined to tell us more about your own. I don't know, but even as I am just browsing through, it gives me the impression you're trying to put other companies indirectly, but afraid to tell us more about your company, openly here.<br><br>Point noted that this is a VE thread, perhaps you can start your own and give us an intro? I'm sure you agree there is no perfect company as there is always room for improvement. I noticed there are several experts in this forum. Perhaps, through discussion, you can also consider some of the opinions shared and make your team a stronger one?<br><br>Just my 2 cents, and happy cny.</blockquote>early gong xi fa cai to all.<br><br>yes it seems to be that way.<br>you see...<br>sonic had exchanged PMs before the above forum posts, and personal messages can continue that way since direct contact has been established...<br><strong>yet </strong>our suggestion to take it off-thread was avoided, and it seems to be just with an intent to create a "new discussion" away from the VE topic.<br><br>our posts had been pretty much ranting about local co's negative rep, and even talked about how the established (foreign) groups could be a viable option for those truly interested in the industry to seek opportunities with positive experiences (our company &amp; others indirectly discusssed in this way).<br>there is not a need to name names, because if one is truly interested in something away from the local co's, a simple PM would answer one's curiousity instead of the purposeful "demanding" of "so what is your company, huh? huh? huh? ".<br><br>well, your other point... naturally, being a supporter of a particular company, one would definitely have opinions of other companies.<br>we can't deny this.<br>however, as long as <strong>facts </strong>are stated for scrutiny, and not "opinions with no basis"... there can't be much faulted.<br><br>definitely, there are no perfect companies. (hopefully there are those that feature more good than bad characteristics.)<br>starting a new thread will be inappropriate as that will constitute self-advertisement &amp; open us up for a ban.<br>the only way about this now is PM(??)...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello. Just a brief intro about myself. I'm one of the many who have recently completed NS and is (in a way) kenging about means and ways to earn money, such as finding jobs, job hopping and such.<br><br>Imagine my delight when i heard my good friend telling me about a wonderful business opportunity to market some sort of health care product. It totally slipped my mind then that it could actually be of MLM nature, so i promised him to go down to take a look at his office.<br><br>Don't bother trying to venture a guess as to which company.. It was *drum roll* venture era!!! (no pun intended, sorry if u felt insulted)<br><br>Totally had no idea what the heck it was.. I mean, i've heard of friends of mine joining NTI, enyouth, LF, but i havent heard of VE (until now). Just for your info, guys, their new location is the old MDIS building near Eunos MRT station. They took over the basement, 1st and 3rd floor, and i hear they intend to take over the entire building by end 2007. (correct me if i'm wrong, but thats what i heard from one of ur BMs, or whatever u call them)<br><br>Personally, i was rather positive about VE, though the products seemed to make me feel uneasy. Why? Cause i'm gonna be selling them, and i don't believe it is that wonderous. The Calstar water enhancer especially. Before you start shooting me like a bird, let me explain.<br><br>When i went there to take a look at the place, i was introduced only the Calstar water enhancer. It seemed to me like it was their main product, seeing all the hype over it. The tests seemed more like secondary school science to me.<br><br>1. Light bulb lit up not due to water. Water acted as a conductor in the experiment. It merely showed that ur water had IONS in it and NOT power, like what your guy told me. It was connected to an AC power supply.<br>2. Iodine + water = iodine solution (I2) (yellow in colour)<br>Iodine + alkali (OH-) = Iodine ions (I-) (colourless)<br>3. pH8 and above! The fact that u have so much metal ions in water goes to show how much metal hydroxide u dissolve in it. Metals reactive enough will simply dissolve H2, making it alkaline.<br><br>You expect me to buy this? Personally, i felt that this was against my consience. You don't expect me to sell something that i'm doubtful of to people out there, would you?<br><br>But then, i thought there might be some method to this madness, so to get my answers right, i sought the internet. It came as a big shocker that there was no official website for VE. And as for Calstar? The only thing i found was Calstar fishing equipment, and Calstar *** toys. No water enhancer. The forums? Haha.. That's when i saw this trend.<br><br>It seems that this VE company isn't as clean as it seems, and by many accounts here, it seems that many don't agree with MLM companies and their methods. VE had insisted that they were doing NM, and not MLM, and so be it.<br><br>From what i know, this is IMO unethical, unjustified and underhand.<br>Unethical because i would be going against my conscience should i sell these.<br>Unjustified because the price of the product is way overpriced. (i know ur PV but i WILL NOT say it.)<br>Underhand because the first targets are always the people closest to those in the business.<br><br>Though i am unapproving of MLM, all i can say is that MLM is just not my cup of tea, and that what i think is not representative of anyone else but myself. What may work out for others out there may not work out for me. I've since told my friend to stick to his beliefs for the best benefits of VE and hope he and his upline makes it big someday.<br><br>Just a question to <strong>enquiries</strong>, since you're from VE: Why VE no official website one? I only wished to know the benefits of the product and learn more, yet all i find is tons and tons of entries trying to put down ur product? If VE got official website i mebbe join VE liao.<br><br>HUAT AR!</div>
