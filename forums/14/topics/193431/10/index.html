Its those "CHAINED" or "PRYMAID" company.... ok... let me explain...<br><br>EG: I am the Marketing manager...<br>I would have 25% of wat I sell... for easy calculations... take as $25.<br>then under me, I would definately a marketing agent 10%, juniors 15%.....<br>then their if they all sell 1 item like me, i would have<br>25% plus<br>10% plus<br>15%...<br>total 50%... $50.<br><br>then but not forgeting, under a marketing agent they might have their own juniors.... each junior they train is 15%..... so watever sells they have, I'll take 10% from them.... they you may have as many juniors as possible.... so you think, It looked like a Prymaid right??? the higher you sit, he more you get.....<br><br>BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its illegal in Singapore I heard... In China too.... I bought YiFei and Faiz with me tat day.... we're all disappointed... My fren told me this company is him and his frens they build de.... I thought like real... oops... haha.... then the products they sell????<br><br>CalWater...<br>1) Alkaline water (Ph 7.6.... Tap water 7.1-7.2... tested with litmus paper....)<br>2) Energise water (Red Bull but without glucose added... using light bulb... and voltmeter)<br>3) Disinfecting ( It can dilute Iodine better than tap water.... said to Pai du/ clear TOxic)<br>4) Anti ageing... ( tested with rusty nails in tap water and theirs.. tap water cos nails to rust like shit.... theirs is clear... so said to give a protective layer to protect your organs therefore slower down ageing process....)<br>5) Smallest water molecues in the world... (tested with tea leaves... theirs are more concentrated... told normal water, body only absorbs 10% of wat we drink.. theis up to 95%... thus, better absorbtion then not so full... bla bla bla..)<br>6) lastly.. it contains Calcium.... ( they say by taking tablets tat contains complex calcium, will be hard to dilute in water... therefore, hard to abosorbs and watever tat is no properly past out, will got stuck there cosing kidney stones.... theirs using calcium ions, will have better absorbtions cos smaller water molecues....)<br><br><span style="color: red;">[b]haha... I really memorise le lo.... dots... one bottle for $1.6.... then somemore must buy 24 bottles at one go... CRAZY!!!!! imagine New year you come my house I pour mineral water for you drink..... hahaha...<br><br>then they sell tooth paste.... then say can whiten your teeth in 3days and heal ulcers in 3days... pls lo... if whitening power so strong, why dentist need to charge so much for whitening treatment....?? then Colgate is around $3.80 i guess... THEIRS IS $19.9!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! one go need buy 10!!!!<br><br>Imagine after new year, your grandma gave you ang pow $200.... then after new year ask you wat you buy with tat money.... you tell her you spend $199 on tooth paste.... left $1 to buy lolipop or gave her 10 public phone calls...

I'm not interested in PMs and if you guys dont make things clear here, people are going to have more and more misunderstandings about you people angels, including me myself.<br><br>I believe in what me teacher've told me: "People who're in the Marketing Industry lie for a living."

I think sonic16's trying to find out more about your company. I think the way you were posting highlights the negative aspects of several local companies, but yet you declined to tell us more about your own. I don't know, but even as I am just browsing through, it gives me the impression you're trying to put other companies indirectly, but afraid to tell us more about your company, openly here.<br><br>Point noted that this is a VE thread, perhaps you can start your own and give us an intro? I'm sure you agree there is no perfect company as there is always room for improvement. I noticed there are several experts in this forum. Perhaps, through discussion, you can also consider some of the opinions shared and make your team a stronger one?<br><br>Just my 2 cents, and happy cny.</div>
