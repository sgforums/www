            <div class='col-md body'>True, but that shows they have no system in place. They are allowed to do what they want.<br><br>The educational system of the MLM company is very important. You would want all distributors to replicate a successful model. Sadly... most do not have that system in place, or even worse, are teaching the distributors to do the very thing that make mlm name stinky in Singapore.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Argh, my friend intro me to this website and I'm hooked to reading this forum. And the spats, flames and immature insults of cos'! Very interesting to see kids killing each other verbally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> U may ask me why am I interested in this forum out of the blue?

It was a big coincidence cos' I registered online with Adecco and my mum helped me send my resume to various companies.

It's a little cramped but nicely done up. I see NO old ppl at all. Youngsters are everywhere! The girl, call her Miss V, finally came and pick me up. Basic introductions went underway and she proceeded to bring me around the office and introduce the products. She seemed like a nice friendly girl.<br><br>Then, it was time for the presentation, which my friend warned me abt. A group of poly students came in as well. The presenter was wacky with very broken English and asked many qns and expect a response from us. Halfway thru, one gutsy poly guy from their grp stood up and asked the presenter to go straight to the point regarding job scope and salary. The presenter tried to beat around the bush and that made the poly guys all stand up and leave. Eeks, I'm alone, bring me out too, u guys!<br><br>I'm too nice a guy. I've always fantasized myself being a cool arrogant straight talking dude. But in real life, i silently 'pei4 he2' with ppl even when I can't stand them. He began challenging me on qns abt the ionised water. 'What PH do u think newborn baby is?' etc. At some pt, I wanted to slap his face. This young punk couldn't be older than me and acted like he's some uni grad. NS of 2 yrs made me slightly dumb as well, coupled with the unfamiliar surroundings and uneasiness, he got me at some pt. Energy started to seep out of me as I continue to listen to his continuous drivel abt how gd his product is. Somehow, I still maintained my attention and fake smiles to make them feel they've done their job and let me go asap.<br><br>After that bugger was gone, I still had to wait for the darn manager. I was expecting at least 25 years of age. In comes a 17 yrs old, dressed to the nines in office wear. We became talking abt life first, abt his brother being in the same unit that I was frm. It was juz weird talking to this young un' who's speaking and dresses 15 yrs beyond his age. Seriously speaking, I felt inadequate, thinking 'hey this guy looks like he's having a gd time in the company, yet I'm still struggling to find a job'.<br><br>He began to talk to me abt the 'business plan' abt how managers can earn up to 40% commission, and that's NOT including other managerial and car bonuses, commission from ur downlines' sales. He kept talking to me abt cars and how an 18 yr old high achiever has a BMW and his big boss at 26 has a SL something. (Not gd with cars, sry) Is that 18 yr old true? If he is, he muz be damn lucky to clinch so many deals or damn ruthless in his sales methods. Prodigy, yes, but maybe a scion in society. Actually, I wanted to ask, if ur managers earn so damn much, may as well lower the price of the products so that more ppl can afford to buy and in the process promoting product awareness. That'd better in the long run isn't it?<br><br>If manager earns 40%, that damn water and mattress should be only worth 20-30% of the retail price. It's major scam, no matter how u put it. Dun talk to me abt other companies oso having to earn profits. It's juz unfair to earn such a huge profit margin in the $100+++ over unmarketed products. Unless it's way damn popular and ESSENTIAL and patented like Microsoft then lanlan suckthumb buy Windows OS at $400. I put 'essential' in caps cos' I feel those products are good, yes, but not essential. I think 90% of the average household in SG wouldn't pay 1.8k juz to filter water or purify the air. As it is, my parents are complaining that after I ORD and spend more time on the computer, the electricity bill is rising to $100. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>He finally finishes his crap and I can't wait to leave! I finally get a peek at my watch and... 2 hrs had passed... Holy crap... Mega machine gun talkers... As I was abt to leave, Miss V said she arranged for a meetup with her direct manager. 2x Holy Crap. I said it's getting late and I have to leave but she said 5 mins was enough. Being the nice guy, I obliged... AGAIN! This time, it's some poly Malay gal young un'. She's very friendly but she began using MLM cliched phrases like 'u've nth to lose rite?' and I knew I had to leave asap. Before leaving, she fixed an appt with me tml at 2 pm! WTH! I said I may not be free and I'll give a reply to Miss V. Yay, I started to go to the MRT. Before Miss V left, she fixed another appt with me! WTH! Double whammy... I said I'll msg her and quickly fled.<br><br>I've juz msged her that I'm not interested and I'm glad I did after reading these forums abt MLM. Anyway, sales isn't my cup o tea. OH YA! Why I didn't shoot her the first thing I see her, since she promised admin or cuts svc jobs? It's sales and damn sales. Miss V, if u're reading this, u're a nice host, if u luv this job, continue to do well, but be wary. U mentioned that Venture Era has no politics, I wanted to tell u this, but slipped my mind. Cos' everyone depends on one another to move up the nxt lvl! It's a more subtle form of politics. But politics nevertheless. If u successfully recruited me, wouldn't u have made use of me when I clinch a deal and 5% of the profits goes to u? I've come to realise 'manager' is juz a name, not in the real sense of the position. Clinch enough deals and u become a 'manager' and be a gd korkor or jiejie to ur downlines as a 'mentor'. Names and titles give a false sense of security.<br><br>As for me, I prefer fulfilment in life rather than mindless pursuit of wealth. I wouldn't feel good even if I earn 10k by coercing ppl buying these products and not relying on my skills to eke a living. (Gift of the gab is not considered a skill to me) As I told u, when I go into the workforce in future, I want my original creations to impact the society. I'm into computer game design, hoping to make a new phenomena like the Final Fantasy series or CS. Then, when I earn big, I can proudly proclaim that it's all part of my toil, not selling sth which u dun even know works and juz selling for monetary gains. Money to me is secondary. If I get my original product out in the market, I'll be a very fulfilled man already. Miss V, u're still young, surely u have dreams to pursue instead of juz earning a fortune and retiring at 30, which u told me abt? Singing, acting, dancing, retail, art, none of these? The human soul needs to be fulfilled, and money can't do that. Nevertheless, all the best to u!<br></div>

I said I may not be free and I'll give a reply to Miss V. Yay, I started to go to the MRT. Before Miss V left, she fixed another appt with me! WTH! Double whammy... I said I'll msg her and quickly fled.<br><br>I've juz msged her that I'm not interested and I'm glad I did after reading these forums abt MLM. Anyway, sales isn't my cup o tea. OH YA! Why I didn't shoot her the first thing I see her, since she promised admin or cuts svc jobs? It's sales and damn sales. Miss V, if u're reading this, u're a nice host, if u luv this job, continue to do well, but be wary. U mentioned that Venture Era has no politics, I wanted to tell u this, but slipped my mind. Cos' everyone depends on one another to move up the nxt lvl! It's a more subtle form of politics. But politics nevertheless. If u successfully recruited me, wouldn't u have made use of me when I clinch a deal and 5% of the profits goes to u? I've come to realise 'manager' is juz a name, not in the real sense of the position. Clinch enough deals and u become a 'manager' and be a gd korkor or jiejie to ur downlines as a 'mentor'. Names and titles give a false sense of security.<br><br>As for me, I prefer fulfilment in life rather than mindless pursuit of wealth. I wouldn't feel good even if I earn 10k by coercing ppl buying these products and not relying on my skills to eke a living. (Gift of the gab is not considered a skill to me) As I told u, when I go into the workforce in future, I want my original creations to impact the society. I'm into computer game design, hoping to make a new phenomena like the Final Fantasy series or CS. Then, when I earn big, I can proudly proclaim that it's all part of my toil, not selling sth which u dun even know works and juz selling for monetary gains. Money to me is secondary. If I get my original product out in the market, I'll be a very fulfilled man already. Miss V, u're still young, surely u have dreams to pursue instead of juz earning a fortune and retiring at 30, which u told me abt? Singing, acting, dancing, retail, art, none of these? The human soul needs to be fulfilled, and money can't do that. Nevertheless, all the best to u!<br></div></blockquote>yea..<br>my fren once ask me there to listen a short talk n being nice guy i go n more n more things happen... end up i buay tahan cos not interested at all i finally reject n went off...really cant stand it..<br>STUCK there for long hrs n they fix date for u..like wont let u off...<br>scary...</div>

But as a new recruit, who's ur immediate network and potential customer? Of cos' it's ur friends and family. To promote from blardy recruit to a Marketing Executive, u need to clinch 1 deal. So u would make at least 1 friend/relative a victim before u find others from their extended network so u dun feel so guilty.<br><br>For me, I can't do such things. Integrity and honesty comes first.

As I said in my first long post, if a BGM can earn 40% commission from the sale, it means the product is not even worth 20-30% of its cost price.

(unless it's a proven Bu Lao Xian Dan <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) Wouldn't u feel guilty selling this thing to ur friends/relatives, knowing that at least 40% (not counting other mangerial and car bonuses) goes to the company as profits? It's alot for a 2k product, my dear. Especially for an unmarketed product.<br><br>Shi Li? Dun make me laugh... K la, sales also need abit of skills and communication skills.

In the wrong way... In my 2 hrs in VE, I keep hearing abt dreams being fulfilled before 30, millionaire in 5 years, BMW even before u're of legal age to get a license etc...<br><br>C'mon, u think it's so easy? So are u a millionaire or BMW owner right now? Reality check, reality check man! Look around u in ur office. Who are the BMW owners? Perhaps only ur big bosses and an occassional high flyer (maybe thru sucking bosses' LJ). I give u a year to earn ur BMW, since they're always so optimistic and say that within 2 yrs, u get ur BMW. Prove me wrong.<br><br>Even if u do get ur BMW, in the process, do u feel happy? What do I mean from that? U have to constantly climb ur way up from ME(P), ME, MM, BM, BGM at least. Which means u're constantly selling overpriced products which u urself have nv tested but believed in the ISO and sweet talking presentation of ur seniors to loved ones around u, using hard and sell tactics to bug ppl to buy. At the same time, desperately recruiting more young uns' like urself and reaping the benefits off them when they clinch deals. It's a damn vicious cycle.<br><br>Since a VE guy in these forums used Christianity as an example, I shall quote one myself. What good is it for u to gain the whole world but lose ur soul? Ponder over it.</div>

But as a new recruit, who's ur immediate network and potential customer? Of cos' it's ur friends and family. To promote from blardy recruit to a Marketing Executive, u need to clinch 1 deal. So u would make at least 1 friend/relative a victim before u find others from their extended network so u dun feel so guilty.<br><br>For me, I can't do such things. Integrity and honesty comes first. How many fresh MLMers go to the streets and promote the products to strangers? (which I feel is better, instead of targetting loved ones who have a weak spot for u) I dare say close to none.<br><br>Then u would shoot back at me. What the hell am I talking about 'victim' and 'integrity'? The products are genuine and MLM is a legitimate business, aren't they? That, I do not doubt, what I'm concerned abt is the details behind it.<br><br>The products are way overpriced. As I said in my first long post, if a BGM can earn 40% commission from the sale, it means the product is not even worth 20-30% of its cost price. How good the shit is, it doesn't warrant such a big profit margin. (unless it's a proven Bu Lao Xian Dan <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) Wouldn't u feel guilty selling this thing to ur friends/relatives, knowing that at least 40% (not counting other mangerial and car bonuses) goes to the company as profits? It's alot for a 2k product, my dear. Especially for an unmarketed product.<br><br>Shi Li? Dun make me laugh... K la, sales also need abit of skills and communication skills.

Nevertheless... I think u didn't get my point... Anyway, how do u know the products are gd in the first place? Did ur company let u try their products for at least 1 mth FREE OF CHARGE? Matters regarding health, u need time, at least 1 month or 2, to decide if it's the real deal. Or do u juz blindly follow ur seniors' blabbering of how gd the product is and assumed it's good cos' of the ISO? Even if they're gd, u would want to sell that grossly overpriced thing to ur relatives when u noe there are cheaper and more effective method to improve their health out there? Seriously, I rather buy those $100-$200 lingzhi, ginseng and royal bee jelly when I go overseas.<br><br>And tell me truthfully, when u sell these to ur relatives, u're actually thinking abt their health? Or the money? C'mon, fess' up. Even if u love ur family so much that u want them to improve their health thru the product, U'LL buy for them, not the other way round. Dun tell me u're some angel from the sky la. I dun take such bullsh!t. Yes, Singaporeans are getting smarter already so dun expect much sales too... And even if they're gullible enough to believe u, most ppl here can't afford 2k for a damn mattress.<br><br>Yes, handphones and MP3 players are all overpriced. But considering the immense research behind these products, size of company to maintain, good advertising and marketing, I'm willing to pay that abit more. Another thing is regarding monopoly or oligopoly... Or do u even understand the terms? Not Monopoly board game hor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I dunno why ppl keep raking up Microsoft example to justify MLM high prices of their products. Bill Gates is a damn genius and he created a monopoly and patented his product. That kind of man, I respect. Buy 1 OS $400 lanlan suckthumb la. Cos' u can't buy it anywhere else. (unless u're talking abt pirated. Cheapskate!)<br><br>What of MLM? The company of the products are in no means of gaining monopoly soon otherwise it would already saturate the commercial market. U can easily find alternative products elsewhere, possibly cheaper and better. MLM companies are not megaloth industries as well. Most only occupy 1 floor of the business building. And they do no advertising at all, instead relying on hard and sell tactics on the streets, thru personal network. No $ involved.<br><br>So the factors which I mentioned that I dun mind paying high prices for doesn't apply to MLM products. So in conclusion, comparatively to big companies, MLM have low maintenance bills, MLM doesn't spend money on advertisement, MLM doesn't spend money on research but juz leech other ppl's products to sell, the products are not well known and thus achieving little to no share in the market for similar products, MLM dun even give their workers basic pay! So pls give me better reasons the next time u reply.<br><br>I'm a very open minded person. It's just that I dun agree with MLM's philopsophy. I think the MLM companies should abolish that business plan and revert back into conventional sales companies. The business plan wrecks more lives than benefits. I've personally seen my friend downspiral. He began bugging all my immediate contacts to buy his products, even one time begging me to lend him money. As a nice guy, I did, and until today, he hasn't return it back yet.</div>
