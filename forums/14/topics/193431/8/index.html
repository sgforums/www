That comes to another point, the manager told me that fresh uni graduates earn max up to $2k a mth only while they can constantly earn beyond that. Machiam trying to deter me to study and making me do business full time. For the sake of every naive guy in this forum trying to earn it big thru MLM, now's 21st century, it doesn't work that way. U still need that knowledge and abilities to tackle bigger business plans. U can't possibly keep relying on ur broken ENGRISH to eke a living for a lifetime. Yea... So... Pursue knowledge and dun be naive to think there's an easy way, guys!<br><br>Dun say my language power leh... I'll blush...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Arrr, but I dun have thick skin so I can't do MLM. I can't talk with a straight face, like nothing's wrong and everything's good, when I noe my company and I will make 50% or more profits off him/her. If the buyer is an arrogant rich kid, knn I'll be happy to rip him off la! But 99% of Singapore's population is made up of the humble down-to-earth average household living in HDB. I juz can't do it.<br><br>Eh, juz joking niaz... Dun take it so seriously... But really wad, u talk like MLMer then got my full fury... Now u say u're not... I feel guilty of bombarding u leh... enquiries seem like a normal guy to me, despite being in MLM, so he wun be next la... Unless he goes the cliched route of saying "U can get ur BMW in 2 yrs! 8-5 boring, this job is freelance, u can work from home and earn more than 8-5!

I feel that his answers are satisfactory so I shall rest my case with VE for now.<br><br>enquiries, as I said on my PM, pls educate not only ur business group but the rest as well. I notice certain typical bogus MLM trends in my 2 hr stay in VE, which is why I was a little agitated in my initial posts.<br><br>I mentioned abt the misleading recruitment phone call, ya? If any of my close friends get false hopes of landing a stable job in VE after listening to a phonecall from a VE recruiter, VE will definitely have hell to pay. (at least on this forums. Relax... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>Also, pls dun make ur recruits too over optimistic. The manager who discussed the business plan with me made it sound like 'tian yi wu feng' plan of gaining riches and mentions a car name at least once in every 3 sentences. What they didn't address is the low success rate and the high dropout rate as well. Not everyone is suited to do sales or specifically MLM sales. Pls offer both sides of the story to give recruits a full picture.<br><br>Another bogus MLM trend I notice in VE is that the recruiter is over zealous and eager to make u stay. Without my consent, she immediately set an appointment the NEXT DAY. For a jobseeker, it's too good to be true, right? Well, luckily, I'm slightly better informed. They should spend more time to actually do the damn interview to decide if I'm suitable or not. What if I'm a criminal or whatever and u guys juz blindly recruit? Goes to show that u guys are in need of quantity like most MLM companies to build a bigger pyramid, and not quality.<br><br>I also acknowledge the fact that black sheep are always existent in a company, no matter how good it is. Hope u would take action on what I've highlighted and I believe VE would be one of the better MLM companies out there. (Why I always type long posts ah... Argh... Can't help it...)
