            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, i must state that I am not against the company. But just my personal point of view. Every system in a MLM company works. However, to fork out 16k is rather risky. Reason is this is the same as buying back stock to stock in your place to sell. If you are able to sell out the stock is ok but what if it happen the other way round? Some reason why people in Singapore cannot accept networking is because some have diff point of view. Some is agent did not do the necessary customer services (they call it hit and run) after selling resulting in customer complaining and pointing finger at company rather than agent. Another reason is it is rather unhealthy to buy stock and keep because if you can't sell them out, you will lost and might spread to people saying networking cannot work therefore resulting more people being negative towards network marketing.<br><br>vksg</div>

We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view, you ridiculous little carnival freak. How about putting that into proper syntax, form, and grammar so that I can at least understand what you are saying before I dismiss it?<br><br>When I want your monkey-brained opinion I'll rattle your cage, okay? You're just another Internet-addicted idiot suffering from diarrhea of the mouth and constipation of the mind. If you knew what you're talking about, you'd be dangerous. As Ellen Glasgow once remarked: "He knows so little and knows it so fluently."<br><br>Reading your post is less interesting than watching paint dry. If wit was spit, your mouth would be drier than a shallow well in an African heat wave. There's nothing wrong with you that couldn't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet, or, better yet, suicide. Maybe you wouldn't come across as such a jellyfish-sucking mental midget if that pimple on your ass hadn't turned out to be a brain tumor; if your weren't so grossly fat that you have to put your belt on with a boomerang, or if you didn't have a face that people rub tree branches on to make ugly sticks. No, come to think of it, you would.<br><br>In future, if you have something to say, just shut up.</div>

Must understand the system first... I'm from BelAir also, and still a Franchisee. Wanted to cut count but no $$, so stay as a Franchisee... Make good use of the trainings provided. I first started becoz of the product. It's very unique and consumable... Go for more talks and ask the person who intro u there if there's any queries. Don't put in the $$ if you don't feel comfortable or is not convinced by everything. Judge for yourself and confidence is more impt than the 16k. All the best and see you on the top. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
