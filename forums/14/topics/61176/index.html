            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys,<br>this is urgent news! Now I have mentioned James Phang might have turned NOP into an investment unit, and running ntiparis at the same time. This just came in on Friday. Please read the ST article carefully.<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,226015,00.html<br><br>Many points I have noted.<br><br>1) One of the sgforumers confirmed NOP was used to be behind Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre in Arumugam Road. This NOP investment, according the ST report is also there. The victims were referred to an office in Shenton Way, voila, thats where ntiparis is<br><br>2) Many members were not informed of the cancelled projects, and offices were moved without informing members.<br><br>3) Many people were approached by saleman and in roadshows. Thought such mega project must be held at permanent exhibitions and company premises and the likes.<br><br>Hope professionals in this industry can comment on this.<br><br>Well, is this the beginning of the end?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Copied from "New MLM company - M.I.T' thread</div>

I wouldn't allow pple to say anything bad about my company.. but if u would like to know more.. how can i contact u?</div></blockquote>Now notyboy,<br>the original intention of this topic was firstly not to flame ntiparis, but rather to analyse whats going on in ntiparis.  Thats why I try to get people to put their views forward. When I was at nti, I thought James Phang is revolutionising the whole MLM industry in Singapore, by putting several features I have not seen before in other MLM companies. But the more I research on it, for example, talking to people inside the company, contacting experienced networkers, talking people who has been in commodities scams before,researching on binary, so on and so forth, somehow, there are few misgivings about nti that I have.<br><br>In this case, for those who wants to find out more can go down and see for yourself, no harm done. Whatever I mentioned in the ntiparis thread, they can verify for themselves. As to notyboy, I suggest you do not quickly put your loyalty down to ntiparis. I have relent long time ago that I cannot convince ntiparis members there are something wrong. Nastily said, no offence here, many MLM companies have mastered what I called brainwashing, motivational, ra ra training sessions. In fact, I am quite scared by you "not allowing people to speak bad things about your company"<br><br>Btw, for me, whenever I go around looking at companies, I have strict criteria to follow. Most importantly, I am not impressed by cheques, cars, registration of business certificates, documentations, luxurious office space in Shenton Way and stuff.<br><br>Truthfully, commodities scams and pyramids have the above features too. Been researching, and I can tell you past and present scams from Tanjong Pagar to City Hall &amp; Suntec. I can also tell you there are re emergence of commodities scams. Ferris Wheel and HallrichRaiders of past are redoing the same 'biz' again.<br>I can link you to people who are insiders, but in return, if you dont keep your mouth shut about what they tell you, be prepare to go MIA from your family.<br><br>The basic principles of looking for good and legal MLM are two points. Look at quantummechanic posts under another nti thread in kopitiam.Its a good post.  Plus another one is.....how you earn the money? Where does the earning of the money focus on? Recruitment or products? These are actually not simple questions. Think about them.<br><br>Another point. As to the reason why MLM was legalised year 2000/2001, look at the case of S888.com. And surprise, surprise, I read an article, where it pointed out S888.com legally did not break any law, but runs in the spirit of a pyramid. ntiparis may not be physically breaking any law, but only experienced networkers and CAD SPF can sniff thru the flaws and loopholes.<br><br>Lastly, why I do not wish to meet you. The reason is simple. If you are from AMH, Amway and such companies, and feel that I have flame your company, I am obliged to contact and explain. But you are from ntiparis. Truthfully, I am f***king scared of ntiparis. You have not been out there, talking to people who are once participated in scams. Certain truth are hard to swallow, and believe me, what you do not know, wont harm you.<br><br>PS: If you wish to know more, put it that way, I do not believe the framework of ntiparis business structure is James Phang's brainchild.<br><br></div>

Put it that way, I will be 'kiling' a lot of friends along the way. So no can do. Apologies.<br><br>Btw, seriously, I am tired of discussing about ntiparis. Not because this topic is mei wan mei liao. The wan and the liao I can predict. Main things are like AMH, you wont know the flaws until the company is around for fairly some time. ntiparis is still a new company. For experienced people they can see it from the beginning.For the rest? Suck thumb?I was always told this criteria by some people, look for companies that are formed and established beyond five years or ten years. I was against this, becos it means losing out on good companies. But as I seen more companies, I suggest everyone adhere to this rule.Flexibly though, hehe.<br><br>Of course, once you found good one, stick with it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>I am a student. I am writing this because I have just came back from the NTI Paris office in Shenton Way. I was asked to go there by a friend who was in turned invited by an NTI Paris employee. Now, after listening to 2 hours of drivel from the NTI employee, all I have to say is that NTI Paris is a devious and despicable pyramid scam, and I swear I will do everything in my power to bring it down before it harms more innocents.<br><br>Pardon me if I am wrong, but isn't the main concept of any business, MLM or not, to sell *products* and not to recruit people into the company for monetary gains? This was the overwhelming impression that I was given at NTI Paris. The employee who talked to me consistently refused to answer questions about the actual products (aromatherapy stuff) that they were selling, concentrating instead on the amount of money that I can earn each month by building up the pyramid under me. He emphasized very strongly on the fact that money is mainly made from recruitment; each time someone joins your binary-downlink tree, you get money from it. When questioned about what the company actually have to does for a living, he evaded the question, and zealously went back to talking about the immense monetary benefits of creating "business centers." He continuously points to the benefits of buying business centers and bringing in more people to the fold, going so far as to warn me not to spread the word too much, because as of now, I am "not sufficiently trained to advertise the company," and that the time will come when I will be sufficiently trained to advertise this business plan to further recruits.<br><br>Now this begs the question, if the business plan is so amazingly good that every employee become instant millionaires if they work hard enough, then why is there a need for such secrecy? Also, and the more pertinent question is, WHERE DOES ALL THIS MONEY COME FROM? Simple mathematics will tell you that it comes from all the people at the bottom of the pyramid, the people who have been sweet-talked into giving hundreds or even thousands on dollars to the company, with no hope of getting any returns either because the market is already saturated, or because the people at the top of the pyramid has run away with all the money. The NTI Paris employee frequently brings up the subject of "following your dreams" and "becoming what you want to be," as do most MLM employees in this thread. I encourage people to do their best in life too, and to strive to make as much money as they can, if that is indeed their aim. But the question is, AT WHAT COST? Is it worth it financing your dreams by bilking other people out of their hard-earned money? That is crime, and at a time like this, I cannot possibly condone such dastardly business acts.<br><br>The names "James Phang" and "Dato Dr. Eric Tan Eng Huat" was frequently mentioned during my talk with the NTI Paris employee. It was mentioned in such reverence, suggesting that they are saintly figures who have made it rich, and are interested in helping us commoners to be "part of the wealth" too. Believe none of this. If indeed they are aware of this, they are cheats indeed, and very malicious ones too. They are the rich who wants to get richer by swindling the poor of even more wealth. Charitable businessmen? More like decadent frauds. And the employees who use their names as part of the recruitment speech should be deeply ashamed.<br><br>Now you may ask, why am I so outraged? Am I working for another MLM that wants to see NTI Paris go down? No, I am not. In fact, I stand to gain nothing from NTI Paris' demise, if that occurs. But I do have friends who have invested much of their money in the scheme, and are prepared to further recruit more innocent people into the scheme to finance their earnings. They do not realize that the business plan is fundamentally flawed, or that the money that they get comes from people at the "bottom of the pile." It is never a Win-Win situation, it is Win-Lose; the people at the top of the pyramid gets richer, the people at the bottom gets poorer. And don't pull the curtains over my eyes by telling me that the pyramid can go on getting deeper forever ... a fool is born every minute, but a binary tree made up of "business partners" won't go beyond 50 levels even if you include all the people who have ever set foot on the earth, past and present.<br><br>There is never easy money. Not lawful ones anyway (excluding the one-in-a-million chance of a lottery ticket). It pains me to see my friends getting their money sucked into this deceitful scheme. And so I must speak out, before more people get cheated of their/ their parent's hard earned money.</div>
