              <p>you must educate yourselves about<strong> the difference between MLM &amp; a "pyramid scheme".</strong> there are so many ways to know the difference, online, offline. You can even hear very successful people telling you the difference between MLM &amp; a "pyramid scheme".</p>
              <p>yet, i feel <strong>majority of people jump into a conclusion</strong> that all MLM companies are "pyramid schemes". </p>
              <p>i'm 20 years old, been doing MLM for about a year, and i've never had any problems with any of the companies i've been with. right now, i'm with a company that has just started out, so us, being pioneers, we have to educate ourselves about all the major companies like Amway, Herbalife and such, and how they got to where they are now.</p>
              <p>disbelievers need not comment, because you're wasting your time and mine attending to your<em> insufficient knowledge</em> of the industry.</p>
              <p>cheers to success :)</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: xx-large;">5 Factors To Look For Before You Join Any Network Marketing Company</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The interest in MLM companies has increased so much in the last years. With this interest growth, many new companies have sprung up to join the ranks of the time-tested, older MLM companies. If a motivated person is considering a part-time or even a full time career in the MLM business or also known as network marketing, or just want to see how their current position measures up, there are certain critical factors to look for when choosing an MLM company. There are enough things to be concerned about when building a MLM business, such as sponsoring and advertising, without having to think about whether or not your company will be around next year.<br> <br>    The first factor to consider is stability. It would be the ideal situation to select an MLM company has been around and in business for at least 2 to 6 years. The new start-up MLM companies can be exciting, but there really is something related to the idea of MLM companies that have been around for an extended period of time. Actually, the longer time the MLM company has been around, betters the chance of sticking with it. There are enough things to be concerned about when building a MLM career, such as sponsoring and advertising, without having to think about whether or not the MLM company will be around next year. The person interested in a MLM company should realize that there are never any guarantees, but with a company that has a longer track record generally has more chances of sticking around.<br> <br>    The second factor is to look at the leadership within the MLM company. Factors to examine include the structure, track record, and other such internal factors of the MLM company. If a person does not know the answer to these questions, call or email the company to find out. It is critical to know the answers to these questions from the beginning. The most desired attributes in the MLM company leader is savvy, honesty, and integrity inside and outside of the MLM business world.<br> <br>    The third factor is an examination of the product or service being promoted by the MLM company. Discover if there's a genuine emphasis on promotion the product and not just the opportunity. Determine the value of the product for the MLM company as well as the value to the market. In addition, the products should be competitively priced, and unique.<br> <br>    The fourth factor is to examine the method of getting started in the particular MLM company. Can people join online, or do they have to fill out paper forms and meet with someone offline in an office? The ability to sign up online makes the whole process a lot simpler. On the same page, having the ability and option to join free will open up your opportunity to even more people. Some MLM companies allow people to join at no charge or at least take a test drive to allow them to see the insides of the business. Once someone has joined free, they have partially committed to the business. <br> <br>    The last factor involves the automation capabilities of the MLM company. More automation in the MLM company is definitely a better option. The parent company should provide a MLM company website that prospects can be referred to. The prospect should be able to contact you from that specific page, and the MLM company should send emails that follow up with the prospects.</p>
