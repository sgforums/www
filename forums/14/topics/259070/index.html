            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FireIce:</div><div class="quote_body">so tts where the money go to.</div></blockquote>Fire Ice hit the jackpot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There are a few issues that can be discussed arising from the fact that a MLM company is using/funding pageants as a form of marketing/advertisement .<br><br>* Role of Corporate Governance/ funding for pageants<br>Major pageants often cost anything from $50k-$250k to run. Hence there is always a need to source for sponsorship:<br><br>- Cash Prizes for winners<br>- Vouchers/prizes in kind for contestants<br>- Gown sponsors<br>- Makeup/hair sponsors<br>- Venue sponsors<br>- Choreographer/ fashion stylist<br>- Grooming/catwalk trainer<br>- MC, sound, lights, stage sponsors<br><br>If sponsorships for the above mentioned are not possible. The the organise would have to risk running it at a loss which can be a substantial amount. However, the following can be done to offset some of the costing.<br><br>- Tickets for preview/pre-final shows<br>- Tickets for actual finals<br>- Rental of gowns<br>- Paid makeup/hair services<br>- SMS voting<br>- Print brochure and sell advertisements<br><br>However, its still a very risky business as only a minority of pageants ever break even, with most making loss/huge loss. Some of these losses contribute to the non-payment of prize money to winners, contractors etc which makes it a even worst marketing exercise for all involved.<br><br>Hence as a MLM company, there should be adequate cost benefit analysis/ cost effective analysis done to fund and start such pageants. As a majority of the funds in any MLM comes from investors and other stakeholders, funds should only be used if there is a contingency plan in place to minimise any loss sustained.<br><br>Corporate governance plays a part in minimising unnecessary risk to the company funds which can be used in other lower risks ventures. Proper accountability will ensure that loss is kept at a minimum and every action properly monitored and accountable by the committee in charge.</div>

Yes, LFI do have plenty of extremely good presenters. They are so freaking passionate, knowledgable &amp; some of the are quite frankly extremely charismatic. I personally know a few of them. So it is no wonder that all people need is to come down once to be convinced, or in your own words "brainwashed". In my opinion, only people with no opinion of their owns or weak willed can be brainwashed. Birds of the same feather flock together too.<br><br>The other side of the coin is this. Your friend came down. He / She saw what the products are all about, what they can do, how they can help people, how HUGE the market for these products is, &amp; also saw the potential of the MLM industry, the potential of the company, etc. They saw AN opportunity. They grabbed it.<br><br>So which is the case? Do you dare to find out for ourself, no strings attached?<br><br>Anyway, seriously, I think brainwashing is not a very nice word to use, irregardless of the context. We follow our parents religion without really understanding what are the teachings, is this brainwashing? We usually accept close friend's suggestions, isn't this also brainwashing? Especially when a friend makes a bad recommendation &amp; yet we do not "sever ties" or "get back at them". We just let it go like water rolling off a duck's back.<br><br>Cheers!!!</div>
