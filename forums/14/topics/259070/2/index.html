Has the accounting been done to see how much deficit has been incurred so far?<br><br>* Engagement fees for Mediacorp MCs- 4.5-20K/per artiste depending on who you<br>* Appearance fees for Mediacorp Artiste- 2-10K/per artiste depending on A/B/newcomer list<br><br>2a. You have not answered my questions on the selection criteria. For example, you have 5 slots to send, you cant be sending a chinese/malaysian national, someone over the age of 21, someone shorter than 1.65m to the Miss World Singapore contest right? So who gets to represent the company in the end? Or continue to send these representatives even though they cant even win or represent Singapore?<br><br>2b. How much is the price of sponsorship for the 5 slots? Since you mentioned that its a national event, what would other individual contestants in the pageant think about these 5 slots, since they have to go through a preliminary audition, 2 preview shows, 2 semi-final shows, 2 final preview shows and the final itself? Will there be a perception of biasness since the Miss LFI entrants do not need to spend so much time and effort? Will the company entrants get ostracised by the rest of the finalist? Or is there a need for all the finalist to buy your products and endorse them in order to just appear in 3 times instead of the 7-8 times required over the duration of the pageant?<br><br>2c. Gosh, the company is sponsoring enough cash for the pageant to go on national TV? It cost $500k to $1.5 million for a pageant to go on National TV? U sure its a wise move for the company? Hey must think 10 times before committing man!<br><br>3. Not all the contestants are long term users of your company products, as mentioned by at least 1 contestants during the semi-final stage. If you want them to endorse the product, must start giving them lots of free samples and monitor their long term usage and any improvements achieved. More scientific basis la. Proper clinical trials la.<br><br>Cheers anyway for a good show. So who were the top 5?

They all taller then me la since i 165 cm tall and they seems taller then me. c.. no other pple will complian.. cuz those are the one who make use of the opportunities .. go through interviews etc..<br><br>2c. definately a good move. make things easiler for us agents to prospect and bring more income. the sales of product being doing very good for the past year and we can earn back that million spent !!<br><br>3. haha some of them only a month old in the company only. cuz one in order to take part the competition have to be our member. so they are related to us and our MLM company.  . a month is all we need to see alot of results from the product man (OF course u need to discipline urself to use the product to get the result asap)...  some of them got before and after la. definately a change lor.<br><br>i not yet get the photos up yet.. stay tune. Or u can come down to our company and c them ur self !! haha definately a welcome</div>
