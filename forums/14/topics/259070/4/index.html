I have no issue with the product but I have issues with how information are being given to the public. LFI will have front line sales. What make you so sure they wont advertise to treat any diseases forbidden under the law. In the LFI pageant, there are many who have violated the advertising protocol by stating that their products can treat the diseases. Proper education/protocols/SOPs by registered medical professionals to all Representatives of LFI should be done before allowing them to go out and represent the products/company. Regular seminars to update these reps and enforce their knowledge. A certification process to make sure that the rep have the required skills and knowledge to promote the product.<br><br>Action speaks louder than words. If LFI is here to stay, you better make sure the customers' welfare is well taken of and the company is not profit driven solely. Of course, there should be ISO certification so there will be a avenue for customer feedback and complain. I would love to be able to complain and see appropriate action taken against errant LFI reps that come and tell me their products can treat a hell lot of diseases and show me testimonials of customers who have recovered miraculously from certain diseases. Its very funny when these reps realise who I am and what I do, you should take a look at their shocked expression when I pass them my namecard. So, if you have a official complain mechanism, let me know.<br><br>Crap talk is always crap talk. Never compromise the welfare of your customers for utmost profits. This is the take home message I have for you guys.<br><br>Good luck.</div>
