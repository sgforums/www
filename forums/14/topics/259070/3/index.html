I said I was once a black sheep, but of course under the advise of some experienced MLMers, I attended lessons over &amp; over again &amp; talked less, listened more. I got my facts right &amp; therefore increased my understanding &amp; appreciation for this business model.

Also stating that everybody must keep an open mind, not directing that remark at you. Not to compare company or compensation plan, just meet new people. Come out drink coffee or alcohol or makan is a good enough reason to meet people mah. I already have a stable network going, why on earth would you think people want to meet you just to recruit you? Are you of such good quality that people are dying to recruit you? I do not want any Tom, Dick or Harry in my network because I have to be responsible for their growth. You want to meet 5-figure income earners for what reason then? Since you say such people willl only try to recruit people. Anyway meeting only 5-figure income earners does not meann you will make 5-figure.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
