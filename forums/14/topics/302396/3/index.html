First look at quality, is it good? Generally speaking more famous brands have a higher standard. And they maintain it to keep their reputation up.<br><br>And reputation. Why the "good reputation"? Is it because it has a long history? Good quality (from outside sources, not coslab agents or coslab reports)?

              <p>Hi, new over here,just happening to drop by this forum introduced by some new friends and decided to join it up because of the dicussions on coslab here.</p>
              <p>also just happen that recently i have join coslab on their investment scheme,is it true that they opening beatuy salon by using our money and also are the monthly rebates guarantee.Cause by seeing the statments here make i starting to get afriad there i will not get back my money???</p>
              <p>So i think that i should pull out of it asap, cause i don't want to be trapped in something that bluff and cheat someone else money.Money is not easy to earn, i will join because i trust my friend who intro me into it, now i think i cannot trust him anymore.He is a cheater</p>

              <p>i understand what you mean,my friend,i truly understand why people like you will say like this.Why will i have this kind of thought is because i'm not happy about the way how they are doing,the way they are doing it are somehow cheating people into it and i have told my friend who had intro me into coslab that i won't to withdraw, but is scared that i cannot take any money back.</p>
              <p>I'm very scared about this point,because money is not easy to earn(like in my previous post).But i think that it is the end of my hard earned money...</p>
              <p>Cheers &amp; thanks for the advices.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dunno but i am still quite new about mlm so i cannot give u 100% advice but like what u say money is not easy to earn..using your money in the right time on the right tings is very important..and i feel that if there are consumers who felt cheated,such companies are definitely not very reliable and have to consider twice before making any impt decisions to get involve in the company..</div>

              <p>So it seems to me now that Coslab most probably should be a scam company right?</p>
              <p>But is there any experts who can really show real evidence about how everything and their planning actually works and is there anyone really getting cheated by them??</p>
              <p>Few days ago my sec friends got another bunch of my friends to join them and they did. They say brother together, gether larh!! then I tiam tiam nothing to say. I really don't want to offend them and I can't do anything.......</p>
              <p>Hope someone can give me good advices please... I really need it. For Coslab may be the company which F our relationships upside and backside down</p>
