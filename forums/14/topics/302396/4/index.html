              <p>But there's only so much you can do. You should respect your friend enough to allow him to make his own decisions. However, what you can do is to try to help him make an <em>informed</em> decision.</p>
              <p>This doesn't mean telling him that MLMs suck. It means asking the right questions and presenting well thought out arguments and points so that he can make his own decision. Your friend is probably being encouraged <em>not</em> to think and told that it takes a positive attitude to succeed. Each day, he's being told that the "business model" works! Each day, he sees his "successful" uplines and he's told that he can be as successful as well! He's being told that by introducing his friends and relatives into the MLM, he's really helping them!</p>
              <p>He's being told not to listen to critics because they are losers! Those people just don't have the will to succeed. They are not able to break out of their slave wage paradigm! But you... you are different. I can see you have the drive to succeed. The business model is proven! All you have to do is to follow it. Do what your uplines tell you and there's no way you can fail. Don't listen to people who criticize MLMs - they are just clinging on to old business models and are unable to recognize the revolution of MLMs.</p>
              <p>So don't criticize MLMs when you talk to him. If you do so, you become the person he's not supposed to listen to. He will shut himself off so he can avoid the negativity.</p>
              <p>Instead, you should show genuine interest. Tell him you really want to understand how the system works. Maybe he will refer you to his upline. That's fine. Talk to the upline as long as your friend is listening in.</p>
              <p>Tell them you are interested and of course you want to be rich. Who doesn't? Who doesn't want to be able to own a nice car, to have financial freedom and the ability to support their family in luxury. But you need to understand the system. Before you can convince others, you need to convince yourself. You need to understand it so that you can confidently go out and explain to others what a great business model it is.</p>
              <p>They will tell you that you don't need to understand. You should leave it to the uplines who are more experienced.  They will help you to explain. They will do the work for you. You will reply that you really appreciate having so much help but there are still certain fundamentals that you need to understand. You ask them, "how are you going to explain the business model to my prospects? Why don't you tell me what you are going to tell them?"</p>
              <p>Forearmed with your knowledge of MLMs you start asking questions - not in a challenging way, but in a genuinely interested way.</p>
              <p>You listen to what they have to say. You ask to borrow a calculator. You do some quick calculations. You say something like "pardon me, but if the company has been around for 10 years, that doesn't really make sense. By Level 9, there should be over 2 million people in the MLM. Shouldn't that level have been reached years ago? How long does it take the average person to recruit the required number of people?"</p>
              <p>You ask questions about the product. What's the size of the market for the product? What share of the market does the MLM think it can capture? What's the market share right now? Why isn't the market share bigger? How much does the product cost compared to major competitors? Who are the competitors?</p>
              <p>You need to know this. After all, you are going to set up our own MLM "business". If you're going to succeed at your "business" you need to understand the market and the competitive landscape.</p>
              <p>There are many many more questions you can ask. The key is to be sincere and non-threatening. You just want to learn. You just want to understand.</p>
              <p>And if your friend hears all the points you made, but still wants to get involved in the MLM; if your friend still wants to pull you in and trade your friendship for his financial gain; if your friend still wholeheartedly believes he will succeed in the MLM, well, you should just walk away. Tell your friend you sincerely hope that he succeeds, but MLM is not for you.</p>
              <p>Then walk away and don't look back.</p>
