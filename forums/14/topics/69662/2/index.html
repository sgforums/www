            <div class='col-md body'>muahaha.. MLM is not easy.. neither is it difficult!<br><br>Basically, MLM i would say that it is a get-rich-forever scheme, not get-rich-quick scheme. You are working for a whole life of income, why not?<br><br>MLM i believe will earn. I'm currently in it. I believe the most important thing is the persistant in the beginning. Lotsa ppl gave up cos they dun see results. Why is that so? Are they not following the right steps?<br><br>Besides that, you should believe in the products that you sell. If even you yourself does not believe in it, how do u expect ur customer does? So, try the product too so you know the product even better and trusting in your product!<br><br>Lastly, are you in the right trend? If you notice, the trend now is going towards wellness industries. Hence, if you are in the wellness industry, it's already a good step. hehe.. so far.. the wellness MLM company i know about is Herbalife and Forever Living. So it's obvious that i'm in one of them.. i'm in Herbalife. haha... anyway, i'm new there. Wish me the best. haha.. Well.. another reason i believe in it is a couple in there earned $130 000 in total for last year. For your information, Herbalife is new and it's only here last year 18 April 03 if i'm not wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>haha.. anyone wanna join me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

It's in Singapore only for a year. Maybe u have not listened to their talk o wad.. but.. the high income is achievable. their retail profit (commission) is real high.. besides.. there's alot of rewards.<br><br>Earning a high income is not a prediction. It is a fact. I know the couple. They did earn $130 000 in total for last year.<br><br>besides.. y should i lie? i wun get anything out of you.. n.. so many ppl see this posts.. there's no reason of why i should lie.. if u dun feel good abt accepting the facts.. it's not my fault.. neither should u say i'm lying.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am just replying to the topic.<br><br>Actually, nothing is easy in this world, it's just the matter of "worth it" or not.<br><br>employment life, wake up 7am, goto work 8am, come back 5:30pm, reach home 7pm. ordinary people spend 12hours just to earn some money.<br>is this easy?<br><br>MLM business is a duplicating business, I read some books. A McDonald's franchiser said " I do NOT need to be a good originator, I need to be a good duplicator". MLM is a duplicating business, creating your sales volume by changing your buying habits &amp; others buying habits, change from X-Brand to MLM brand.<br><br>Everything needs efforts, no free lunch in this world. If you hope to get something easy, POOR will be an easy way.<br>So why we wanna put efforts in MLM? It is because of the rewards.<br><br>MLM companies provides fantastic rewards, financial &amp; time freedom.<br>At least what we can see, if we work under employment for 12 hours per day, we have to work until 55yrs old then retire. But in MLM it's a different story, MLM helps us multiple our time, that's why we call it "MultiLevel Marketing". The more time &amp; efforts we put in today, the more time &amp; rewards we will get after some time.<br><br>Of course some can say, under employment can get a basic salary without any headache. In this case, just take MLM business as a backup income.<br>A Porsche need a spare tire, so do we need a spare income?<br><br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
