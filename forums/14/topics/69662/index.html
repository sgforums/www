Like HBD, SIA, they are retrenching staff to cut down on expenses. How many people have been out of job due to having MLM companies?<br><br>Both MLM and advertising will be around in the world.

            <div class='col-md body'>No authorities will ensure the safety. The only one that is enforced with a law is in electric appliances. It is alright to sell anything, however it's the responsible for the dealers if anything goes wrong. As for consumers, it is your duty that you are aware of what you are consuming/ using.<br><br>Even some of the products on the shelves or MLM companies have harmful contents. Not all companies including MLM &amp; non-MLM are concerned of the side effects and the result of consuming or using them.<br><br>Maybe the next time someone ask you about flouride, you can tell them about Antibiotic then. It's the same theory.  I guess you are telling your friends about how good are the products you are using when questions are thrown to you? Check out if the companies where you are using their products have such training then.<br><br>Presently, there are 300++ MLM companies locally, everyone of them has "different" range of products, compensation plan, training, presentation, etc,etc.  Most companies are not exactly the same. So if you asking about "<span style="font-style: italic;">Do MLM provide such information to the distributors during the training session???", </span>then I think you have to ask which company and what do they deal with. Some do and some don't.<br><br>As for <span style="font-style: italic;">Rationale for the purchase</span>,as I have said different companies have different policies.  If you are asking about "<span style="font-style: italic;">Forever Living requires the distributor to purchase $500 worth of products before they can sponsor other distributors</span>." Though I'm not from Forever Living, I believed that it might be one of the few reasons below.<br><br>Reasons being: 1-  To try and be comfortable with the products, more confidence in using and telling people.<br>2 - To control the distributors and consumers.<br>3-  To prevent their members to only recruiting members thus resulting in pyramid.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A distributor of MLM</span> is not the same as a distributor in a MLM company. Most distributors from different companies do not usually understand every single one out there.<br><br>Since you are using products from Neways and Newlife , why not ask them about <span style="font-style: italic;">practice on sponsorship</span>? Sorry to mention this again, different companies have different explanation on it.<br><br>I will recommend a book to you if you are so keen in knowing more. It's <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Wave 4 : Network Marketing in the 21st Century.</span></strong> By Richard Poe.  There are more than what are written, however it'll be a basic of understanding MLM then.<br><br>If you want to clear more doubts, I don't mind helping.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by health_toxinfree:<br><strong>[b]1) Supporter of  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> good MLM products, but the price is steep!!!</strong><br>Contary to what you say, I am a user of Neways and Newlife products (both are MLM), which focus on toxin-free products.<br>I am satisfied with the products except the price charge is kind of steep, for instance the Ultrashine Radiance Toothpaste (175g) costs $16.20 (equivalent to $.093), whereas Newlife El-Natural Toothpaste (100g) costs $7.80 (equivalent to $0.07<br>Aquafresh toothpaste (181g) merely costs a negligible $2.70 (equivalent to $0.015). To convince someone to purchase the toothpaste distributed by the MLM, definitely you need the MLM distributor to explain the harmful ingredients present in the product over-the-counter.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a) <strong>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  is an industrial garage floor cleaner.

Fluoride can <span style="font-style: italic;">cause bone cancer and increases the rate of oral cancer</span>. (Spotlight, May 1992)<br><br>Most Singaporeans are unwilling to pay a premium for the MLM products because they trust the relevant authorities will ensure the safety of ingredients in the products that are sold in Singapore.<br><br>Try telling someone<span style="font-style: italic;"> fluoride is categorized as protoplasmic poison, and are used to kill rodents.</span><br>(http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/1999/07/fluoride1.htm) He will probably ask you why the water in Singapore is fluoridated.<br><br>Do MLM provide such information to the distributors during the training session???<br><br><strong>2) Rationale for the purchase</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>Forever Living requires the distributor to purchase $500 worth of products before they can sponsor other distributors. Pls refers to Queen_of_rain comment under the subject, "Forever living products". I know Neways and Newlife does not have such policy.<br><br>Are you a distributor of MLM? If you do? Pls enlighten me on the practice on sponsorship.<br><br>I am not an MLM distributor.[/b]</blockquote></div>

It's only a computer games with figures. It might seems to spread fast and might even have great internet features or video conference to show how wonderful the whole thing works, yet I have seen real examples in S'pore and overseas markets that they didn't last long enough for you to realise that they are gone.<br><br>If you want to join one, understand more of the companies, the marketing plan, the products, the future.

The world is changing so fast, so anything might happen.<br><br>Of course, there are no instant success overnight, yet I don't deny that there might be in short term.<br><br>Jim Rohn's philoshophy might be good. However how much risk are you willing to take?  How far are you looking at when you are choosing a company.  Following strictly to one's philoshophy might not be an good idea, it's just like history. Are you living in the past  or future?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Finally, as you are worried that something might happen, you are not even trusting your own judgement and the company you are in. You wont be into full force to make your career in it.<br><br>If you see it, grab the chance as there might not be a second chance.   Failure make a person learn and experience, yet are they positive or negative ones, it'll be up to you to decide.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

What I have written before, all the answers are there.<br><br>If you have stated that  what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you believed in</span>, then no matter what happened,  it has nothing to do with you. It's always better to understand them openly and well before you reject.<br><br>Can I ask you bluntly? Do you believed in Chinese medicine or Western Medicine? Which medical authorities have stated that? Do you think the chinese or the western know better in terms of chinese medicine?<br><br>I'm in neutral position as I believed that most of the prices and quality of alternative products have their facts, reasons, however I do not stand for the effectiveness and maintaining strict testing standards. Know what you are using and consuming, the best is to know what is in there. Look for products that have research and test reports conducted and done by official government sectors ( e.g. Spring Singapore) .<br></div>
