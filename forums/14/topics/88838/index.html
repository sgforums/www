            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps, most forummers who are doing MLM have been informed (or brainwashed) about the next trillion dollar industry and the companies are just hitching a ride on it.<br><br>Still confused? Let's put it this way. Ever wonder why MLM companies are heavily promoting health products/gym equipments/bio-degradable cleaning kits and why they engage in the MLM prototype.<br><br>Health products/gym equipments/ bio-degradable cleaning kits/organic food are categorised under the "Wellness" Industry -- yes, the next trillion dollars industry. (Oh really?!) On what basis are economists making such a statement?<br><br>If you guess baby-boomers generation, you are absolutely right! Who are the baby-boomers generation and why are they so powerful in determining the market trends?<br><br>Baby-boomers (1945s - 1960s) generation are people like your mid forties-fifties folks, my parents etc. They are the folks who control 80% of the purchasing powers, utilising 80% of the natural resources and contributes 80% of the world population.<br><br>Amazing hur?<br><br>Protac and Gamber Inc. flourished in 1940s, specializing in diapers/shampoos/soaps for infants. Toy'R Us starting booming in the 1960s and many became millionaires overnight because they cater to the baby-boomers.<br><br>So what?<br><br>In this millenium, these baby-boomers have grown old and what do they want? Longevity? Wellness? or maybe you go ask your parents? Anyway, these health products companies are flourishing.. and as quoted by one forummer, they are spreading like Black Plaque.<br><br>But why use the MLM methods?<br><br>Firstly, through such distributionship, the companies can focus on the product research and development and logistic management/warehouse keeping. All they have to do is to conduct product training classes to distributors.<br><br>In my opinion, distributors are equal to employees to the company. It  is just that they do not have to face the music when the business is not doing well and they can pre-determine how much they want to do.<br><br>Health products are products requiring a long period of time before the desired outcome can be seen. Moreover, alot of explanation to be done to convince consumers to buy the product.. Advertising on TV is expensive too.<br><br>Again, in my opinion, MLM companies dwell with the 3 basic instincts / traits of human, that are, fear, greed and insecurity. Fear of death, Greed for wealth and Insecure of the future.<br><br>Workable?<br><br>To some, it works because they are really earning big bucks. To some, it doesn't work because they have burnt a hole in a pocket. To some, they are just sceptical about the whole idea.<br><br>Some critics even prosecute the idea. Haha. read more via my website http://www.bigbucks.cjb.net. There is a link leading to the article and also conveniently advertising one MLM company.<br><br>So question here is, is MLM a future trend? My answer is NO because only a minimal number of people are willing to give a try while the rest are still traditional consumers.<br><br>Come on, let's face it. How many of us hate door2door salesman or frontline salesman?<br><br>We still prefer to walk into a shop and source out for the things we really want based upon our five senses. Seriously, I will rather walk into Guardian/Watson to buy slimming products than my friends introducing their slimming products to me.<br><br>Until here, do you still believe that MLM is the future trend to the next trillion industry? I leave it up to you,<br><br>My 3 cents worth.<br><br>Regards,<br>Jack</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mlm is basically human psychology in crisis...<br>it is the base sum of evil...<br>the sleep of reason...<br>it feeds off your passion...<br>everything you're scared of... do... or die.<br><br>during my brief sojourn with a local mlm, what really pissed me off was the motivational speeches running over their console system, the "what are your dreams" pitch. Give me a break, I've never heard such materialistic garbage in my entire life! N what's even worse, their speeches are wrapped in religion, often using all kinds of weird theology to justify their mlm position. it seems like some new-age cult on the rise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wrong use of vocab. i'm not poisoning the industry. nor am i attacking it for personal reasons. i'm just trying to unveil all the lies and deception smothering it cos so many pple are suffering in it.<br><br>and you talked about the binary system and so outrightly condemned it in the forum. what shld i say in response to this? "stop poisoning the system of Usana purely because you don't like it!" sounds silly huh<br><br>there ain't smoke without fire. if the industry was that good, i wouldn't have anything to post here.<br><br>if i am attacking the industry, aren't the others in e forum doing e same to? a forum is a place to discuss abt things, and i stress e word "discuss" cos you tend to flame... yeah. just as i didn't stop others from glorifying mlm in the forum, i am entitled to my own views.<br><br>if you are not happy abt me spreading such truths, then you can jolly well choose to ignore it. asking me to stop posting is a very immature and silly thing to do. An even more childish thing to do is to respond to virtually every thread i post with aggressive and hostile attacks, bereft of any constructive criticism. i for one don't deserve such attention.<br><br>oh and on a lighter note, shld i fail to reply to wadeva you are abt to post to me, its cos your shallow remarks and superficial analysis of the industry -- or what they call FLAMING now of days -- don't deserve my attention.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following is a quote from an article written by someone who is a court recognised mlm expert in the USA:<br><br>"If it were possible to count all the words we speak within our lifetime, I'd guess "I" would be number one, "and" would be a distant second, closely followed by "to." Unless you're me. Then you'd probably find "why" right on "I"'s tail.<br><br>Ever since I was a small child I've been asking that question. I remember vividly having the "birds and the bees" explained to me at a very early age. It was due to my questioning as to why Mommy had to go all the way to the hospital for my baby brother if the doctor was going to deliver him?<br><br>After Dad did the honors of teaching me the real story right from the start (he knew there was no hope of me ever buying into the stork bit), I remember asking why, after this elaborate, very deliberate, incredibly meaningful event between a man and a woman, did the father always act surprised when told his wife was expecting. Did he forget?<br><br>About the age of nine or ten, during a cross country trip, I remember asking my parents; "Why do they say we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway?" It wasn't until many years later that I would hear, to my astonishment, that very same question asked of millions of television viewers during a show by the comedian Gallagher.<br><br>Gallagher has always been one of my favorite comics. He asks a lot of good "Why..." questions. Why is there an expiration date on sour cream? Why doesn't bomb and comb rhyme (a variation of my own question about do and go)? Why is there a permanent press setting on an iron? I love this guy!<br><br>I know that taking this why thing too far can get obnoxious. I've really had to struggle to not ask the vendors at Oakland A's games why their catsup containers are yellow and their mustard containers are red. That makes no sense. I've been dying to ask one of the tellers at my local bank why they just installed braille instructions on the drive-up automatic teller machine. I don't know how much longer and I can last on that one, but I'm hanging in there.<br><br>Why do all dictionaries contain a definition for the word "dictionary?" Why don't they just say: dicÂ·tionÂ·arÂ·y (dik'shenÂ·er'e) noun 1. This thing you're reading!<br><br>Why are there instructions on a bottle of shampoo? Are there really people out there who massage in the shampoo -- then wet their hair?<br><br>Why does the mashed potatoes section of a TV dinner always take three times longer to cook in a microwave?<br><br>Why does the prison doctor who administers lethal injections dab the subject's arm with alcohol before inserting the needle (it's true!)? Is this guy really concerned about getting an infection?<br><br>Why would anyone buy Levi's Oversized Jeans? Why don't they just buy normal jeans a couple sizes too big?<br><br>Why does fat chance and slim chance mean the same thing?<br><br>Why do all Bic lighters carry a warning label informing you the contents are "Flammable." Isn't that why you bought it?<br><br>Why does that same warning label go on to suggest that the user should "...not hold flame near face?" Who is this warning for, the Marboro Man... or Cro-Mangon Man?<br><br>Why did kamikaze pilots were helmets? To prevent head injury?<br><br>What time is it at the North Pole? I know that's not a "why" question, but it's still a darn good one. Think about it.<br><br>This insatiable appetite to know why has carried on into my research and observation of the network marketing industry as well.<br><br>For example, why is it that if a large conventional business, employing thousands of people, goes bankrupt and/or is on the verge of closing, their employees, and many times the company itself, is pitied and people root for them to survive? But if an MLM company, employing just as many honest, hard working people shuts down, it's a scam. Every time.<br><br>Why do ex-employees of closed companies usually see themselves as unlucky, or victims of the economy, whereas ex-distributors for closed MLM's consider themselves "ripped off," or victims of the company, or the MLM concept?<br><br>Along the same lines, why is it that if a car, real estate or insurance salesperson fails, he or she just wasn't a good salesperson. But if an MLM distributor fails, it wasn't a good product, company, or compensation plan?<br><br>Why is it that if you create a company hierarchy where all those at the bottom can only succeed by climbing over those above them, and those above them are doing everything they can to make sure they stay below them, this is considered a legal, legitimate pursuit of the "free enterprise" system. However, if you create the exact same hierarchy, but allow those at the bottom to create, and be at the top of, their own hierarchies, with unlimited support, training and encouragement from all those above them, this is considered a "pyramid scheme?"<br><br>Why is it that many states conduct lotteries which take in tens-of-millions of dollars more than they pay out, mostly from the middle and lower class, which have a one-in-ten-million chance of winning, but these same states will investigate, file suit, and even shut down some MLM opportunities because they employ a "luck factor?"<br><br>Why is it that any other kind of business that involves sales can induce and entice prospective sales people to join their company by displaying the earnings of their top sales people, and openly discussing the "income potential" of the compensation plan, but it's considered "illegal" in network marketing?<br><br>I want to clarify something about that last question. I'm not an advocate of high earnings claims in MLM. But none-the-less, it infuriates me to no end to hear stories of top distributors being prosecuted for displaying evidence of their incomes, even with a stern disclaimer. Prosecuted for telling the truth!<br><br>"Why ask why?", the beer commercial asks.<br><br>Sometime for fun, and sometimes -- to know the answer!"<br><br>Think abt it ppl!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time, multi-level marketing was a legitimate business which provided a way for small companies to get their unique products to consumers in small towns and rural areas which had no access to these products. At this time, the products sold themselves, and the multi-level aspect was a way of giving a small reward to those who had worked hard to build the organization. But the focus was always on the product.<br><br>Today, and especially with the growth of the internet, it is possible for consumer to get about whatever they want at competitive prices. There is simply no real need for distribution Â“systemsÂ” as there once was, and indeed the focus of all the programs is not on the products they sell -- which are usually either bogus or are available somewhere else to the public at the same or lesser prices. Instead, the focus now is solely on recruiting new people to either buy into the program or else to buy products that are grossly overpriced (i.e., a $1 bottle of Â“herbal shampooÂ” for $26), with the idea that those people will recruit additional people who will also buy into the program or themselves buy the grossly overpriced products.<br><br>Thus, today just about ALL of the multi-level marketing programs are scams. In todayÂ’s internet economy, there is simply no need for multi-level marketing or the overpriced products that they sell -- meaning that the only thing they are selling are memberships in anticipation that future memberships will be sold in the future, which is the classic definition of a pyramid scheme, and thus a fraud.<br><br>The poster boy for all MLM 's companies is Amway, the oldest MLM which was founded in 1956. The Amway website claims that it has annual sales of US$6.2bn sold through some 4m distributors (meaning each distributor had average sales of US$1000 annually).<br><br>Four years after Amway, Sam Walton founded Wal-Mart, a conventional retailer, in 1960. Walmart reported sales of US$256bn (41 times larger than Amway), employed some 1.3m people and profits of around US$8bn. Wal-Mart is the LARGEST company in the world in terms of sales, larger than BP, Shell, Texaco and almost 10 times the size of Microsoft.<br><br>The battle for MLM has been lost where it matters most-in the marketplace.</div>
