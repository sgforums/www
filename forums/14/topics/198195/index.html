However, you'd definitely make more money if you spent that time working some regular job. Even $6 an hour for all the time you spent on MLM will definitely earn you more money than investing in an MLM.<br><br>MLM isn't for everybody.

One who say he or she can't, needs to do a little soul searching on what could be the cause of failure. Most of the time, the blame is on MLM. I am not saying there is no such MLM but at times it could be the individuals. One needs to be wise in choosing the right MLM. There are two ways to be wise. Learn it the hard way or follow the right person. Don't be blinded by the nice suit and nice car. I have been there and done that.<br><br></div>

I have actually taken a course and done a report and research on it. Personally, i think, if you are a very good person in sales sector, its a job for you. Of course, you will meet friends along the way. But if you are a quiet type of person, don't take this type of job. Do ask a few question before you join a MLM company. Such as how they pay you, how it works and stocks. If they ask you to buy stocks to keep at home. DON'T. Don't join that type of MLM company. You will suffer. Join the company that gives u flexibility.</div>

You might think they don't feel strange but most do. I've never seen a guy who didn't feel odd when being given a MLM presentation. Moreover your character, personality and things will change due to the influences of the company.<br><br>Time and effort can be better spent elsewhere where there is a better rate of return. Leadership skills are NOT learnt in MLM. I get highly irritated when people think they are learning leadership skills where they are still the same as before. As for experience, what kind of experience are you looking for?<br><br>Not exactly lose friend but more of wedge a gap in between.</div>

If u think of it as a business then i would say MLMs is a good way to try out 1st. Unlike conventional business, u dun have to fork out a large sum of money 1st so the risk involve shd be reduced to a minimum. But like all businesses, not everyone will succeed.</div>
