            <div class='col-md body'>Hi makan007,<br><br>From what I see, most prob u cant get ur money back. Is this friend who sold it to u very close to u?? If so, perhaps when ur friend is guilty enough, he or she might pay it back to u using his/her own money. Of course u can go to DSAS, Small Claims, Police, MP of ur area and whatever, u wont get ur money back unless u are willing to afford at least $3K of legal fees to get ur money back from court.<br><br>My friend got cheated $1.5K and theres nothing he could do, so I gathered ur $300 worth of money is just another bit adding to this snowball. Perhaps I will start to gather all those who have been cheated, I think I can easily get at least 20. We will all employ a lawyer together, and we can share the legal costs and get our few thousands back together. And togther with at least 20 such cases, we will expose their scam. Are u guys on for this idea?? If so, pls pm me..<br><br>I am really getting upset  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  seeing so much people getting cheated while these money suckers continue to suck people's money for their own BMWs!!<br><br>By the way, if u are free, kindly visit my thread in MLM forum too.. My one also has DW Group's name in the title... apparently, there's someone working in DW now, and he or she seems to have closed ard at least $20,000 of sales recently..
