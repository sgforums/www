LOL  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So they're withdrawing their products from watsons... and switching to MLM as their channel of distribution... I can only conclude that the product is not that well received here in SG unlike HK and China, where they're still selling the products thru retail... Smart move by the management, to push their products to people in SG through greed aka $$ making opportunity from MLM...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What I can see is that the company is only adapting to the market here in SG. One can only guess if the management intends to go by MLM if they do expand to other countries. Try asking them to try switch to MLM in HK lah, which I doubt they will since retail is doing fine there... which makes me think of the MLM distributors here as pawns of the company.<br><br>The company may not have plans to adopt MLM in the future and may only be concerned about its own profits. Nothing unethical in a business world, but worth a thought if you are intending to be their distributor, who are made to believe they hold the "exclusive rights" to distribute the products. You may be able to make a killing as the "pioneer" but please spare a thought for the future of the members of your group who may not be as fortunate as you...<br><br>We seldom see other true MLM companies adopting a retail approach in other countries...

All Rights Reserved<br><br>SINGAPORE: It's been over five years since the law was amended to allow legitimate multi-level-marketing (MLM) firms to operate here came into effect, but the direct selling industry remains dogged by the negative image many associate with pyramid selling.<br><br>"In the early tough days, legitimate direct sellers were held back by suspicion. But sadly, this scrutiny of legitimate direct sellers continues till today; it is uphill still for us," said Mr Benjamin Tan, a founding member of the 30-year-old Direct Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS).<br><br>To improve its image and win public confidence, the body - which is made up of 22 of Singapore's biggest direct-selling companies - is calling for tougher self-regulation.<br><br>It is drafting rules to tighten loopholes in the industry - currently the association doesn't step in if any of its member firms collapse. With the new rules, it will step in to help affected consumers.<br><br>Also, it will step up on checks on its members: Those who repeatedly don't abide by its code of ethics and conduct will face expulsion.<br><br>"We will look into how we can better protect consumers' interests, whether through further collaboration with the Consumers Association of Singapore, or through local regulatory and industry partners," said Mr Nicholas Chia, chairman of DSAS.<br><br>The association is setting up a one-stop information centre for the public next month.<br><br>This centre will allow consumers to check - for free - the legitimacy of any direct-selling company, and help organise public education forums to inform the public on the differences between direct selling and pyramid selling (see box).<br><br>"However, if the negative mindset about the industry persists, we are under severe threat of losing a large pie of the potential multi-billion revenue that the global industry will generate," said Mr Chia.<br><br>While one in every 10 Singaporean buys from direct selling companies now, Singapore is still falling behind the rest of South-east Asia in grabbing a share of the US$101 billion ($160 billion) global direct selling industry, he said.<br><br>Last year, Singapore generated US$330 million in direct sales, compared with Malaysia's US$1.4 billion and Taiwan's US$2.1 billion.<br><br>Said Mr Chia: "We need a big mindset shift fast or we will be outstripped by other stronger direct selling markets in Asia for a large share of the global industry pie."<br><br>Multi-level marketing (MLM) and single level marketing (SLM) are the two forms of direct selling practised in Singapore. Consumers still tend to confuse the two forms of direct selling with pyramid selling, which is prohibited in Singapore.<br><br>"Direct selling is the sale of a consumer product or service, person-to-person, away from a fixed retail location. It is a popular alternative to traditional employment for those seeking to supplement their household income, or whose responsibilities or circumstances do not allow for regular part-time or full-time employment," said Mr Tan.<br><br>Pyramid selling on the other hand, requires participants to make a lump sum payment upfront to join the scheme, and the driving force to recoup the initial fee is the recruitment of more members, rather than the sale of goods and services. Many participants lost huge amounts of money under the scheme, and subsequently an Act was passed in 1973, declaring pyramid selling illegal in Singapore. - TODAY<br><br>Document CNEWAS0020060927e29q00002<br><br>More Like This<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Strangely, DSAS is just a body without the teeth, since its not an authority on its own.  Like they said, its 'self regulations' with the regulations having impact on its members, such as stepping in to help customers of its members. Not really a wide reaching change can be forecasted in the short term.<br><br>Besides, I am not sure how far they can justify the legitimacy of any DS company, especially that which does not belong to the member list.

As far back as s888.com fracas, s888.com technically did not break the previous MLM Act. They were simply charged for contravening the Act in spirit. The Exclusion Order did not explicitly correct this. Simply said, if a company do have products for sales, you cant fault it technically. Its going to take an exhaustive investigative work to prove that the company was not simply interested in selling that stuff, so then you can start to fault it on 'spirit' terms. Or perhaps, minor offences covered under other Acts might have to be pulled in, like selling to under 18 without permission of their parents, misrepresentation under Sales of Goods Act etc etc etc<br><br>There is at least one other loopy Act which they dragged their feet about, I believe its the Frauds Act, something inherited from the colonial past.<br><br>Swisscash is relatively easier because they involve investments instruments, and the finance industry is too heavily regulated to let that get past notice by MAS.<br><br>I do agree we need more bold citizens, but then CASE and DSAS to me are like paper tigers. Seriously.<br><br></div>
