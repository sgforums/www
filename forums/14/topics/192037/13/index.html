            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">SINGAPORE: It's been over five years since the law was amended to allow legitimate multi-level-marketing (MLM) firms to operate here came into effect, but the direct selling industry remains dogged by the negative image many associate with pyramid selling.<br><br>"In the early tough days, legitimate direct sellers were held back by suspicion. But sadly, this scrutiny of legitimate direct sellers continues till today; it is uphill still for us," said Mr Benjamin Tan, a founding member of the 30-year-old Direct Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS).<br><br>To improve its image and win public confidence, the body - which is made up of 22 of Singapore's biggest direct-selling companies - is calling for tougher self-regulation.<br><br>It is drafting rules to tighten loopholes in the industry - currently the association doesn't step in if any of its member firms collapse. With the new rules, it will step in to help affected consumers.<br><br>Also, it will step up on checks on its members: Those who repeatedly don't abide by its code of ethics and conduct will face expulsion.<br><br>This centre will allow consumers to check - for free - the legitimacy of any direct-selling company, and help organise public education forums to inform the public on the differences between direct selling and pyramid selling (see box).<br><br>"However, if the negative mindset about the industry persists, we are under severe threat of losing a large pie of the potential multi-billion revenue that the global industry will generate," said Mr Chia.<br><br>Multi-level marketing (MLM) and single level marketing (SLM) are the two forms of direct selling practised in Singapore. Consumers still tend to confuse the two forms of direct selling with pyramid selling, which is prohibited in Singapore.<br><br>"Direct selling is the sale of a consumer product or service, person-to-person, away from a fixed retail location. It is a popular alternative to traditional employment for those seeking to supplement their household income, or whose responsibilities or circumstances do not allow for regular part-time or full-time employment," said Mr Tan.<br><br>Pyramid selling on the other hand, requires participants to make a lump sum payment upfront to join the scheme, and the driving force to recoup the initial fee is the recruitment of more members, rather than the sale of goods and services. Many participants lost huge amounts of money under the scheme, and subsequently an Act was passed in 1973, declaring pyramid selling illegal in Singapore. - TODAY<br><br></div></blockquote> The article kept emphasing on Direct Selling/MLM is legal but Pyramid selling is not. Think all in the forum agreeds. Problem is the methods used by MLM companies to recruit people (as in sonic_16, etc, replies).<br><br>Also from the article <strong>Pyramid selling on the other hand, requires participants to make a lump sum payment upfront to join the scheme, and the driving force to recoup the initial fee is the recruitment of more members, rather than the sale of goods and services.</strong><br><br>I think it is a very fine line on this. Many MLM companies will ask you to make a lump sum payment for products to promote 1-2 levels first so you're have better overiding and sales commissions. Isn't this in a way asking for a lump sum investment? MLMers can earn money through sales and recruitment. Who is to say which method is the primary driving force?<br><br>A personal experience I had at Bel'air a few years back is that on a successful close of a package of products, after paying the money my friend received the products NOT from their sales counter, but from the distributor's stock. This shows the distributor had stock up huge amounts of products when she joined the business.<br><br>And in their "New Distributor Training Program" (I dun remember the exact name) attended by all newbies, the trainer said there are two ways to make money, sales and recruitment. The trainer then empahsis alot, on recruitment. Only like first 10-15 minutes of the program is on sales, the rest 1hr 45 min is on recruitment. Most other talks they have is on recruitment. The dukes and marquises (higher executives and managerial level people) of his team always emphasis on recruitment. In fact the first thing they taught my friend is to list all names, and contact everyone for potential recruitment.<br><br>So it seems they're all:<br>1. Breaking the law<br>2. Lying to get people down for recruitment<br>3. Giving empty/unrealisitic promises (Which is actually equalivant to lying)<br>4. Giving unrealistic expectations<br>.....but yet are legitimate mlm companies.<br><br>The distributor that my friend had joined under (the higher of a duke or marquis (memory no good)) claimed he earned 5-figure income every month. But when ask why dun he get a car, he said once a biker, always a biker. And he rides a very old TZR (a cheap bike in the 1995-96). This shows that he may not have that kind of income monthly. If he has, shouldn't he already had upgraded to a better bike.<br></div>

Thats for basa malam, I have went to show in expo which cost $1k/day.<br><br>For inventory, nobody in this earth will give credit term to ppl selling things at basa malam. Say u only buy enought goods for one day e.g handphone cover. Cost 45 cents. Selling price a dollar. You have to sell 100 of them to get back ur rental, another 45 cover to cover cost say u want an income of $50/day, tat will be another 50 plus 23 cover. So total u need to stock up 218 cover and tat will be $98.10.<br><br>Lets say u print ur own flyer, say 1000 flyer per day. 1 copy is 2 cents total $20.<br><br>Ur total cost per day is $218.1 (per day) n after all tis trouble u earn $50.( working hour 11am-11pm)</div>
