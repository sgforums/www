            <div class='col-md body'>Has anyone see The Straits Times on 27 Sept 2006 under Home section?<br><br>It stated that people have the bad impression that MLM = pyramid selling. This is because of those black sheeps in the past that do MLM without any products without is illegal till now. It creates a bad impression to people that MLM = con money, pull people, pyramid structure.<br><br>What I want to say is that whether MLM is good or bad, depends on yourself. MLM is just a tool/way to do business.<br><br>What people involves in MLM said cannot do, then should they ask themselves the question "Have you work hard in the correct way?". What is the point of you working so hard but in the wrong direction.<br><br>MLM is just another tool for people to earn  other than being an employee or businessmen. But truly speaking, how many people start a business actually succeeded in the end? You can go figure out yourself... So easy to start a business???<br><br>If people fail in starting business, then does that mean that starting a business is wrong??? If it is true, then why are there still people intending to start a business??? It only implies that maybe the directions or method is wrong or other factors...<br><br>So whether you believe or not really depends on your thinking... because different people have different views for the same thing...<br><br>^_^</div>

I can only conclude that the product is not that well received here in SG unlike HK and China, where they're still selling the products thru retail... Smart move by the management, to push their products to people in SG through greed aka $$ making opportunity from MLM...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What I can see is that the company is only adapting to the market here in SG. One can only guess if the management intends to go by MLM if they do expand to other countries. Try asking them to try switch to MLM in HK lah, which I doubt they will since retail is doing fine there... which makes me think of the MLM distributors here as pawns of the company.<br><br>The company may not have plans to adopt MLM in the future and may only be concerned about its own profits. Nothing unethical in a business world, but worth a thought if you are intending to be their distributor, who are made to believe they hold the "exclusive rights" to distribute the products. You may be able to make a killing as the "pioneer" but please spare a thought for the future of the members of your group who may not be as fortunate as you...<br><br>We seldom see other true MLM companies adopting a retail approach in other countries...

So for a person who joins, he actualli gets to buy new pills every mth. seems to me that the original 1000+ pills that he bought to start his LFI "business" can be left to rot le...<br><br>finally one of the directors was the one that dealt the killer blow. he sat down and kept boasting abt his 7-8k income a mth in LFI and his network of 400 downlines. kns... <strong>if anyone in any mlm company has 400 downlines and is onli earning 7-8k, either its gone wrong for the company/plan or sth's very wrong with the person...<br><br>2 cents worth...<br></strong></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

There must be something very wrong with the comm. plan.<br>1 of the reason may be they are taking ur $ to do all the marketing advertisment.<br>So dun think tats the company is doing all tats FOC for u.
