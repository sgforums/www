"My opinion is that PDMYB cannot heal anything its just helping you to clear toxins from body that is all". Its the company's job to ensure they comply with the guidelines as mentioned earlier.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think becoz of greed... Or the greed for making it big in a short time... Who likes to work forever? Humans always want to choose the faster way out... Nobody likes being rich when he is 50 or 60... But u see most of these people never make it in the end... Actually, i think mlm is a good way to study human psychology dont u think? U could see how people change their tone or their character before and after doing mlm...<br><br>I think it will be interesting if we could analysis the ones that do mlm and fail and those who are still flourishing in this trade... It is really intersting to understand the psychology of the human here when it involves money.  We could see why human desires for being rich quick or thinking of being a millionare at a young age could lead to the change in one's character and thinking...<br><br>Haha think i'm crapping, but i think it is really interesting if we could analyse such people and those that fail afterwhich, could learn how their mindset change and might can ask them how they feel when they were in it and after they were out  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
