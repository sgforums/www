            <div class='col-md body'>Me too been out there for awhile.  I think they are quite dishonest at times.  Perhaps they never explained to us about the maintenance fees.  and the pay out is not very good. its in RM.  The payout is explained in RM if I'm not wrong.  I think everything we earn is halfed because of that.  Lately, I think they also have other promotions such as accupuncture slimming.  Alot of stuff, even beauty contest.<br><br>Well I feel after doing MLM, did I should say, I've learned alot of things. For example, when in MLM, they seem very "On" about everything, there is always this image they will force into you that u will get what u one at the end of the day.  I think its really crap seriously.  Think about the time I've wasted on MLM, instead of getting a better CONFIRMED pay job would be better off. Its irritating that these MLM people always have funny ideology or ways to comment about people's failure in MLM.  My whole upline used to tell me people give up easily this and that and they are foolish to do so.  Guess what, after leaving for about slightly more than a year, when i asked where these people were, they are no where near LFI anymore.  So what was the promises that they have said in the past, or their BRIGHT future ahead.<br><br>Well to people who want to join MLM, I think just let them join, if they dont make it, at least its a lesson worth learning.  1K to learn a good lesson its quite worth it.  For those who succeed, good for them, then they can tell people a bunch of stories of how they didnt give up and then new batch of people will then once again fail or succeed when they join and it goes on and on.  Its a cycle and it doesnt end. =)<br><br>Pardon my language, thanks.</div>

Does your explanation represent LFI legally? If you represent LFI and gives a official explanation for any adverse reaction to LFI products as stated above. Let me know.  I am sure many people will be interested to do a investigation into LFI products based on your explanation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

If you want to know how many &amp; what are they used for, just google LFI or visit their website if you know the address loh. I have not come across a company what started out with a complete range of products on their first day of business. Did Amway have their numberous products on their first day? I guess the answer is no. They had a few in the beginning, then started to do more R&amp;D &amp; introduced more when the market is ready or if there is a need to be filled, etc etc. If you want to compare, please choose companies that are about the same age for a start. Apples with apples please.</div>

So I'll be waiting for your comparison &amp; let the rest of the forum read what you have to write loh. If you know the two companies in detail, you would know that they can't really be compared together because of certain differences, but I guess with your present level of MLM knowledge, that is all you can point out because that is all you know. Rumours, gossips, common knowledge. Anyway I must commend you on your effort. It is a good start to learning more. Everybody has to start from somewhere, even if it is not up to par.</div>

You know quite a fair bit on drugs. What do you know about the LFI products? Can you list out the pharmacological profile since you mention you know quite a fair bit?<br><br>For a start, do you have the information on these?<br><br>* Active Ingredients<br>* Indications<br>* Doses<br>* Contraindications<br>* Special Precautions<br>* Drug Interactions<br><br>On a side note. Are the Manufacturing of these products cGMP regulated? If regulated. Give me the details so we can check up on the manufacturing quality/consistency and safety of the manufacturers.<br><br>Any clinical trials done? Published papers? Which Journals? Give me the details so we can retrieve the papers and read for ourselves on the efficacy of these products and the adverse and safety profile.<br><br>Do you know the Adverse reporting procedures in Singapore and where the reports are sent and tabulated? Since you are in the pharma trade. I am sure you will be able to retrieve the data with just a online click at the required website from your company's account or using your company's name, call up the relevant authorities. I am interested for you to find out the details for the benefit of everyone here since you are so proficient with a fair bit of knowledge about the Pharmaceutical Industry.<br><br>Thanks for the clarifications and admission that "its your own baseless opinion/judegment" that people who are sent to the hospital with adverse reactions are just having normal dehydration due to diarrhoea.<br><br>Dont take advantage of the nominal regulations on these products and take it such that everything is ok.
