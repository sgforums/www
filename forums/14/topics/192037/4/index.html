            <div class='col-md body'>Definition of idiot from webster.com:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>idÂ·iÂ·ot</strong><br>Pronunciation: 'i-dE-&amp;t<br>Function: noun<br>Etymology: Middle English, from Anglo-French ydiote, from Latin idiota ignorant person, from Greek idiOtEs one in a private station, <strong>layman, ignorant person,</strong> from idios one's own, private; akin to Latin suus one's own<br>1. usually offensive : a person affected with idiocy<br><strong>2. : a foolish or stupid person</strong><br>- idiot adjective</span><br><br>Now that we have the proper definition of the word, idiot, and before you put words into my mouth, note the few keywords: LAYMAN, IGNORANT &amp; FOOLISH. Let's put STUPID out of the way here for the time being.<br><br>All 3 words point to a person who does not know ________ (fill in the blanks where necessary). In this case, MLM being the subject, if one jumps onto the bandwagon not knowing what to expect, not weighing the pros &amp; cons, then, yes, if the results do not meet expectation, it is easy to feel like an idiot.<br><br>Therefore, what i have been advocating all the while is know what one is getting into and don't run crying to mother when results don't matchup to expectations. Expectations arise from promises, but promises are as as easily broken as egg shells. We all break promises. So let he who is without sin cast the first stone.<br><br>If one is lured into MLM with a hope of earning big bucks effortlessly, be prepared to be disappointed. Spend some time finding out what MLM is. It's not a magic stone, nor your golden goose. It is merely a method of marketing.<br><br><blockquote>yes sir,i will trust you but can we trust your distributor too like what diebirdstand have say- </blockquote>And simidaichi, thank you for your courtesy and trust, but you make the assumption that i am male by addressing me "sir". Or perhaps it was in sarcasm? I will give the benefit of doubt.<br><br>Trust is built, not given. If you don't trust the distributors, don't. I repeat myself again, do your due diligence before making decisions and you will never regret a single moment of your life. This statement will be applicable for the rest of your life in every other thing you do in future. It will also make people take responsibility when things go wrong and stop the finger-pointing.</div>

Ultimately, it is the products that are being used/consumed/inhaled/applied, and not the sellers. Like buying a car, the salesmanship and knowledge of the dealer is important no doubt, but it finally boils down to the condition of the car itself. If the car is damaged, or faulty, whether the company will help to rectify the problem is another point to take note of. Moreover, we are talking about one's well-being here.<br><br>There will be plenty of horror stories about so-and-so agent of so-and-so company who hard-sell and claim that their products are not unlike magic stones. If the majority of "hearsay" is negative, then there must be a slight possibility that there are some truths in them. Otherwise, go and listen and decide for yourself.<br><br>It is more wise to narrow in and focus on the product. If it is good, the person/company distributing it shouldn't matter too much. If it ain't effective, even with the slickest sales-talk and fanciest company image, it can't last long.<br><br>If it's LongFar you want to know, their website is quite comprehensive.

I'm sure proof will help boost sales. Having many shareholders does not mean that the company is viable or above board, look at Enron and WorldCom. Unless someone from the company can provide offical proof of efficacy of the medication, it will be of questionable quality.</div>

How about this fictional scenario:<br><br>My friend told me that LFI is a company dealing in drug trafficking and human smuggling?? I heard that orgies are happening everynight??<br><br>Proof?? There's no proof needed for the rumours because "There's also no scientific proof that a higher being exists, but that doesn't stop billions across the globe from going to churches, mosques, temples &amp; synagogues." So that also can't stop thousands in Sgforums for believing in the rumours.<br><br>I don't have access to the authenticity of the rumour but "Not having access to, does not mean non-existence"<br><br>Yah.. The above info is pure speculation I heard but "thousands of public shareholders of the company's stock in HK don't seem to dwell so much on the evidence. It's all there, i'm sure, just not available to Tom, Dick or Harry"<br><br>So... the above fallacy is what you get if there's no evidence... Please don't acquaint it with faith... If blind faith is all there is about PDMYB, then I can only say the effects are "placebo" effects...

            <div class='col-md body'>To all Toms, Dicks &amp; Harrys, please read this again:<br><br><blockquote><strong>Not having access to, does not mean non-existence.</strong><br><br>Apparantly, thousands of public shareholders of the company's stock in HK don't seem to dwell so much on the evidence. It's all there, i'm sure, just not available to Tom, Dick or Harry.</blockquote>I made the effort to <strong>BOLD</strong> it this time in case you guys missed it in your grief of my mention of Existentialism comparing Health Products with Religion.<br><br>By doubting the reports that are unavailable to you, you are also doubting local health authorities (i.e. HSA), HK health authorities, &amp; HKSE (for allowing a scientificall-useless, placebo product to be listed), which in turn does not shine too brightly on both governments. I will not even go into mentioning the many millions of stockholders that have been insulted for their lack of discretion for investing in a potentially fradulent company. But frankly, we don't really care, do we?<br><br>So this thread will become another NTI thread, i await in eager anticipation to help up the entertainment index here.... If discussions are conducted in a fair, matured and educated manner, it's for the better of the forum, i'm sure. Just try to quote properly, it's impossible to know from the post whether it was for or against my earlier posting.<br><br><blockquote>You are confusing religion and a product and its not a very good point to make at all, these silly nonsensical analogies.<br></blockquote>If it does not make sense, it's easy to brush aside claiming it is nonsensical. I fail to see why it's nonsensical when both examples have relevant similarities in that <strong>not having access to, does not mean non-existence.</strong> Faith was not mentioned, and i do agree that it's absurd to bring faith (or blind faith) into the subject of health products.<br><br><blockquote>If the product is good and if there indeed is proof (as required by the law), why isn't it shown to everybody? I'm sure proof will help boost sales. Having many shareholders does not mean that the company is viable or above board, look at Enron and WorldCom. Unless someone from the company can provide offical proof of efficacy of the medication, it will be of questionable quality.</blockquote>If the product is good and if there indeed is proof, it isn't shown to everybody simply because the company doesn't feel the need to, i guess. Apart from having skeptics who will claim that the reports have been cooked up, the company is not listed in Singapore, and unless a majority shareholder, it is not available to you, Tom, Dick or Harry. But if non-disclosure means it's no good, don't buy it. If it is of questionable quality because of this, don't recommend it. If it's perceived to only have "placebo" effects, don't consume it!<br><br>If a person's decision of whether to use a product or not is dependant on which VIP/Minister/Boyband is involved in the company's opening ceremony, then i must say, he's got it all wrong. Sure, it lends weight to a company's profile if there is a high flying VIP opening, but then again, it's just a ceremony, nothing to be made a big hoo-haa about.<br><br>&amp; MLM_Victim, same response, same level of intellect.

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz sharing,<br><br>maybe its not the public that dont trust H@A. SL@m 1* also was registered and checked by H@A. But wat happened? PPl got their liver cutted. Its the 1st screening that they passed and the subsequent products failed. Therefore such incidents happens.<br><br>If everyone heard of a B@W, everyone knows it is reowned for the stability and the comfort and also the reliability. How can anyone be so sure that out of 10,000 cars a few of them is defective?<br><br>Its not the products thats sucks, sometimes its juz luck. Some ppl get allergic to something they dun suddenly. Its purely luck maybe?<br><br>I believe there is nothing wrong with the product since H@A audited the product unless the future product was defective.<br><br>Its up to individual that believe in this system and product.<br><br>I personally wanted to try the product and went to the place myself during the launch. I got a package that day and currently testing it out. I am surprised that such a company boomed in such a short time. Maybe is the group of guys behind ET. I have head about him from Frens at C@sl@B. Heard of wat type of character he possess.<br><br>Amazing many ppl from C@Sl@B didnt believe that he can make it in such ashort time.... PPl from LF told me he got someone to help him to acheive so much in such a short time.<br><br>Could it be the arrangements of the office? Did he consult some Gao ren?<br>I have heard of such placing or arrangements can help oneself but could that be so potent?<br><br>Juz my thoughts.</div>
