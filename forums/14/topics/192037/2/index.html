            <div class='col-md body'>Went down to the company a week ago... Kenna conned by a friend on the pretext of dinner.. machiam enyouth strategy.. To think retribution comes that fast to me.. LOL  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So they're withdrawing their products from watsons... and switching to MLM as their channel of distribution... I can only conclude that the product is not that well received here in SG unlike HK and China, where they're still selling the products thru retail... Smart move by the management, to push their products to people in SG through greed aka $$ making opportunity from MLM...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What I can see is that the company is only adapting to the market here in SG. One can only guess if the management intends to go by MLM if they do expand to other countries. Try asking them to try switch to MLM in HK lah, which I doubt they will since retail is doing fine there... which makes me think of the MLM distributors here as pawns of the company.<br><br>The company may not have plans to adopt MLM in the future and may only be concerned about its own profits. Nothing unethical in a business world, but worth a thought if you are intending to be their distributor, who are made to believe they hold the "exclusive rights" to distribute the products. You may be able to make a killing as the "pioneer" but please spare a thought for the future of the members of your group who may not be as fortunate as you...<br><br>We seldom see other true MLM companies adopting a retail approach in other countries... Why? Think about it again...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all it took was a simple google search<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Many people buy detox aids looking for a quick miracle fix just from taking a branded supplement, which will cleanse your body, <span style="color: red;">but there is no evidence to support many of these claims.</span><br><br>If you want to detox properly it involves eating the RIGHT Diet to detox your body not simply adding a detox aid. Detoxing is not that simple!<br><br>There are some easy ways to detox and this involves simply a change to diet and don't forget your body's organs are designed to detox without any help from branded pills or juices!<br><br>Let's look at the myth of detox aids and how to detox properly.<br><br><strong>The body has its own detoxification system already!</strong><br><br>Most of the pills, juices teas and oils sold as detox aids have no scientific foundation to back up their claims, yet people still buy them looking for a quick fix!<br><br>The reality of detoxing is that the body has its own in build detoxifiers namely the liver, kidneys, skin intestines and lungs and they are designed to remove and excrete toxins within hours of consumption.<br><br><strong>Want to detox? Change your eating habits</strong><br><br>The fact is to detoxify your body all you have to do is make simple changes to your diet.<br><br>If you simply drunk more water (at least 2 litres a day) and ate more fruit and vegetables your skin would look better and you would feel healthier.<br><br>Combine the above with removing from your diet what you know is bad for you i.e alcohol cigarettes and caffeine and you will compound the feeling of well being.<br><br>Think about it if our bodies can naturally detox and we simply add foods we know are good for us and remove ones we know are bad, the body will take care of the rest.<br><br>Logic tells you that if the body has organs to detoxify then how can a pill or juice help?<br><br>If you are in eating foods which are bad, a branded pill or juice cannot save your liver from alcohol or your lungs from smoke.<br><br><strong>Detox naturally</strong><br><br>All you need to do is eat a healthy diet and skip the detox aids. So, what foods need to be removed? Here is a list of essentials:<br><br>Red meat<br>Alcohol<br>Tea coffee and anything with caffeine in it<br>Sugar<br>Dairy products cheese eggs and full fat milk<br>All processed and junk foods<br>All processed carbohydrates such as white bread and pasta<br><br>Keep in mind you if you eat naturally the body will take care of itself and if you do fill it with toxins there is no miracle cure to remove them that's left to your over worked specialist detox organs !<br><br>Eat raw vegetables, unsweetened fruit juices, brown rice, lean chicken and turkey, fish and drink plenty of water and you will be getting healthy foods that put the minimum of strain on your organs.<br><br><strong>Some natural aids</strong><br><br>If you want some natural aids try:<br><br>Milk thistle to help liver function, bio yoghurt to boost probiotics to help digestion in the gut and finally, wheat bran, which speeds up the passage of food through the colon and gives your digestive system a good clean at the same time. Its nickname is natures broom and its name is well earned.<br><br><strong>Detoxing don't believe the myths</strong><br><br>The above is totally logical and common sense.<br><br>Branded detox aids are of little use and feed on people's desire for a quick fix. Alas, like all quick fixes if they sound too good to be true and they are.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Your body can detoxify itself, but you well help it by cutting out bad foods eating naturally and drinking lots of water, to help your organs do what they were designed to do by mother nature without the help of a branded pill or juice.</span><br><br>(source: <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Detox-Aids---The-Myth-Of-Detoxing&amp;id=137769" rel="nofollow">Ezine Health</a>)<br><br></div>

Its all based on the experiences and thoughts. of coz we had to be responsible.<br><br>We need to know the Co background before we dump our money to "try" rite.<br>Some of the salesman i presume didnt had enough training.

I am refering to my particular experience with this guy. Forgotten his name anyway.<br><br>Of coz i heard alot abt LF the good and bad, pro and cons.

Is this the sales on products of Co or ppl?<br><br>I juz want to wait for a little while to see if the Co is worth investing my time and money but the sales person insist i join now. To me its a form of hard selling. He dont want to give me time to think abt and wants me to commit in the moment of pressure and rashness.<br><br>Is this wat is taught in the lessons provided?<br><br>Its not that i am constructing a gray image of the Co, I juz want to share and feedback in the channel.<br><br>If u do take this with an open mind u will have know i meant well.<br><br>Thanks.<br></div>
