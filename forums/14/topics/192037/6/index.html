I thought this bunch of Ex-NOP Directors willl stop after the menace at CosLab. Now they are spoiling the industry with this company...<br><br>1) Product. This is a wonderful product, listed in HongKong and all along no problem in HK. In Singapore, it used NOP as the main marketing agent then change to retail and now go back to MLM style. So can this strategy really work for this kind of high-end health product ? Will it go back suddenly to become retail and all this present Networkers are going to suffer especially those who have been doing lots of inventory loading. Product quality is not a problem but the problem lies with this product. ( Which stage of the product life cycle is it at?)<br><br>2) Training. What kind of training are this bunch of Leaders going to give. Training materials of JP a decade ago? From what I know, this bunch of people are still imitating NOP style training... I really wonder how can they be better.<br><br>3) Compensation Plan. Can this kind of plan still work in Singapore? Once people become par, they are helpless... What kind of era are we in now. This plan, many people are gonna build lots of managers/directors and earn lesser the bigger they build.<br><br>4) Direction. Why is'nt this company a Network Marketing company which concentrates on building the marketing channels for itself but is building for the supplier instead. After the channels have been established, this company will become obselete as people will just go straight to the supplier. What kind of assurance can Networkers have??<br><br>All those who are really serious about becoming a true blue networker, please review how you are going to survive in this place 3 years later.<br><br>Just my 5-cents worth, please dont take all this too seriously. Cheers. </div></blockquote>1) product life-cycle: need not get worried bout what stage it is now, from what i heard from my frenz, this product has a  9 out of 10 repeated sales figure<br><br>2) training wise: you can't judge the company just by listening to these comments from these people, you have to dropped by there for a visit to know more bout them.<br><br>3) compenstation plan, did u hear how was the plan like b4 u actually determine if it's good or bad?? did you open your mind and listen to it or as u are listening to it, u keep telling urself that the plan is bad?? (no offence)<br><br>4) i will use sk2 for example:<br>if sk2 didn't use advertisment at it's product launching(introduction) stage, will so many ppl get to know of this product?<br><br>if it didn't have a celebrity to endorse it, will ppl dare to dry out such expensive products ma? if there's no endorsement etc, will it be much harder to sell it to the public?<br><br>now the company is selling the products cheaper then what's offered in the market. of cause it's easier to sell<br><br>would u like to personally come down and take a look, and have a more detail de explanation? My fren is working in there, I can get him to intro the products to you <br><br>I last time used to work in nti, ex-nti agent, but though I am not involved in this stuff le, but I still find mlm okay, if thereÂ’s really a good company out there la, but for now, me dun wanna talk bad bout any company.<br></div>
