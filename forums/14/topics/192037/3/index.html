Lets not talk abt 3 years. I think half a year the noob downline might quit. I think the training style needs to do a revamp.<br><br>I have been to LF, the place although was hard to find but if u got a GPS u can find it real easy. LOL<br><br>The setting was rather impressive except for my fren kept on introducing this that worst till... toilet also need to compare....<br>I mean come on... we can see. Juz give us some time to look ard...<br><br>The setting was really unique as there is this big fountain in the foyer. I bet this setting is really damn ex especially the huge stone infront.  I mean i know wat it is but man i have never seen such a huge one before.<br><br>From my fren they said something abt lucky thingy. Actually in my mind i wanna ask him where they got this from. LOL<br><br>Quite modern for the MLM. U can see some abstract art from the main walls. I mean all this are appearance target to impress the public. In that sense its a great job done.<br><br>So was there something abt fengshui thingy was done? They kept mumbling abt that. Anyone from LF wanna talk abt it?<br><br>Care to enlighten me? Juz curious abt that. And i noticed the colourful snail shell, care to elaborate too. thats wat the guys told me... snail shell. where the hell to get a flat snail???<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by diebirdstand:</div><div class="quote_body">I joined Coslab about 3 months ago.  To be frank, my uplines Bryan and Fion painted the best picture to me. I thought I was going to be super rich in a few months time. They promise me that if I follow their foot steps and do what they tell me to, I will succeed. But after a capital investment of $1,300 and now that the new company, Long Far has started. I only manage to make back about $400 from Coslab. I am still losing about $900. Anyway, I think I will do this little write-up and add some fire to the oil.<br><br>I belong to a group of youngsters under their network. But what makes me really disappointed was this particular incident. Fion was talking to a Beauty Consultant and she blurred out, Â“Aiyah, these downlines all idiots one lah, you ask them buy what they also buy.Â”(In Mandarin)  Little did she knows, I just got out of the toilet and was behind her when she call me and all her downlines  IDIOTS!!! But I didnÂ’t spread these to my other friends as I believe it would cause dispute within the group.<br><br>Anyway, about a week plus ago, I was brought down to Long Far together with some others. And the same thing happen, all the promises sounded so familiarÂ….follow us, work together with usÂ….this company will make more $$$$....we are going regionalÂ…HeyÂ…this sounds like Coslab, just much better. But once bitten twice shy, I wasnÂ’t going to jump into this thing without doing some groundwork.<br><br>To be frank, I was a bit tempted. After all, they say this product Pai Du Mei Yuan Bao (PDMYB) sells like hot cakes at pharmacies and WatsonÂ’s. It will be like Coke or Marlboro doing MLM. Sounds tempting doesnÂ’t it??? And that Long Far will be the only company selling the product soon. I did my research and guess what??? I visited 7 different WatsonÂ’s outlets. Spoke with about 12 sales staff there about the PDMYB and the response I got was, PDMYB doesnÂ’t move very well. 1 particular sales staff even ask me to try another brand which was cheaper and more effective as she had tried it herself. Maybe I should get Eddie to switch to this other brand. Therefore itÂ’s no surprise that this product will be taken off the shelves and sold by Long Far only. You trust me on this, these ex-coslab people can sell ice to Eskimos. PDMYB will definitely have a better sales volume with the ex-coslab people than at WatsonÂ’s.<br><br>How on earth can PDMYB be compared to Coke and Marlboro when not many people buy it when placed on the shelves??? Bryan and Fion are like people at the top, they probably have the whole network done up already. But what about people like me at the bottom??? I think Steve is going to be the only one who will be driving the Maserati or maybe Eddie will dig some money out of his own company and sponsor a few more Maserati just to prove me wrong. Another thing, what do I want to do with PDMYB??? I just donÂ’t think this product appeals to me or maybe just not yet.<br><br>I know the top people like Eddie, Steve, Kevin and Bryan will condemn my little write-up.  They will say things likeÂ….Tree Big Gather WindÂ…..unsuccessful person say unsuccessful stuff.  But if anyone out there have doubts, please go to any WatsonÂ’s. Spend a few hours there and see if anyone picks up PDMYB. I was at the Bugis Junction outlet from about 6pm to 7.30pm and not a single person bought that stuff. That is peak hour, plenty of human traffic, but the product didnÂ’t even sell 1 during the one and a half hour. So, how can PDMYB be compared to Coke??? Or Marlboro???<br><br>I guess itÂ’s a good thing I did my little research, if not I will believe everything they sayÂ….again.  Anyway, whatever promises they gave at Coslab, they have broken it.  I donÂ’t see why I have to risk another few hundred dollars to believe them again.  Maybe under Eddie leadership, the people who join Long Far will make money. But what happens if Eddie decide to go study again??? Or what happens if 2-3 years later, Bryan decided he wants to start a new company, am I suppose to change to a new company again??? Even I think highly of Eddie, everyone makes him sounds like god. So for those at Long Far, do take a bullet for him if necessary. And remember to take a bite out of his every meal in case someone from Coslab wants to poison him.<br><br>I hope those who seriously think of staying at Long Far, do go to WatsonÂ’s to check out how well PDMYB sells. I mean Long Far will have other products, but if the main product donÂ’t sell as well as they make it out to be, I have little faith with the rest of the products. It will be stupid to buy all the products and store them at home. I am sure you guys will be familiar with the tons of anti-oxidant we have stored under our bed.<br><br>NOP sold PDMYB before it close, then this product is taken to the retails shop. Now itÂ’s back to MLM again. If itÂ’s such a premium product, will it changes from hand to hand?  I still have a lot of doubts about Long Far. Since Coslab has already close down, I think I will go back to working for my money.<br><br>To all my friends at Long Far, do take my advice and go check out the sales of PDMYB at Watson yourself. Do not listen to whatever your uplines say, they will probably tell you they have checked it out themselves and the sales is good.  See with your own eyes, go down to a WatsonÂ’s near you and just ask the sales staff.<br><br>And lastly, FionÂ….you are a b-t-h. My friends and I contributed to your income at Coslab and you called us IDIOTS. Hope you take PDMYB and lau sai for 10 hours straight. Just be glad I never tell them what I heard.<br></div></blockquote>is this group that pull people from coslab to long far,so now they are at long far,than this post is your reference about them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting... an online nutritionist largely dependant on the selective usage of information without making reliable references. The only known reference came from ezinearticles.com written by a lady Sarah Tarkovsy, author of "Detox Aids - The Myth of Detoxing", whose command of English &amp; Grammar is far below that of a credible writer, much less a credible consultant in the field of nutrition and detoxification. But that's not to say that the CONTENT is of no value. There are some truths in the article, which i will elaborate later. Oh, and by the way, mdm Tarkovsky also wrote other articles like"Poker Slow Playing - Master It For Huge Gains!" and "Female Erogenous Zones Â– Secrets To Drive Her Wild With Your Tongue" among other more adult posts. You be the judge to the value and seriousness of her articles.<br><br>If i may quote, "Google is your friend". Indeed, but one must be careful with knowing where to look for the right information as we all know, the internet is full of articles that might lead one in the opposite direction. But we all know that things we obtain online should ALWAYS be taken with a pinch of salt. Yes, even this post i'm writing.<br><br><blockquote>take the list of ingredients and search each ingredient... if there are side effects, find out if the stuff mitigates it..<br><br>most of all, i see the stuff is used for "detox"... well, scientifically, "detox" is a lot of rubbish... the body detoxes by binding toxins to stuff produced in the liver and kidneys making the stuff water-soluble and you pass it out as urine..<br><br>drinking water is the best detox..<br></blockquote>Usually, TCM products do not list the full ingredients on the bottles. The formulation is proprietary. Only HSA or FDA (depending on the product of origin) will have the full ingredients. Therefore, one can only have a rough idea of how the product works in concept. But it's not a bad idea ultimately, provided one has the patience and ability to digest all the write-up of each ingredient.<br><br>"Scientifically, detox is a lot of rubbish". I'd like to see which "scientific" journal carried an article with that heading! If it was meant to say that the body detoxifies by itself, yes indeed, it is true. But unfortunately, unless one is a health nut or makes a living staying on mountains nurturing bonsais, chances are, we will intake more toxins that we can purge out. Our current lifestyle here in Singapore do not allow the average joes to live as healthily as our ancestors. Illnesses that used to plague the aged are now infecting &amp; affecting the young as well.<br><br><blockquote>politicians are easy marks.. you just make friends with their secretaries and they won't have a clue what they're opening...<br></blockquote>I'll love to see how our politicians react when they read such an absurd sweeping statement.... simply ridiculous!<br><br><blockquote>$1k will get you 3 bottles (instead of the 6 bottles i was told)<br><br>that'll get you a "rebate" of $150 (probably not in cash but in the next 3 bottles you buy)<br><br>that 3 bottles of crap just cost your sister $333.33 per bottle!<br><br>the next bottles will be $288.33 per bottle!<br><br>and remember.. if she goes the MLM route, other people will be conned for the $1000<br></blockquote>Absolutely incorrect, from what i hear. Perhaps was thrown out of the presentation before fully understanding the marketing plan. Dopechic makes it quite clear.<br><br>Anyone who wants a clearer picture should just receive it from the horse's mouth, and not incomplete assumptions.<br><br><blockquote>"how many generations of recruits do i have to have before i get my $1000 back?"<br></blockquote>The way this question was structured, says pretty much about how much the person asking the question understands and views MLM - an investment. Since treated as an investment, one should leave it into the hands of the professional. Not to mean, leaving it to the manager to sell FOR the prospect, but rather the prospect is involved in the sales process together. That is what makes MLM unique - combining investment and sales together. That is also how MLM sales can afford a higher payout of commission than normal sales, and a higher "interest" from other investment products.<br><br>MLM is after all, just another vehicle for moving products. Whether the end consumer is the agent himself, his friends, relatives, or strangers, it doesn't matter. PRODUCTS HAVE TO MOVE. From the distributor to the customer. Shortening the traditional marketing route allows a bigger piece of the pie to be divided amongst those involved.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Every MLM company should be judged more by its products than its sellers. Ultimately, it is the products that are being used/consumed/inhaled/applied, and not the sellers. Like buying a car, the salesmanship and knowledge of the dealer is important no doubt, but it finally boils down to the condition of the car itself. If the car is damaged, or faulty, whether the company will help to rectify the problem is another point to take note of. Moreover, we are talking about one's well-being here.<br><br>There will be plenty of horror stories about so-and-so agent of so-and-so company who hard-sell and claim that their products are not unlike magic stones. If the majority of "hearsay" is negative, then there must be a slight possibility that there are some truths in them. Otherwise, go and listen and decide for yourself.<br><br>It is more wise to narrow in and focus on the product. If it is good, the person/company distributing it shouldn't matter too much. If it ain't effective, even with the slickest sales-talk and fanciest company image, it can't last long.<br><br>If it's LongFar you want to know, their website is quite comprehensive. They are a listed company in HK after all and are closely watched by the financial &amp; government watchdogs in HK.<br><br>Finally, trust no one, not even my threads, but follow your own judgement.</div>
