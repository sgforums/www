            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone! I heard so much about sgForum from my friends so I decided to check it out yesterday. Upon scrolling down all the top forums I came across 'Multi Level Marketing' so here I am.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Firstly, I want to make it clear that I have never been a distributor of any MLM companies BUT I have worked with them. I used to work as a Product Trainer for a MLM company for many years.<br><br>The word 'MLM' has always been associated with 'Pyramid Selling' and 'Ponzi Schemes' ever since the days of Gemini Chit Fund. If I am not wrong, the general public's opinion is that ANY kind of money-making venture that requires one to put down some capital outlay a.k.a. investments with promises of high returns, is a scam. The GCF drew a lot of flake from the public who demanded that the government bodies DO something to prevent innocent people from being cheated of their live savings. The government did. The Pyramid Selling &amp; MLM Act was enforced.<br><br><strong>http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?actno=REVED-190&amp;doctitle=MULTI%2dLEVEL%20MARKETING%20AND%20PYRAMID%20SELLING%20%28PROHIBITION%29%20ACT 0a&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part</strong><br><br>However, in view of the marked differences in MLM and Pyramid Selling, the Singapore government lifted the ban on MLM in Year 2002.<br><br><strong>http://app.mti.gov.sg/default.asp?id=81</strong><br><br>MLM companies from all over the world flood the market.<br><br>However, to operate a MLM company in Singapore, there is an organization that is working very closely with CASE (Consumer Association of Singapore) and MTI (Ministry of Trade &amp; Industry) in weeding out undesirable 'MLM' companies.<br><br>Basically, for anyone who is interested in joining a MLM company as a distributor, he/she should know his/her rights.<br><br>As the common phobia is of 'being taken for a ride' by MLM companies, this link would be good for you. Please note Clause No. 5.<br><br><strong>http://www.dsas.org.sg/dsas/Html/afterlogin.htm</strong>I have a tendency to write very long articles so please forgive me.</div>

I hope whatever I am able to share (due to my limited knowledge), you will be able to have a clearer picture about what is MLM &amp; why it is very powerful if done in an ethical &amp; correct manner.<br><br>junkieyuri</div>

You don't know me and I don't know you so I don't bother if you like me or not. I post to give my point of view, not to make friends or enemies.<br><br>Those who have expressed their skeptism about MLM in this forum are justified to feel what they feel.<br><br>I understand MLM but that does not mean I brush aside the black sheep distributors in MLM companies.<br><br>Yes, you can be young and perhaps educated and maybe more eloquent than others but as MLM works through DIRECT contacts for development of customers and prospective downlines, it is YOU and who you are that those who know you choose to put their trust in.<br><br>You are wrong in assuming only young people have a greater chance of succeeding in MLM. Older people have a greater advantage as they are liklier to be more respected and BELIEVED when they share with their friends and relatives how XYZ products helped their arthritis, diabetes, migraines, etc, etc.<br><br>You see the approach most young distributors take in their MLm businesses is to focus on making $$$$$, residual income and being your own boss, etc, etc. If no products are sold to people who need them, then where does the $$$$ comes from?<br><br>Share the product if it helps you overcome a specific health problem. If your friends and family members know about your problem they will be thrilled to know you are better. They will not mind listening to you talking about the product. They might even ask 'Does your company has anything to help with my gastric pains?' This is when distributors can be entrusted to recommend the right product or not. There are distributors who forget they are not qualified doctors or health professionals and conduct themselves as 'a healer for all kinds of ailments'. This is where they tread on dangerous grounds as they can lose their credibility once a product they recommended is found to be ineffective for their customer.<br><br>If a network marketer does his/her MLM business this way, i.e. by first using the products and then recommending the products to others it will require years before any $$$$ can be earned. The longer he/she is with the company, the higher the chance he/she has of converting his/her customers to be downlines.<br><br>I believe anyone who is anti-MLM can see the logic of what I said.<br><br>It is those distributors who harass their friends with 'I am in a great business that will enable me to earn $10,000 in a month. I feel you can do it too. How about coming with me to a meeting this Friday and find out for yourself?' - One or two friends might just oblige but most of them will be wary and skeptical.<br><br>No more friends to harass? Well....some of these MLMers think forums are the ideal places for prospecting. The veil of being anonymous is so much more attractive.<br><br>Btw, I believe in MLM as a good business opportunity. I also believe NOT everyone has the tenacity to stick to it for 5 - 10 years.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MamaRos:</div><div class="quote_body">"apprarently what i feel of you - intially it's bad, few days back it's good, now it's bad again...partly due to your years of experience which puts a barrier in front of you..thus you only do a selective picking of people whom you want to meet..." extract from fallen's post.<br><br>What irony! You don't know me and I don't know you so I don't bother if you like me or not. I post to give my point of view, not to make friends or enemies.<br><br>Those who have expressed their skeptism about MLM in this forum are justified to feel what they feel.<br><br>I understand MLM but that does not mean I brush aside the black sheep distributors in MLM companies.<br><br>Yes, you can be young and perhaps educated and maybe more eloquent than others but as MLM works through DIRECT contacts for development of customers and prospective downlines, it is YOU and who you are that those who know you choose to put their trust in.<br><br>You are wrong in assuming only young people have a greater chance of succeeding in MLM. Older people have a greater advantage as they are liklier to be more respected and BELIEVED when they share with their friends and relatives how XYZ products helped their arthritis, diabetes, migraines, etc, etc.<br><br>You see the approach most young distributors take in their MLm businesses is to focus on making $$$$$, residual income and being your own boss, etc, etc. If no products are sold to people who need them, then where does the $$$$ comes from?<br><br>Share the product if it helps you overcome a specific health problem. If your friends and family members know about your problem they will be thrilled to know you are better. They will not mind listening to you talking about the product. They might even ask 'Does your company has anything to help with my gastric pains?' This is when distributors can be entrusted to recommend the right product or not. There are distributors who forget they are not qualified doctors or health professionals and conduct themselves as 'a healer for all kinds of ailments'. This is where they tread on dangerous grounds as they can lose their credibility once a product they recommended is found to be ineffective for their customer.<br><br>If a network marketer does his/her MLM business this way, i.e. by first using the products and then recommending the products to others it will require years before any $$$$ can be earned. The longer he/she is with the company, the higher the chance he/she has of converting his/her customers to be downlines.<br><br>I believe anyone who is anti-MLM can see the logic of what I said.<br><br>It is those distributors who harass their friends with 'I am in a great business that will enable me to earn $10,000 in a month. I feel you can do it too. How about coming with me to a meeting this Friday and find out for yourself?' - One or two friends might just oblige but most of them will be wary and skeptical.<br><br>No more friends to harass? Well....some of these MLMers think forums are the ideal places for prospecting. The veil of being anonymous is so much more attractive.<br><br>Btw, I believe in MLM as a good business opportunity. I also believe NOT everyone has the tenacity to stick to it for 5 - 10 years.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>I'll break your replies into different parts..<br><br>by which paragraphs = para for simplicity..<br><br>para 1 : yes, our objective here is just to share and dicuss, but don't you agree with me that even friends started off from strangers?<br><br>just because we are some how or rather with different set of views, doesn't means that we can get to know each other as friend perhaps?<br><br>this is networking; not for purpose of recruitment but rather to widen social cycle only..<br><br>i'm don't have the phase "everything is related to mlm" that short of words imprinted on my forehead do i?<br><br>lol..just normal casual friends..for just some discussions..<br><br>para 2 : true, reasonable, but not all can be trusted, because it's rather a 1-sided story, we have to hear both sides thus able to decide on our own if what others commended on any company are either true/fake<br><br>para 4 : well said - trust is a very much deciding factor to see if a fren/person trust you enough..<br><br>but if you have being trained to pick and approach strangers, basically there's no trust between you (bridge) and the client (prospect) thus when propsect walks into the company and listens, prospect trust only his/her eyes and hears..which is why i wanna share with all the people here on how to actually go about decideing and observe if a company/products/people are good working partners..<br><br>but the problem is, many choose to stay at home and read the replies rather than to meet and have a discussion on such issues, which is what i strongly believe in - discussion face to face is always better than discussions via online etc, coz it misses out the personal touch - the feeling.. thus the message or keypoints are NOT CARRIED ACROSS to the readers..<br><br>para 5 - i say 50/50 you're right, i'm right as well..(no one is wrong - coz we have our different views...[just like in BGR, there's No Right OR Wrong - agree?]<br>older folks do have more convincing power via word of mouth...[fact] but not all, it depends on the character of the person before when he/she was once young to determine if the old folks are trustworthy or not...<br><br>why i say youngsters have a greater chance in success, is because they have more of the element needed for success - Hunger..how much do you desire and how much are you willing to put in?<br><br>Success to many of us - is it just<br>1- a want<br>2- a need<br>3- a must<br>4- die die must attain it<br>5- just work and earn money than worry later lor..<br><br>para 6 : the reason why youngsters focus on $_$/ s 11 is because they know they power of $_$ but at their young age, they still pretty don't know nor will value the importance of friendships nor soul mates nor confidant etc those short of stufss..<br><br>why most are only $_$ is mainly due to the reason that most companies train agents to look towards $$ and worship $$ like god rather than teaching their how to handle respect money and family ties as well as other things which might be just as important as money...or perhaps is worthless (can't be tagged for price, coz it's priceless that short of thing)<br><br>agree?<br><br>i've being through this stage as well..which is why i'm here to share and meet people just to know more people, not to recruit people..like many other people's motive is to recruit people..<br><br>it is solely depends on the level of hunger...<br><br>para 7 : product sharing..<br>there's a lot of ways to achieve this objective..<br>take photos (before after)<br>long time friend as witness<br>record your testimonial of product recovery.<br><br>product sharing boils down to the company training and education that it imparts to the distributors...as there's a saying.."shang liang bu zhen, xia liang wia"<br><br>para 8 : althoug in most cases it takes a long time, but if you really put in committment and do it part time it's achievable in half a year, but the quesiton is do people join mlm for fast money or for security?<br><br>i join not for fast money, thus i'm able to learn and see what others normally over-looked..<br><br>para 10 : again it boils down to the Quality Agents and Training CLasses their leaders impart to them..<br><br>para 11 : it's be belief and with some links to hunger element to decide if the agent is here for a short while or is here to stay...<br><br>this hunger element is based on individual, thus how successful or how they are such a failure depends on who, what, when, why and how such issues happen etc..<br><br>if it's right - a hungry person will find ot, ask lots of ire-relevent questions..<br></div>
