Although I'm guilty myself sometimes, but I try not to do so. I'm also a member a mlm companies, both local and foreign. I'm in this industry since 98, one more year and it will be my 10 anniversary. Damn I'm old.<br><br>Secondly, some of your replies may also be view as evasive and not based on any facts but personal opinions of course which everyone is entitled to. However mixing personal opinions in with arguments can be very misleading, especially to newbies who generally have no knowledge about this industry.<br><br>Thirdly, although there are many negatives about local mlm companies (I myself is guilty of posting some of them) there are people earning 5-figures every month in their second year of full timing in the company. So overly blasting about the negative side of a local mlm company may to a certain extend lead a newbie to "siam" local mlm company altogether, which is something I'm sure no one would want to be guilty off. No one is qualify to judge any company (be it local or foreign). No one is able to predict one would not make money in a  company that have "negative" or "not widely accepted" teachings.<br><br>Some companies teaches never to put down another company, even if its their strongest rival. They are not to slander, criticise, accused, whatever their rivals. They can only say things with facts, not personal opinions or general impressions, so that things can be argued on a true neutral ground.<br><br>Shouldn't all of us here do that?<br><br>Finally things change with time; opinions change with time. The blacks are inferior. Twins are devil's reincarnation. Women must bind their feet to be proper and cultured. The world is flat. Nobody needs computers. All these are no longer applicable.<br><br>One day everyone may be a member of several mlm companies; or one day mlm may fall out of sync; one day a nuclear war may occur; one day mother nature decides to blow her top... no one can predict the future. Who is to say we will not swallow ours words and actions tmr?<br><br>When I sit down and reflect upon what I did and what I didn't do, sometimes I couldn't help but wonder whether whatever I had done was correct. What if I had add a "bloody hell" or a "you are welcome" or a "great job" to the end of a conversation?<br><br>I'm not that great a noble man (or Miss Universe contestant) to ask for world peace, but how about a fact-based discussion in the forums, without unnecessary flaming, slanders, etc. I guess that would not happen, but I'm doing my part.<br><br>I'm fortunate to come across a quote that I hold dear to myself (am and trying to put into practice everyday). I shall post it here, its not in the exact words (cos its written in 1950s english), hope it will mean something to you.<br><br>"Even God himself do not judge someone until he enters heaven's gates, who are we, mere mortals, to?"<br><br>This will be my final post in this forum.</strong></div>

For this company. The people here is really very helpful and friendly as the direct also personal come to help out their down line when their down line need help with it.. but Some others mLm Company i went b4 the up line does not even care or bored to help one. as here everyone work just like in a big family just like sec home for all the people here.....<br><br>this is what i saw in LFI ....

I had no idea what they were driving at until we went up to their "office" and they start telling me about their "business plans"... gave me "special" price since I am a student... wasted my 2 hours there... in the end I just left saying I have no money (like 100 times)<br>so how different is it? with its hard sell tactics, boasting their "friends" who earned enough money in a few months to be driving a BMW, said goh chok tong will be at their opening ceremony, said they will become the sole distributor of Long Far PDMYB.
