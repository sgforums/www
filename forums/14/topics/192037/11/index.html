            <div class='col-md body'>Fact:<br><strong>1. LFI is a business. </strong><br>Read: It is not a charitable organization, therefore it needs to make money, therefore it has a margin for all the products it sells, therefore no need to state the obvious that the marketing plan is realistically beneficial to the company &amp; the distributors. If the balance is tipped too much in favour of the the company and not the distributors, distributors don't make enough and walk away. If the payout is too incredulous to believe, then it probably is - don't even touch it.<br><br><strong>2. LFI is a MLM business.</strong><br>Read: In MLM, as with every other businesses, there are success stories and failures. A handful of individual failures don't represent the majority - Singapore is a developed market-driven nation - whatever is not popular with the people will automatically be eradicated by the market in due time (Read: Bubble Tea). A few unsuccessful stories don't say much about the company - but says a lot about the individual. If one is not successful, save yourself the embarrassment of declaring one's incompetency to the world on the forum and lie through your teeth you never was a distributor of any MLM company but was just a "customer". It helps ease the sense of individual failure and impotence of one's ability to achieve results that others have already proven to be possible.<br><br><strong>3. MLM businesses follows the market's Golden Rule of 80/20 or 95/5</strong><br>Read: Whichever statistic you choose to adopt, distributors of MLM companies are not immune to failure - just that the cost of failure is much cushioned by the fact that the MLM "business" does not have the same kinds of financial penalties of traditional businesses like running costs. He who claims that anyone and everyone who participates in XYZ MLM company is SURE to succeed is either a liar or under aged.<br><br><strong>4. Hearsay is not admissible in the Courts of Law worldwide.</strong><br>And there's a reason why - it's just not reliable to depend on what people other than the accused and plaintiffs have to say. Though this ain't no courtroom, but surely, with people posting behind nicks and pseudo-names, whatever that is written here should just be taken as entertainment, inclusive of my own posting.<br><br>If there's anything to be learnt from this thread, they are as follow:<br><strong>1. Don't eat McDonald's, use Windows, or be employed.</strong><br>Why? Coz McDonald's is apparently making TONS of money from you, since they are such a big conglomerate, NYSE listed and all....<br>Why? Coz Bill Gates is already a multi billionaire... and he puts stuff in your OS to spy on your activities.... whahahha..... use Linux instead.<br>Why? Coz the work you put in for your employers are worth dozen more to the company than the amount that you receive at the end of the month.<br>Heck, just go build yourself a hut on Pulau Pesek Kecil (last heard still unoccupied south of our country), so that no one can take advantage of you or your ass-ets.<br><br>(I choose to ignore this lesson since as a learned working adult, I know that every willing transaction has to be beneficial to AT LEAST one party, ideally, to both parties or more. You demand a service/product for your own benefit, be prepared to pay an equal and fair price for it)<br><br><strong>2. Condemn and boycott all companies (especially MLM companies) that explore and use more than one marketing/business methods/practices because they aren't being "true to their commitments, customers or trade".</strong><br>And that will include Dell computers (who have brick and mortar shops now as opposed to direct selling), McDonald's (again.... for using delivery services instead of OTC - that's Over-The-Counter for all you children out there who aren't familiar with professional abbreviations), and all conveyor-belted sushi outlets for not making their sushis fresh by a chef who must at least look like an ethnic Japanese.<br><br>(Give me a break and grow up please. Just because LFI puts PDMYB on Guardian's shelves, harnesses the strength of traditional advertising, and integrate MLM at the same time does not make the products less effective/company more susceptible to scamming/distributors making less money. If anything, advertising raises the profile of the company/product even higher - READ: nothing to hide - and thus much easier to start a topic with prospective customers.)<br><br>If you have lasted through this long post till now, allow me to take the guesswork out of you - Yes, I am unabashedly a LFI distributor. I also repeat what I said earlier - don't believe everything you read, hear or even see. There is a reason why 2 people reading, hearing, and seeing exactly the same things can form completely different views on the subject. Difference lies in experience and intelligence.<br><br>I don't necessarily agree with some fellow distributors who over exaggerate things like ABC minister opening or XYZ celebrity endorsement just to close a deal. Totally unimportant in the prospect's consideration when contemplating signing up or not. Who really cares if Fiona Xie is endorsing LFI's products or not? In the prospect's mind are more important issues like credibility of company, effectiveness of products, service standards of company, personal growth potential, ease of product sales and distribution, and last but not least, the support of the recruiter and uplines. The rest, are just icing on the cake. If a prospect signs up BECAUSE of hoping to meet Fiona Xie, then, that's  a tell-tale sign of how "qualified" the prospect is.<br><br>I find that if I am unable to utilise existing tools available to me to close sales, then what's the use of employing unestablished "facts" to try to convince my prospects when those things have not realised yet? Ultimately, my own credibility is at stake if they do not happen. So for all out there, when someone makes claims about future plans, don't reject it straightaway, nor embrace it as the gospel truth. Take a minute to contemplate about the reliability of the person who makes the claim, and then form your own conclusions.<br><br>Too long a post. Reply the rest of the issues another time.</div>

There is a wireless version of this called the MOBILE PHONE. It also comes with a paid service that directs you to a operator when you dial "100". Ask for LFI's telephone number and ask the customer services desk for all your queries. I can give the answers to you right now but I choose not to. <span style="font-style: italic;">"Better to teach a man to fish than to fish for him".</span><br><br>And if you have done sales but yet to receive any payment, then you should call up the company directly and ask. Don't worry, all payment made are by cheque to payee only so odds of your introducers pocketing the money for themselves is virtually zero. If it's there and it's not been claimed, just go and get it from the counter yourself, no need to feel disappointed. Better to call and ask all the questions first before going down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting concept..... but I think a variation of that idea works better:<br><br>Buy from a a disgrunted customer cheap, sell it off to the next fella, pocket the money, and wait for the 2nd customer to feel lousy about the deal, then buy back from him cheap again, and sell it on to a 3rd customer - all the while pretending to be an authorised agent, but never appearing at the office. Customers feel cheated, goes to company and kicks up a big fuss, but since no invoice, nothing can be done. Matter is reported to the authorities under the recommendation of the company to protect its own interest, the conman is caught and sent off to the slammer. 3-5 years for cheating.<br><br>On second thought, nah......... I think I'll still buy OTC @ LFI direct, thank you. I can't manage that kind of risks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why i said LFI agent are good in lying, my friend told me to join, he promise me that he will help me and i do not really need to do anything. He said he is all out, you can see him there nearly everyday. He still mention that he own me alot and he is very confident to make us both rich together. He still told me got alot of people earning alot of money in their full time job is also part time LFI agent. But after one month, i still cannot find who are those rich guy earning alot in their full time job. Most of the people i encounter there are having their full time job pay of less than $2500 per month, and alot more having less then $2K. They said alot of high paid job people are joining LFI, but i see none. Maybe there are some, but i think they have all left LFI.</div>
