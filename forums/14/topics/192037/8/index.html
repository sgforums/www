They're just paying you [later] what's rightfully yours at an earlier time.<br><br>Clearly, it is a "company benefits the most" type of MLM.<br><br>Anyone want the details can msg me.<br><br>Lol you change your mind fast!<br>[<span style="font-style: italic;">img]My favorite saying is,<br><br><strong>"There's no right or wrong in this world, only what serves or doesn't serve you."</strong>[/img]Think hard on that. True or not?</span><br>And, "If what you say doesn't serve, don't say it."<br><br>Lastly, before you guys go imagining silly scenarios and construing bad impressions of Longfar because of some errant members who didn't get enough training, MESSAGE or EMAIL me and I will tell you more.<br><br>Especially, those who're looking out for their siblings, talk to me about Long Far. Good product, Good pay-scheme, Prompt Payment, Great Training, Great Support system.<br><br>1)Firstly i guess you fail in line because you try to recuit people the aggressive way cause you have too much confident that the company can go far but others don't that's why they turn you down.First of all no matter how confident you are people won't trust you as there are too many who fail on mlm and with the bad news about it spreading around.Bad news are always easlier to assorb rather than good news and this are spread by those who fail and when news spread around it will be modify with this and that.<br><br>2)Well why is the product been selling well at guardian?cause the market is still big and agents are not sharing and selling as they concentrate on work itself.<br><br>3)To be sold at guardian is a good idea cause it where most will buy health product and lots and its gonna be like mac someday as there are ads are been shown on tv,newspaper and lots around nowadays.If you are selling it cheaper where will they go?when they have a need for it where will they go?<br><br>4)Is the percentage that important when you can't even sell product that have a trustable brand to go with it?If the company is big oversea and its an mlm product that's not sold anywhere will you be able to sell it well?Normally those who fail didn't sell it well as they are rejected by friends and relatives that are the closest market to them cause they don't even know if it will bring them harm though they know you won't.Thus you will turn to hard selling and you will therefore fail and it will apply to all mlm no matter where you go.Keep it in mind those who failed in mlm industry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont blame people that dont really understand MLM and scare that MLM is out there to cheat them.. That's all because they are lack of knowledge abt MLMs.. But if you ask yourself - who the fook can earn so much at such a fast time?? Look around you.. There's alot.. And where got so good 1!! ppl study until so high but their pay is lower den the one doing MLM!! Look around you there's also alot.. It's just the matter of you want it anot? I'm not saying MLM is a can join.. And also dont mean that MLM is a cannot join.. I only believe in if u believe u can succeed.. Simple? Why bother so much on things that you dont even believe it can work??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Few months back i have join LFI, my friend cheat me there and told me that he had already earn alot, then he told me that he owe me alot during school time and he can pay back to me if i join. He know that i do not like MLM and have no time for it, but he make a promise to me that he can help me settle everything. I join because he was so confident, for me its like paying 2k, investing in my good friend.<br><br>But after i join, my friend and his senior keep on calling me, tell me to go down, keep on influence my mind, and follow their mind. They still conduct lesson of how to cheat you friend to join, how to make appointment, tell you act rich and influence your friend mind. all bullshit to me.<br><br>Later i found out that actullay my friend did not earn that much and the research given by those talker are not all truth. If you did research in that company, you will find some hidden info that are not review by them.<br><br>LFI people keep telling people that they are not the same as other MLM, but after joining, you will felt that they are all the same.</div>
