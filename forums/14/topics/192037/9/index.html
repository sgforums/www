In fact I just left LFI. Best thing I ever did. I just got so pissed off by the pay plan being in Malaysian Ringgit. 36-38% payout ain't good enough. No start up incentives for newbies who drag themselves out evening after evening, to earn just $30-50+ for sponsoring someone who invests $1000. Global profit sharing?

Good product, Good pay-scheme, Prompt Payment, Great Training, Great Support system.<br><br>1)Firstly i guess you fail in line because you try to recuit people the aggressive way cause you have too much confident that the company can go far but others don't that's why they turn you down.First of all no matter how confident you are people won't trust you as there are too many who fail on mlm and with the bad news about it spreading around.Bad news are always easlier to assorb rather than good news and this are spread by those who fail and when news spread around it will be modify with this and that.<br><br>2)Well why is the product been selling well at guardian?cause the market is still big and agents are not sharing and selling as they concentrate on work itself.<br><br>3)To be sold at guardian is a good idea cause it where most will buy health product and lots and its gonna be like mac someday as there are ads are been shown on tv,newspaper and lots around nowadays.If you are selling it cheaper where will they go?when they have a need for it where will they go?<br><br>4)Is the percentage that important when you can't even sell product that have a trustable brand to go with it?If the company is big oversea and its an mlm product that's not sold anywhere will you be able to sell it well?Normally those who fail didn't sell it well as they are rejected by friends and relatives that are the closest market to them cause they don't even know if it will bring them harm though they know you won't.Thus you will turn to hard selling and you will therefore fail and it will apply to all mlm no matter where you go.Keep it in mind those who failed in mlm industry.[/b]</blockquote>still no people order from me, you still dare to said LFI selling cheap. i have gone their training before, they should rename the training program to "how to con your friend and be our slave"</div>

Thanks. </div></blockquote>i was just wondering if there is any difference if the product came from an MLM company or if it came from a traditional retailer or distributor? as far as I know, longfar pharmacuetical has been a traditional manufacturing company all this while &amp; if you have been taking the product for a long time, it would imply that you find the product effective &amp; has already established some form of consumer loyalty with the product &amp; indirectly, with the company. I believe MLM has not been legalized in China, &amp; longfar has MLM divisions only in S'pore &amp; M'sia.<br><br>let us consider the scenario where MLM will diminish the quality of a product &amp; therefore makes it relatively inferior than before. so if Coke (the cola) has gone the MLM route, will you stop drinking Coke? what about Nokia? start selling off your mobile phone (if it is a Nokia). If your answer is No, then I believe that the same logic should be applied to B&amp;H capsules (at the very least) &amp; any subsequent product launched by LFI (S'pore) or longfar's subsidiary companies.<br><br>my point is that MLM is objectively, a way of distributing a company's product or service, not a method of manufacturing, not a method of company management per se. let us not let the stigma associated with MLM in S'pore cloud our judgement.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, I think the product is decent but the way the marketing is conducted is terrible. I was also pulled to such a talk at Prosper House; over there, some army regular whom I know told me that since he started doing this, he's earned thousands of dollars to pay off his credit card debts and that in a good case scenario, we can easily earn 10k a month.<br><br>However, during his explanation, I found out that the Maths just didn't add up to that kinda 5-figure sum so I requested to bring home the piece of paper to further analyze at home. I was rejected immediately, so I already knew what kinda scam this was.<br><br>Anyway, I was offered a significantly lower price to join them when I didn't reply to them after 1 week. Suddenly got 50% discount, so become $400+. Haha, honestly even you give it to me at $100, I also won't give a flying shit about it.<br><br>Sad to say, a lotta army regular friends have been sucked into this trap. Let me just tell you something: all my friends who entered MLM withdrew from it because they finally realised that it's damn difficult to earn any decent income from this and when your friends start rejecting all your phone calls, you know how socially disasterous you've become.<br><br>Anyway, don't you find it so hypocritical that such a large number of the "distributors" smoke when they throw you so much hullabaloo about detox? I feel like just telling them that the first step in detox is to quit that habit. No offence to smokers, I'm one myself too but I still see the stinging irony in this.<br><br>Some more funny things about this company:<br><br>- I was told during the presentation that ministers endorse this product and Fiona Xie is likely to be the person featured in the TV commercials. Turned out to be Marcus Chin. Haha, Long Far cut budget ah?<br><br>- To be honest, their advertisements featuring 2 skimpily-dressed ladies in those magazines is very 80s. I'd expect something more professional from a "top pharmaceutical company".<br><br>- People who tried to coerce me 3 months ago into entering this scheme are now cursing and swearing at the system. I guess that says a lot.<br><br>My take on all these schemes: they prey on Singaporeans' greed and want-to-get-rich-without-doing-too-much-work mentality. Get real, what makes you think there're so many easy ways to make money? Invest in your education, work on your people skills and grab the right opportunities; these are still the time-tested ways of making a decent living. Not psychoing every single person you know into joining a bogus get-rich-quick scheme.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OKOK, Long Far associate aka JunkieYuri, I have nothing against Long Far or you. I'm just stating my experience with the company and what I felt.<br><br>I have no advertising credentials, so you don't need to bother to get the company to hire me. In any case, I wouldn't want to work for LFI.<br><br>Care to share how much you've made since you joined LFI? That is obviously the most effective way to get people to join you. I just found it ludicrous that my promoter claimed he could pay off all his credit card debts after joining the company for 2 months.</div>
