Every mlm company will tell you the same thing. It's a gross generalisation, but considering my experience, yes. After you listen to them you will find its all the same.<br><br>Step 1: Bluff your friend down on pretense of a meal, etc<br>Step 2: "By the way" Talk about young people earning alot, show them to the mlm office.<br>Step 3: "By the way" Say something great about a certain "manager" his accomplishments and how much he earn in a short time and how busy is he recruiting poeple/earning money....and then suddenly the manager appear and is ok to sit down 2 hours with you immediately to talk about the company's business plan.<br><br>The only more respectable companies that usually wun bluff people down are those bigger western companies like amway, herbalife.</div>

He say their edge over other mlm companies are LF will spend money to advertise the product so that its easier for mlmers to sell.<br><br>In Nov i msg him "where's your TV ad"? he never reply.<br><br>He also showed me a method of how to do the business by just bringing down 3-4 friends and will be able to earn a good amt. Till now had only had one new downline, his gf.<br><br>He also show me this guy this guy still in NS, now here working  part time, earning already much more then his NS pay.<br><br>He also say this guy in insurance, but also working here and is earning much more than what he is earning in insurance.<br><br>He say company got high level executives, uni students, grads, corporate managers, ex-mlmers from other companies who after knowing this company, jump and join here.<br><br>He say got goh chok tong or somebody specially invite them to establish their mlm business here.<br><br>He say fiona xie and marcus chin are embassors for LF, but from what I've heard, Fiona Xie is embassor for some yogurt drink and LF is trying to make a deal with that yogurt drink company and claimed once the deal goes through, fiona will automatically become LF's embassor. (Which is false). Marcus chin is also not an embassor for LF, he is just "paid to advertisement in poster" for their product. It's a one-off thing, not even an official embassor.<br><br>And yes, the office is located 10 min from Aljunied MRT, but still at a ulu place. So what if it's 10min from Aljunied MRT? Not many people past by there.<br><br>If your company is so great, why do your members have to lie to me to bring me to your office? Why can't they just say something like what other sales people do? example "Hi, I selling panadols, property, cars, insurance, household items, etc...would u be interested to find out more?"<br><br></div></blockquote>haha, they also told me goh chok tong invite them to establish their mlm business in singapore, i was also being told of all those fake stuff that you have mention and alot more.<br><br>I told my friend some of the false info that they have mention, my friend will laugh at me and correct me with his stupid ans, when i talk back, he will call his upline to come and talk to me, and same thing stupid and false info again, normally i will act blur and ask him question, but inside of me is laughing at their ans.<br><br>LFI people, did more research on your products and company, and not repeat what your upline have told you.<br><br>To me friendship in more important, if you think money is more important, take all your money and fly to india or some other poor country, you will be very rich with no friend there. Most important thing is, do not con people in joining.<br><br></div>

Because people from there all talk the same kuan one.<br><br>I seriously don't wish to draw any more brickbats from LFI personnel anymore because it's as if I'm talking about apples and you shoot me about oranges.<br><br>I'm just glad that my education has taught me enough logic to discern good companies from bogus ones. For those of you who still firmly believe in LFI, go ahead! You're not wrong, you just have different beliefs.<br><br>Anyway, I get your job interview analogy but like I said, it's as if I'm debating on about why the Saddam Hussein execution video should not be broadcast and you're going on about Iran and Syria being America's next targets. It totally does not refute my point about how people there are dishonest about the kind of money you should be expecting.<br><br>10k/month just by introducing 3 levels of downlines? Cmon, it's already hard enough to get 1 person to join you, needless to say each of these 3 under you getting 3 who get another 3. Honestly, from what I saw in the presentation, a terribly hardworking person can probably earn at most $1,000 per month in the company.<br><br>It's so funny that everyone working there is so evasive about the amount of money they draw from this whole scheme because YOU HAVE ALL BEEN TAUGHT TO LIE ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF INCOME YOU'RE DRAWING SO THAT OTHERS CAN BE COERCED INTO JOINING. I've some MLM-ers in my former camp too; they're always saying how they earn 5-figure sums etc. but at the end of the day, I don't see any improvement in their lifestyles!

Because people from there all talk the same kuan one.<br><br>I seriously don't wish to draw any more brickbats from LFI personnel anymore because it's as if I'm talking about apples and you shoot me about oranges.<br><br>I'm just glad that my education has taught me enough logic to discern good companies from bogus ones. For those of you who still firmly believe in LFI, go ahead! You're not wrong, you just have different beliefs.<br><br>Anyway, I get your job interview analogy but like I said, it's as if I'm debating on about why the Saddam Hussein execution video should not be broadcast and you're going on about Iran and Syria being America's next targets. It totally does not refute my point about how people there are dishonest about the kind of money you should be expecting.<br><br>10k/month just by introducing 3 levels of downlines? Cmon, it's already hard enough to get 1 person to join you, needless to say each of these 3 under you getting 3 who get another 3. Honestly, from what I saw in the presentation, a terribly hardworking person can probably earn at most $1,000 per month in the company.<br><br>It's so funny that everyone working there is so evasive about the amount of money they draw from this whole scheme because YOU HAVE ALL BEEN TAUGHT TO LIE ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF INCOME YOU'RE DRAWING SO THAT OTHERS CAN BE COERCED INTO JOINING. I've some MLM-ers in my former camp too; they're always saying how they earn 5-figure sums etc. but at the end of the day, I don't see any improvement in their lifestyles! Cmon lah, you earn 5 figures and still not willing to buy a car? Get real!<br><br>Lastly, I have no idea why JunkieYuri deleted ALL his posts. Well, if what we've said can make people actually sit down and think about their current situation, then I think wasting 10minutes of my precious time to type all this out is worth it.</div></blockquote>1) one look and you think i'm form LFI?<br>lol - go take a look in other mlm threads, did i recommend them LFI or did i just try to give a balance view?<br><br>2) if you want a balance view, can have good if not better logic than me - than kindly refer to the mlm thread of "A job, A business , MLM" that thread.<br><br>3) I'm not trying to pull anybody or anyone into any industry. Nor did i advertised in recent posts* (post with age 2 months or less)<br><br>4) my logic is not wrong like you have said, it's just different beliefs. - this I have to agree with you, but i didn't say at any point of time recommend LFI in any recent posts*.<br><br>5) why i bother to type so much - if you know your stuff of MLM for at least a year and have discuss with top leaders from different companies or even challenged some leaders from other companies + talked to different people of different ages. than your knowledge should be enough to give general examples like I did. If not better examples than me.<br><br>Luckily, i have the opportunity to go challenge leader from other company - although it's not professional * (but i only did that when they force me to the wall than only did i pin-point their disadvantages in their face- hard selling; close door let dogs out [guan men fang gou] that  type of company. you know right?) so i am considered lucky to be able to learn all these stuffs (which cannot be taught nor bought - but can be shared) and of course some personal interest in finding out on all money making methods exposes me to many more options.<br><br>I have being trying to give examples to to let people understand the basics.<br>But if you want to say that you know how to choose a good company, than i like to invite you out for a drink and we shall discuss our knowledge face to face and not in the forums.<br><br>General and simple stuffs - forums (since there are a lot of rookies)<br>A bit slightly advance stuffs, private discussions (face to face)<br><br>Why i don't like to pose advance stuffs online - i feel that by posting advance stuffs online , it will only complicate things more.<br><br>Example: Ask LKY to come and discuss if not teach us ordinary citizens to run the country, istead of listening with an open mind, many will criticize this and that because most of us are simply Not Interested in how a country should be run.<br><br>if you were to discuss any businesses/ possibilities of setting up a joint venture or tradditional businesses, i am more than welcome to meet you up and listen if you have any (putting mlm business aside).<br><br>Simple people have simple doings.<br>Since you know more, than we can meet up and discuss.<br>Easy stuffs - normal people do<br>Hard stuffs - govt or people who willing to learn go settle<br>Not complicated this way. Does that sounds simple?<br><br>Those people who wants to earn $ - will listen to more ideas<br>Those people not prepared to earn $ - will say this bad, complain and blame a lot of things, but not themselves. [this part is to answer to what you said in your last paragraph]<br><br>Regarding the post on you commenting on LFI way of doing things and the payment scheme, i will not comment on that, for the sole reason that I have to maintain my professionalism.<br><br>As for another part which is me commenting on N*I's investment scheme - that is just what i want to warn people of. Anyone can choose not to believe, it's alright with me, but it's my duty as a person who have so call being 'conned' by them to give some insights and advice to people who might be interested in the investment scheme. [my personal experiene]<br><br>Lastly - regarding the apple orange issue, do point out exactly where did i say out of point, i will try my best to edit and reply respectively - do guide me along, for there are no perfect people with no records of making mistakes at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's good that you've brought up some inadequacies in NTI's investment scheme in the other thread, which I personally have not read yet.

That's my own personal experience. After reading through some threads in this forum, my doubts have only been further compounded. I hate to see so many poly/uni students, NSFs, retirees and ORD personnel waste a large amount of time (and possibly money) in certain bogus firms. And it seems like once problems hit the company, all they need to do is close it down and start a new branch. Case in point, NOP's Magic Kingdom (which I was told to invest in a few times). It almost seems as if the founders of the company have an aura of immunity; while being pursued by thousands of people who want their money back, they can so easily just open another company and commence another MLM chain again.<br><br>And another problem now seems to be the products. My friend's mother was coerced into buying a magnetic mattress for $8,000! She's those illiterate sorts who don't really understand much and under hard-selling, she just crumbled. It's not even as if she can well afford it. Currently, what I see is that the products are priced considerably higher than their cost price which allows for commissions at so many different levels. I'll be really interested to know how much a bottle of PDMYB costs in the pharmacies in HK.</div>

Than i bring those t-shirts back to Singapore, need to go through the customs, pay for tax, gst and other small little expenses.<br><br>the tax gst etc ADDS on to the cost of my t-shirts, so i have to increase the selling cost of the t-shirt price when i sell it in Singapore. Than if a customer wants to compare which t-shirt (example there are a lot of t-shirt stores in a same street) than the person will go to every single store to compare the price and quality based in Singapore looking at the different stores.<br><br>they will not ask about their cost price which is not concerning the customer.<br><br>so when you compare the price of pdmyb, do so when you compare it on local market context, don't jump to other countries.<br><br>if you want to know about the price of local mlm selling price and guradian price, i can refer you to my friend who's in lfi.<br><br>i see that you are still skeptical of mlm - which is pretty normal. if you want to learn more on mlm as a whole industry - i will not recommend any mlm companies in the course of interaction unless you request.<br><br>since you're a experienced person who have done mlm, than maybe we can meet and disucss futher if you like to clear your doubts.<br><br>i welcome any other people who are interested to know more as well.<br>but please, no trouble makers or people who want to advertise for their company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NWM&gt; Yes, someone had already mentioned it earlier on.<br><br>Thanks for reminding me. That's another funny thing that's happened. During the promotional talk, I was told that the products will be withdrawn from the shelves of Guardian and Watsons shortly, so all the B&amp;H in the market will have to be bought from LFI's agents! Wow, what a promising market!<br><br>And of course, at the present moment, not only can we get it at Guardian and Watsons, your up-and-coming NTUC UnityCare and medical halls also stock it! Maybe soon to be available at all leading supermarkets too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I leave you readers to draw your own conclusions from this.
