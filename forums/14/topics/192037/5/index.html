I will not even go into mentioning the many millions of stockholders that have been insulted for their lack of discretion for investing in a potentially fradulent company. But frankly, we don't really care, do we?<br><br>If it does not make sense, it's easy to brush aside claiming it is nonsensical. I fail to see why it's nonsensical when both examples have relevant similarities in that not having access to, does not mean non-existence. Faith was not mentioned, and i do agree that it's absurd to bring faith (or blind faith) into the subject of health products.<br><br>So this thread will become another NTI thread, i await in eager anticipation to help up the entertainment index here.... If discussions are conducted in a fair, matured and educated manner, it's for the better of the forum, i'm sure.

Sure, it lends weight to a company's profile if there is a high flying VIP opening, but then again, it's just a ceremony, nothing to be made a big hoo-haa about.<br><br>&amp; MLM_Victim, same response, same level of intellect. Welcome back into the ring. </div></blockquote>To Mr Tom's Dick is Hairy..<br><br>Indeed... I'm griefed... Your mere mention of <strong>"Correction. It should be "There's no concrete evidence (i mean scientific proof) AVAILABLE TO ME about Pai Du Mei Yan Bao.<br><br>There's no scientific proof that a higher being exists, but that doesn't stop billions across the globe from going to churches, mosques, temples &amp; synagogues."</strong> devastated me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The threadstarter only asked for scientific, concrete evidence of PDMYB... because she's concerned about the effects after consumption... By bringing out your example of <strong>"There's no scientific proof that a higher being exists, but that doesn't stop billions across the globe from going to churches, mosques, temples &amp; synagogues."</strong> You led me (or others) to believe that consumption of PDMYB is akined to religious faith.. Scientific proof is secondary regardless of its existence...<br><br>It sounds like a genuine concern to me, but your response seems far from convincing.. More like deceit IMO... Are you one of the shareholders?? Oops.. you did mentioned that the evidence is not available to you... Then how did you know about the existence of one?? Because someone told you, who in turn heard from others etc?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Perhaps it'll help to alleviate the doubts of people here by saying that you'll help to look for more details, rather than providing excuses of shareholders, religions and governments...<br><br>I'm not here to judge the integrity of shareholders &amp; governments.

Thank god the thread starter started asking!<br><br>As for my earlier post... I'm sure majority of the forumers believe that I'm in "support" of your post by quoting your example to my fallicious reference of vice in the company...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>NTI thread is indeed entertaining! Forgo the fair, matured and educated manner of discussions.. It's not the trait of that thread! Just look at the way supporters there are responding..
