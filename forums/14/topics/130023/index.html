            <div class='col-md body'>..isnt about moral, ethics, courage and pushing your own ideas into people throats...<br><br>i am quite peeved, when i see two things<br><br>"come out talk lar'<br><br>'if you brave enuff, sue the coy'<br><br>'only cowardly people post here'<br><br>and<br><br>'MLM is the second or thrid wave marketing, you MUST embrace it' and afterwards call people who dont embrace it as foolish..<br><br>The whole business is to market your ideas and products to people, not taking it as a must and push it down people throats, some went so far as do hard sell and coercions. The company cannot grow because they lose support of the customers and prospects, and they blame it onto others. As the public grew more disenchanted with such scams and pressure selling, they make note of it. But again, instead of repairing their public image, totally clueless agents threatened defamations suit, which never appear, on the public.<br><br>In the end, you lose your potential income. You forgot, you need to win your customers over, not forcing them to accept. If they dont support you, goodbye to your second or third wave marketing.<br><br>Thats all i got to say.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mlm seems to have missed on the vital aspect pertaining to product branding.<br>creatin cust loyalty? yes.<br>but brand awareness n image? still leaves much to be desired. perhaps companies could work more on creating a loose impression of their product...akin to the likes of coke and bread talk?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Btw, this topics isnt meant to set an anti MLM or pro MLM tone.<br><br>For this period of time, i am sitting on the fence, mainly because cutting off a business marketing strategy cut the bit off the entrepenurial drive off Singaporeans, in terms of risk. notwithstanding the many misconceptions i see in this forum abt MLM. To many here, its seems quite easy. The misconception MLM = scam or low potential business = must ban aint gonna get you anywhere. Please do read the Parliamentary proceedings and many other public documents on why they unban MLM in the first place. As for saying its too low a potential mainly emphasise the low level of risk taking and entrepenurial drive Singaporeans are willing to bear.<br><br>I am more for two things, the increasing regulation of the MLM industry, and the awareness of MLM not only to customers and prospects, but current NMers. Hence the topic here....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say MLM is actually a gd marketing strategy, its juz dat sporeans seems to be using the wrong way!<br>- They do hard selling wen ppl dun wan.<br>- They play mind games to make ppl join even wen the person dun wan it.<br>- Becoz of $$$, they juz grab all their friends to join, they shd find out who<br>actually needs the product!<br><br>I feel the correct way is:<br>- sell to someone that needs the product/service, not hard selling to someone<br>dat doesnt need!<br>- if the product works, ppl ard the person will be interested in the big change in him/her &amp; try the product too! This way, u get urself a group<br>of happy networkers.<br><br>At the end of the day, i feel MLM products r actually quite gd, its juz the way they sell it. So nxt time if u hv friends dat wana intro u someting, tell them u r ok wif MLM, let them share wif u, its no use running from them, if the products is not of ur interests dan run! hahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But if the product is of ur interest, no harm listening to it, who knows it might solve all ur problems! At the same time.... guide them the rite way, if they cont, they will ended up wif no friends! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Second trend i noted is this, using the points provided by the forumer above me<br><br>When some companies  having unethical or illegal practice are often challenged on these few points<br><br>a) lack of products/lack of focus on product selling<br>b) hard pressure selling<br>c) unethical refunds policy<br>d) a backstabbing, nasty culture<br>etc etc<br><br>there were few rebuttal on these few points<br><br>instead, people who want to defend their company choose to do so by<br><br>a) flaming the person who brought forward their points<br>b) choose to talk about why people must get rich when the issue is on the unethical behaviour of the management<br>c) fight on issues on other grounds<br><br>for eg. i bring points against your coy, you choose to ask why i like to backstab your company, that i must come out one to one debate so on and so forth<br><br>people, who thought they know all abt biz, forget that the marketing ground isnt fought solely on grounds of personal courage, bravery, brute force<br><br>coincidentally, these are pretty attractive stuff a lot of scams masterminds like imbue in their poor victims<br><br>kinda remind me of the Coliseum games the Roman Emperor organised to divert the people mind away from their poor economic condition... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
