            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Experienced:</div><div class="quote_body">Amway,<br><br>They are the No. 1 for 3 things:-<br><br>a) The big brother of MLM and long history from U.S.  Used to be NO. 1 in Malaysia too but taken over by Malaysian Company now.<br><br>b) They have the lowest commissions payout in relations to their products price and sales.<br><br>c) They are No. 1 in training. The term BRAIN-WASHING in MLM originated by this Company.<br><br>You may ask me, if they pay the lowest commissions, how could they are still so successful ?<br>The answers:<br>Because their training and brain-washing is strong, so strong that people in Amway will not leave even if they don't make money; and they are good in looking for new bloods and young people who do not have much exposure to MLM.<br>In fact, I don't consider them as successful if you look at the range of products they have, meaning their sales volume per product is relatively small.<br>In Malaysia, Amway is so difficult to do that they are thought to switch to a "pyramid" method and will not reveal to a prospect that it is Amway.<br>In Singapore, people are more intelligent and many MLM Companies start together, so I think Amway will not be as successful here as compared to other countries which they started when there is less competitors.<br>My advice is don't join Amway unless you want to learn something from them and take it as a stepping stone, but beware, don't be brainwashed and start telling all your friends you will never leave Amway and that they are the best. This is how they teach you inside. I have seen many people said that and eventually find themselves very shameful to join other Companies and ruin their own future in MLM. </div></blockquote>Please don't be certain that Amway will not be successful. I do not think you are in any position to make this judgement cos all 80 countries have already proven to be successful.<br>Do you mean all the 80 countries distributors are stupid and got no brains?<br>Let me share with you, all business including Amway will need time to be successful. Just only one and the half year in Singapore and you can make this statement, I think it is a bit too early to tell. Even new business venture need al least two to three years to see some good results.<br>If Amway is easy to get rich so easily then all of us will jump striaght in. Success depends mainly on you, Amway only provide you with the environment and products to help you.<br>Amway will not force you to buy a single thing if you do not want to.<br>Understand, the different with other MLM.</div>
