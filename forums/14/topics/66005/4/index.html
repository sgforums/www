This means that you can let your children who are just starting to learn to use as there will not be any effect on the person. Because they have ISAS certification and this means that our aloe vera contents are more than 80%. Plus if you have any cuts or burns, it can be acted as a first aid thing. If you always have gum bleeding, its also very good. It can cure and after using it for a while, your gums will become healthy.

            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time, multi-level marketing was a legitimate business which provided a way for small companies to get their unique products to consumers in small towns and rural areas which had no access to these products. At this time, the products sold themselves, and the multi-level aspect was a way of giving a small reward to those who had worked hard to build the organization. But the focus was always on the product.<br><br>Today, and especially with the growth of the internet, it is possible for consumer to get about whatever they want at competitive prices. There is simply no real need for distribution Â“systemsÂ” as there once was, and indeed the focus of all the programs is not on the products they sell -- which are usually either bogus or are available somewhere else to the public at the same or lesser prices. Instead, the focus now is solely on recruiting new people to either buy into the program or else to buy products that are grossly overpriced (i.e., a $1 bottle of Â“herbal shampooÂ” for $26), with the idea that those people will recruit additional people who will also buy into the program or themselves buy the grossly overpriced products.<br><br>Thus, today just about ALL of the multi-level marketing programs are scams. In todayÂ’s internet economy, there is simply no need for multi-level marketing or the overpriced products that they sell -- meaning that the only thing they are selling are memberships in anticipation that future memberships will be sold in the future, which is the classic definition of a pyramid scheme, and thus a fraud.<br><br>The poster boy for all MLM 's companies is Amway, the oldest MLM which was founded in 1956. The Amway website claims that it has annual sales of US$6.2bn sold through some 4m distributors (meaning each distributor had average sales of US$1000 annually).<br><br>Four years after Amway, Sam Walton founded Wal-Mart, a conventional retailer, in 1960. Walmart reported sales of US$256bn (41 times larger than Amway), employed some 1.3m people and profits of around US$8bn. Wal-Mart is the LARGEST company in the world in terms of sales, larger than BP, Shell, Texaco and almost 10 times the size of Microsoft.<br><br>The battle for MLM has been lost where it matters most-in the marketplace.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, there.<br><br>Thks for ur feedback. I think what Chi HongXue meant was that if u have any dental problem, eg, gums bleeding/gingivitis,bad bread,the ALOE VERA toothpaste can help to improve these conditions in a certain degree. I personally use the toothpaste and was amazed by the toothpaste. It also whitens my teeth. Well actually i jsut keep using it for abt 1month/more..then accidentally saw my teeth becoming whiter....<br><br>^_^<br>fang</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Recently I attended a talk at a building opposite the Four Seasons Hotel with my friend on some successful people who became rich . I had some doubts &amp; suspicions that it would be a MLM company. My instincts proved correct as when I first entered the room, there were tons of products.<br><br>The MC started to address everyone &amp; she started to show us some videos of successful people and all these people have one thing in common and they followed a formula that worked for them.<br><br>About 30 mins into the presentation, she started to come to the main agenda and that it was to introduce Amway &amp; I immediately felt uncomfortable &amp; almost wanted to leave but my friend seemed to be hooked into the idea of making it rich.<br><br>Then came the testimonials of their top performers &amp; the way they spoke really sounded atrociously bad. Eventually, a video of the leader of the company was shown &amp; there was a lot of hypocrisy going on...it showed him &amp; his wife stepping inside a helicopter &amp; it showed their numerous bungalows &amp; tons of luxury cars...He said his company is a representative of Amway &amp; they represent Amway products...then everyone applauded...<br><br>I felt I was in a cult group coz the feeling is like everyone is possessed by the ideas of making it big in this industry....lucky my friend saw I was visibly uncomfortable &amp; suggested we leave....I never turned my back even though the staff there tried to ask us to stay on....<br><br>I managed to see tons of promotional materials by the company, just before we made out exit. After leaving that place, I asked my friend...why he brought me to the meeting...he said his ex boss ask him go...he said no harm listening to a talk...I told him once you allow them to psycho you into believing them, then you will be sunk deeper into the pitfalls of MLM...which is only the top people on top of the hierarchy will get rich, leaving only the bottom people with little....</div>
