            <div class='col-md body'>guys,<br><br>I am new here, just would like to share something.<br><br>I don't think Amway's marketing plan is giving low bonuses. Try study the FAA scheme &amp; latest SIP (Sales Incentive Program).<br><br>If I am not mistaken, until 2003 Amway still No#1 in Malaysia, with the annual sales of RM422million.<br>I heard that Elken claims they are better than Amway, but they are better than Amway for 1 month only. They manage to make a monthly sales of RM40million, so they multiple it by 12 months, means it should be RM480million.<br>So they claim that they are the best.<br><br>According to DSAM, Mr Paul Yee from Amway still the president of DSAM.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The business model of MLM cannot be sustained in the long run.<br><br>In MLM there is no limit to distibutorship whereas in real world there is this thing called supply and demand.Imagine this scenario, MLM depend on people buying their product (which is priced higher than normal), the business model of MLM is flawed in today age of technology the product can be marketed in more efficient way than the MLM Model.Why should i buy a more expensive toothpaste when Darlie can do the same job at much lower price.<br><br>The idea is not to sell the products but distributorship. It is product based pyramid scheme. The model is not sustained mathematically. For a distibutor for example, he has to get 50 people under him, and the next level is 50x50(2500) and the next level is 2500x50(125000) and the next level is 12500 x50 is 6,25 Million people that more that the population of Singapore. The Pyramid is only 5 level and it alreay exceed the population of Singapore. Get the picture!! The ones at the bottom have to work their a**** off just to make ends meet. The idea that it is not full time job is all hogwash,You need to spend lots lots of time in attending meeting, product trainings etc (all which you have to pay-$$$$ ) and books and tapes etc etc.<br><br>They are selling you false dream and hope to be free from debts, worry etc. There is a saying if it is too good to be true it probably is&gt;??<br><br>My three cents worth</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by dl2734:<br>Why should i buy a more expensive toothpaste when Darlie can do the same job at much lower price.</blockquote>correct!! but unfortunately most of the MLM products are patented by the respective companies.<br>most of the cheap toothpaste in this market can cause damage to our enamel.<br><br>But sugar free toothpaste from MLM companies does not damage our enamel layer.<br>Example LS-928 formula from Amway, latest Sylodent formula from Amway, and also ap-24 from NuSkin. All these are good formula toothpaste BUT it was patented by Amway &amp; NuSkin.<br><br>In the market, of course there are sugar-free toothpaste, such as Oral-B. But if you compare Oral B with MLM toothpaste, I believe that you will see a huge differences.<br><br>One more thing to consider, the environmental friendly issue.<br>Although maybe some outside brand can do the same thing, but are they environmental friendly?<br>What will happen if their detergent went into the river &amp; sea?<br>Most of MLM products emphasise on environmental friendly, it is safe for the consumer and also the environment.<br>Example bottles, usually we buy toothpaste or any hosehold cleaners are in bottle. So after we finish using those products, especially those plastic bottles, how we dispose it? Plastic bottle if we try burn to it, it will become a plastic lump that will stay on earth forever.<br>Bottles from some MLM companies, if you burn it, it will become white ash and dilute in water.</div>
