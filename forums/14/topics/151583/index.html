            <div class='col-md body'>if you are in the marketing profession, you can always tell when somebody is about to make a sales pitch. You then have to adjust your 'mental guard' and just remember the golden rule - don't sign any papers, part with money or get into any agreement to try anything for free. That goes for anyone from relatives, friends and strangers to your favourite doctor specialist, hairstylist or  provision shop aunties...who suddenly becomes overtly concern with your well-being and  life, wanting to help you out or share an excellent secret opportunity to get you out of all kinds of misery.<br><br>There are many sales tactics/strategies being used and they vary with different industries, cultures or countries and besides verbal communications, there are also other non-verbal cues you could watch out for.  Marketing, especailly with sales, A&amp;P, PR  and the likes are multi-disciplinary and borrow many concepts from psychology, sociology, science, technology and so on. For those in MLM may recruit hundreds and thousands of people to join, but they have forgotten one thing and that is different individuals have different personalities and attitudes and these affect their selling approaches. Selling is an art form that takes years to hone and professional sales people think strategically and not everybody can do sales and be adept in it overnight.<br><br>There is rarely something as a free lunch or quick buck. If you discovered a gem, someone else would probably have done so 10 years ago. There is no magic formula but serious hard work and what you believe in. Shot gun pressure selling from people you know and those that border on emotional blackmail or often quoted stories and phrases are something nobody wishes to encounter. So, it requires some tact when dealing with them.<br><br>In any business dealings, the foremost goal is to make $$$. Singaporeans are actually following the US capitalistic style of business and relationships. Some come in good faith and others misguided but it will not do any good for each to convert the other. Direct marketing, personal or multi stage selling like MLM is not something wrong or bad in its form, but those that take it up must practice ethical judgements and pursue it with professionalism, not half hearted attempts or harbour unrealistic expectations.  To some, it is a temporary escape from routine, to others they have grand ambitions. So, there is no blanket answer as to whether MLM is right/wrong, respectable or despicable. It is probably a style of marketing one is not comfortable with as it involves money, the sales process of offer, acceptance and fair benefits with people we know. But afterall, doing MLM is one's preference.<br><br>At times, you may make an exception to just help out another who tries very hard to sell you something, not that you support those money grubbing corporates or the flashy products, but as a form of encouragement to those close to you who put in effort and tries very hard to make something out of their life.  As we know, who doent have to struggle with financial issues given the high living standards and growing rich poor divide here? There will be greater  tensions between the haves and have nots. The future economic landscape will be one of ups/downs and never again like those that promises you stability or an entitlement to something. This generation will be one filled with disequality and there will be more social problems that rear its ugly head in various issues and ways. We would also become more self-centred. If you limit another's ability to do MLM, you are also taking away your own chances to do something else in life. Just the same if we spit and complain of low standards by service staffs all the time without realizing that our discrimination makes us even more narrow minded, critical and insecure individuals?<br><br>Take it as a recipocation of future favours but draw the line when it gets too aggressive or someone promising you the moon and getting 10K/month income. These are just the works of those evangelists to get newbies all psyched up with images of posh cars,  big houses, family gatherings with a dog by the swimming pool and lots of cash to spare etc. While these are exaggerated visions and short term approaches, do not shatter someone else's ambition or impose on them what they should follow.  Everybody sells things in small and big ways; be it tangible or intangible, to make a living and they may be selling you something insignificant just to buy their own dreams where likewise you are also selling some things to others just to buy your own. There aer risks inherent in every businesses and whichever directions one takes. Good for those who succeed but for those whose efforts do not materialize, take it as just another learning step in life's path, and hopefully move on thereafter. So, it is more important how you deal with the people, not the MLM nor of the products they offer.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by scarletfever:<br>[b]print out this list, take a pen, and tick the phrases as he rattle off his recruitment phrases trying to convince you to join.<br><br>anything phrase he says which is not found in the list, pls note it down, put them in this forum, and i shall add them to my list.  thank you.<br><br>_________________________________________________________<br><br>[size=small]1)new wave of marketing<br>2)difference between pyramid selling and Network marketing<br>3)Robert Kiyosaki's rich dad poor dad, Donald Trump<br></div>
