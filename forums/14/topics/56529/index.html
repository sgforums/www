            <div class='col-md body'>DW group looks like an MLM company to me, selling health mattress. I have been to their interview before and it's the longest interview i've ever went. It took me about 2.5 hrs to finish the whole interview.<br><br>First, they brought me around the whole office, introducing me to everyone. After that, they showed me photos of their wonderful colleagues having a good time at outings, dinner or sentosa or overseas trips, etc.<br>Then, they showed me a file and explained to me hell lot of stuffs on health problems like heart attack, kidney failures etc. And it all boils down to one main cause of the illnesses, which is poor blood circulation. And so, they will introduced this magnectic kind of mattress, which claims to improve blood circulation and to 'cure' illnesses.<br><br>And finally, you will have a main interview with the manager. The manager will be telling you that this job can train you to be good in sales, recruitment and management. Which means, you starts off as sales, learn how to do recruiting, and finally, when you get to promote, you will learn to manage your own team members. Sounds like MLM?<br><br>And if you are really interested, they will send you for a 2 days course on sales presentation, product knowledge, etc.<br><br>One good thing though, i can see that all of them are very young, mostly in their 20s, most of them are good in sales, often get promoted easily and they have this special bond between them. They seems to get along really well and enjoy lots of outings while working too.<br>So, is this the job for you?<br><br>p/s: I didn't join the company in the end, cause i really hate sales.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
