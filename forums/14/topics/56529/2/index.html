            <div class='col-md body'>Let me say a few things with some rationale here.<br><br>MLM is a FORM of DIRECT MARKETING, a form of distribution of PRODUCTS used for many years.  The form of MLM comes in the last 3 decades or so.  MLM is NOT a new idea and not an innovation that comes out recently.<br><br>Thus, like any form of distribution of products, be it franchising, MLM or by agency, it is perfectly ok if the company thinks that that is the best way to distribute its products and to maximise its potential.  Thus I would have nothing against DW or NUSKIN or AMWAY or whoever if they decide that MLM is the way to go.  MLM is neither superior nor inferior, it is just a matter of suitability.<br><br>However, let me point out a few things and let you all ponder over it.<br><br>1)  In MLM, its very common to hear that "anyone can be your customer" sort of statements. This means that all 4 million people in Singapore could and would buy your product if only you know how to do it.  Unfortunately, such IDEAL situations just do not exist in the REAL BUSINESS WORLD.  There is NEVER a single market where everyone is a potential customer.  A company who targets everyone as a customer is doom to fail because you cant be all things to all men.  Even WALMART believes that it cant possibly make everyone in USA buy from WALMART just because it is big and found almost everywhere in USA.  Different people has different needs.<br><br>Thus for people in MLM, consider this, if saying that there are 'X' number of people in Singapore who might be interested to buy your, say, MAGNETIC MATRESSES, at  $1000 per piece for the benefits it claimed to give.  Then we must accept that there are definitely 'Y' number of people who will not simply pay $1000 for this product or who feels they have no need for such product or have found a substitute for this product.  So no matter what 'X' is, if you are in MLM, you have to make a smart estimate how many customers 'X' represents. 'X' cannot simply means EVERYONE.<br><br>2)  Once you know what 'X' is, you have a rough guide of your market size.  Now this is the crux. You see, you can have 50% of the market share but that does not mean 50% of the population, thus 50% of market share could mean just 100, 000, could be more, could be less.  Let us just take that in a 4 million population, 5% of Singaporeans are willing to pay $1000 for a MAGNETIC MATRESS.<br><br>Now, consider this, do MLMs limit the number of distributors it can have?  NO.  So imagine, if I just recruit 5, then the 5 recuits 5 each who in turn recruits 5 each, I would have 755 people as my downline!!!  This is certainly not a far fetched number because this is exactly what the MULTI LEVEL MARKETING structure is about.  THEN, imagine, there is just 5 people like me: meaning there will be a total of 3775 distributors in SINGAPORE.<br><br>This is what we call in business, OVER SUPPLY, meaning that the market is only so big but yet there are so many supplies, some suppliers are bound to die.  Thus by having so many distributors, who do you think benefit most?  Its not the majority, its the company itself; the people who own the brand and also the higher uplines.  THis means ultimately, most people in MLM is doomed to fail all because of the structure alone.<br><br>EVEN a mega brand like UNILEVER has only 7 sales executives going around Singapore to serve their even bigger base of customers (cos I am one of them).  So how many of the people in MLM will succeed? Some will but not most.<br><br>**** I still have many points to write but I am tired.....this is not to burst your bubble. MLM is a perfectly legal structure.  HOwever, the serious flaw in it is that the more levels you have, the more distributors you have in a market, the more failures you will have in this business.  MLM is a sales job, just like many other jobs.  In a sales job, we should aim to give customers an EXPERIENCE which they enjoy with our service, honesty and efforts to solve their problems.  Having nicely printed brochures and catalogs about your factories in some obscure places do not do that.  I was and I still in a way still am in a sales related job. MLM can bring success just like any other sales job. But if you think that MLM is the next KILLER APPS, then I would love to burst your bubble and tell you<br><br>"just try your best with all honesty, ethics and effort but do not be too muddle headed and foolish and not know when to stop trying and focus on other things instead."<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">MTI Enhances Safeguards on MLM Schemes Operating in Singapore </span></span></strong><br><br>The Ministry of Trade and Industry has enhanced the safeguards on MLM schemes operating in Singapore, with the aim of protecting Singaporean consumers. The revised Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (MLM) (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order (MLM Exclusion Order for short) will take effect from 01 January 2002.<br><br>The Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) and Pyramid Selling (MLM) (Prohibition) Act (the MLM Act for short) was enacted in 1973 to protect consumers against harmful pyramid schemes. An illegal pyramid scheme will typically require participants to pay hefty upfront charges. In turn, the participants are promised attractive financial rewards for each additional participant recruited, as well as for all new participants brought in by their recruitees. As more salespersons are recruited, participants hope to recover their upfront charges and earn sizeable profits. Consequently, such pyramid-like structures will eventually run out of new recruits and collapse, resulting in those salespersons at the bottom of the pyramid losing all their upfront charges. Illegitimate MLM schemes usually share the following characteristics:<br><br>Promoters hype about how easy it is to earn money, that people can get very rich in a very short time and that the way to earn money is by recruiting others to join the scheme;<br><br>The commodity in question is not something one would normally buy at its price;<br><br>Participants are required to invest money into the scheme, whether in the form of a joining fee or buying inventory.<br><br>Not all multi-level marketing schemes are harmful and outlawed. The MLM Act empowers the Minister of Trade and Industry to exclude certain schemes and arrangements under the MLM Exclusion Order 2000. Insurance, franchise and direct selling schemes, which fulfil certain criteria, are exempted from the MLM Act. However, as a result of developments in the market and suggestions from the public, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in consultation with the industry, and taking into consideration the public's comments, has come up with a revised MLM Exclusion Order, the main amendments of which are:<br><br>Safeguards - A participant cannot be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to become a participant in the scheme, other than the purchase of demonstration equipment which are not for resale, at no more than cost price and for which no commission can be given out. A legitimate multi-level marketing scheme would not impose a financial risk on salespersons. For example, salespersons should be entitled to full refunds, under reasonable commercial terms, for any inventories kept or purchased by them which are not sold to end consumers, so long as the inventories are returned within a period of 60 days.<br><br>Behavioural checks - The companies must not misrepresent the scheme as get-rich-quick opportunities, and should not use fraud, coercion, harassment, or unconscionable means to force people to join the scheme. Instead, the companies should focus their efforts on promoting the quality and features of the products. If a company wishes to show potential participants the earning potential, they must keep records of the maximum, minimum, mean, mode and median earnings of their salespeople in the past.<br><br>Sharing of commission - It is all right for a salesperson to share commissions from several layers of salespersons recruited by him. However, such commissions must be generated by sale of the product or service in question, and not through the recruitment of additional participants into the scheme.<br><br>Any person who promotes or participates in an illegal MLM scheme or arrangement is liable, on conviction by a court, to a maximum fine of $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or to both. In addition, the Act empowers the court to impose an additional penalty of an amount not exceeding the amount or value of any benefit which the promoter or participant has received.<br><br>The amendments to the Exclusion Order will be published on 14 December 2001. There will be a grace period for companies to review their current rules and regulations and to inform their promoters about the change. The new legislation will come into effect on 01 January 2002.<br><br>The full text of the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Excluded Schemes and Arrangements) Order can be accessed at the MTI website, www.mti.gov.sg from 14 December 2001. Hard copies may be purchased on line at www.myepb.com/script/legalpub.asp or any MyEPB book stores.<br><br>While the Government can help by amending laws and enforcing against fraudulent activities, the consumer's best defense is to stay vigilant and not fall prey to fraudulent, 'get-rich-quick' schemes. When investing, consumers should always look not only at the profit opportunities but also at the risks of losses involved.<br><strong><br><br>Ministry of Trade and Industry<br>13 December 2001</strong><br><br></div>
