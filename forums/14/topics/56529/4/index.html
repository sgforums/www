Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies. Jus take a look at the newspaper for the past one month, alot of articles is focusing on NETWORK MARKETING, and they also teaches us how to prevent from bad companies. if u wan to know, read the straits times forum on MLM and chinese lianhezhaobao on last sunday 18/01/04.<br><br>Most imptly, its not the money that counts. Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Halo... My side think, not when a issue happen on an individual and we condemn all.<br><strong>We are not judge! Don't give our unfair judgement to them!</strong> It's not to condemn or talking behind their back, i suggest. Why be so nasty? I just reading and don't feel it's right to comment these ways. Jus let the case cool off, and see how is the outcome, rather discussing or dragging far out.</div>

If everybody start to comment, this issue will have non stop. I think Yi Zhen and Joey are now having enough problems. Jus let this cool off first. We can discuss some good side to motivate them rather keep on rubbing salt into the wound. I suggest.</div>
