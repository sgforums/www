            <div class='col-md body'>Hi PaYitForward,<br><br>Just 3 points will cast doubts on the future speed of growth on the horizon for this company....<br><br>1) Does the company own their own manufacturing facility as well as own the R&amp;D facility?<br>Without this ownership and control of this two areas, the future is shaky.<br><br>--- Also being listed in the SES is no-big deal. Now the company has to answer and deliver earnings per share to shareholders, and not necessarily to the best interest to its direct-selling agents.<br><br>3)You mentioned that this company has been doing direct sales for past 12 years. How come their market is only around Singapore Malaysia and few Asian cities. How come they have not expanded to large consumer markets especially the US and  Canada?<br>This clearly shows that the product and services from this company will be limited to the relative small market size around Asian cities... not the larger giant markets which will see larger residual incomes and faster growth of new markets.<br>Why? because this company does not have any unique competitive or technological edge in US or Canadian markets where there are hundreds of other stronger competitors selling the same stuff there.<br>Sorry if this hurts.... but its reality and common sense in marketing... glitzy hyped up presentations and promises doesnt impress me.<br>I doubt if this company can attract high-calibre , high growth oriented people to join, given their slow-growth track record for the past 12 years. It will still see people joining them but doe'nt appear to an exciting and fast growth business to be in.<br><br>My advice to you is ... dont defend or be loyal to a company just because a friend asked you to join or because you did join for wahtever the reason. If you detect that as a business vehicle, is this the right one that match your expectations and strengths? Can you get faster results with another vehicle?
