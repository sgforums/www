              <p>i beg to differ.</p>
              <p>coz i personally know of a fren who is my poly friend and is in a mlm company constantly earning at least 3digits per month, if sales good, go up to 4 digits. that friend of mine is currently paying supporting herself with what she earns from that company.</p>
              <p>and that company is super established from USA, so don't tell me only the early birds/insiders can make a lot. it's all about hardwork, stop pushing the blame and finger pointing.</p>
              <p>she is just earning from local market.</p>

              <p>Well, first of all, I would said that venture era is by far the best MLM company, and what they are actually promoting seens more realistic and effective. Plus the_fallen is true, some people do face their hard times in the MLM, and nothing comes easy into our hands, so being in the MLM is something that seen to be alot to answer.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I have been reading some of the topics in this forum and it is interesting that some of the frenz here dont really understand what is the diff btwn MLM and Pyramid scheme.</p>
              <p>If you insist MLM is Pyramid because there is always 1 leader only, then with many followers with them which form a big triangle pyramid layout, then you can say a country is a pyramid scheme too. Why? Because one country has only 1 president/ King/ PM, then the rest are their followers, which will become a Pyramid layout too.</p>
              <p>Do note that Pyramid is something that the upline (The guy above you in the group) always earning more than the rest of the guys below him. For instance, Level 1 earn $10k, second level$6k,3rd level $3k, then the rest maybe only 1-2k, or nothing. Then you need to be aware of this because the money earned is not equal to the hardwork put in.</p>
              <p>Secondly, Pyramid scheme usually do not have product. Or the product is something that is sold in very over-over-over priced price, and only sold once. Or simply you can earn money by just sell the idea to some of your frenz, WITHOUT any products.</p>
              <p>And, there is no right &amp; wrong for doing any MLM because it is just a different type of business. It's the same that we are not at any position to judge anyone who want to open a coffee shop because we will never know the outcome.</p>
              <p>So, for those who wanted to do MLM and treat MLM as their ultimate business to realise their dreams, please choose wisely as there are many Pyramid scheme that is so confusing that you might mistakenly thought that it is a great business(MLM).</p>

              <p>for those who say mlm = pyramid. pyramid must go jail 1 leh. i doing mlm how come i not in jail. if want to say anything pls have something to back up. or else end up disgracing urself only. might as well dun say.</p>
              <p>also just to add on to my previous post. why ve is bullshit. u might want to find out how ve advertise to ppl. and also what products they selling. indeed some products are good. but how many are copied from other companies? around 10+ years of history. the boss from another networking company come set up another networking company. pull how many ppl to the company. almost make the previous one bankrupt. then dun even have DSAS cert. still want say best company. this isnt a place to advertise ur company hor. so many underaged ppl working there still want say best company. water system so many chemicals. magnetic bed still same as 10 years ago. air purifier copy from ppl. want buy anything also can find better one elsewhere.</p>
              <p>whatever it is do find a company that is trustworthy and dunnid u to invest. product also must improve since 10 years ago. and the techniques used are not some con ppl technique. must based on facts. amway is really a good company. but too bad no more potential.</p>

              <p>Obviously you're not watching news, reading newspapers or doing business..even if the business is bad..business owners don't say negative remarks on their competitors at any one time...but if you insist you want to say remarks about other companies by all means..continue at your own expense..</p>

              <p>PS: Stick to the thread topic, will you?</p>
              <p>your input shows nothing except for the fact that you're trying to display your intelligence/wisdom only..</p>
              <p>PLUS: get your facts right first..Singaporeans are not skeptical of Amway and a few other reputable companies..the fact is that most of us are already in contact or know of people who are in that company and have preferred friends to make the purchase..</p>
              <p>So when you say people are skpetical of Amway..i think you said it purely because you faced rejections when trying to sell/recruit people into this company without knowing the fact that most Singaporeans already have pre-existing connections with this company in one-way or another thus they will not be even interested in wanting to know more unless they/their friends/parents know nothing about mlm at all la..</p>
              <p>if you are unsure of the information, don't post it..else it will cast a negative impression on yourself.</p>

              <p>companies like LFI and whatever crap won't be around in a few years ! companies selling one-time-off products are in for the quick buck, that's all !</p>
              <p>only companies selling items that have recurring sales like healthfood, cosmetics etc can survive for the long haul. plus local companies or those from Hong Kong or Malaysia can't be compared to American ones.</p>
              <p>didn't i hear people here complain about LFI increasing their prices a couple times already with some packages actually doubling in price ?</p>
              <p>it's a sure sign of impending trouble ! with more and more people getting paid upstream, either you need more people buying downstream or you increase the prices, simple math !</p>
