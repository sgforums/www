              <p>1)if you say that mlm is for losers, you must be quite a winner yourself la, and if you are a winner, i bet you earn about $10k-$20k per month...right?</p>

              <p>i've seen separate bunch of friends get ruined by MLMs..</p>
              <p>all different ones too..</p>
              <p>despite all the advice other friends tried giving them..</p>
              <p>heck! i got dragged to a few of their "presentations"</p>
              <p>the math the MLM companies tried to show people didn't work out at all.. when i showed them why the math was wrong, i was suddenly isolated then shown the door away from the other patsies..</p>
              <p>now.. why would MLM work in Singapore? when there is almost no levels from the source to the consumer at all?</p>
              <p>if you still want to, go ahead.. it's a free country..</p>

              <p>Wow why so defensive? I dun dare to say I'm brilliant but my brain is definitely bigger than mlmers. Threads like this, most probably started by mlmers to mislead people into singing praises for mlm companies. Let me teach u smthg, y dun u cre8 a clone for urself and start posting positives about the mlm company u r going to talk about?  There, I'm being constructive.</p>

              <p>Like all industries, there are good and bad companies.  Think it will be unfair to brand the whole industry as bad if there are a few bad companies.</p>
              <p>Arthur Andersen is from the auditing industry but we cannot say that the whole audit industry is bad because of one company.</p>
              <p>Enron is the energy company and yet we cannot say that the energy industry is bad because of one company.</p>
              <p>Lehman Brothers is with the banking and think you will know what I want to say.</p>
              <p>My take is to join a MLM company, it is to see if you will still use the products when you take out the compensation plan.  If you will not take the products when you take out the compensation plan then don't join.</p>
              <p>The other are just like what most MLM people will tell you:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>How old is the company?</li>
              <li>Does the company manufacture their own products?</li>
              <li>Do they have a system in place where you don't need any superstar?</li>
              <li>Are there success stories that you can see and learn from?</li>
              <li>Is it for all generations, be it an 18 year old boy or even a 60 year old man?</li>
              <li>Are the products consumable and something that can address a problem?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>These are some things that I believe will constitute a good company.</p>

              <p>Wow why so defensive? I dun dare to say I'm brilliant but my brain is definitely bigger than mlmers. Threads like this, most probably started by mlmers to mislead people into singing praises for mlm companies. Let me teach u smthg, y dun u cre8 a clone for urself and start posting positives about the mlm company u r going to talk about?  There, I'm being constructive.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>well its very simple..  a good MLM company will have products which u will be able to sell even without recruiting people, although recruiting ppl is actually still a part of MLM. If you feel that a particular company has products which are really good and that you feel you will be able to sell them easily without having to recruit them as your partners, then its probably a good company. but still take note, finding more buisness partners is still a must in any mlm company</p></div>

              <p>successful mlm agents/distributors mostly will not hang around this gossip based forum unless they have ulterior intentions which is so obvious..</p>
              <p>as for being new in mlm, i will not encourage distributors to come in here as here is the land of skeptics..</p>
              <p>being a newibie = hotblood super enthu which results in making wrong decisions without thinking - that's what i view as newbie's potentials</p>
              <p>great opening for various companies to earn a quick buck from ignorant, smart-alex agents. . jumping from company to companies.</p>
              <p>those mlm seniors or regulars users will take this place as a updating place (but i think they left after being being proved to be skeptics in my own thread and didn't really update here as much as compared to before I posted that thread)</p>

              <p>perhaps it may be the main concen for choosing a business but there are so many people who forget and overlook the basic fundamentals.</p>
              <p>anybody can copy an system just by buying the franchise and apply it.</p>
              <p>but do each of you, every single one of the people who join network marketing companies really know how to do business, how to maximize the system to your advantage, how to service the system, ensure the system don't fail you, did you recieve any instruction step by step menu to using the system?</p>
              <p>no companies teach to that in-depth into details, i learn it the hard way all by myself..there are more to it than it meets the eye.</p>
              <p>as for health, if that's what your uplines/company is teaching you, you might want to reconsider your choice. they teach only what they think is right, but it is not necessary the one and only, there are still beauty, luxury, property, enjoyment segments whereby people will spend on, why only health? brush up on understanding real business..learn more and do more homework, don't jump right into it when they whoa you with their 'knowledge' which i see lots of weakness in, thus i'm sharing what i feel after years of learning.</p>
              <p>hope it helps you guys for those who are new, don't waste your money unnecessarily.</p>
              <p>the other thing is read the words which you use. you're using mis-leading words which will ruin your reputation and making people think again if they want to do any business with you in future.</p>

              <p>well, if all you think about is working hard get downlines, you are better off going to get a job to be a salesman.</p>
              <p>as your mental thinking which is taught and passed down from whatever company you're in is recruitment per head (people) and not selling of products (sales volume).</p>
              <p>be wary, you might be already in a pyramid concept company where they focus on recruitment and not products. money is made from recruiting people and not products, thus there are countless companies doing recruitment and not products in attempt for only FAST CASH and QUICK CASH.</p>
              <p>such companies practice are dangerous. be more careful and approach with caution.</p>
