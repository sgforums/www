              <p>Topic revolves around the word "BEST". This can be subjective or objective, depending on the author's original mindset.</p>
              <p>Best at what? Sales, recruiting, product, for making profit, appeal to consumers? The thread is a perfect example of how one person starts something and it get's morphed or distorted as each person "gets involved" in the process or providing a reply to the thread.</p>
              <p>For statistical issues, visit the DSAS. For opinionated issues, this thread provides insight as to the myriad of thoughts, approaches and perceptions of the industry and its players.</p>
              <p>As for who will be around and who won't, who the players are and who are not . . . MLM is just like any other business arena . . .there are businesses that have been around for a very long time and there are NEW busines that submit for license and permit everday. Those who succeed are going to have a mutli-faceted program and approach that appeals to one's personal criteria - either as a company to work with and be involved in, or as a company that can provide them with products/services they desire or need. Remember, for any business to surive it must provide a product or service that is marketable and in demand (or demand that can be created) - and any business must be conducted above board (with integrity). </p>
              <p>In the end, we are all providers or consumers of "something". Does not matter if you buy from retailer CK Tang or your next door MLM neighbor. What is the "best" is ultimately determined by YOU, though you may be influenced by other factors!</p>

              <p><br>Hi mlmersrlosers,</p>
              <p>glad that you have your own opinion, hmmm...but i got 2 questions for you! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)if you say that mlm is for losers, you must be quite a winner yourself la, and if you are a winner, i bet you earn about $10k-$20k per month...right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)and honestly, have you ever tried being in any MLM company?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>since you are so brillant, do you care to share your success story, or are you gonna just sit there as a spectator and let the whole world pass you by? I mean i am just your avg person, just looking for a way out of the rat race and willing to try anything as long as its legal and i am able to take care of my family. so please share your idea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as the old saying goes; If you dun have anything constructive to say, dun say anything at all. it may make you look like a fool...</p>

              <p>Currently I am working in a multi-level marketing company in Singapore. I just joined the company and my leaders gave me a lot of support and guidance.</p>
              <p>Our company is called LFI, and we have a history of 4years.</p>
              <p>Currently we are the top MLM company, and the fastest growing MLM company in Singapore. We will be expanding our market to 26 different  countries in the coming October, where internet marketing will be officially launced.  It will be a huge event, where there will be over 2000 attendants at the seminar here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I hope I will be able to find friends with common interest in MLM as me, regardless of age, to join me in this journey.</p>
              <p>I am confident that if you attend the seminar in the coming October, you will be very interested in knowing more about us, LFI.</p>
              <p>If you are interested in knowing more about LFI, you may visit the following official website of the company.</p>
