Are you saying all the things that have been said in this forum are not true? And yet you prefer to accept them? C'mon guys, nothing personal. But seeking real facts and information is better than listening to gossips and rumours from non-credible sources anytime.<br><br>Cheers! Its a brand new week!</div>

Geez<br><br>Again, i have to repeat for someone's vision impairment.<br><br>These people already came up to speak their views. Its not my loss anyway, if nti agents wish to come up to state that these people are clones, or that their claims are false. Anyway, you would have already gotten their money, and since there is this big issue over your tight fisted refunds policy, so i guess these people dont matter anymore to you, dont they?<br><br>But then, did you realise one thing? Have these agents actually do help clear doubts, or are they like you, keep coming to suggest what these victims or ex agents said are gossips and rumours?<br><br></div>
