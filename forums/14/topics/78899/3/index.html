            <div class='col-md body'>that I'll have to disagree cos in traditional biz, the shareholders are oso not the ones doing the work. once the biz grows big, they can hire ppl to run the show for them issit it. that's why mlmers are always told to run their biz like real biz and not just child's play.<br><br>another thing is that the money comes from the sales of whatever products they are selling. just like normal biz. recruitment wont earn mlmers any money unless their downlines buy the products( which the downlines can choose to join but not to buy unless needed. if the downlines are told they mus buy to join, it's that particular organization that's flawed)<br><br>Moreover you reap your hard work after your organization grows big enough but occassionally u oso need to give presentations to your downlines,maybe as a speaker to a whole room on your experience. it's not that you can totally wash your hands off and wait for money to come in,cos if that the case, soon ppl will start dropping out from their organization.<br><br>correct me if I'm wrong</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a traditional business, you have to oversee all e workers to ensure smooth running of e business. moreover, you are responsible for their livelihood... the payments to creditors, the profits you rake in etc etc... all these take up alot of time and effort. should anything go wrong with e company... you are held accountable. My dad's a traditional businessman and he works very very hard.<br><br>whereas in mlm, once your downlines are able to survive on their own independent of your help, you don't have to do anything... mayb just come in once in a while to see how things are going. you just leave your downlines to do e work and e training fer you while you reap e benefits. you do not have to worry abt office rent, expanding e company, e diseconomies of scale that set in once e company expands etc.<br><br>It has also been reported in e news that in this business, only a miniscule proportion, that's abt 2 percent, of mlmers are raking in e money while e rest are not. So which means only e top gets to enjoy e benefits while those at e bottom have to slog their way through. In an orthodox business, workers find themselves getting a stable salary of at least a thousand a month (reasonably good compared to those at the bottom of the mlm ladder) as they work fer their bosses.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another problem which renders our concern is that some of these companies have an alarming number of youngsters working for them. These youngsters are guilible... and what's even worse, some of them are still schooling. Some of these people even go to e extent of playing truant so that they can come to work. If their parents knew abt it, they would be utterly disappointed. Even further, as these people are greenhorns it becomes apparent that companies are trying to take advantage of their naivety. anyone would like to comment on that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for your comments on only top 2% gets any money,i have to agree. jus like any other biz, not everyone will survive. however you have to accept that mlm is a home based biz so you dun need to pay rent and other stuff.however, that oso mean the money gain depends on how hard you work. as for kids, i think the law in s'pore is min age of 18 yrs,so that leaves only poly and grad students and they shoul mature to think for themselves. some students will still play traunt even if not in mlm cos the teritary system has alot of freedom.<br><br>maybe you can try relating mlm insurance agents.jus take insurance as an example,may not be the best but quite similar. u get only a basic pay when you start out as an agent and even have to pay to enroll in the courses beforehand. your monthly salary depends on your sale. you need to form you own team and network. when you have a team big and gd enough, you join the management level and do less of presentations but more of management work. of cos i have to say mlm is not perfect as nothing is 100% THE BEST. how? anymore comments</div>

You stated that these poly and uni students were mature enough to think for themselves. Is playing truant just to work a mature thing to do? How would their parents and teachers react to it? Adults they may be, but the childish mentality is still evident in many of them. So what if you said that even without mlm, these kids will still play truant? the fact is that mlm gives another excuse for youths not to come to school and that is wrong in itself.<br><br>i can't agree with you when you use insurance agents as examples. There are many ways in which insurance agents are different from network marketeers. For instance, insurance agents and managers alike have certain sales quotas to hit... but such quotas are not stipulated by companies doing mlm. Any manager who fails to hit the specific quota will questioned by the company and faces the prospect of being fired. Similarly, any manager who does not show up for work will be given the axe, regardless of the size of his team. This is further aggravated by the fact that in e mlm business, uplines are entitled to absorb a sizeable fraction of the sales his downlines make... in insurance e fraction is only 5% for some companies.<br><br>of course, nothing is perfect in this very flawed world. but compared to mlm, other routes seem better alternatives. At least e principle of you reap what you sow applies.</div>
