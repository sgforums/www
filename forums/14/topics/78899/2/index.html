            <div class='col-md body'>two bucks,<br><br>There are good MLM companies out there but they are not prefect. Let me put it this way, "Would you put your eggs into a basket with big holes in the basket basket?" If you simply pick one company, is taking a big risk. What you are thinking is that people join you because they have the believe you and the company is not important. Let me ask you this "If the company collapse for whatever reason, what would happen? Your intregrity? What would your members think of you? I would want anyone to bring me "Holan". That's for sure. Of course, I would agree with you, good MLM company will not guarantee success, it boils down to your willingness to do, your desire  and your teacheability. These are the 3 criterias I would look for in a member.<br><br>If one is focus on making money for himself, is truely selfish in the MLM world. One should be focus on how to help their members make the money, only then he shall be rewarded. People are not stupid. They  can feel whether one are sincere or not. The moment they notice one's true face, one will be a general without soldiers.<br><br>You are right on the bosses statement. It's not the boss responsibility to make one rich. It's us. And there is no such things as job security anymore. One need to wake up soon as possible or else get buried alive.<br><br>Everyone should be encourage to try MLM. Yes MLM is not for everyone but how would know if you have not tried yourself. Just don't simply try anyhow lah. Painful when you knock against the wall. When you are in MLM, three very important questions to ask yourselves, Have I done enough, what did I do wrong and how can I do better?<br><br>MLM is a part time business, you do not need to sacrifice you job just to do MLM. I would never encourage anyone to do that unless the time is right.  Housewife can do it full time because the husband are paying for the bills. It all depends on the situation.<br><br>two bucks,<br><br>I believe you are in the direct selling concept, I could be wrong. Most of your income comes from sales. If selling stops, you either don't making anything or make very little. You probably have not seen another kind of concept which I feel very comfortable with. As long as you are happy and comfortable, keep it up.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ben<br><br>email : benwong99@hotmail.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>twobucks,<br><br>i have not taken it personally. I have a job, a business and into MLM and I don't mix the 3 together.<br><br>I find it very good to have this sort of feedback. On a negative feedback, how can we handle it? Fight fire with fire or put water on the fire? Why is it a such? On a positive feedback, what can we learn from it? How can we be better?<br><br>I have learned some new things here, which will help me to become better and better, each day and in every way.<br><br>There are two things that could happen when one face with challenges :-<br><br>1) you be come BITTER. A sore loser? Blame heaven and earth?<br>I have met a lot people in this category and the saddest part is, they have locked themselves in a room and throw the keys away.<br><br>2) you become BETTER. Learn from it and grow to become a better person. I believe with the challenges in MLM, it will help a person to be better in many ways such as confidence, self-esteem, leadership, humbleness etc.<br><br>I know this because I have benefited a lot from MLM and have seen many real life people going through the changes.<br><br>I'm sorry if you have felt it as a threat. I do not have such intention.<br><br>I have challenge a few to say what they have to say. To me it's just like playing poker. You know what is a poker face? I put on a poker face when I play poker, so that my oponents cannot tell whether I have good or bad cards. A person who have no poker face will lose badly, that's what happen to me before. Sometimes we challenge just to find out what is the cards, even when we do not happen a very good card.<br><br>Some people thinks they know a lot but what they really know are just excuses or hear say...no facts just like putting on a "Poker Face".  There is a reason to everything, many do not have the reason for whatever they say. It's it a bit sad to see new potential MLMers taking advice from so-called people.<br><br>I used to have friends giving me opinions like that. Many have stopped giving me their baseless opinion because they have realised they have to know what they are saying. Those who got better are now my good friends regardless whether they are in business with me or not. Those who get bitter can say whatever they want, people who want to listen to them, let them be because I will not let them steal my dreams. For sure the day will come and I will not forget to remind them.<br><br>Smile always. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Ben<br></div>

If you are not productive, you can't help your stable company generate revenues, even if you've landed yourself in a fortune 500 company, you are bound to be axed pretty soon.<br><br>After being in the rat race for over a decade, I'm confident to make this statement: the only positions that seldom get retrenched, are positions of administrative clerks and security guards. Get these jobs, if you would like to draw stable income.<br><br>I'm not encouraging you to join MLM and be a networker, it's not a career for just anybody. I despise networkers who drawn you the beautiful picture and promised you quick fortune, they are black sheep of the industry. Nevertheless, every industry have black sheeps, I hope you can agree to this?<br><br>I haven't made a million as a networker yet, so far, I have been earning "unstable" retail income of S$2000 to S$2500, not fantastic but I'm glad I earned those money by and for myself. And I'll never get retrenched for sure.<br><br>Conclusion: it's not how good the MLM company; but, it's how good are you.</div></blockquote>I dun really agree with you. It is not how good you are, but are you doing it right? In MLM, we don't need sales personnel. It is not about sales. As long as the product works, effective, in the right industry, you are at a good start. The best student is the teachable ones.<br><br>May I ask how long are you doing this business?<br><br>Another point is, your sponsor.. Are you able to learn alot from your sponsor? Is your sponsor a millionare? I'm considered lucky to have a good sponsor. I'm able to learn alot from him. He is a millionare.<br><br>The concept is, if you wanna make a million, learn from someone who has already made a million. It's the same with if you are learning physics in school, you learn from a teacher who have good grades in physics before right?<br><br>Of course i don't mean that those who do not have a good sponsor have no hope of making a million. You can also exchange pointers with other colleagues.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

What I would look for is :-<br>1) Good Management - with Intregity and credibility<br>2) Financially Solid - preferably cash rich<br>3) Business and Product Support - in terms of functions and coaching<br>4) Rewarding Marketing Plan which is proven<br>5) Registered with Direct Selling Association - it's a bonus if possible,  just to be sure we are not in a Tom, Dick and Harry Business.<br>6) Company's Vision and Mission Statement<br><br>These is what I'll look for, of which I do not need to look anymore. I've found one. What I could say to anyone who is looking for a MLM company is, know what you are looking for and decide for yourself whether this is the company that will help you get what you want in life.<br><br>Not everyone have a millionaire friend or a sponsor and I hope you not implying to everyone that a sponsor who is not a millionaire is not a good sponsor. Stirring up the hornet's nest?  Many MLMers started as nobody(meaning from the bottom) in the business. By the way, we have people who are millionaires before they joined the business, should we call them good sponsors?<br><br>Well, that what I think.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ben<br><br>email : benwong99@hotmail.com<br></div>

I'm not what you mean or what's with what I have said. "Great Trouble"? Ohhh...should I be worried? The thing is a lot of people take potholes as barriers where they rather give up than to try overcoming it. Those who take barriers as potholes are successful people in any field they choose.<br><br>That is a rather basic book to read for beginners. One may read a lot of books but not applying what they have read is as good as not reading. I'm a fan of Jim Rohn. To me he is the greatest of all. He even challenged the power of positive thinking, knowing many would not agree with him. What he said is logic, something really worth pondering upon. No matter, I do not depend on books alone but also tapes and coaching. I have many friends who are successful in the business I'm in and they are fantastic leaders with passion who are willing to answer any questions I have. Different leaders with different advices will help a person to learn better and faster.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ben<br><br>email :benwong99@hotmail.com<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Company and Management background is most important, followed by products and system.<br><br>The Management must be solid, experienced and honest. This I observed from all the international Companies with long history.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I believe all of you know the concept of Network Marketing aka MLM.<br><br>I have been to too many sales talk about each and individual company. I came to a few conclusion on how to choose a good company. (my PERSONAL OPINION)<br><br>1) How long has the company exist? How is its history and culture? Any Debts? How much is the company owning? Worldwide recognised?<br><br>2) Products - variety more or less? Whether the company owns the processing and developing of the products? Any patern process? Has the products been able to speak out? Is it useful and handy that people can use easily? Is it expensive or reasonable? Is it copyright? What kind of certifications?<br><br>3) Sales volume? Business Plan - Fair or Not?<br><br>To myself, MLM is not a easy job yet its one of the job that can offer you free time, free finance. If anybody can see that you will earn big money after a few months of starting, just be wary.<br><br>Open to comments. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ben<br><br>After looking at the past comments and debate with the others, i really admire your patience and determination to convice people out there. And this is what networking industry is all about, cheers on you. However, MLM personel often are too persistence to market their products or introduce their plans or ideas to people. This kind of working procedures deter people... They must know what people want before starting their biz plan. Some people may just want to stay on with their job and earn a normal income; while others might be more adventurous.. but MLM might not be their cup of tea..<br><br>I have a friend whom i know in the uni.... we were good friends and talk a lot.. But once he join MLM, he kept on tell me about his biz.. i think he should look at what people wants...  Instead of changing people mentality, MLM personel really think of their biz strategy b4 pushing their sales or ideas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey Ben...i can see that you are different from other mlmers...you don't coerce people into buying your products...but remember... it's never about the miniority...we're talking about the majority of them.<br><br>you are in mlm right&gt;&gt; and you are not into the selling part...then what are you in??? the recruitment?? which is precisely what is so flawed in mlm.<br>it shows that mlm goes against the principle of "sowing and reaping". i believe that you reap what you sow. but mlms go against that. you can just stay at the top and claim credit for the sales your downlines have made without putting in any effort yourself. of course, you have to train up your downlines and that takes a considerable amount of effort. But in the later stages... it's when the statement "you reap what you do not sow" comes in, and i cannot agree with that.</div>
