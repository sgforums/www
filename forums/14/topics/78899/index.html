            <div class='col-md body'>Alex,<br><br>What did Amway do to you? Was it that bad? Care to share why?<br><br>Sometimes it's how you look at things. Some may say the problem is with the member when they quit despite the fact they have really tried but still no results. Well, the way I look at it, there is not a business that will suit everyone. To me, when a person  take a look on a opportunity, ask yourself three question. 1) Do I like the concept? 2) Do I like the system that will help and support me in the business? 3) If I'm not building the business, would I use the products?<br><br>If you can confident say yes, I love the concept, something good I could share with anyone I know... yes, I love the system and I know the system will grow me into a leader (not a salesman) and support without fail throughout the journey.... yes, even when I'm not building anymore, I would still use the products because I know the products are of quality and value for money.<br><br>See you at the top.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Ben<br><br>email : benwong99@hotmail.com<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MLM are just shits. Many people who are doing mlm wont quit or confess simply because of ego problem. i have a friend who wanted me to buy stuff from him, let him get his promotion, then he promised me to help me sell the stuff away. I think that's BS. (the stupid thing cost $1500)<br><br>Those who really do reading up/investigation will realise that MLM products can be obtained much much cheaper from other countries or the internet.<br><br>Congrats to those earning big money. Those who struggled for a long time and produce nothing , time to wake up, forget about your face/ego problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Accela,<br><br>What's your story?<br><br>I've been in banking and unit trust industries. Do becareful on what you advise people, that is my advise to you. When I was in the Unit Trust Industries, I sold a lot of unit trust. I have shared all the the benefits and assured them this the probably the safest form of investment. Then the crisis came, everything went bad. I have a really tough time explaining why they have a  paper lost of 50 to 70% of their investment and is beyond control. I have a couple who just retired back then and needed to money to pay for their son's education, came to withdraw only to find out they will lose half of their hard earn money. I couldn't bear to see their tears. That is the worst day of my life.<br><br>I recommend you read the following books by Robert T Kiyosaki :-<br><br>Rich Dad Poor Dad<br>Cashflow Quadrant<br>Retire Young and Retire Rich<br>Business School<br><br>I believe the above book will change your thinking/view on JOB or Just Obey Boss mentality and on the Unit trust/Shares.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ben<br><br>email: benwong99@hotmail.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't really choose a "good MLM company". Even if you have found and joined the best company, you are not guaranteed a fortune.<br><br>Hold you horses, dont get me wrong! I'm not against MLM here, I'm a full time networker.<br><br>My point is simple:<br><ul>It is not whether the company is good or not; it is whether YOU are good or not.<br>It is not whether the company can help you make money or not; it is whether YOU can make money for yourself or not.</ul><br><br>Some say it's better to find a stable job and draw a stable salary. There's no such thing of stable job anymore these days, like it or not. <span style="font-style: italic;">No bosses in this world would open a company to help you make your living</span>. The reality is more like, <span style="font-style: italic;">bosses pay you salary to help them make a living</span>, to maintain their Mercedez, to send their kids to overseas for study (while you are working hard to earn your paid leaves for your trip to overseas). If you are not productive, you can't help your stable company generate revenues, even if you've landed yourself in a fortune 500 company, you are bound to be axed pretty soon.<br><br>After being in the rat race for over a decade, I'm confident to make this statement: the only positions that seldom get retrenched, are positions of administrative clerks and security guards. Get these jobs, if you would like to draw stable income.<br><br>I'm not encouraging you to join MLM and be a networker, it's not a career for just anybody. I despise networkers who drawn you the beautiful picture and promised you quick fortune, they are black sheep of the industry. Nevertheless, every industry have black sheeps, I hope you can agree to this?<br><br>I haven't made a million as a networker yet, so far, I have been earning "unstable" retail income of S$2000 to S$2500, not fantastic but I'm glad I earned those money by and for myself. And I'll never get retrenched for sure.<br><br>Conclusion: it's not how good the MLM company; but, it's how good are you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thoreldan,<br><br>Very good also. I too have met with MLMers with ego problem, if you ask me, some bankers, lawyers, politicians, basically everywhere you will someone with ego problem. Correct me if I'm wrong. That's why human beings are very unique species. But I will assure one thing, MLMers with ego will not go far, they will wonder why others can surpass them in levels. They could achieve levels but when they look back, they would wonder... where are my people? why aren't they following us? thoreldan, does it make sense?<br><br>Your friend is in direct selling business. If he don't meet his personal sales volume, he may not get the cheque. How long do you think he can sell like that? How can you build a residual income like that? I don't know how, really. If he can't sell, he may have to buy it himself and stock. Would you believe me if I tell many members of many MLM Companies are actually stocking just because they can't sell? Direct selling is an old concept and will it sustain? I'm not in DS so this does not really bother me.<br><br>$1500 worth of products???? Wah, selling shark fins and bird nest ah? It's hard to believe why someone would join this company. Honestly, I do not know which company and I do not want to know.<br><br>All I can assume is because of human nature. Does greed come to mind? Probably the marketing plan promised them huge rewards.<br><br>In this situation, ask a few questions,<br><br>1) Where does the money come from? The money should come from the products, if not, it's a pyramid scheme.<br><br>2) Are the products value for money? You need to know what you are paying for and is the products worth what you you are paying for.<br><br>3) Is this company registered with Direct Selling Association Of Singapore? Just to have a little peace of mind. Minimise the risk of being conned.<br><br>Of course there are many more question to ask, I do not need to go into details.<br><br>Before I selected the MLM Company I'm with now, I want to know the company, how solid is the company, the story, the background, the vision, the mission, the support, the experience and proof of success.<br><br>Many people out there claim that they have made so much in a short time. If you are looking for a quick gain, go ahead, it's your choice. To me, it nonsense, to say it in a nice way, who knows there are minors in here. They may make the money know but can they guarantee it will sustain. Was there any buy in just because you can't sell?<br><br>I would be impressed if the person have been business for 2 to 5 years earning in a range of $2K to $40K. I have been approach by many who emphasize on profit to attract people. If you have read enough books, you will know it will never last. Sad to say, a few of my friend have done this. They didn't listen to me, never mind. What ticks me off is, when they fail, they blame the heaven and earth.<br><br>There is a saying "When a student is ready, the teacher will appear" . Very true. When you join a MLM, leave your ego, experience, degrees at the doorstep, if you want to learn and be successful in MLM. If your cup of tea is full, how can you put more tea into it. It's all about teacheability and willingness to change.<br><br>Those who  struggle a long time and produce nothing, something is wrong somewhere. It's too long for me to go through here. But what I can say, when my business is not going anyway, I would get coach and ask him. I would tell him to tell me straight, what wrong with me, what did I do wrong, what should I be doing. It's going to be painful but I have to give my coach the right to lecture me, otherwise, how to change myself for the better and how to move my business to the next step. A lot of people got stuck because lacking of leadership skills and personal growth. The higher your level the more essential these skills are and it takes a bit of time to learn the skills. They will not go anywhere if they don't change and improve themselves.<br><br>Training and Support is what I would look for in the system. There are many types of training. If the training always talks about products, then the company is product focus, more less training you to be a good salesman. If training talks about the system, program, personal development, then the company is people focus. I believe people are the greatest asset.<br><br>Well, I have said so much. Thank you,Thoreldan,for your comments.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ben<br><br>email : benwong99@hotmail.com<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... My two cents worth.... Pls pardon my horrijible english.<br><br>Very often,  even for me initially, my take on MLM is that they are bloodsuckers where the up-liners earns from the poor down-liners. However, these up-liners now are also previously down-liners also.. and they have worked hard to make their way up. In some companies, there are cases where the downliners actually surpass, in terms of ranking as well as profit, the upliners.<br><br>And about Jioing frenz to buy products from u. Let us look at another angle at the scenario. Imagine u have a business, for example, selling chicken rice. The would u tell ur frenz, " hey, i am ur good friend ah, so when i opening that day, dun come to my stall, cause i am ur frenz and i dun wanna earn ur money." cannot be mahz. What is important is that u earn his money, u provide the service, product and support to him to make sure that he earns as much if not more than u mahz. Thats is wat i call frenz mahz.<br><br>So to summarize my craps above, company culture is a very important factor to consider before chosing a company. and i am glad that i have chosen the right one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one of the tactic tat mlm uses is to tell u to start "selling" to ur frenz. They would tell u to buy 1st, say tat if u du buy, how to tell ur frens tat its a good product. so they gain  in both way. Of cos there r some good mlm but those r far n few.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, did u ever wonder dat those 'on top' also have people on top of them, they also start from the bottom. its a climb-the-ladder game. if u really go all out to promote the products, u will get more incentive or so. no doubt whoever roped u in will rip abit of the profit but for Amway, the guy above u gets paid by Amway and ur profits stays 100% with u, not siphoned at all by those on top.<br><br>I am not promoting Amway MLM scheme or wat, just to bring to u all the fact dat MLM is no easy get-rich-quickly scheme, u got to have wide social circle in order to get ur products out and.....the products got to be good in the first place. no point people buy liao, realised its rubbish and u can be sure they won't get any orders from u anymore and it do have a domino effect.<br><br>So 1 word, if u like the products and the company offer MLM scheme, no harm taking it as u will can buy the products cheaper for own use, u benefit and even if u dun wanna go promote the products its ok too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> you got to like the products 1st....dats very the important. u gonna convince urself b4 u can convince others. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sell ur products but dun always try to get them to sign member, if they realise that the product is good, they will sign member so dat they can get the products at a cheaper price and they will advertise for u. its a win-win situation....if u just wanna line ur pocket with $ quickly, u will not go very-the-far.<br><br>Amway now delivers the stuff to ur door FOC if u order more then S$150 at a time. You can also collect ur stuff from Singpost now, think the minimum is 50 bucks of products or so...not so sure. I personally feel dat Amway's way of doing things (not relating to MLM) is very good. With regards to MLM...no comments still.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Accela,<br><br>I didn't misunderstand u, trust me. I read those books long before I joined MLM. I left the bank 2 years back, fed up with the work, day in day out, beside the future in banking is in the rocks. I joined the oil and gas company and when on looking of other opportunities but I'm never interested in any MLM business. One day I saw and advertisement on TV about this book and a short interview on Robert T Kiyosaki. What Robert said really disturb me and went on the net and ordered the books from Amazon.com worth about US$200.<br><br>The first 3 books I've recommended have nothing much to do with MLM, probably 5 percent but I've ignore whatever he said about MLM. Furthermore, It's not the MLM part I want you read, It talks about business and investment, which is what you are recommending to everyone here. I personally don't feel that it's right for anyone to recommend business and investment when one is half cooked.  These books actually open up my mind on the "Employee Syndrome" and how we are programmed to work employer. In rich dad poor dad, it tells the story of his 2 dad's. What I can say, a lot of people have the poor dad mentality, it only that we never thought about and by the time we realise it, we are deep sh*t.<br><br>In Retire Young Retire Rich, the questions "Why should we let the age 55/60 determine our retirement? Should it be us who determine when we should retire? Why can it be 25, 30, 40?" This show us the option we have if we want to retire young and rich. Do you know what is the most important influence on our retirement? .................. MONEY. Where and how to find? This book will show you.<br><br>In Cash Flow Quadrant,  it tells you the 4 quadrant, Employee, Self Employed, Business and Investment. When you say business, what do you mean? Small business or big business? In smal business, yeah you are your own boss. Nothing wrong...but let me ask you this "You own the business or the business own you?". Think about it seriously. Can you afford to close shop on holidays? Maybe 3-4 days a year. Is that what you want? On investment, a lot of things to to learn from Robert. I thought I know a lot but I didn't know much at all.<br><br>The fourth book, Business School, I read it months after joining MLM. It tells you why MLM is a misunderstood industry and what is good about MLM. Why I recommended this book? it because you have such a negative view of MLM. I can tell all the good things about MLM but still you think its rubbish. Simply you would say I'm in MLM so I will only say good things about MLM. Robert is not in the MLM, he does not need to because he already a multi-millionaire in business and investment. Why not listen to what he has to say, maybe you will open up your mind.  You know, you have the same thinking that I once had. What you have said, I have said it before. I've been through a lot of challenges the last few years, I have overcomed it and it made me a stronger person.<br><br>I'm not better that anyone, I'm always a learner. A lot of the stuff I have shared comes from the books I read, tapes, teachings from my coach and all other leaders in my MLM company. It's the knowledge and skill I have gained being in MLM.<br><br>If anyone thinks I wrong or does not agree with what I say, by all means challenge me, let's debate. you could be right and I could have learned something new. Who knows, someone else would benefit.<br><br>When I look back, I've got a bad attitude. I now know my character, is choleric. I like to tell people what to do and do it my way. I admit my character flaw which forms my attitude. I used to be very negative and stubborn. That's me. I learned from a book called Personality Plus and from my coach. It tells the types of character of a person. It's through the progam I have change a lot but this is a never ending process.<br><br>Accela,<br><br>I'm a stranger to you and you do not have to listen to me. You can stick to what you believe in, it's up to you. I will not gain anything from you anyway by recommending the books. It's you who will gain the most if you decided to take a look. Is there any harm done? or are you worried that someone proved you wrong?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Ben<br><br>email :  benwong99hotmail.com</div>

My upline will not benefit from my group of people if he does not work his other group.<br><br>My income did not surpass my first generation upline, but I have surpassed many uplines from my first upline. It's fair because we deserve to get more if we do more. We are truly paid what we are worth.<br><br>What you said is half true, all conventional business is like that, maybe some MLM is like that but not mine and all pyramid schemes are like that.<br><br>By the way, you are commenting on the selling concept.
