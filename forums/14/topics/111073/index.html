            <div class='col-md body'>I've seen most of the post in the forums about people actually trying to slander each other in the forums. Not a very good way to portray to others who are not networkers in the market. All companies in the market will have their strong points and good products if not they would not have survive these turmoil times.<br><br>Some companies which I like to quote are:<br><br>Bel Air and Lampe Berger/DCHL for their Aroma Therapy<br>Forever Living with their Alovera<br>NUskin for their skin care and shampoo<br><br>of course there's more...can't list them all out ya...<br><br>So I do hope that all the networkers in the market do help out with informations about your company. And for those on the receiving end do take the words from people in the higher positions.<br><br>Eg. Would you take an advise from someone who failed in business or someone who have suceeded in business?<br><br>Taking an advise from someone who has fail will give you the advise to fail.<br>However taking an advise from a successful person will not make you sucessful, unless you action.<br><br>Business never fail. Only people fail.<br><br>And people who fail will never blame themselves.<br><br>So fellow networkers, do stop all this nonsense slandering other people's company.<br><br>And one more thing, i would like to know information about a company named FORMOR. If anyone do know or are in the company do PM me or share in this forum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not the company survived, it is just they have not fail yet!<br><br>I agree there are some good MLMs, but what about those fraud and scums one? Leave them that way to continue to harm people? There are doing the wrong way but just some people keep supporting them! Many who cannot differentiate right or wrong joined them and controlled by them, make use by them and lastly become one of them. Sad if you were to see your friends become one them right?<br><br>The reason those scums are still surviving are because they keep coming up with new ways to con people!</div>

I agree on that, legimiate one have cooling off period, but not it is not necessary the company is with DSAS. Similiarly to insurance, some agents, in order to get sales, ask you to buy powerful investment policies which are of no use to you. If the MLM person is your friend, he will encourage instead of hard selling to you. The company have a business model, it is how the distributors maximize the plan to the limit for the best profits, it goes the same for tradition business as well. It is juz how the party does his marketing/business strategy.</div>
