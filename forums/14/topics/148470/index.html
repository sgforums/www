            <div class='col-md body'>TO ALL THE PPL READING THIS, I'LL JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT I HAVE BEEN A VICTIM IN A SUPPOSEDEDLY BIG COMPANY. (why victim u may ask? pls refer to below) AS I REALLY FELT UNJUSTIFIED IN THE WAY IM BEING TREATED IN THE COMPANY. I JUST HOPE THAT BY MENTIONING IT HERE, WHENEVER U ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB, PLEASE BE MORE CAUTIOUS AND DUN END UP IN A CHEATER COMPANY. I jus can say that i've learnt my lesson and it is a BLOODY expensive one.<br><br>The story goes as..........<br><br>This Company is located at SUNTEC TOWER 2 .... (woah, it may seem prestige and all, but pls dun be farking fooled by the appearanace, as this com. is all out to cheap fresh graduates who have no working experiences, maybe this is how their advertisement fee came frm. )<br><br>(PLS BE CAREFUL: tis co. is constantly on the HIRE, due to the high turnover becox of unfair treatment so make sure u dun choose the wrong one)<br><br>It specializes in a few fields: Courier, telemarketing, publishing etc.<br>Such a "BIG" company. Would it exploit workers? Would it deny the employees of the rightful pay? Would it be resorting to underhand methods? U bet they SURE WOULD. I really could not believe it myself, but it is the truth and nothing but the truth. Right now, im fuming mad. But i can blame no one except myself for making the wrong choice to actually worked in this co.<br><br>Wad actually spurred me to go for this interview was their advertisement in classified. It was those bigger ads that come will big highlighted: $1800-- $2500. hence i thot, why not? it seems quite prestigious, unlike those small ad<br>which i usually dun give a damn about. i was SO SO SO WRONG.<br><br>Wadever. Anyway, all the workers there are denied of the right to actually go home at 6.30. And everyone is supposed to work till almost 8.30pm everyday!!!!! WITH no OT. ALMOST 12 HR PER DAY!! Although i really detested this co. i mean in the contract it states 9 - 6.30pm. so how can they exploit us by letting us work till so late, yet no OT. But i still worked with pride, ok, i was a telemarketer selling Standard CHartered Bank Products, Asking people to borrow money and all. I SWEAR i did gave my best everyday, constantly making calls out to customers and PROMOTING the product.wanting to help this co. achieve the targets, i always thought u reap wad u sowed. BUT damn farking wrong i was, the company wun think bout how much hardwork u put in, how much OT u are giving. but only Bout the company's welfare. MONEY.<br><br>I worked for 1 full month and though i really wanted to quit on the spot, i didnt and exited via the correct way byi submitted my one month notice in the middle of the month. After serving 2 weeks notice, the manager said my resign notice was not accepted. and wan me to resubmit. i was like fark, can they deny me of my rights to exit the co. ?<br><br>This story is bloody long...... to be continued. jus hope job seekers wun be like me. WORKED ONE FULL MONTH W/O getting my pay. $1400!!!!!!<br>this co. sure know how to  weave around loopholes in contracts and employment act to their benefit.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ANyway, i wanted to claim  back my rightful pay and went to sent a letter to MOM asking bout thesituation. but i'm quite sure my pay is now irrecoverable BAD DEBTS. wad can MOM do to them? they have their limits. jus like CASE and DSAS, they too have their limits. (to be frank, they have nNO USE, they cant help us reclaim back losses, they cant help consumers fight back for their right, leaving those ppl who approach them wallow in disappointment) IF CANT HELP MIGHT AS WELL SHUT DOWN RIGHT? y let ppl approach u but u reject them straight in the face saying "SORRY THERE"S NOTHING WE  CAN DO"<br><br>anyway, here's the letter. hope it'll give a clearer pic of wad im toking about. i jus feel so unjustifed. BEING A FREE LABOUR FOR ONE FULL MONTH:::::::::<br><br>RE: FRAUD<br><br>To: Person in charge<br><br>I have a few questions and sincerely hope that you will assist me in this matter. It is rather urgent.<br><br>I just graduated from poly and joined a telemarketing company. As a fresh graduate, I had high hopes and aspirations, but it was soon shattered and I was faced with the ugly truth of the working place- fraud, deception, and underhand method. I soon found out that the company actually has some bad practices which I do not approve of:<br><br>(i) Detaining us for work till almost 8.30pm everyday even though our contract states 0900 to 18 30 HRS. (without paying us OT)<br>(ii) rag?pay system whereby the company will always hold two weeks pay with them. (but within the salary period)<br>(iii) Denying employees of the right to exit the company in the rightful manner (provide 1 month notice), this is because they will benefit from it when employees just leave the company as they will forfeit the 2 weeks pay.<br>(iv) Employees had no punch card system, and denied of a photocopied contract<br><br>In addition, the company seems to have a lot of underhand methods to protect themselves and deprive employees of their rights. On the first day when I signed the employment contract with them, I requested for a photocopied contract for reference. But the interviewer denied me of this right and said that the company does not have such practice. Thinking back, I was sure that it was all in an attempt to rapped?new graduates like me who had no experience in the working industry.<br><br>Hence, I decided to quit. I tendered my one month notice resign letter to them on the 25 July (as required by them), which means that officially, the employment contract would be terminated on the 25 August. As such I would be able to get my full pay back. However, only on the 11th August that my manager told me that she did not approve my resign letter and want me to resubmit the one month notice again. I was furious and felt cheated that I was denied the right to exit the company in the proper and rightful way. If they did not approve of my resign letter, they should have told me on the day I tendered my resign letter but not after I served 2 weeks notice. My colleague faced the same problem too. She tendered her letter and served her one month notice. But on the last day of her work, when she told them that it her last day, the manager said she forgotten about it and she never did approved her resignation and asked her to resubmit it again.<br><br>It was obviously an attempt to rag?our employment period or even to force us to quit on our own so that they would not need to pay us our 2 weeks pay. Is this how the working world is supposed to be? Resorting to such ugly underhand methods to the beneficial of the company &amp; denying employees of their rights? Denying employees of their rightful pay even though they worked responsibly for the company. (A few of the ex- staffs actually tendered their 1 month notice but never did the company pproved?the resign letter too. In the end, they rather choose to leave the company and forfeit their pay instead of being forever stuck in such a cycle----- the company denying them the right to exit the company by saying they did not approve the resign letter.)<br><br>I was utterly disgusted by the culture of this company and I really wish to highlight this matter to MOM. I sincerely wish that appropriate action to be taken on this company to prevent more people from falling into this trap. Further more, it is not the first time that someone actually lodges a complaint against this company.<br><br>Lastly, here are some questions:<br><br>(1) If employees had already tendered their resign letter to employers. Do employers actually have the right to eject?or isapprove?the resignation?<br>(2) If yes, won employees be forever trapped in this cycle?<br>(3) By doing so, are the employers actually committing the rongful detention of employee?under the Employment Act under clause 108?<br>(4) In light of the situation mentioned above, will employees be entitled their pay after only serving half month notice?<br>(5) Will employees be able to claim back their pay if we just leave the company without finishing the one month notice?<br><br>Thank you for your kind patient in reading this letter and hope to hear from you soon.<br><br>Best Regards!<br></div>
