            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I should share a good post.<br>Written by someone by the forum nick of Bane.<br><br><blockquote>Dear friends, I have been to their company and listen to their presentations and proposal. After considering many factors, I did not invest this company. Yes, this company guarantees you will not lose the principle amount. Moreover, you have been pledge by this company that you will earn more over the time, and the more you invest with them, which also mean the more you trust them, the more you earn. (Thus the GP, SP and the BP system is to give the trust reward) It sounds like a great deal! I mean, which financial entity guarantees 100% principle secure?<br><br>Before I carry on, I wish to let everyone know that is solely on my opinion. I have facts, Â“black whiteÂ” and professional help which helped me in making my decision. But, Â“Cash flow QuadrantÂ”, what I type here is considering an opinion, till you saw the facts or Â“black and whiteÂ”; then it is consider a fact or a principle.<br><br>The investment returns are excellent! 300% if you are a GP, wow! And if the Emcom collapse, the other businesses that are under Sunshine Empire will pay back to you, your entire principle amount plus a little bonus, therefore your investment is very safe. That sounds good, too good to be true too. But that is the least of my concern because , I was told by a trust worthy friend, that there is a time that Mircosoft buy back itÂ’s public shares 44 times on what is listed on the stock exchange (probably when the price is low, and the Ceo is very confident). So, good deal does come along and let you earn unexpectedly, but same goes of expenses<br><br>The financial report shows the health and status of the business. Even if the business is making money, financial report will show how efficient the business is using the money. (For example, for simple terms, Business A uses 10k to earn 5k per year, but Business B uses only 8k to earn 5k per year. Business B is more efficient in using their money, thus Business B is a better investment.)<br>WellÂ… when I asked for the financial report, they mentioned the company is just started, therefore there isnÂ’t a financial report. Ok, that is reasonable. So I asked for the financial reports of the other businesses that are under the Sunshine Empire. They were unable to produce them to me, explaining to me that private limitedÂ’s financial report are restricted to only shareholders of the company.<br>Reason why I want to look at other businesses under Sunshine Empire because when Emcom were to collapse, the other businesses are the ones will pay you back the principle amount. Therefore, the other business under Sunshine Empire health and status are under my decision considerations.<br>I called 3 friends, a lawyer, a financial planner and very good businessman friend. They told me that even for a private limitedÂ’s financial report is public knowledge, not just the ones listed in SGX.<br>HmmmÂ… maybe my friends were wrong. There is still a possibility right? But how do I make an investment if I canÂ’t get hold of a financial report? All master investors wrote or mentioned that it is a good move that the financial report must be read before investing the company.<br>Â“Risk comes from not knowing what you are doingÂ” Â– Warren Buffet<br>From what that successful old guy, I do know what kind of business they are doing, but I have no idea how well they are doing in all their businessÂ…<br>Therefore my first point of reason I do not invest with Emcom; do not know how well their businesses are doing.<br><br>For those who have read Rich Dad Poor Dad series, both in Â‘Cashflow QuadrantÂ’ and Â‘Guide to InvestingÂ’, these 2 books have mentioned that the businessÂ’ system is very crucial to its vitality. This company uses the Â‘binaryÂ’ system to aid in their MLM business.<br>On 24th of January 2007, on the Chinese newspaper Â‘My PaperÂ’ published that such system like Â‘binaryÂ’ system is impractical. It is because if you manage to recruit up to 11th generation, the number of agents has exceeded population of USA, if you manage to recruit up to 13th generation, then you have agents more than the world population.<br>The system is flawed. It is heading to high risk of failure. It has very little room of expansion. Is this the business you wish to invest?<br>Therefore my second point of reason I do not invest with Emcom; the business system is flawed.<br><br>Has anyone heard of pyramid scheme? This is what I learn, in simple, a pyramid scheme is concept selling, which means, you get no physical products, only an idea. In the system too, you are unable to out earn the one who recruited you, even though you work harder and recruited more members than he does. MLM system on the other hand, allows you to earn more the one who recruited you if you bring more sales or recruitment than him if you reach the MLM CompanyÂ’s requirement. You get your fair share, based on your hard work. It is also an obligation for an MLM company to sell you a physical product.<br>On Emcom side, wellÂ… they are selling phantom shares, presenting that they build wireless network in certain parts of Taiwan, where it is hard to confirm, unless you fly to those parts and confirm it.<br><br>On the agreement, they mentioned that if I have to sue them, I have to sue them at Taiwan. HmmmÂ… this is kind of odd, since this company is register in Singapore, why do I have to go to Taiwan to sue them?<br>Therefore this is my first point of doubt; why do I have to sue them at Taiwan if they are register in Singapore already?<br><br>To summarize the whole thing,<br><br>The advantages:<br>Fourth player in Singapore telecommunication industry<br>Capital Assurance plus a little bonus if you invested more if Emcom collapse.<br>High returns<br><br>The points of doubt:<br>I do not know how well their businesses are doing.<br>The business system is flawed.<br>Why do I have to sue them at Taiwan if they are register in Singapore already?<br>It fits perfectly as a pyramid scam (but doesnÂ’t mean it is a pyramid scam ok?)<br><br>HaizÂ… honestly speaking, I seriously wish they can satisfy my reasons of doubt because the offers they give are seriously very good. If this is successful, they can be possibly being the fourth major player in Singapore telecommunication industry.<br>But, based on what I discovered, their business seems risky to me. Very risky. Therefore, if you are a very HIGH RISK investor, this is perfect for you. But, this isn't for me.<br><br>Thank you everyone.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>refering to the post that you quote from others.. (I've edited [delete] partial of the post which i quote..for full quote...kindly refer to the previous post..)<br><br>from what i know..supported by BLACK AND WHITE with Newspaper articles and Trust-Worthy Websites..<br><br>based on the red text which i highlighted, there are way a lot more problems than those highlighted in red.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First and foremost</span> - in the event of losing the principle amount invested, company pledged that investor will not lose the investment.<br><br>but if you people were to read the clause CLEARLY when being showed to..there will be a Excluding Clause inside stating that THEY the company HAVE THE RIGHTS TO AMEND ANY TERMS AND CONDITONS STATED IN AGREEMENT WIHTOUT THE NEED TO IMFORM ANYBODY.<br><br>Such a clause is only used to protect the company and not to protect the investor..nor is it a Win-Win Situation..in fact, it's a Win (company) - Lose (investor) situation.<br><br>Note: Since the person who posed this mention that they do have pledge to gurantee the at least the pricipal amount, i'm not sure if what i have on hand is still up to date or not, based on the agreement which I have. But if there's anybody reading this article who have that latest agreement, we can meet up and discuss about that in details.<br><br>There are lots of inside details which i shall not elaborate as the readers here are either young people if not people who have no buying power thus there's no need for me to go into details..however for those pure readers (real investors who just read and don't post, if you want facts, well I do have quite a handfull of facts for those people who are keen).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second</span><br>Now that the person mention the 4th teleco company.<br><br>readers..if you know copyright laws of company trademarks and copyrights, you might want to take a look at their logo, and check how many BlueEngine are there registered in Singapore..you'll be surprised..<br><br>Hint: There's more than One..are you thinking what I'm thinking?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third</span><br>Don't be misled and take into believe when they mention and try to link good examples of buying back of shares..<br><br>When it comes to BUSINESS, lets look at the BrandName of the company, how much does the Brand cost..for those accountants..it's intanglible asset which i'm talking about here...something like Nike, Addidas etc..Everyone of us consumers are paying $$ for the brand..<br><br>When it comes to buying back of shares..how creditable is the company and the prospects of the company.<br><br>Will the company be buying back the shares?<br>Bear in mind that the company already have a Dark Dirty Negative History in Most of the People living in Singapore..if they happen to be in the every 1 out of 4 person in Singapore who was under this International President when he was at he's peak..but due to lots of mistakes which he made..there goes his retribution...thus what you see today, he aren't trust-worthy nor reliable.. (this goes back to why people are skeptical of MLM thus I shall not elaborate more coz it's another story..)<br><br>More and more complaints have being surfacing recently is because those who complained are either victims of his passed projects if not victims of other schemes before or Prudent/Smart Investors who think carefully.<br><br>Do a background check for those Real Time Big Investors..<br><br>Facts are always there..just that do you know who to ask and where to dig out those FACTS!!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Due to the Complex Story and History of this details, I will not elaborate anymore...Information will only be passed individually only.</span></span><br><br>I am only saying all these because I need to add on to the current post, so that it will only show the TRUTH...<br><br>They can cover themselves..but they can't hide the truth..as it will present itself out one day..just like an example of the Perfect Acused Victim 'Japan' declining to take respondsibility for those women who were raped during WWII, and will only admit when being thrown with PROOF..<br><br>such is the way of how the society works..untill there's sufficient evidence, if not law-breakers will still be at large..<br><br>would you want to be a savy or be greedy investor?<br><br>decide for yourself..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mrleech:</div><div class="quote_body">Thought I should share a good post.<br>Written by someone by the forum nick of Bane.<br><br>Dear friends, I have been to their company and listen to their presentations and proposal.

Look at those investment returns that are offered by legitimate businesses. There is a certain range of returns that you'll get from the money that you put into the investment.<br><br>"If the guy promises you 20, 30 times of that, that is a signal that you have to be extra careful."<br><br>The Monetary Authority of Singapore website lists the financial institutions under its regulation.<br><br>The public can also seek advice from CASE or call the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority to check records of companies.<br><br>Mr Nalachandran said: "If someone feels that they have been cheated, then of course they can lodge a report with the police or commence civil proceedings to try and reclaim money that they've lost.<br><br>"But this can be difficult if you can't locate or identify the parties you're contracting with or dealing with, or if they're not based in Singapore."<br><br>In such situations, CASE said it can still track down the company with the assistance of overseas consumer bodies.<br><br>If the company is a Singapore firm, consumers can make their complaints on the CASE website or contact its officers.<br><br>CASE can write to the company and negotiate on the consumer's behalf for a settlement.<br><br>If the case cannot be resolved directly, CASE may persuade the company in question to go for mediation.<br><br>Ultimately, experts said, the final decision is up to the consumer.<br><br>- CNA/so</blockquote>Another piece of interesting news.

Look at those investment returns that are offered by legitimate businesses. There is a certain range of returns that you'll get from the money that you put into the investment.<br><br>"If the guy promises you 20, 30 times of that, that is a signal that you have to be extra careful."<br><br>The Monetary Authority of Singapore website lists the financial institutions under its regulation.<br><br>The public can also seek advice from CASE or call the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority to check records of companies.<br><br>Mr Nalachandran said: "If someone feels that they have been cheated, then of course they can lodge a report with the police or commence civil proceedings to try and reclaim money that they've lost.<br><br>"But this can be difficult if you can't locate or identify the parties you're contracting with or dealing with, or if they're not based in Singapore."<br><br>In such situations, CASE said it can still track down the company with the assistance of overseas consumer bodies.<br><br>If the company is a Singapore firm, consumers can make their complaints on the CASE website or contact its officers.<br><br>CASE can write to the company and negotiate on the consumer's behalf for a settlement.<br><br>If the case cannot be resolved directly, CASE may persuade the company in question to go for mediation.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Ultimately, experts said, the final decision is up to the consumer. </span> So consumers have to decide themselve, n not some wulu ppl who are not even involve..</strong><br><br>- CNA/so<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Another piece of interesting news. LOL! I think its of some relevance here.</blockquote></div>
