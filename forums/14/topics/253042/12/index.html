Its not their duty to do so, as they can get away with saying even the most ludicrous stuff.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Independent distributors will NEVER be recognized as authorized agents of a MLM business simply there are too many of them and the company will not be able to track the movements or conduct of these distributors to agree to be bound by their authorized agents' actions and word. Note that "agents" in a traditional business holds the authority to sign contracts on behalf of company and bound them to lawful contractual obligations. I believe that all MLM companies' policies would state very clearly that their distributors have NO such authority. So that means these distributors are only here to present their own point of view in this forum and are not representatives of the company.....</span><br><br>As for keeping hope, this been said many times everytime there is a new project (note the damn high turnover of projects). So issit doomsayers prophecies, or is it people no longer bothered to be conned to keep hope?<br><br><span style="color: brown;">This is very true. It seems to be a really long list in a really short timeframe. We need someone in the know to list the projects again so as to enligten all newbies to this board.... </span><br><br>As for ad hominem arguments, even forumers who came in with neutrality or has no interest in this subject has noted how agents are ruining the image of the companies with tireless ranting, whining and flaming, and which subsequently lead to banning, and more ranting whining and flaming.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">I am afraid this trait happens far too often and not only with this board. </span><br><br>If the company cannot get control and cease this behaviour on the significant scale, there is no point telling people numerous times that these are rookies. This is the business world, ie, who cares? In the real world, rookies like these are fired immediately.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">The truth is that we don't know the extent of the problem really. the "problem" is magnified online via this forum and probably nowhere else... in real numbers sense, maybe the figures are really very small. And maybe companies are already tackling against such rouge behaviour but as a business I believe companies would try to strike a balance between discipline and profit and not fire anyone firstly accused of bad conduct..... May not be a good strategy but I think some companies operate such way.</span><br><br>This is not a school where people are given chances and be allowed to justify themselves. Which is what i said, get away from the pseudo business world James Phang been putting you guys in. Go to the real business world with these ridiculous ideas and prepared to be pwned, as they say.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Ah Lau... this is the school of life lah... people must learn from everywhere as life springs its surprises from all over.... Even in the real business world or traditional business world, we are many atimes disillusioned....let alone in MLM.... but nonetheless, there are pretty much ridiculous ideas preached that should be addressed otherwise a MLMer would appear really inadequate in the real world... But we must try to symphathize with them... the MLMers would never cross their mind at this point that they would enter the real job market.... so they can't imagine they need to learn anything else....</span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
