Dont think, be sure!<br><br>Again, distributors or so called top earners or anyone having interest in marketing their scheme have duty to reveal their income, preferably verified. What being noob got to do with it? Are you saying MLM is like a traditional business, got top earners and bottom slaves? Surely not I hope.<br><br>Why they would not, especially help top earners? In fact, why not you boost the income earned by these distributors, so that in the long term, people are attracted by large income and pump in their money, increasing the company's coffers? Real clue is, if you know, how much of the company earns that go back to  distributors? I find many investors too happy to recoup and gain some income. In capital market, they have measurements, such as dividends per share, profits payout etc? In SE, there are? in short, know whether what you invested in, not just interested in gaining some.<br><br></div>
