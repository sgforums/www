I've seen friends turned enemies, hardworking people turned irresponsible... ask whatever you guys wish to ask. The MLM company that I was with was a national day parade sponser. So yes they can be 100% legitimate, but what lies beneath the lies and false encouragements reveals a network of liars and criminals out to cheat people of their savings.<br><br>All these through a cleverly disguised system that managed to escape the legal loopholes. But justice has prevailed, after such a long time in Singapore (7 years under the current name if I am not wrong), the system is finally disintegrating... hopefully into ashes and never to be risen again.<br><br>Ask whatever you guys wish to know... the story is too long and too complicated for me to repeat. But do not take whatever the person that is introducing you into the company is saying... WHO WOULD BE SO DUMB TO SAY BAD THINGS? Check the internet... check forums.

            <div class='col-md body'>just saw this posting from sammyboy.<br>thread title: Everyone beware! Get Rich Scheme<br><br>I went home this evening and my mummy was quick to share with me a get-rich scheme that an organisation is trying to sell.  She was persuaded by a few of her customers to buy; they themselves have benefited greatly from this scheme.  Here is how it works:  You go to a talk at a hall in HDB Hub (nothing to do with HDB) which is usually packed with aunties and uncles.  The silver-tongued presenter would tell you how easy it is to earn money simply by parking a few thousand dollars with them.  The money will be used to invest in "projects" in Taiwan etc according to them.  They would even offer to fly you to Taiwan for FREE to look at the construction of the buildings in progress!  You can park as much as $28,000 with them and get $5000 (yeah no mistakes!) a month as interest.  if you do your math, thats like $60000 in a year!  Your investment has more than doubled!  I was like, even with buying stocks and shares, there is no such good deal anywhere on this planet.  Some gullible aunties after parking a few thousand dollars and getting their few hundred dollars interest as promised have begun to park more substantial amount with them.  Some of even quit their jobs to invest full time. If you want to earn more interest, just recommend this scheme to your pals.  What makes them CREDIBLE is interests are really paid out.  When my mother questioned about their background, these aunties would just said, "Dont worry lah, it is held at HDB Hub one."  I have a feeling that these people are using the place to show their credibility.  From her story, I suddenly remembered a scam ran by a church pastor in the US with the same modus of operandi.  He would write to churches in the US to ask them to invest in this scheme.  Of course, they invested and got their interests.  Think about it, who would question how you earn your money when money was pouring into you bank account without fail every month?  When the sum became too huge, and obviously after paying out the interests to "investors", this chap declared bankrupt and vanished - he was caught of course.  If any of your closed ones are involved in this, warn them because by then, the pyramid would be on the verge of collapsing!</div>

I have a feeling that these people are using the place to show their credibility.  From her story, I suddenly remembered a scam ran by a church pastor in the US with the same modus of operandi.  He would write to churches in the US to ask them to invest in this scheme.  Of course, they invested and got their interests.  Think about it, who would question how you earn your money when money was pouring into you bank account without fail every month?  When the sum became too huge, and obviously after paying out the interests to "investors", this chap declared bankrupt and vanished - he was caught of course.

After following the threads for so long......finally its my turn to come in here. Lawrence82, I don't quite agree with you. Are you challenging the public that you have a stronger bond with the moderators?<br><br>Or can I say that you are the king of Sgforum?<br>I hope that the moderators will be fair as I foresee anyone personal attacking, except Lawrence82. Why not the moderators ban Lawrence82? Lawrence, are you sure you have not even once personal attack anyone before in sgforum?<br><br>If this is the case, I think this forum is useless because it can only hold one sided story.......(Lawrence82 and gang stories).<br><br>And by the way Lawrence82, why not you set up a company. From the whole mlm thread, you have been bombing more than half of the Earth's MLM companies. Seems like no MLM bosses is better than you. Why not you set up one company and I will promise you that I will be the first to join you. (Cause I got confidence in you as you understand the MLM law, (both nationally and internationally) and also you know how to bring up the professional image of this industry.)<br><br>Well. If you do not see me posting in here anymore, pls be sure that I have been banned, cause Lawrence82 will protect this small little webspace territory of his.<br><br>To the moderators,<br><br>Pls, I am not trying to offend you, if you can see, I am trying to protect you. It seems like Lawrence82 is getting out of hand using you guys as a threat to the rest of the users. It will be good if you can give him a warning publicly or else, I believe no one will really come to sgforum anymore as it is controlled based on relationships with the moderstors.<br><br>Juz my 2 cents worth.</div>

I see people writing letters to the authorities without concrete evidence......What has this world become?<br><br>Can you guys gather some concrete evidence, that ca be used in court before flamming anyone, or any mlm company down here. I believe that you all are matured enough to use your brainy juice. (I thought most of the users here are graduates, eg: Lawrence82). Pls for god sake and for the whole world's sake. Do something that will be productive to the society. Don't waste the $$$ that you spent on your certificates and of course pls do not pollute humanity with the things that you want.<br><br>I know Lawrence82's intention. I have PM him before. Those who wants to know, pls PM me.<br><br>TY<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it strange is that why everyone is making such a big fuss over personal attacks. How you decide to react is entirely up to your own judgement. No point getting worked up.<br><br>MLM is an industry to stay, whether you like it or not. However, I guess plenty of goverance and legislation would be needed to ensure the proper development. See how the trade of insurance have changed throughout the years.<br><br>With the case for Sunshine Empire and EGA, no point pushing and shoving around verbally. Facts should be shown and facts are facts. They cannot be wrong unless there are concrete evidence. Thus flaming alone will not change those facts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 1</span><br>NTI has been renamed Sunshine Empire.<br>HBCI has been renamed EGA<br>Thus, both NTI and HBCI should not be reflected under the group of companies under EGA.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 2</span><br>As of the last check, EGA's shareholders are not shareholders in Emcom or SE. Thus the claim of EGA having SE and Emcom as subsidiaries are baseless. How to check? Go ACRA and do an enquiry. Pay $5.20 and you have your answer. Want more information? Pay more and you can see more.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 3</span><br>EGA's paid up capital is $100k. Emcom's paid up is $2m. SE's paid up is $150k. Don't you find it interesting that a company with $100k paid up should be an owner of a $2m paid up company?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 4</span><br>The marketing plan requires you to at least join as a Bronze Member (BM). If my sources are correct, the value is US$280. With a membership, you can then decide to stay there or upgrade to a partner level. The most common is the GP or Gold Partner costing US$6900. That aside, I was told by a Business Development Manager from SE that I can already enjoy my commission payback even as a BM by getting another BM to join under my wings. Those familiar with the MLM Law in SG would be able to detect what is wrong.<br><br>Do make your own judgement even when you read the points I made. If you feel that I may not be making right statements, please feel free to drop by their company to ask for yourself. Nothing beats finding out the information yourself.<br><br>Please note that I am not advocating that the business is good/legitimate/scam/etc. I made my own judgement call with information that I have found. You should make your own judgement. Do a due diligence check. Imagine if you are going to start a business, a businessman would do as much checks on the industry and stuff before deciding on his next step. Same goes for MLM.</div>
