            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>I've been looking into this SE thing for some time now because it's catching up really fast with the people in Singapore. Apparently though, the maths just doesn't work out for SE, they will not be able to support their cash outflow in due time, as much as they try to convince people that they will be paid through the projects in Taiwan. For that I must still thank SE for their magnanimity, for coming to Singapore and letting us earn off the people in Taiwan paying for their contracts and what not. For many of the SE agents posting online, I would say thus far it has been a dismal mistake, given the lack of professionalism shown and clear sense of low qualification, need I say education. Just explains why they have no other way to earn money and use this to boost whatever ego that's left to boast about. It puzzles me how Singaporeans are still willing to part with their money to such people, and 11k for GPs indeed! The education system may be going on to cyber schools and the like, but we still have those left so far behind.<br><br>I like what SE did with their office, especially the huge poster of lions and the new people streaming in. Ooooh, SE agents, did u get that innuendo? Still thinking it looks so majestic does it not? A lot of people tell me seeing is believing, but an office like that can easily be funded by well, 5GPs? At least people now know where their money is going, nice office in cosy HDB hub. Will we have gold taps in the offices too I wonder?<br><br>So many of us have lost track of the purpose of this thread, and in others too about SE. Inasmuch as people are frustrated and slamming SE, nothing is done, and we get useless point-scoring arguments between SE agents and outsiders. Whatever happened to CAD, CASE, or now I heard, that 95.8FM investigation?<br><br>The thing is this my friends. Pressure CAD to come up with an official statement. CAD is meant to serve the people, as do the media as the independent fourth estate of a state, and we should seek their help in helping us solve this mystery. If CAD says that there isn't anything to go against SE, then the whole Singapore, all happy 4million (smiles) of us should just throw in whatever money we have to support this wireless project in Taiwan. It's amazing how much money we put in and yet the governments don't seem to be shaking hands over this.<br><br>We know how SE will respond, seeing how they cannot cope with the cash outflow. They will close the GPs, and get ready to run.<br><br>No point calling SE a scam, because their agents will insist on meeting you 1-on-1, and they will insist that you provide evidence when they themselves fail to do so. The elusive James Phang will always be somewhere as the great holy President, and his knights and representatives, Regional Business Managers for example, will be around to ease your fears *blink blink* So friends, keep it up and keep calling your favourite radio stations, keep blogging, keep writing to the press and let's help SE do a bit advertising shall we. If SE is that good, we should help spread the word. If it isn't then these foreign knaves should stop manipulating Singaporeans and just leave. Remember people, the key is to raise SE to the national level, and let our friendly govt help us deal with this fiasco too.<br><br>James Phang made a revolution in creating a fantasy world for the weak and helpless. I say, let's join hands creating a revolution to rid him once and for all.<br><br>P/S: Oh darling SE agents, here's a link for you: www.dictionary.com. And I so love your SE website - the Spore and HK sites are almost carbon copies! Not to mention all the cool presentations - "Wealth you cannot denial (sic)", complete with enrapturing music from Pirates of the Caribbean to keep people at the edge of their seats! Awesome work guys! Cheers.</div>
