Cause i don't believe which guy would be so smart to put their own income tax online..from what i know.. Anyway how about ending this in such way... Take it as Everyone in SE is not earning... They are just boasting thats all... Happy.. ? They are a Scam waiting to be caught... This should sound pleasant ba.. This would not benefit anyone.. Rite..? aruging over such matter can prove what..? how Great those people that anti SE..? then let them be.. For those in SE just like me, just do ur own things like me... What the point prove so much in this forum.. By proving will result u sponsor more lines , making u earn more $$.. ?dun tink so ba... just sit back enjoy what people say.. Times will tell whether SE will make it or nt.. as it might fail den prove Lau dey all are rite..? but if it succeeded..? den think lau dey all should just keep quiet by then..<br><br>No need rebuffle back..Just trying to say what on my mind.. Think It sounds neutral as no one know what will goes on down the road.. Failure of SE or Successful of SE..?<br><br>PS: Hooray...
