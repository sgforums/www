Its not a subjective issue. In the first place, why should a distributor promoting a clean scheme be evasive about proving his income? Is there a very solid reason not to do so?<br><br>So far the various answers given have been disappointing, and like you said, even conflicting. One chap insinuates that its a practice to evade taxes, one said even a tax income statement can be questioned, and one asked whether its possible to fake account statement from company.<br><br>None so far provided a very coherent consistent view, and some totally evade the issues by making incoherent posts.<br><br>This issue is very simple. Its either some people have been evading declaring income, or simply there is no income to declare to.<br><br>And also, this was not the main issue also.
