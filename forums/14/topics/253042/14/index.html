That means, if any person in the mlm business wished to claim income, they must ensure that those figures aren't plucked from the air...<br><br>Singapore being a pro-enterprise economy, I don't think the govt will step in to make stricter controls as they would rather self-regulation in the market.

So your type of talk of "admitting" all the negative things for SE is not really contributing to the growth of constructive information and critique in this forum board.<br><br>There are people here that are burnt by the said company and have personal experience to share, questions left unanswered, anger unmanaged, frustration beyond explanation. The forum allows people like them to share their thoughts on their own experiences, just like what a reader would contribute to the Straits Times Forum Page.<br><br>There are distributors of the said company here to defend the repute of their company and seek understanding, I hope. If you would care to read other mlm boards as well, you will notice that many atimes, the so-called distractors are not as "flaming" as you would think so, they do listen out and then they input their own opinions.<br><br>I believe that if you wished to harness the goodwill of the online community here, it will do better to seek to understand what's bothering people and then assist to address those concerns in your own capacity.<br><br>It doesn't do anyone any good and especially not to your company to say things like what you had said in the above "quote". Be understanding, provide assistance, show some professionalism.<br><br>We don't bite.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by helpdesk^^:</div><div class="quote_body">I believe income proof per se is not regulated in the sense that you want because simply,<br><br>"what one person can earn does not equate to what the next person will earn";<br><br>and it is still considered a private affair regarding one's personal income - no one in any other industry will let on their earnings in published manner too...<br><br>and if such "proof" were allowed, it may draw even worse conclusions that earning this sum is a "guaranteed" when we know that is not the reality etc...<br><br>In fact the MLM Act stated very clearly that where any actual or potential income or benefit that can be earned or accrued via the mlm business must have fair records of max, min, median, avg and mode records that are duly audited by an auditor for each financial year. That means, if any person in the mlm business wished to claim income, they must ensure that those figures aren't plucked from the air...<br><br>Singapore being a pro-enterprise economy, I don't think the govt will step in to make stricter controls as they would rather self-regulation in the market. But we'll see if there are any impending changes if too much unregulation harms the market eventually...<br><br>Hope i make sense...</div></blockquote>unfortunately, this is not the stance MLM companies will or should take in general<br><br>if you were to market a scheme, there is a need to show how successful it is<br><br>same logic apply everywhere, if you were to sell a treasury product to a company, you will need to show how it benefit them and reduce their cost in making payments<br><br>if you were to sell a physical product, you need to show it has good success rate, for example, in curing certain diseases if its a medical product<br><br>so on and so forth, and if any MLM company cannot prove that it's successful or indicate that the scheme provides an avenue or opportunity for success, it will be shooting itself in the foot<br><br>besides, in this situation, SE is so willing to even to publish their income on their websites, but my issue is not with this alone, if you were to read the rest of my posts<br><br>and true, there is lack of action on the part of government to do anything, but anti mlmers should not raise the alarm more than before<br><br>either something big will happen to wake the society up, or mlm will remain a slumbering industry as it is now<br><br>i think a lot of people make the assumptions that the gowing number of growing MLM companies indicates strong growth, but i beg to differ, there is a growing number of participants dipping their hands into the pie but there is not much significant improvements in quality of products,distributors earning, distributors turnover rate or even the level of professionalism<br><br>even till today there is large debate over the success of MLM, and i mean success in whole, not mere numbers</div>
