It was registered last year in which they changed name from a previous Niutrend International. More likely the 28 years statistic is the length of time JP spent engaging in business and/or MLM.<br><br>This is the problem, when a network marketing company starts to expand, there is always an issue with distributors giving varied accounts of their company's plans and even products. It has been, and most likely will stay as a questionable issue in the industry for practically every MLM company unless a perfect training system can emerge.<br><br>That, however, does not necessarily indicate whether a company is doing well or not. I agree with you that a company can never fully dictate and explain its own actions to its consumers and the whole world; i have done research as homework for a project on another company called Enron (if you're educated enough, you'll know which company i'm talking about). A third party is absolutely necessary. I don't pretend to understand why SE never joined DSAS, all i can offer is the fact that i have witnessed (both personal and third party) the failure of a few projects (namely China Dream, Club Empire and Magic Kingdom), and from what i see between them and the current Emcom/Emcall/Empire Property Venture projects, i can say that at least ongoing progress is being much more visible than before including the launching of products like Emcall. In previous projects, everyone had to wait eons for the eventual news of failure.<br><br>True, there may be too many past projects which suggest that there may have been a major problem with the network in the past, but just what if, what if the current one is different and just might work out?<br><br>So for those (not laurence) who view it with more than the usual skepticism, just wait and see if ur words bear fruit instead of constantly mouthing doomsayer prophecies.<br><br>Anyway, this forum is likely to stay in ad hominem stasis because except for the odd interest, very few distributors from SE who are earning big bucks, getting their income taxes and cars will be bothered to come down and put in their two cents' worth. Most will likely be new, enthusiastic and probably not fully-trained people (pardon my unintended slight) who just happened to hunker down onto this forum. And in which, they'll most likely respond to the slightest insult towards their company more with their emotions and less with universal reason.<br><br>Apologies if what i have mentioned is flawed in any way (and i expect it to be since i haven't engaged in forum discourse for some time), but at no time do i present intentional falsehood or evasion of facts. Do ask me more questions on anything about the company and i'll try my best to answer them with my limited know-how. Thanks for the time everyone =D<br><br>p.s. Laurence, u do offer good food for thought at times!<br><br>p.p.s Emcall is already out on the market, for those who are unaware. It was launched on the 5th June.</div>

The very core activity in network marketing happens to be spreading of the company's profile mouth-to-mouth (relatively) informally, not by professional advertising, corporate appointments and such. The government itself recognises and does not dispute the existance and legality of MLM, but due to the long standing war between consumers/unhappy distributors vs the way they handle their operations, even the head honchos of the country did not deign to comment on the development of this industry.<br><br>Personally, i would love it if a method was found to regulate how much an agent can say and represent. It would solve many issues on both sides, yes?<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">As for keeping hope, this been said many times everytime there is a new project (note the damn high turnover of projects). So issit doomsayers prophecies, or is it people no longer bothered to be conned to keep hope?<br><br></div></blockquote>What you're referring to is disillusion. Granted that negative reaction to a new project after a string of failures is not unexpected, but does that mean that no quarter for consideration should be given to a new one if it does start to adhere to promises and is moving in a different direction from the past? Critics should respond in a rational enough manner that would make pple feel that their stand is justified, rather than to make strongly suggestive statements that i find not much basis on. Again, i refer to a few individuals. Sorry about that.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">As for ad hominem arguments, even forumers who came in with neutrality or has no interest in this subject has noted how agents are ruining the image of the companies with tireless ranting, whining and flaming, and which subsequently lead to banning, and more ranting whining and flaming.<br><br></div></blockquote>Similiarly, on the other side of the gulf, there are also forumers who thrive on targeting agents with lack of any tact and shoot off the barrel without bothering to think about what they're saying. As i said before, no offense meant, but the agents you see here are most likely the bottom-of-the-barrel, too used to spending time picking nits on the net rather than spending useful time outside consolidating their knowledge and expanding their network. I dare say even that the company itself may not approve of some of the material mentioned in the threads, just that it has not taken any action.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">If the company cannot get control and cease this behaviour on the significant scale, there is no point telling people numerous times that these are rookies.

It might seem significant in the forum, but forum is out of company bounds and not within its direct jurisdiction. Unless a discussion in this forum directly threatens company interests, of course.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">This is not a school where people are given chances and be allowed to justify themselves. Which is what i said, get away from the pseudo business world James Phang been putting you guys in. Go to the real business world with these ridiculous ideas and prepared to be pwned, as they say.<br></div></blockquote>I have heard a quote from one of the better respected individuals in the company, saying that most of the people in SE, no matter how much they earn in the company, will earn less than peanuts if we're all thrown into the real business world. This is something I, and many other agents are painfully aware of. 95% of the agents are learning sales skills (and some rather not efficiently due to the size of the company), not business management. So if you wish to use the analogy of a corporate business on SE, you're right, a pwning session will be in progress.<br><br>That is why in the strictest sense, no one should consider this a traditional business. Because in a lot of aspects it does not behave like one. Therefore, if anyone has the intention to come into the company, spend a year or two and expect to go out into the business world as a corporate guru, i would encourage everyone here to get him/her to wake up his/her idea.<br><br>All the issues that have been raised here, i'm sure CASE, MOM and even CAD are already aware of. Its the murky transistion from traditional business models to new ones that's making everyone scratch their heads and wonder what to do as the masses smell foul play and cry murder, for justifiable and unjustifiable reasons.<br><br>Guide me back if i drift from the point. I tend to digress. ^^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Need to be perfect? Thats why i said 'on the significant scale'. Why some companies distributors are significantly rambunctious while other companies are relatively profesisonal or do not have that significant number of people who distort the company image?<br><br>Solution? Many. One clue is the profile of the distributors, mainly youngsters with raging hormones. Another is the top down infuence. Strangely, the more established companies (Amway, Elken, Herbalife, Nuskin etc) do not have these two problems or issues. There could be others, but at end of the day, management's problem to resolve.<br><br>In what way its not justified? i believe the fallen and other has provided a lot of justifications from day one, so you could start along with these. Otherwise, not much to keep hope on, given the 'exchange of information' that has passed in this forum.<br><br>The number of forumers from the opposite who flame rather than debate are rather low. If anyone feel they are flaming, can feel free to message the moderators. But as the recent weeks shown, a lot of banning on so called SE agents.<br><br>And who cares whether or not the company approve of any sort of behaviour? If the harm has been done, you can tell the public 1001 times but to what effect? Like i said, this is business we are talking about, not civil rights group or schools. You done the damage, go solve the problems and face the consequences, not stand around tryng to justify. Again, its a cold harsh world out there. These people can be bottom of the barrel, these people can be clones or some other trolls, but again, damage been done. If the company is doing nothing to arrest the situation, what is the point of going over and over again that these people are insignificant few? Its like saying sorry but doing nothing, people seen the ugliness, and you couldnt just expect anyone to come along and say 'hey its ok' that simply<br><br>I didnt know flaming skill is a type of sales skill? Besides, what sort of sales skill people are learning if they market an investment scheme but chose to evade the duty of proving their income? Is this a business management skill? I dont see the difference. if they cannot show how they understand how business work, it will be a blight on the sales skill. Its like a banking sales officer marketing various treasury products but could not understand how these products relate to business operations.<br><br>In fact, which of these stuff i mentioned during the rounds of debates can ever be so cleanly classified as 'biz management'? What is the point of using 'corporate business'? How come that got into the discussion, its like out of mid air. Same for the talk about traditional business?<br><br>Do you mean to say, for example, MLMers can evade tax because its no longer the tradtional business? Can MLMers be less professional because its no longer the traditional business? These are the issues that have been discussed all along and i didnt noe because its a new type of business, these ideas can be discarded.<br><br>Lastly, being aware is nothing. Rather, i would say apathetic, maybe until something big crops up, like the Ponzi scheme way back then.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Correct, distributor profile is an important indicator as to the manner in which information is distributed to the public.. It depends on the makeup of the company in the first place. Certain companies, strangely, attract youngsters more and others attract older and more mature individuals, just like your Amway and Herbalife.

Top down influence might work under controlled situations where everybody down the line has the minimum maturity to adhere to the right things, but not when there's a sprawling network spread everywhere with an enticing product that does not require that much of a distributor's efforts to close the average layman as other products such as aromatherapy and magnetic mattresses. Not easy to try to be an omnipotent CEO, u know.<br><br>the_fallen and other both have done their homework, i was referring to others who tend to brush away facts and press their point without any thought. But if they are becoming a minority, then all the better for it.<br><br>Exchange of information in this forum is a very interesting topic you know. Since this place is not an official representation of SE, you have to always take what you see here with a very heavy pinch of salt. The only real info as to what the company is portraying is what comes from its official talks and seminars. Therefore inference from this place should never be taken seriously unless quoted by a reliable or official source. Even than, that is subject to scrutiny as it may be outdated.<br><br>I applaud too the banning of SE agents who don't think before they post. If i appear to be one too, feel free to ban me too, fireice ma'am ^^<br><br>Damage is done everywhere you know. Even my grandpa hurls constant abuse at EPL when among his friends (due to losing bets) and there's no end of criticism at practically every company that exists. There's a good and bad side to everything. But laurence, if anti-laurence clubs sprang up in a dozen forums, would you go and try explaining yourself to all of them, or would you simply stick to what you know is right and let everything clear up when enough evidence them being mistaken emerges? SE knows it has a string of past failures to answer up for, and therefore is spending its resources to keep expanding its profile instead of snapping back. Proof in eventual action, eventual because nothing can be proven overnight. You have to give them some time. Just like this project is relatively new, the company also has to research and spend time to develop ways to try and curb the wanton behaviour of some of its more dubious members while making sure the project is not going to collaspe this time. Yes its a cold harsh world, but no one said it was going to be an easy ride in the first place.<br><br>By the way, even if the company was doing something to arrest the situation, there's always the possibility that forumers here are not aware about it because of the "exchange of information" here, or rather the lack of it.<br><br>I never said flaming was a sales skill. Flaming comes from the lack of control of emotions and rational thought, which everyone is capable of.<br><br>And for hopefully the last time, there is no investment scheme in SE. If there was, MAS would have come down on the management's throats by now. If anyone wants a clarification of this, feel free to pm me.<br><br>From your inference, I can conclude that there are many, many people who have 'blighted' sales skills because there are too many uneducated salespeople in many, many industries without proper training. I, for one, will not hesitate to prove my income when my income tax comes out in Oct (this is my first year filing tax). Unless there's a horde of people baying for my unaudited preliminary statement of tax right now, of course. ^^<br><br>And my fellow networkers whom have earned significant income have all filed our taxes too. You should have seen those of us new to it scramble on Apr 15 only to find out that it had been extended for e-filing.<br><br>The so called phrases out of mid air, namely 'corporate biz' and 'traditional biz'<br>were mentioned because of your previous statement that all of those involved in this 'pseudo business world' would be pwned if all of us were displaced into a fully corporate setting. Hence my statement that no one here can claim that they are a businessman in a meaningful way. i'm not trying to discard any ideas here unless it is so by my lack of perception.<br><br>Basically i'm still a relative newbie in this industry so i may not be your equal in dissecting facts and analysing them but i hope that my efforts in doing so do not degrade the quality of this discussion too much.

See how the trade of insurance have changed throughout the years.<br><br>With the case for Sunshine Empire and EGA, no point pushing and shoving around verbally. Facts should be shown and facts are facts. They cannot be wrong unless there are concrete evidence. Thus flaming alone will not change those facts.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 1</span><br>NTI has been renamed Sunshine Empire.<br>HBCI has been renamed EGA<br>Thus, both NTI and HBCI should not be reflected under the group of companies under EGA.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 2</span><br>As of the last check, EGA's shareholders are not shareholders in Emcom or SE. Thus the claim of EGA having SE and Emcom as subsidiaries are baseless. How to check? Go ACRA and do an enquiry. Pay $5.20 and you have your answer. Want more information? Pay more and you can see more.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 3</span><br>EGA's paid up capital is $100k. Emcom's paid up is $2m. SE's paid up is $150k. Don't you find it interesting that a company with $100k paid up should be an owner of a $2m paid up company?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact 4</span><br>The marketing plan requires you to at least join as a Bronze Member (BM). If my sources are correct, the value is US$280. With a membership, you can then decide to stay there or upgrade to a partner level. The most common is the GP or Gold Partner costing US$6900. That aside, I was told by a Business Development Manager from SE that I can already enjoy my commission payback even as a BM by getting another BM to join under my wings. Those familiar with the MLM Law in SG would be able to detect what is wrong.<br><br>Do make your own judgement even when you read the points I made. If you feel that I may not be making right statements, please feel free to drop by their company to ask for yourself. Nothing beats finding out the information yourself.<br><br>Please note that I am not advocating that the business is good/legitimate/scam/etc. I made my own judgement call with information that I have found. You should make your own judgement. Do a due diligence check. Imagine if you are going to start a business, a businessman would do as much checks on the industry and stuff before deciding on his next step. Same goes for MLM.</div></blockquote>Till date, no one is explaining or trying to rebutt. Instead, they are harping on various issues that may be subjective.<br><br>For Fact 4, I would need to clarify. US$150 as BM + US$25 for registration fee. Do explain the facts that I find strange. Why must SE work in such a manner? How will the public react knowing of such uncommon practices?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter what outsiders perception of how the company handles its affairs, things will still go on.<br><br>1 group will say, i'm not interested in what your company problems are. I just want to see how your company reacts and deals with them.<br><br>The other group will say, i'm not interested in anything else you talk about your company, as long as what i'm promised is given to me.<br><br>Company will still grow that way.<br><br>Different people have different ideas, company's idea as what it has shown so far is to find ways and means to conform to as acceptable a way as possible for everybody. However it cannot cater to every outsider's needs vis Ã  vis. Answers, solutions and results don't just show up right after a feedback. So no matter whether any group of dissidents care to give a company time to prove itself, neither can the company care too much to ensure that every single person sees answers to their liking. Why have people joined SE and are still joining it? That is because signing up is within their level of acceptance as they accepted what the company has shown them so far.<br><br>I'm not a designated company relations spokesman, i cannot directly answer u company's Solution A to Question A, Solution B to Question B. All i have been saying, however philosophical it sounds, is simply the company's direction for the past months. That is what i can offer right here. If answer's not accepted, then i apologise for what you perceive to be rambling. A company can have its pros and cons. It might have an excellent product but a poor system, or an excellent system but poor management. But that does not necessarily mean the company sales will slow down or that it does not have the right to carry on.<br><br>Second, if you're talking about inputting resources to gain something, what about paying $1 for a bar of KitKat? If retail is also an investment scheme, then there's no need for further discussion for this part of the topic.<br><br>Wireless project is a CAPITAL investment by the company, not consumers. Simply because when anyone forks out $ and signs the form in SE, they receive products and services in return. That is consumption. A direct investment would be something in which you pay the money and get nothing but returns. Unless a gimmick is thrown in, of course. Singtel has Red Rewards, Shell has Escape Points, these are all extra benefits, just like SE's Customer Reward Programmes and Customer Loyalty Programmes.<br><br>Regarding proof of income, i'll be quartered by my colleagues if i ask them all to give me a copy of their income taxes when it comes out, since they will berate me for bothering to discourse on company issues with a forum group instead of doing more constructive activities directly beneficial to my network's expansion. As an individual, i will say again that i can only show my income tax once its out this year. I haven't even mentioned my own income anyway.<br><br>Peace out..<br><br>p.s. mhcampboy &gt;&gt; Join SE? You can pm christopher_rf or me, although it sounds a bit incredulous that someone in this forum would say something like this.<br><br>p.p.s.

From business sense, distributor has the duty to provide evidence for marketing something they have an interest in. On personal and common sense, you must be ready to be challenged everytime you boast about something.<br><br>Either this, or you simply could end this debate with "I admit that I can boast anything i like, i do not expect to be questioned or challenged, all must listen to me". Then i got nothing to say<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Besides, although i must applaud you for being more civil than your counterparts, I cannot say the same for your points. Just this post and the last post of yours alone, there is an evasion of issues.<br><br>This post you talk about people need not expose their personal details online, which is contradicting what i have been saying all along. Never mind, But your last post, which i have challenged, you asked whether its my rule on which what i talked about earlier,ie, how and to what extent company and distributors must reveal their income and the period and so on.<br><br>I already laid the answers, and instead of gunning this point, you go talk about posting personal details online. You have been doing it in this style all along and my point is you should not evade issue before going to the next one. Dont look like a person drowning in the sea and willing to grab anything to keep afloat. Am i expecting a different issue the next post?<br><br></div>
