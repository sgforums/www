            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Procter:</div><div class="quote_body">No matter what outsiders perception of how the company handles its affairs, things will still go on.<br><br>1 group will say, i'm not interested in what your company problems are. I just want to see how your company reacts and deals with them.<br><br>The other group will say, i'm not interested in anything else you talk about your company, as long as what i'm promised is given to me.<br><br>Company will still grow that way.<br><br>Different people have different ideas, company's idea as what it has shown so far is to find ways and means to conform to as acceptable a way as possible for everybody. However it cannot cater to every outsider's needs vis Ã  vis. Answers, solutions and results don't just show up right after a feedback. So no matter whether any group of dissidents care to give a company time to prove itself, neither can the company care too much to ensure that every single person sees answers to their liking. Why have people joined SE and are still joining it? That is because signing up is within their level of acceptance as they accepted what the company has shown them so far.<br><br>I'm not a designated company relations spokesman, i cannot directly answer u company's Solution A to Question A, Solution B to Question B. All i have been saying, however philosophical it sounds, is simply the company's direction for the past months. That is what i can offer right here. If answer's not accepted, then i apologise for what you perceive to be rambling. A company can have its pros and cons. It might have an excellent product but a poor system, or an excellent system but poor management. But that does not necessarily mean the company sales will slow down or that it does not have the right to carry on.<br><br>Second, if you're talking about inputting resources to gain something, what about paying $1 for a bar of KitKat? If retail is also an investment scheme, then there's no need for further discussion for this part of the topic.<br><br>Wireless project is a CAPITAL investment by the company, not consumers. Simply because when anyone forks out $ and signs the form in SE, they receive products and services in return. That is consumption. A direct investment would be something in which you pay the money and get nothing but returns. Unless a gimmick is thrown in, of course. Singtel has Red Rewards, Shell has Escape Points, these are all extra benefits, just like SE's Customer Reward Programmes and Customer Loyalty Programmes.<br><br>Regarding proof of income, i'll be quartered by my colleagues if i ask them all to give me a copy of their income taxes when it comes out, since they will berate me for bothering to discourse on company issues with a forum group instead of doing more constructive activities directly beneficial to my network's expansion. As an individual, i will say again that i can only show my income tax once its out this year. I haven't even mentioned my own income anyway.<br><br>Peace out..<br><br>p.s. mhcampboy &gt;&gt; Join SE? You can pm christopher_rf or me, although it sounds a bit incredulous that someone in this forum would say something like this.<br><br>p.p.s. Herzog_Zwei &gt;&gt; i know. i love bananas too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>You are confusing me. If at the end of the day you still think its not plausible to convince me, or rather the group as you say, and that admit you couldnt do much to answer the questions, you are not spokesman, in fact you are not direct representative of the company, then my question here is, what is the purpose you posting here, be challenged, and in the end going in circle without purpose?<br><br>As for your definition of investment, you are confusing yourself. EMCOM has a wireless project in Taiwan, do Singaporean investors receive wireless network from a project infrastructure built in Taiwan, therefore now they are called consumers? Ridiculous right? And we know they are not anyway. And why you can talk about monetary income of your uplines, why SE investors can come boast about their returns, and at the same time, you talk about Shell Points which is a reward for using their services and is non monetary in nature? Refer to past posts by your own agents, where they even talk about investors receiving a cut of the profits.<br><br>Clearly, you are confused between capital investments and dividends, and rewards points given to consumers for using their services.<br><br>As for your last point, unless you are justifying your uplines income or marketing your company's investment schemes online, you have no reason of course to ask your uplines for their own personal income tax statement and bringing it into the forum. Therefore, since you are not doing it, i believe you have no reason or basis to say that SE top distributors earn a lot.<br><br></div>

So your purpose in quoting and reply my posts, explaining about your company's actions, about how your company management cannot be so perfect etc etc is.....? You are humouring me right?<br><br>2. Which is also about defending your company's position...see point 1<br><br>3. Which you are not stopped from commenting, but challenged and asked why...<br><br>4. I cant believe how many times your company want to change the scheme..first its an investment into the wireless project in Taiwan, even stated on company website, then now its mail points and rewards for services used. And mail points generate returns in monetary terms?<br><br>Clearly, you are confusing yourself, or the rest of us here. How can earning rewards points and earning large income be put into the same sentence? Mean actually no one in SE is earning significant amount of income at all? Its non existent? So why agents are so uptight? Since its like a Pepsi lover flaming  Coke, but why should people who drink Coke really cares? Since they only pay Coke and get their drinks thats all, get a bit of rewards, but they are not getting income from Coke, so they need not care if Pepsi lovers are flaming Coke.<br><br>5. Again, monetary income...need i say more?<br><br>6. Actually it wont be on ad hominem basis if you and your fellow agents could simply answer the questions and issues directly and clearly. I am very disatisified with the way you answer about investment scheme, if a little on excess i would say you are playing around with words.<br><br>Again, i see no point saying its on ad hominem basis just because your top distributors refuse to 'share' proof of their earnings. A very twisted argument to put forward, dont you think? So now your top distributors are god and anyone who say anything else are putting forth ad hominem arguments? Dont make me say 'sheesh' please.</div>
