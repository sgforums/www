How low can you get?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>From this post alone there are so many contradictory points. You guys were guaranteed payments every mth, so what makes you different from Swisscash who promise 10%?<br><br>Secondly, if its merely buying products and getting rebates, why the talk of getting rich, getting income and having BMWs and Mercs? This is one of the contradictory point which was raised numerous times and which were not refuted. Instead, people have to resort to personal attacks to avoid this issue.<br><br>In short, Sunshine Empire is not a place to get rich.

This model only stands to benefit them, not you, the "investors" per se.<br><br>Yes, they have products in their Emall and claimed that "investors" join as merchants and get e-points to purchase the products in the Emall. The returns you get every month is so called the loyalty rebates. <strong>BUT</strong> they are only paying out the rebates faithfully because they know that to get more money for expansion (and to legalise their business), the payouts have to be there to attract ignorant and insatiable investors. One word, using <strong>GREED</strong>.<br><br>Let me tell you what is likely to happen. In the near future, they will stop paying cash returns. They will then claimed that nothing was guaranteed at the beginning. They will say that this was not an investment, the company hence has no obligations towards the merchants. They will say that whatever the independent distributors promised were not representative of the company. In other words, at the end of the day, the "investors" will be left with no cash....only e-points which they can use to purchase expensive and unwanted MLM products (from SE's previous failed businesses).<br></div>
