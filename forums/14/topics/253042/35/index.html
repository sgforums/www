Its just sad that you don't have good comebacks and always need the_fallen dude to come back you groundless theory up.<br><br>If ever SE is a scam it is because of how independent distributors of the Co. portray SE. I've recently came across a post where a 16 year old boy paid 300+ and thinking money can flow in easily, and did not comprehend a single thing about the company, it is the representative's fault at not explaining in details and raising such a confusion.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the_fallen:</div><div class="quote_body">Just a word of Advice.<br><br>To stand in and Gain the most advantage out of this service and pay less for it's service, look at it from customers' point of view.</div></blockquote>SE's Prime packages are actually rising from time to time. While the rebates are getting lesser. Emcall was a huge success there's tons of people using this service right now and more in the future.<br><br>To sum it up, the biggest worries by people are that SE's rebates is too fantastic and impossible, please think logically and in a business sense, if SE doesn't have such an attractive package who will forge such a strong bond with them. And do you think Emcom/Emall have a chance to fight the big guns that are already in the industry, think about it.<br><br>Ps. These are my 2cents, I'm only 16 if i may offend or say stuff that you might not agree please be kind and ever-forgiving!<br><br></div>

When I read JP's interview, I thought he was on drugs or something. Because the whole issue of the article is about SE breaking some financial regulations, and there he go yakking about participants calling him father and claiming that his company is worth $300 million USD. Huh? He doesnt even address anything at all.<br><br>Same for you, learn to address everyone's issues and questions directly and to the point. No point resorting to personal attacks or just come here attacking this nick by the name of 'laurence82'<br><br>i am not sure if SE agents are desperate or something, but grasping at straws wont help anything.<br><br></div>
