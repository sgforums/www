From magnanimity in wanting to share wealth to chasing people for their money, what is this world coming to.<br><br>It's really so sad when the top people continually change their approach and the rest blindly follow their lead and believe every single rubbish thrown at them. From the potentially successful Taichung project, the company is suddenly shifting it's focus to Emcom and Emcall, saying that it would enable it to be listed in HK by the end of the year. I wonder if they mean in the HKSE or commercial affairs blacklist.<br><br>From their official forum:<br><br>"I understand from the recent meeting that Mr. James Phang wants us to get back our returns in a shortest time possible, so this EmCall will enable EMCOM to be listed in HK faster rather than to wait for Taichung, Jan 2008 and Taipei, sometime 2009 to be ready and generate handsome profit for us."<br><br>And we hear the GPs are paying USD66 per month (or deducted from their rebate) for Emcall services. Why is it that no one in SE realise they're really in fact paying for this callback service, this service which was already started by a few companies but not popular with Sporeans? On top of that they've already parted with 11k, boo hoo hoo.<br><br>Instead, they're showered with idealistic and ridiculous "rhetoric" like this:<br><br>"So, if you ask me, should I look at $12000 being deducted $66 monthly for 4 years or it is the beginning of Loyalty Program payment of $60000, I rather choose to look forward to the payment of Loyalty Program and besides its more money involved for us."<br><br>Anyway, Emcall is hopeless, the quality is poor and calls keep getting disconnected or disrupted. I know because two of my friends keep trying to show it off to me, though very much in vain often times. SingTel ain't dumb, and for once, I'm so glad we've got the real people looking out for us and stopping these scam buggers.<br><br>Oh, and when my friend tried to ask her upline about the complaints and open doubts that were aired on 95.8FM sometime ago, they (SE) told her it's a stunt pulled by one of their rivals who is "doing something very similar". HAHA. Talk about evasion man, this sunshine empire sure is dodgy even to their own members.</div></blockquote>True, there were numerous third party providers like these, but somehow they do not have the infrastructure the local telecoms have, putting the price and quality in doubt. Especially the price, when I see packages being introduced at 12k, you got to wonder why are people paying hefty sums when you could be pay under $50 $100 bucks monthly for your own bills from local telecoms.<br><br>Then come the issue of rewards points, which doesnt make more sense, and your point regarding incentives to earn. They seem to shift between the lines of earning and purchasing.<br><br>As for putting up a conspiracy theory that a rival firm did it, I am not surprised SE agent would say such things<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Unfortunately, SE has some whistle blowers *cough*initials c.y*cough* around and are saying Taichung is suffering, which really explains the recent abrupt push of EmCall to the fore.<br><br>People put their money in because they believed (what shouldn't be believed) that SE was going to earn big time from Taichung. Ironically, the top members <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> earning off their gimmick, feeding off the greed of the people.<br><br>If you think about it then, SE and Emcom are nothing but a lowly callback-service company with a big story and a big lie.<br><br>Oh and an email just in, just in case some SE agents got their facts wrong:<br><br>"The EmCom is a private corporation , they donÂ’t have any partnership with Taichung City government. Regarding the city governmentÂ’s plan on building a wireless internet network, it is a part of the Â“Mobile Taiwan Application Promotional PlanÂ” proposed by the Industrial Development Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs. This government initiated project has been handled by Asia Pacific Telecom Group(APTG). After contacting APTG &amp; Emcom(http://www.emcomgroup.net/),we understand that Emcom is not involved in the government funded M-Taichung project.If you have any further question, please do not feel hesitate to contact us. Best regards Taichung City Government".<br><br>Either EmCom is not involved in Taichung City or they are, but only in some sad suburban part of Taichung. If that's the case, how is the money going to roll in, as they tell the people rushing to Toa Payoh HDB Hub all the time?</div>

Regarding the city governmentÂ’s plan on building a wireless internet network, it is a part of the Â“Mobile Taiwan Application Promotional PlanÂ” proposed by the Industrial Development Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs. This government initiated project has been handled by Asia Pacific Telecom Group(APTG). After contacting APTG &amp; Emcom(http://www.emcomgroup.net/),we understand that Emcom is not involved in the government funded M-Taichung project.If you have any further question, please do not feel hesitate to contact us. Best regards Taichung City Government".<br><br>Either EmCom is not involved in Taichung City or they are, but only in some sad suburban part of Taichung. If that's the case, how is the money going to roll in, as they tell the people rushing to Toa Payoh HDB Hub all the time?</div></blockquote>This Emcom, issit the Emcom in Taiwan, or the so called subsidiary of Sunshine Empire which someone posted some time ago?<br><br>And if none of these entities are involved in the Taichung Project, this means all along its a hoax?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
