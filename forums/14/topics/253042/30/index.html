She always claimed that she was only trying to help the poor, but in her trial it was proven that she had received the equivalent of 85 million Euro.<br><br>2) In autumn of 1994, the European Kings Club collapsed, causing a damage of about $1.1 billion. This scam was led by Damara Bertges and Hans GÃ¼nther Spachtholz. In the Swiss cantons Uri and Glarus about every tenth adult invested into the EKC. The scam involved buying "letters" valued at 1,400 francs that entitled buyers to receive 12 monthly payments of 200 francs. The organisation was based in Gelnhausen, Germany.<br><br>3) In May 1995, Pennsylvania's attorney general moved to freeze the assets of the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy and its chairman, John G. Bennett, Jr. The organization had raised over $500 million from 1,100 donors. Participants, including the Red Cross, had believed they were participating in a matching-gifts program through New Era but, in fact it was simply a Ponzi scheme. Losses amounted to $135 million.<br><br>4) In early 1996, the SEC filed a civil action against Bennett Funding Group, its chief financial officer, Patrick R. Bennett, and other companies Bennett controlled, in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme. The companies fraudulently raised hundreds of millions of dollars, purportedly to purchase assignments of equipment leases and promissory notes.<br><br>5) In 1997 the government of Albania officially endorsed a series of pyramid investment funds. When the inevitable end came, the people of Albania, who had lost $1.2 billion, took their protest to the streets in a revolt that toppled the government.<br><br>6) In 2000, a Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Scientology minister Reed Slatkin came unraveled when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulators became aware that Slatkin was not a licensed investment adviser. Slatkin had raised some $600 million from over 500 wealthy investors, mostly Hollywood celebrities.<br><br>7) In December 2005, in Los Angeles, California, Larry Toshio Osaki, who ran a gigantic Ponzi scheme and continued to offer bogus investments in accounts receivable "factoring" after being ordered to stop by a federal judge, was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison. In addition to the prison term, Judge Stephen V. Wilson ordered Osaki to pay more than $145 million in restitution to victims.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> In May 2006, James Paul Lewis, Jr. was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for running a $311 million Ponzi scheme over a 20-year time period.

SwissCash offered a returns of up to 300% within a 15-month investment period. Currently, this HYIP investment is offered to citizens of Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I am a merchant from SE and i wanna share some thougts in this forum. Just some self opinions of mine.<br><br>-After reading throught all the post made by you guys, its absolutely frustrated that you all keep redirecting to others topic rather than the initial topic of the forum. For you guys info, i am a newbie in SE and had just joined for few weeks. But after going throught these few weeks, i found there's some both positive and negative points that should brought out...<br><br>Let started with the negative first :<br>1)SE is a company that runned by JP under a MLM method. Firstly i being appoarched, its concentrated on the Taiwan wireless projects and all the presenters will use this only point to attract the people to join in. But recently this was totally shifted to another project called eMall and this damn old idea can make money?I can't say no, but a bit hard. Why they abundance the wireless project since its much attrative than the online shopping mall? This shown SE don't have a ultimate aim and had already made a raise in doubt.<br><br>2)The people inside SE are bad story tellers. Their interacting skill is low class. As a merchant, i attend some of the grouping and classes that held by my upline. During the grouping, we do planned how to market our GP's plan more efficienctly. We are taught to counter a question that raise by the propesct with another question, yes, they are avoiding giving a clear explanation. For the classes or seminar, i never attend any from JP one but throught those classes which held by his management or development team, the presentation is su*ks!!!!Even me can think of a better way to present a update to all the member.<br><br>3)They cover all the negative stories bout' the SE from us. Whenever you enquire  bout' the rumors, the upline or you all called higher earners will say its a fake story meanwhile the truth is they keep avoiding all this issues.(as usual)<br><br>4)EmCall is a failure, bad quality of calls makes some of my clients stop using it and change back to normal telephone service. Hopes its getting better soon or Emcall will eventually dissappeared.<br><br>For the good side:<br>1)Undoubtly, SE can let you earn money.(up till this moment) Thats the only reason i join SE. The plan they offer is too good to refused, by just asking people around you to share this plan you can earn a massive amount of incomes. Who don't want money, so do i. Thanks SE for the extra incomes.May be you all out there will doubt the cheque that the member of SE shown you, but i experiencing it myself, its truth money which you can actually withdraw it anytime you want or directly bank in to your saving account.<br><br>2)Another fact that SE is growing in a speedy rate because the top-earners have the good ability to organise a group to fight along with them. Try to imagine, when we known that there's propects in Indonesia and we will straight away flied over for the meeting, updates each other instantly when new updates bout' company is announced...such a good organisation, is a main fact that they can earn big bucks in short time.<br><br>Lately, its said that CAD already started their investigation on EGA. I just wanna know who out here can confirm me its this a truth or just a rumor? Cause i know the answer that i can get from the prople inside SE, therefore i need a point of view from different perspective.<br><br>I am not gonna post anymore, i am just waiting for the answer from those who know, i don't want to wast this server space like you guys by just posting a  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> icon...<br><br>Looking forward for the reply.</div>
