If i remember it, onli moderater are able to trace the IP address of people who post. So are you going to ban all the people who is from SE? If what i say is true den the forums is useless already as there is not P&amp;C things.<br><br>Im a outsider and just want to post a view of my in this MLM issue.<br>I find it stupid for people keep on telling others that this cant make it that a scam of SE is cheating. Since 4 yrs ago i saw this NTI topic, people been saying its a scam and should make police report. But till now the company still around, and worse still, they are getting bigger and richer.<br><br>And also somethings i find it strange, when many people saying SE is a scam, den y do HDB hub still rent the place to them. So are you people trying to say that the government is trying to support scam company. Human always like to believe the media and so call radio. but are they really stating the true or are they just stating what others thinking. And the media keep on reporting accident case and cheating case, i wonder why they didnt report success case. Isnt it obvious that they are reporting somethings which attact people to watch or listen to, and how true can it be.<br></div>

If what i say is true den the forums is useless already as there is not P&amp;C things.<br><br>Im a outsider and just want to post a view of my in this MLM issue.<br>I find it stupid for people keep on telling others that this cant make it that a scam of SE is cheating. Since 4 yrs ago i saw this NTI topic, people been saying its a scam and should make police report. But till now the company still around, and worse still, they are getting bigger and richer.<br><br>And also somethings i find it strange, when many people saying SE is a scam, den y do HDB hub still rent the place to them.
