You are right to say that he is out to warn people. But do you realize that he might be also destroying other peoples' dreams, and most importantly, the economy of singapore?<br><br>If there is any evidence against any company, and I mean concrete evidence and not by personal experience, then i think he have the right to do so.<br><br>We muz know that different people will react differently in a same given situation. I foresee that whatever you are saying here in this forum is also an insult to the singapore police force. I see people writing letters to the authorities without concrete evidence......What has this world become?<br><br>Can you guys gather some concrete evidence, that ca be used in court before flamming anyone, or any mlm company down here. I believe that you all are matured enough to use your brainy juice. (I thought most of the users here are graduates, eg: Lawrence82). Pls for god sake and for the whole world's sake. Do something that will be productive to the society. Don't waste the $$$ that you spent on your certificates and of course pls do not pollute humanity with the things that you want.<br><br>I know Lawrence82's intention. I have PM him before. Those who wants to know, pls PM me.<br><br>TY<br><br></div></blockquote>I am a pet to no one. I have my own train of thoughts. I am a puppet to none. I want to clarify this point once and for all. Hope there are no questions regarding this point.<br><br>Why do you think Laurence is destroying other people's dreams? Don't people have brains to think, to process whatever information they gather on their own? If whatever Laurence said is enough to cripple an entire organisation, does that not set whatever alarm bells that is in your head ringing? Why should a powerful legitimate organisation fear a tiny individual?<br><br>Can you please ask yourself why MLM has garnered a bad name? Is it because of Laurence? Is it because of me? The answer is a resounding NO! Yes I agree that not all MLM companies are bad, but what wrong have we done to share our personal experience with our old companies? Do we want others to fall into the same pithole?<br><br>WOULD YOU BE RESPONSIBLE IF OTHERS FALL INTO THE SAME PITHOLE? WILL YOU?<br><br>I know I have done my part to inform... to warn others of what we did wrong. It is up to you, the reader to decide.<br><br>Again I repeat. I am not a freaking pet... and neither should you be a puppet of the MLM industry.</div>
