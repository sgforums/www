(Just because all the Mentors and Products are provided for you, doesn't give us the reasons to start a business with no knowledge.)<br><br>Just because it's cheap, with no overheads, that's the reason why people often FORGET That MLM is also a Business because it's a 1-time investment.<br>If today you own a retail store, direct selling, no customers what would you do?<br>Go consult the mentors and learn to increase your sales because businessman have OVERHEADS to clear!!<br><br>MLM people DON'T HAVE IT.<br>It's a Privilege but end up being ABUSED.<br><br>If you pay $100,000 into a retail store?<br>Will you anyhow do the business or will you follow the steps and try to break even asap. Take in mind, after the investment, you liabilites are always increase, unless you can have a quota and gain profit, if not ur invest is always increasing.<br><br>To succeed, there's no easy way to  it. Just follow and learn.<br><br><strong>Scenerio 2:</strong><br><br>You just start your business, with all the contracts and pre-ordering all ready, but you have yet to learn, thus you go for lessons, learn and invite somebody to be your mentor as well as to help you with the operations as they know how it's done.<br><br>So after you have learn the theory, together with your mentor or business partner, than you both start the business, and at this time, you are on OJT, learning the practical knowledge and skills not taught in books.<br><br>Once you get the hang of it, than you took over, the customers like your food and service, they refer more customers to you.<br><br>At the end of the day, it's a WIN-WIN Situation.<br><br>Which is better?<br><br>Scenerio 1 or 2?<br><br>But ask yourself, are you really making good use of this Privilege of 1-Time investment business or are you Abusing it?<br><br>UNLESS you find the right mentor, right company and right upline. You can't learn the real solid foundation which I've learnt from different channels, not just from MLM industry, but I also learn by reading, watching and observing.<br><br>In mlm, nothing is more important than finding a good upline which can spend time to guide you and share what they know with you.<br><br>General Mistake when people join MLM companies is that they see the company is good, the products are good (I'm saying about those Proper Legal Companies) but when they join, they can't get any form of support in learning, and thus they will not improve, end up making the same mistakes over and over again.<br><br><strong>Impt Pointers</strong><br><br>1) Right Upline who will commit their time to share what they know with you, no point joining a Leader who's earning a lot, but they have no time to share their knowledge with you<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: darkblue;">(Before you join how to identify such good uplines/mentor/business partner)</span></span><br><br>2) Right Products<br><br>3) Right company<br><br>This is a very simple example: For more details on how to know if everything is good, I'll explain to those people who are keen PERSONALLY - (advance knowledge)[/b]</blockquote>Long reply.. some part i agreed, but not all relevant.</div>
