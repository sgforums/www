            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>I can tell you guys that some of them have no problems showing you their ''pay slip''. I've seen people with commissions in the five figure region before. It's good money.<br><br>But however, I also realised that many of them will show you the commission that they received (or more accurately, rebates) from the company after they paid a lump sum. Most of this income (rebates) are only one time affairs, with many of them unable to get back the amount they actually invested in.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">eg. Mr Happy invested $50k and gets back $15k in ''commissions/rebate" the following month for the amount he invested.</span><br><br>Of course I am not saying that NTI, EGA and SE are the same, but I just wish to point this out to those who are exploring MLM and wishes to join this dynamic industry.<br><br>Do know what to ask when choosing a company to join, do your research thoroughly and it can save you from sleepless nights and heartbreaks...</div>

I am sure the top guys do earn alot, but the important thing is how this scheme can last? Ponzi schemes last around 3-5 years at the most.<br><br>If you want, just join and get the monthly comms, just don't get your relatives and friends to plonk down their life-savings. Once trust is lost you can never get it back.<br><br>PS: A bank robber can have loads of money too, but are you sure you want to go down that path?</div>
