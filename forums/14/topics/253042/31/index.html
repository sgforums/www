Upon completion, Emcom and the party acting in concert will own approximately 73.85% of the enlarged issued share capital of China Photar.<br><br>Emcom will offer to buy the shares of China Photar it does not already own at $0.017 apiece and the convertible note at a price of $51,644 per $500,000 in the principal amount of the convertible note. <span style="color: red;">Emcom is owned by three merchants from Singapore.</span><br><br>Trading in the shares of China Photar is resumed today.<br><br>The price of $0.017 for each share represents a discount of approximately 94.24% to the closing price of $0.295 on the last trading day. Proceeds from the share sale to Emcom shall be applied as to $8 million for repaying of shareholder's loan and upon which Chen Jijin, a substantial shareholder shall duly execute a deed of release for full discharge of the shareholder's loan. About $20.4 million from the proceeds will be used for redemption of the convertible note and the remaining balance of approximately $2.2 million will be used for general working capital.<br><br>Pursuant to the subscription agreement, 1.62 billion China Photar shares will be subscribed by Emcom, and 180 million China Photar shares will be subscribed by Smart Step, representing approximately 66.46% and 7.39% respectively of the enlarged issued share capital of China Photar.<br><br>Upon completion, the shareholding of Modern China Holdings Limited (MCH) which is held by Chen Jijin in China Photar, will be diluted from 54.39% to 14.22%. In order to restore the minimum public float requirement, Emcom and the party acting in concert will place 1.319 billion shares after completion, adding the full conversion of the convertible notes, the shareholding of Emcom, Smart Step and parties acting in concert with them will be 61.45%, while shareholding of MCH is 13.55%.<br><br>[b]Emcom is beneficially owned as to 75% by Phang Wah, 15% by Yong Wai-hong and 10% by Lee Ping-yeow, all citizens of Singapore. </strong>They altogether have been actively engaged in the development of telecommunication infrastructure and telecommunication services in the Asia Pacific region.<br><br>Smart Step is an investment holding company which is solely and beneficially owned by Lim Yi-shenn, a citizen of Singapore. Lim has more than 10 years of banking and corporate experience<br>[/b]</blockquote>You should refer to NYSE and see their normal stocks trading price..<br>it's a minimum of $0.20-$0.30 per piece of share and the majority of those shares are priced at $0.50 per share if not over a $1 etc...<br><br>compare it to that share with you said..$0.017..<br>Trust worthy or not?<br>What type of company will offer the shares at such a LOW PRICE??<br><br>Anyway..since you're neither an investor nor an independent distributor than I shall not elaborate further..<br><br>if you want to know more about shares, bonds, mutal funds, options, unit trusts etc..go seek a Financial Planner/Advisor with License on Proper Investments..<br><br>Btw: To those investors in this company..It's sad to read that Emcom only belongs to 3 peson..<br><br>So what did i say in the passed actually was true, and thanks for your posting..it proved what I said is true ...when people invest, they are just using their (people's) money to increase their (shareholders') own wealth.. and neither do they own any shares of emcom nor can they explain why they should invest...<br><br>why invest when you don't own any share of the project?<br><br>is that smart investment or rather should i say blind investment just for greed?<br><br>you be your own judge..<br><br>don't need to answer to me, answer it to yourself..</div>
