            <div class='col-md body'>well.. whoever who's doing the business will be dumb enough to admit, but rather try to smoke it up and tell people that they are doing the right thing. Moreover, in most NETWORK MARKETING, only those people on top earn, for eg, a manager incharge of several downlines. Im sure the manager himself knows that only he will be able to earn much more, however he still encourages his downlines to recruit more people and to give them false hope/drive. Perhaps MLM is legalised, but what they are doing is unethical!</div>

Some MLMs are actually quite respectable.<br><br>Most of the people who are in Ponzi Schemes will not admit that it is one, neither will they admit to the similarities. They are actually afraid that it is the truth and that they will not be able to recruit new investors once people get wind of things.<br><br>Once that happen, you can expect the Ponzi scheme to collapse spectacularly... and fast too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's funny how "christopher" consistently encourages "emcom" to "chiong sales". From magnanimity in wanting to share wealth to chasing people for their money, what is this world coming to.<br><br>It's really so sad when the top people continually change their approach and the rest blindly follow their lead and believe every single rubbish thrown at them. From the potentially successful Taichung project, the company is suddenly shifting it's focus to Emcom and Emcall, saying that it would enable it to be listed in HK by the end of the year. I wonder if they mean in the HKSE or commercial affairs blacklist.<br><br>From their official forum:<br><br>"I understand from the recent meeting that Mr. James Phang wants us to get back our returns in a shortest time possible, so this EmCall will enable EMCOM to be listed in HK faster rather than to wait for Taichung, Jan 2008 and Taipei, sometime 2009 to be ready and generate handsome profit for us."<br><br>And we hear the GPs are paying USD66 per month (or deducted from their rebate) for Emcall services. Why is it that no one in SE realise they're really in fact paying for this callback service, this service which was already started by a few companies but not popular with Sporeans? On top of that they've already parted with 11k, boo hoo hoo.<br><br>Instead, they're showered with idealistic and ridiculous "rhetoric" like this:<br><br>"So, if you ask me, should I look at $12000 being deducted $66 monthly for 4 years or it is the beginning of Loyalty Program payment of $60000, I rather choose to look forward to the payment of Loyalty Program and besides its more money involved for us."<br><br>Anyway, Emcall is hopeless, the quality is poor and calls keep getting disconnected or disrupted. I know because two of my friends keep trying to show it off to me, though very much in vain often times. SingTel ain't dumb, and for once, I'm so glad we've got the real people looking out for us and stopping these scam buggers.<br><br>Oh, and when my friend tried to ask her upline about the complaints and open doubts that were aired on 95.8FM sometime ago, they (SE) told her it's a stunt pulled by one of their rivals who is "doing something very similar". HAHA. Talk about evasion man, this sunshine empire sure is dodgy even to their own members.</div>
