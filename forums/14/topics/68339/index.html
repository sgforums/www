Firstly l must introduce myself, my name is MR  FRANK SMITH from ANGOLA, in the southern region of AFRICA. I am 30 years old, I am the eldest son of the UNITA REBEL LEADER MR JONAS MALHEIRO SMITH who was ambushed and killed on 22nd February 2002 by GOVERNMENT TROOPS OF MPLA.  I am presently residing in SOUTH AFRICA with my widowed mother MRS ELIZABETH SMITH, my WIFE and my 4year old son.<br><br>I got your address from the CAPE TOWN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY here in SOUTH AFRICA. On behalf of my widowed mother MRS ELIZABETH SMITH, I decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$25.000.000.00 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION  UNITED STATES DOLLARS) which l inherited from my late father into your PERSONAL/COMPANY ACCOUNT.<br><br>In his Â“WILLÂ” he specifically drew my attention to the US$25.000.000.00, which he deposited with a SECURITY/FINANCE COMPANY here in SOUTH AFRICA fully documented on my name. In fact my FATHER said and l quote  (my beloved son, l wish to draw your attention to the US$25.000.000.00 which is deposited with the PRIVATE SECURITY /FINANCE COMPANY IN SOUTH AFRICA. I am very much dedicated and committed to win this war against the ruling Government troops of MPLA, incase of my absence on earth, as a result of death, only you should solicit for assistance for investment purpose).<br><br>From the above you will understand that the lives and future of my family depends entirely on this money, as such l will be grateful if you can assist us. We are now living in SOUTH AFRICA as ASYLUM SEEKERS and the FINANCIAL LAW of SOUTH AFRICA does not permit ASYLUM SEEKERS certain FINANCIAL RIGHTS. In view of this, you can see that I cannot be able to invest this money in SOUTH AFRICA.<br><br>For your effort I am prepared to offer 25% of this total sum, while 5% will be set aside for local and international expenses. Then 70% will be for my family and me for our investment purposes.<br><br>Finally, modalities on how the transfer will be made will be conveyed to you once we have established trust and confidence between ourselves. Please treat this matter as very urgent, contact me on line or email as above.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>MR FRANK SMITH<br><br><strong>Comments from CAD on such schemes:</strong><br><br>African Scams<br><br>The public is advised to be wary of conmen involved in the infamous 'African scams', commonly termed "419" fraud ( named after the relevant section of the Nigerian Criminal Code). The scams involve a number of schemes, all designed to dupe victims into parting with their money. The conmen typically send letters through the postal mail, facsimile or more recently, the Internet, claiming to have acquired or inherited large sums of money, sometimes purporting it to be 'excess government or bank funds.' They seek the victimÂ’s help to supply a foreign bank account number to be used to transfer the 'funds' out of Africa. The victim is promised a huge commission in return. These offers are bogus and the victims are often duped into paying large sums in up-front payments, purportedly as taxes or fees in order to transfer the 'funds.'<br><br>Another ruse used by the conmen is to dupe the victims into believing that blackened US currency notes smuggled out of Africa can be 'washed' and used after treatment by 'special chemicals'. The victims are usually offered large sums of the US currency notes at a huge discount. The catch is that the currency notes are painted black to avoid detection and can only be washed by using 'special chemicals.' The conmen also sometimes conduct demonstrations to 'wash' the notes with the 'special chemicals.' The victims are then duped into paying huge up-front payments purportedly for the purchase of the 'special chemicals.'<br><br>What to do if...<br><br>If you receive a "419" letter or e-mail, do not reply. Be wary when offered such get rich-quick-offers that promise exorbitant returns. Those who receive such offers or wish to pass on the letter to the police, can contact the Duty Officer, Commercial Affairs Department at 63250000 or at 391 New Bridge Road, #06-701 Police Cantonment Complex Block D, Singapore 088762. They can also contact any police station.<br><br>Remember: "If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is the one supposed to be on the first post.<br><br>29 January, 2004<br><br>Dear Beloved friend,<br><br>I am writing this letter to you to request your assistance and co-operation  in addressing the issue facing me at the moment. As you may rightly want to know, I got your contact from our Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry and after reading through our impressive profile, I decided to write you this personal letter.<br><br>There was this foreigner who lived in my country long time ago, his name is Mr. John Creek Schelpert (now deceased). He is from Canada. During his life time in my country, he contracted me as his personal attorney.  It happened that in 1999, Mr. Schelpert made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months valued US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve Million United States Dollars)only with Banquiers Sans Frontieres Togo.<br><br>On maturity, the bank sent a routine notification to Mr. Schelpert forwarding address in Canada but they got no reply. After having sent several reminders to Mr. Schelpert's address without any response, the bank made an inquiry to the Togo Oil Company where Mr. Schelpert is a contract employer and they were informed that Mr. Schelpert and his wife died in a plane crash in America. Since the news of Mr. Schelpert death, the bank had expected some one from Late Mr. Schelpert family to come forward to the bank for collection of the deceased fund: but till this very day, nobody has come forward.<br><br>The problem now is that according to the banking laws and edicts here, any dormant account after (5) years will be frozen and the fund therein forefited to the government treasury. What this meant is that the bank will declare my client's fund unclaimed and hand it over to the government this year. In view of this situation, the bank mandated me to trace my client family so that they come forward to the bank for collection of the deceased fund.<br><br>My enquiries to the American Embassy here in Lome and my contact with different Oversea Search Agencies for over one year now has not produced any positive result. This is as a result that the deceased died without a "WILL" and did not even declare any relation's name in all his official documents with me including the bank deposit papers with the bank.<br><br>To forestall forefiting my client's fund to the government, I am appealing to you to allow me your personal information(your full name and address) so that I go to the bank and inform them that I have been able to locate you (one of my client's relations) so that the bank will hand over to you my client's fund and both of us will share the money on collection for our personal use.<br><br>There is no risk in this transaction since I am acting on the bank instuction. I have all the vital documents of the deceased which I will use to back up my claim in your favor as the deceased next of kin and bonafide beneficiary as required by the bank. The nature of your proffession or your origin is not relevant. What is important is your willingness to cooperate with me.<br><br>If, upon reading this letter you agree to work with me, please send me your full name and address including your telephone and fax numbers so that I proceed to meet the management of the bank for the release of the fund to you. You are also at liberty to commence sift investigation at the bank: Banquiers Sans Frontieres, 2 Commerce Avenue Lome -Togo. Phone: 00 228 26 11 13 or  00 228 222 9468; Account Number: 602 110 5616. You can equal for your reference log in to: http://www.wabao.org/waba/bank_togo.html<br><br>I would like to end this letter with a plea: that we do this business together so that I will be able to collect my client fund to avoid loosing it to Swindlers or forefeiting it to the government. My name is Mr Hamed K. Kojo. I am a lawyer by proffession.<br><br>I will appreciate any advice or opinions you would like to share as we undertake our discussions.
