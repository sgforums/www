              <p>The reason why MLM fail is they dont have enough sales to meet
              those guaranteed obligations, in other words their overwhelming

              <p>I get your point, but what company said that and what product were they promoting. If there wasn't a product, it is a pyramid scam. And did i say i would project such huge profits and guarantee your success?</p>
              <p>The thing is if you don't work at it, would you succeed? If you never study at all for a test then what are your chances at passing it? The stock market is risky, but did the people who lost money in the stock market take the time to study the market and learn how to read the graphs?</p>
              <p>Anyway this post is for people who would want to have the opportunity for personal growth and development.</p>
              <p>P.S. evangel if you are really not convinced of my words, pm your email, i will send you a link to let you understand the industry.</p>
              <p>P.P.S. If you just want to say all this is a scam, get a life and get your facts right before talking. If you want to live your life distrusting everyone in the industry, then your life is pretty much over anyway. Good Bye Good Luck.</p>

              <p><br>i dont get your example.... so you mean the newer/better the product, the cheaper it will be? since you quoted vinyl, tapes, cds, .mp3 files<br><br>the reason why those on shelves dont show you their certificates is because its almost impossible to do so... however you can look at their ingredients... actually mlm goods are more or less not validated by our AVA</p>
