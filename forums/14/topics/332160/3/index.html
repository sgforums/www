              <p>It is very simple... if I post my company here, in a forum full of anti-mlmers, you guys will start bashing my company before you get to know it... or even start spreading false rumors about the company...</p>

              <p>you totally miss the point</p>

              <p>to answer your point, simply, why so scared? even retail salesmen must expect rejections and even sarcastic remarks from clients. if you are not able to face this pressure, if you already scared of bashing, if you come start up hell lots of threads and yet refuse to be upfront about discussing your company, you lost the battle</p>
              <p>you already given bad impression, you have already signalled to the world your company is shadier than ever...so what 1st impression are we talking about here?</p>

              <p>two wrong mindsets here</p>
              <p>a. thinking everyone will defame your company, to be brutally honest, what's makes you think your company is so good and clean that anything the anti MLMers say is tantamount to defamation?</p>

              <p>Rule no. 1 about investment, INVESTIGATE... Risk, legality, turnout etc... I'm not telling you not to invest, but find out what you're investing in and not another Sunshine empire...</p>

              <p>reply to rule 1: Agree. Money in the bank doesn't actually grow, compare the inflation rate and the bank interest given and you will understand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>reply to rule 2: Disagree. Ask me why...Because if you don't risk you won't get much back in return, think of yourself dating, after all the stuff you have done for the other party, they may not fall for you, risk is everywhere, it's what you see with your mind, not your eyes.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think u got me wrong for Rule 2. What I mean is to slow things down whenever u hear any new stuff coming out in the market. Investigate, analyse, decide for yourself what u intend to do after that. A true investor will always reduce their risk exposure to the MINIMUM....</p></div>
