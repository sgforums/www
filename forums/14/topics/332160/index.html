              <p>i would be glad to let more people know about this industry</p>

              <p>my only wish is to let people understand what is it about and know how to identify the scams from the non-scammers</p>
              <p>the difference can be seen from the approach, i'm not pushy.</p>
              <p>the friends of mine who have been introduced to my business have not been condemned by me just because they did not join, i just tell them that its alright that you not join, however we will not talk about this business again, that's all. If you know other mlmers then most likely you will see the difference there.</p>

              <p>I have alot of friend who ask me to join their MLM company but I did not join and yet they are still my friends.</p>
              <p>This a just a Business of thier own or let say is a job of theirs.</p>
              <p>GOVERMENT has already step out to say MLM can do and is not Scamming. But do you all have all this free time to sit infront of the computer and gossip here and there.</p>
              <p>We have our own job to do. just respect ppl occupation.</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>Ah! Now i see a person who is neutral to the industry!! So happy about that.</p>
              <p>But libra, have your friends shown you the compensation model and how it works? Hope you know about it and enlightened the rest.</p>
              <p>Basically i call it a fair system because the more effort you put in, the more money you make, instead of a job, cause in a job, you work twice or thrice as hard but you wont be paid twice or thrice as much and have to work all the way til retirement age, its really sad, in a business(not just network marketing), you put in all the hard work now and reap the benefits later in life.</p>
              <p>Your choice, suffer now enjoy later or enjoy now suffer later. There is 2 sides to a coin, most only see one side, the side of scarcity. :-)</p>

              <p>People are still bruised by scams pretending to be MLM... or they're recruited but unable to perform well as an MLMer...</p>
              <p>Its gonna take some time for people to change their prespective... Just like trying to change the minds of 1/4 of Americans that not all muslims are terrorist... Most likely need a very big event to show contrary or wait for this generation to die out and new generation with an open mind to take over...</p>

              <p>Totally agree with you. that is why I am saying that MLM is not the same as PYRAMID or scam.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>If you ppl really so scare as cheated before, why in the first place never check with MAS (GOV call in ) a place to call in and check about the company is it a MLM or scam.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Now gov is protecting MLM company from all this Scamming so that it will affect them, but yet there is still ppl so stupid never check and still can get cheat of all their old money.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Please do beware.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>There are now company of scam that I know of from my friend that is Last time the Sunshine Empire now know as NIU Lifestyle.</p>
              <p>PLease do not get cheated once again,</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>And also another new company , something like GIO investment going around asking ppl to invest in gold. But no receipt and net payment, only CASH.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Just an advised if still get yourself cheated than don't blame MLM company.</p>

              <p>I like libra's explanation of the pyramid, it is a good point that all organisations are arranged in this way, religions corporate companies and the school system, do all you people get the point. The thing is that, in those systems, the highest up will command the most respect or earn the most, but in networking, it is about who works the hardest, an example would be like this, if i trained you, just one and only you and stop training people, and you go out and train 5 others, who would earn more? The answer would be you, the reason is simple, it's because you put in more hard work than me, you should be rewarded more.</p>
              <p>I feel that a good way of finding out if the comapny is good or bad, firstly look at the people in the company, do they shine with confidence or do they look like a bunch of losers? This is my experience when i nearly joined avita, from the first time i had the feeling like they were losers, but i felt the program was good so i continued, til the last day, the day that they asked me for a 5-figure sum to start-up, had a discussion with my mom and she told me FGN had been investigated by the police or government body or something, after a few months, i met the introducer to that company and he admitted to the investigated but changed the topic straight-away. So the first thing is what is their outlook.</p>
              <p>Next, you may still want to try it out, here i advise you to go in at a price around $500, reason being that if you can't succeed at least the amount of money lost is rather affordable.</p>
              <p>Next up, look at the compensation model, if you have done your homework, you will know about the different compensation plans the companies have to offer, so look through and see which plan fits you best.</p>
              <p>By the way, MY TOPIC IS GOING OUT OF TOPIC. HAHA</p>
              <p>Anybody looking around for a networking meet-up now? Since you have seen so much of information right here on the topic</p>
