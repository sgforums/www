            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>let us forget bout bout watever companies we are all in. I feel that no matter what we are doing, it remains to be seen what is true and what is not.<br><br>At least what I have learnt is to be a better person, esp in character, and not to bash other companies and just simply to share what I personally feel can help others. We should all learn to be caring towards one another, no matter what he/she is doing and to understand his/her business etc oso, whether he/she is doing the same or not.<br><br>By going out and critisizing other companies, esp without any substantial written proven facts, ultimately it points back to oneself and thus pple can see the type of distributors that the company produces. It reflects badly not only on oneself but also towards the company.<br><br>As pple in the same industry, we should all help one another out and support each other as we are all one big family.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
