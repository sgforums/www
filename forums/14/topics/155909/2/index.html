            <div class='col-md body'>you know according to economics theory, it is sometimes worth to pay more for the right products than the wrong products because the middleman adds value to the consumers by providing the extra information, service and probably other knowledge. which explains why products brought at say harvey norman is more expensive than if you buy in over the internet. I'm not going to deny that middleman adds to consumers' satisfaction. Another example is like when you want to sell house, you get an agent, coz he has the connections he can fetch you a higher price.. for you use ebay as middle man coz they can reach a world wide audience... or celebrities/footballers having agents to help them find jobs that gives higher pay.... but I feel the middleMEN value that we paid for MLM is way over the roof... for products not extremely valuable... and for informations that sometimes even unnecessary.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who brought up the name of the company Amway. I believe that you haven't done your own research at all. Amway was researched by Forbes Magazine and among other things, Forbes uncovered that:<br><br>1) Amway is owned almost entirely by the founders and their immediate families.<br><br>2) They've been sued for slander and they lost. Amway actually spread rumours that Proctor &amp; Gamble (which makes stuff like Pringles potato chips and Gilette shavers) was an instrument of Satan.<br><br>3) The average Amway MLMer, makes US$780 from sales to others. However, on average, these people will consume US$1068 themselves. Also minus of the profit from losses made for telephone bills, transport, rallies,<br>publicity material and other expenses to expand the business... and ultimately Amway earns, but the MLMers lose.<br><br>4) Amway has hired gangsters to "rough up" and threaten people who were critical of the company.<br><br>A link to the whole article is listed below:<br><a href="http://skepdic.com/klebniov.html" rel="nofollow">http://skepdic.com/klebniov.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cepat:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm I started this topic with the intention of pointing out the negative aspects of MLMs but what I'm getting is you're trying to promote your MLM company instead.<br><br>I just hope that you bear in mind that it's very difficult to be successful in MLM unless you're the owner or someone very high ranking. Let me put to you this question, how can you decide your own future when you don't even fully own the company? In MLMs you're just representing the company product brand (much like insurance or real estate) but not have the full 100% ownership of the company. Is that really real freedom when what you earn is ultimately going into your boss's pocket (since you are your boss's downline) and you're also really dependent on your downlines for your commissions?</div></blockquote>Not owning the company is very similar to working as an employee in any other company is it not? THat is what at least 90% of what all Singaporeans are doing (being employess) at the moment, so it is difficult to be successful for all of them?<br><br>If you are making 3 or 4k with an MLM, to some extend I'd think that is better than being safely employed. At the very least the scalability aspect is there.<br><br>I'm not an MLM member by the way... but I feel that perhaps out of the many MLM companies out there, there may be 1 or 2 rare ones that really make money,  and in an ethical way.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The correct mindset has to be deep down in the heart the wish for somebody to have a better life. The desire to truly help them succeed and only then one can receive not only the reward but the joy of seeing somebody have a better life because of the true opportunity that I share etc...<br><br>Thus, I agree that it cannot be pushing or hard-selling or focused on one-self or money, as greed is something that will cause one's failure and this alone is the main reason why so many pple fail and why so many pple hate the business. A lot of pple have been tricked by frens etc and not presented the opportunity carefully or the company policy is to just go sponsor sponsor etc...which is clearly wrong and is not the true spirit of mlm...<br><br>That is why a true mlm company not only focused just on recruiting but the products too. The products should be the core of how an mlm works and it also brings out the company culture and true values of the company. This is why I chose the current company I am in because it has been many years in the business, the values are as discussed above, and the products are of the top quality with documented certification all written down in black and white and good product demos which can clearly demonstrate the superior quality of the product. And most importantly, the products all come with a 90 days satisfaction guarantee..and thats 3 months, which clearly shows how confident the company is on its products! And for all those who sign up the business, one only needs to pay $68..and get a starter kit plus subscription of a full-colour magazine for a year...and if anytime within the year he decides to quit the business...Full money refund of the $68..which clearly shows that the company is offering an opportunity without loss...for those who wants to go in take a look etc oso can...coz its not for everybody..but for those who truly see the potential of the business and the company. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have seen and read through many anti-mlm websites etc and I chose this opportunity with this company because i can see the sincerity and the true business and I also will share this with everybody without any worries because I know what I am doing is for them etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This goes out to everybody out there, whether in or not, to step back and take a look not just at your own life, but for the next 5 years...and to understand the principle that I am bringing across.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the rule of thumb should be: if you are not convinced, don't join in.<br><br>However if the risk is small (eg US10 a month), would you consider taking that risk to see if you can make it? Sometimes its all about making calculated risks if you have done as much research as you can but havent found all the factors or have that niggling doubt because you don't know what question to ask.<br><br>Because of high joining costs, MLM participants sometimes or more likely most of the time are pressured by themselves to recruit more people to recover their cost. But the real cost of this is the potential loss of friendships. IMagine your friend alwas bugging you to join his mlm. The MLM fails in human economics.<br><br>Thus, I think that if you want to join an MLM, consider if you will be pressured to recover your costs (weigh in the factors of high startup cost and recurring costs) and if you will feel pressured, its likely your upline will be feeling pressured too. So put yourself in his shoes. I think this is one way to find a good MLM but I am open to comments.<br><br>Don't be swayed by people who claim they can make so much money in a month. Do more in depth research. Its good that the company has such good testimonials. The difficult part is when you join, it may takes a long long time for you to reap the income that the claimant once claimed he had. So join only if you have the strong will to wait it out. The higher the return, usually the longer the wait. After all its not some get rich quick scheme.<br><br>Last time, it was buyer beware. Now, it is joiner beware.<br><br>As i previously posted some guidelines to joining that you may want to follow, though its my own opinions.<br><br>Good luck to you all in achieving your financial goals, regardless of the path you take.</div>

They keep on having tons of promotions that no one bothers to read or reply or show interest, yet they are so persistent like they're parasites or viruses to society.<br><br>Just remember that if one tries to tap into one's own internal network of family, relatives and friends...eventually they're run out of downlines, because of the fact there's a limited supply to begin with but come to think of it, MLM ignores the basic economic principles in the first place.<br><br>Perhaps they should realize this forum is not the place to come advertise or promote their MLM but rather this forum is to wake people up to the idea that MLM is not really anyone's cup of tea.
