            <div class='col-md body'>Reading so many topics on new MLMs with so many questions asked on this and that, wouldn't it be better to have everyone post more warnings about this or that company topics. At least that's more useful information which we can apply to counter against any persistent MLMers.<br><br>Sorry to say that, but the majority of MLM supporters on this forum really have no idea that their topics on new MLMs and trying to promote their type of MLM is really a waste of time to read and reply. They keep on having tons of promotions that no one bothers to read or reply or show interest, yet they are so persistent like they're parasites or viruses to society.<br><br>Just remember that if one tries to tap into one's own internal network of family, relatives and friends...eventually they're run out of downlines, because of the fact there's a limited supply to begin with but come to think of it, MLM ignores the basic economic principles in the first place.<br><br>Perhaps they should realize this forum is not the place to come advertise or promote their MLM but rather this forum is to wake people up to the idea that MLM is not really anyone's cup of tea. People are not so easily open to it once they are more educated and this forum serves it purpose of educating people to the supposedly advantages and hidden disadvantages of MLM.</div>

And for all those who sign up the business, one only needs to pay $68..and get a starter kit plus subscription of a full-colour magazine for a year...and if anytime within the year he decides to quit the business...Full money refund of the $68..which clearly shows that the company is offering an opportunity without loss...for those who wants to go in take a look etc oso can...coz its not for everybody..but for those who truly see the potential of the business and the company. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have seen and read through many anti-mlm websites etc and I chose this opportunity with this company because i can see the sincerity and the true business and I also will share this with everybody without any worries because I know what I am doing is for them etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This goes out to everybody out there, whether in or not, to step back and take a look not just at your own life, but for the next 5 years...and to understand the principle that I am bringing across.

Let me put to you this question, how can you decide your own future when you don't even fully own the company? In MLMs you're just representing the company product brand (much like insurance or real estate) but not have the full 100% ownership of the company. Is that really real freedom when what you earn is ultimately going into your boss's pocket (since you are your boss's downline) and you're also really dependent on your downlines for your commissions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quote..."If something sounds too good to be true...it usually is."<br><br>Speaking of MLMs...<br><br>It's really nothing but just money making based on subtle conning, cheating there and about. The one that truly profits, are the ones on the top, the pioneers.<br><br>I've seen countless products offered by MLMs, most being health products. And being a Health Science major, I can only say that these products are at worst, harmful (in the long term), to being harmless...and benefit-less, to beneficial - at astronomical prices.<br><br>Products I've come across so far...<br><br>Protein weight loss plans<br>-&gt; Based on a pure protein diet, up to 80% calories from protein. All meals are replaced with 'meal packages'. Total amount of calories offered from the meal replacements are usually less than 1800kcal/day. This is by far the most harmful product offered. Why? Do your homework.<br><br>Ephedra supplements<br>-&gt; Another weight loss product, sometimes used as an adjunct to intensive weight/physical training. Ephedra was previously pending to be banned by FDA. Whether or not this substance is harmful in typical doses remain to be seen. A powerful stimulant, similar to caffeine. Long term use could lead to anxiety disorders.<br><br>Obsolete/bogus supplements (chitosan)<br>-&gt; Some MLMs still sell products with claims that have already proven to be obsolete. Chitosan is one of them.<br><br>Probiotic supplements<br>-&gt; This range of supplements do have documented evidence of some health benefits. Can serve as a form of preventive medicine to gastrointestinal diseases. Alternative forms are widely available; dietary interventions can remove the need for probiotic supplements. Such as Yakult, baker's yeast, whole bread, fiber intake. Very expensive, and perhaps unneccessary.<br><br>Water purifiers<br>-&gt; Local water supply is by far some of the safest compared to other nations. Boiling your drinking water can kill most bacteria while most bacteria are harmless to the body. What else do you need to filter from your drinking water?<br><br>Cosmetics<br>-&gt; MLMs have a tendency to promote cosmetics that are made from certain essential oils, fatty acids, 'exotic oils' that could promote skin health. While most based on the Omega fats with sources from salmon, whale, peanuts oils could be harmless, these cosmetics could cost more than your Elizabeth Ardens. A small range of products based on exotic oils could be dangerous - due to allergies which are not uncommon. Some oils could contain chemicals that people are allergic to.<br><br>After seeing so many products that are either dangerous, to of no use, to products with such high costs...how then I bring myself to sell these things to people? I have yet to see anything that is worth selling, much less be absorbed into the MLM industry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Yup, I fully agree with u on the fact that I am not the owner of the company, but firstly, if we are employees, are we owners of the company?? Let's say we start up a new company, what is the start-up capital we need?? And do we need to earn money from "downlines" who work for us??<br><br>In fact, there is no gd solution to the above problem until my founders decided to start up a company that lets every individual, regardless of education etc to have a chance to own a business without a big capital. But there needs to be a gd way to share the profits of the business. Thus this system was formed and developed, simply based on the idea to reach out to pple to let them have a business of their own and to share in the profits of the products.<br><br>As the year goes by, many people saw and abused the wonderful system that was developed, causing many controversies, legal cases etc. However, the basic fundamental belief of the company is still there, that is to give people the opportunity to have small business whereby it can help them in their lives still remains in place even up till today. The company is a global company with sales up till 6.2 billion dollars. It is a proven company, and that is why compared to many others, it is much more safe to choose such a company to be a business partner with <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I also agree that it is not easy to do the business. In fact lots of hard work is required. The mindset and the company is also impt. Any lack of any one of these will easily cause one to give up etc. This, sad to say, accounts for the majority of pple. Many looked for a get-rich quick scheme or just wants money fast...without putting in true hard work...but in actual fact it is impossible. The world is fair, how much u earn is proportional to the hard work that is put in. In fact, as I see it, it is a get-rich SLOW scheme...yes..it doesnt sound nice..but to me, I do it for compassion, I believe in helping those who truly wants to help themselves. It does not matter how long it takes, but I know that the money I earned is 100% clean money, paid on sincerity, integrity and hard work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>A true fair plan ensures that no matter if u join 20 years ago or now, the opportunity is the same. The plan must work in such a way that if you put in more effort, you can be more successful that people who joined much earlier.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the topic starter aims to find out the negative aspects of mlm as opposed to mlmers promoting their opportunities with lots of positives. I think he wants to have a full picture of the industry.<br><br>Of course everything has its good and bad. Do make sure u know a complete picture before judging. Most ppl think mlm is bad. No company is absolutely perfect. The most I can say there are very good ones. You have to decide for yourself by asking the right questions and reading a lot and use logical thinking. At the end of the day ultimately the person joining makes the business decision entirely on his own and only has himself to blame.<br><br>I think mlms' existence is positive because you cannot deny the fact that it does help some ppl to cope with bills and so on. Sure, some got burnt. But what does matter is that at least it can be an additional source of income for the average struggling citizen. An additional source of few hundred or thousand dollars per mth of income definitely helps the family a lot. I dun think the aim of becoming a millionaire is the top agenda for all mlmers. Of course there are a few big players earning monstrous figures.<br><br>Of course what im referring to are LEGITIMATE MLMs.</div>

MLM in Singapore is still at an infant stage which is why it is being subjected to abuse and done inethically.<br><br>Regarding abt refunds, it sure is a tricky issue here. There are some companies which will come out with lots of hidden meaning behind it's refund policy..ie, read the <strong>fine print </strong>so be sure to do due diligence and intelligent research before joining any company. Most people who join are motivated by emotions of earning a lot of money(without checking out the company's refund policy thoroughly). In the end, they have only themselves to blame for making poor business decisions.<br><br>It's not MLM's fault. Not that im doing MLM, it's just that people are doing what they should not and not doing what they should.<br><br>I guess your fear is losing friendships while doing MLM but that has been proven otherwise. I see people doing MLM and yet they still have friends with them. If your friendships are strong why are you afraid that they will be destroyed by MLM, which many people are also doing it an honest way?<br><br>If MLM is so sinful that it can destroy friendships, then I guess the friendship is weak in the first place and you have to do something to save it.</div>

Dunno what products you find overpriced.<br>But I do agree that those shampoo, body soap and body lotion are usually too expensive, when you can easily buy Loreal shampoo and Nivea body lotion from Watsons at half the price but equally good (or even better) quality.<br><br>Stuff like facial cream can be cheaper than those better brands (like Estee Lauder, Lancome) in the retail market.  But actually they are all using the same ingredients.<br><br>As for inner nutrition stuff, if you talk about overpriced, I will norminate GNC.  so bloody expensive and the staff always follow you around the shop (same for every branch, I bet you).  They insist on helping you find what you want, even though you just want to browse.  Of course lah, once they get the chance to talk about their products to you, they can better chance of making you buy things that are really expensive (now THIS is high prices) which you don't even need it in the first place.<br><br>And then the staff will not give up pushing you to join their membership.  They literally refuse to accept reasons such as you seldom buy their products.  For those of you who got nightmares being pushed by MLMers, my advice is don't even try entering GNC.<br><br>As for MLM nutritional products, there are plenty that are far from GNC kind of pricing, quite cheap.  But of course, I also see a few (not many though) that are really expensive (costing $500 or more a month just to lose weight.  Like that, I rather go slimming centre then.  Slimming Centre also that kind of price).</div>

The correct mindset has to be deep down in the heart the wish for somebody to have a better life. The desire to truly help them succeed and only then one can receive not only the reward but the joy of seeing somebody have a better life because of the true opportunity that I share etc...<br><br>Thus, I agree that it cannot be pushing or hard-selling or focused on one-self or money, as greed is something that will cause one's failure and this alone is the main reason why so many pple fail and why so many pple hate the business. A lot of pple have been tricked by frens etc and not presented the opportunity carefully or the company policy is to just go sponsor sponsor etc...which is clearly wrong and is not the true spirit of mlm...<br><br>That is why a true mlm company not only focused just on recruiting but the products too. The products should be the core of how an mlm works and it also brings out the company culture and true values of the company. This is why I chose the current company I am in because it has been many years in the business, the values are as discussed above, and the products are of the top quality with documented certification all written down in black and white and good product demos which can clearly demonstrate the superior quality of the product. And most importantly, the products all come with a 90 days satisfaction guarantee..and thats 3 months, which clearly shows how confident the company is on its products! And for all those who sign up the business, one only needs to pay $68..and get a starter kit plus subscription of a full-colour magazine for a year...and if anytime within the year he decides to quit the business...Full money refund of the $68..which clearly shows that the company is offering an opportunity without loss...for those who wants to go in take a look etc oso can...coz its not for everybody..but for those who truly see the potential of the business and the company. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have seen and read through many anti-mlm websites etc and I chose this opportunity with this company because i can see the sincerity and the true business and I also will share this with everybody without any worries because I know what I am doing is for them etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This goes out to everybody out there, whether in or not, to step back and take a look not just at your own life, but for the next 5 years...and to understand the principle that I am bringing across.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi just want to input my 2 cents worth...<br><br>I believe in life, we cannot just depend on our salary. Thats why people look into bonds, stocks, land banking, hyips, and affiliate programs. We have to look for sources of passive residual income to supplement our salary, to provide a cushion in times of fall, or maybe just to earn some extra income.<br><br>To me, MLM is a form of affiliate program. There are many many MLM business models out there and some are good, while others are unscrupulous. Now lets not jump to conclusions and say "most mlms are bad, lets steer clear of them".<br><br>Affiliate programs work on the method of marketing called network marketing. Surely by now the benefits and disavantages of network marketing have been drilled to death by many many people, so i don't want to venture into that area.<br><br>Why do I say this, it because if you KNOW how to differentiate which are good and which are bad, then you are better off than one who dosen't. You for one, will not be fooled to join one that sells absurdly ridiculus products or some high joining fee.<br><br>What I want to do is to try to help clear the air.<br><br>So, first we start off by giving ourselves an ENEMA. clear your mind of whats bad and whats not about MLMs. Lets not let our perceptions get in the way of what the real facts may be.<br><br>Now, someone asked that he "dont really know its aim n motive". We don't have to be some rocket scientist to find out the guidelines for which MLMs are safe and which aren't. This is because the Ministry of Trade and Industry has released an order on MLMs. i.e. to say, they have drawn out a set of guidelines to determine which mlms are legal and which arent.<br><br>Now, you may tell me, there are so many MLM companies REGISTERED in Singapore, meaning they are legal. But are everyone of them good?<br><br>To me, the many different MLMs and their different models cater to different people. There are people whose risk appetite is small, so they want something with low start up cost. There are others whose risk appetite is large, so they would be willing to spend thousands on MLMs. Whatever the case, <strong>if you know how to do your research</strong>, you can find one thats right for you.<br><br>So lets get back to the MLM order, and this part here is a lot of my own opinions as well, so if you agree or disagree with it, I hope you guys will talk about it gently and not flame me (after all, this IS a sensitive topic to some  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> -especially anti-mlm crusaders hehe)<br><br>What we want to differentiate are illegal MLMs and legal MLMs. You can tighten on the guidelines according to your risk appetite, but generally this is the limit (right)<br><br>firstly, <strong>An illegal pyramid scheme will typically require participants to pay hefty upfront charges.</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>so we should look for something which dosent require us to pay hefty upfront charges</strong></span><br><br>secondly, <strong>the participants are promised attractive financial rewards for each additional participant recruited, as well as for all new participants brought in by their recruitees. As more salespersons are recruited, participants hope to recover their upfront charges and earn sizeable profits.</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>So what we need is low upfront charges so participants are not compelled to coerce others to joins just because they want to recover their upfront charges.</strong></span><br><br>next, <strong>such pyramid-like structures will eventually run out of new recruits and collapse, resulting in those salespersons at the bottom of the pyramid losing all their upfront charges</strong>. <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>So what we need is something in an expanding industry, and in a global front.</strong></span><br><br>next, <strong>Promoters hype about how easy it is to earn money, that people can get very rich in a very short time and that the way to earn money is by recruiting others to join the scheme</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>so the MLM must not be promoted as some get rich quick scheme. MORE IMPORTANTLY, the way money is earned is not by recruiting people. THIS IS ILLEGAL. Participants should be paid only if people buy the product, not from any sign up payments.</strong></span><br><br>next, <strong>The commodity in question is not something one would normally buy at its price</strong> <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">we must ensure that the product is not exorbitantly priced.</span></strong><br><br>Next, <strong>Participants are required to invest money into the scheme, whether in the form of a joining fee or buying inventory.</strong> <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>So you pay an MLM not so much for the joining fee or stocking up on items you may not use or need to sell. You should pay only for items you use. NO STOCKKEEPING should be required.</strong></span><br><br><strong>Basically the most important thing to note is that you pay an MLM not for joining fees, but to consume a product. Secondly you earn from an MLM not through others joining fee, but through their consumption of the product.</strong><br><br>Actually I have done alot of research on my website. <a href="http://samales.ws/is-it-legal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://samales.ws/is-it-legal.htm</a>. So go on and check it out. There aer some information that may make you think I am trying to promote something. But thats not my intention. <strong>I don't want to sell anything here. </strong>You can see and extract important parts of my research from my website, and if you are interested to find out more on what i have written up, you can go check out the rest of my website. Of course theres not obligation to do anything in my website.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess Cepat's issue here isn't much on whether or not the MLMs are legal, illegal, pyramidal or not. And previous points on the long term safety of the products I'd mentioned earlier had been grossly overlooked. As one's going to pop with the all familiar FDA labels...I hope you all know that supplements are regulated differently from drugs.<br><br>When a product is classified and regulated as a drug, vigorous long testings are required to ascertain its safety. Yet this alone do not guarantee long term use...numerous drugs had been recalled in history after being approved by FDA yet proven to be harmful after the drug has been released for public use.<br><br>When a product is regulated as a supplement, the story becomes very different. It's no secret that close to every product would be approved unless it contains chemicals which had been previously identified to be harmful and rejected. Otherwise, approval goes without much hiccups. The recent issue with Ephedra, a common stimulant found in sports/performance/weight loss supplements is that... several studies revealed that ephedra could have long term complications on the mental system. This issue has not quite concluded and much controversy is still abound.<br><br>..my point in bringing this up is that, as in the ephedra case, so long it is not concluded or proven it is harmful, it's assumed as harmless. This sort of lax ruling by the FDA is not unknown to many sport enthusiats. Hence, some other supplements that are potentially dangerous are constantly in circulation and perhaps in near future, ephedra or some other product could be recalled back because it's proven to be harmful, carcinogenic... (not just MLMs in this case, but also Nature's Farm, GNC are guilty of circulating much of the dubious health products in the market)<br><br>I have no issues with the income-earning, profit distribution thing with MLMs, rather with product safety. If I were to sell, and if I can't even certain of the product safety, how am I to sell?<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>While I have nothing against the concept of MLMs, networking, I hope MLMers do their honest and <strong>unbiased</strong> homework of their products, ascertain their safety before selling.<br><br>Btw, something that's natural may not be all good. =/</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was frequently bugged by friends/so and so/whatever who tries to get me to join MLM but I never did. I even endured a few long hours on the phone for the sake of not offending our friendship when one fella even risked losing his voice to convince me to go for of those talks and buy some stuff. But like what I was told they were aka mass motivation camps working up people's emotions with sing song hugs like some religious events or presenting role models telling all how much they earn. The thing is, I don't just participate in something without knowing about it. They always claim that being part of the MLM brings hope and financial freedom etc, well maybe, but you have to believe in it and commit to doing it well to succeed. If that is the reasoning, and you believe in something or anything else for that matter at all to work, it will work. So, the logic is not just for MLM and focusing one's attention on this argument to me is flawed. About superior products much cheaper than the market, by saying that they do away with ad expenses, buying in bulk etc, so its cheaper than mass market.   Maybe for some products yes, but the rest like you said, are definitely overpriced as I have come across some gold numismatic and watch/jewellery or household items purported to be worth a better deal but if I were to appraise them myself, I think it is just worth a fraction of the manufacturing cost and indeed some of the claims of authenticity, miracles are dubious and unrecognized. So the high price could just go to the company or commissions. That I am not sure as each company may have different systems and layers. It could be a legitimate business, fair enough, people need to eat, but other than going beyond the benefits of selling and giving 'hope' to buyers etc etc, it is a very complex structure that few including myself have took the time to understand because there is a lot to research. Unless your short term goal to make money without thinking about other possible consequences (heard they were banned in some 3rd world countries causing losses to its member victims) and you persist, go ahead.  Again, it could be that some products are more suited for MLM than others as in the case of cosmetics or health products where personal selling/consultation is often used. And if this hypothesis were true, it would also explain why some claim that MLM is a more effective distribution system than others or those in certain countries. But I have not come across any literature that can claim itself to be a the best distribution system ever, if that were the case, you won't have your giant supermart and P&amp;G will close shop. But obviously, there are other reasons like their training, policies, participation level, loyalty or sales tactics too and some are highly debatable and in the gray areas. If your friends ask you to join MLM, maybe its already too late since you will be one of the downliners who will be sucked into some multiplex levels struggling to sell and fatten the upliners pocket. unless i were selling an alternative but equally effective drug formula to the needy that can cure their life threatening ailments where current medication are prohibitive for them due to 'legal' patents and trademarks. So, better to just ask oneself on the basis of motivation rather than claim by others, as I have given up thinking about this...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ito_^:</div><div class="quote_body">the problem is the extremely high prices they put out and the dubious claims they promote. wld u pay so much for something that was never proven?</div></blockquote></div>
