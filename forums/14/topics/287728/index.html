            <div class='col-md body'>According to 24th Oct article in Straits Times, it claimed that Sunshine Empire is part of the EGA conglomerate.<br><br>Dear investors/ merchants, maybe u guys should really analyze why conglomerate may not be a good idea after all.<br><br>To modern business analysts, the best argument for conglomerate organizational form is that it may allow capital to be allocated in a more efficient way. For example, a hypothetical conglomerate consists of a candy store and an internet website. Suppose the candy store has high cash flow, but very few profitable investment opportunities. The website has low cash flow, but lots of good investment projects. By combining the businesses together, the cash from the candy store can be used to make profitable investments that would otherwise not be made in the web site. The main question associated with this strategy is why this improves upon a market-based allocation of capital. That is, if the entities were standalone, then presumably the investors in the candy store could receive dividends, and then reinvest those dividends in the startup. If this market-based mechanism works well, then all profitable internet startup investments can be made without having the two entities be under common ownership. Research suggests that financial markets may not always operate efficiently due to the presence of transaction costs and asymmetric information. If this problem is severe, then the common ownership of the assets might yield a more efficient allocation of capital.<br><br>In short, whatever money that sunshine has accumulated is bascially transfered over to another company without any barriers. Hence the funds can also be brought out to other co-companies and never to return..<br><br>So to all merchants and investors, pls be careful. u may wan to start complaining to pull out ur fundings.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>M E M O R A N D U M<br>To : All Merchants / Staffs From : Mr Jackie Hoo. Asia Pacific President Date : 24 October 2007 Re : PresidentÂ’s Message<br>Dear Our Valued Merchants, I am sure that you would all have read the Articles in todayÂ’s English Straits Times. No doubt also that many of you will also have heard many fearful things being said about our Company. Let me encourage you all by focusing your mind on these points:<br><br>1. It is a positive thing that the ST has presented a write up on Mr James Phang and the EGA conglomerate.<br><br>A.It is positive or negative , i think JP &amp; JH know the best ....<br><br>2. It is a positive thing that it is clear from the page 26 article that EGA does not own or have any part in Sunshine Empire (this means that the Group activities and companies are not affected by the Sunshine Empire activities).<br><br>B.Rubbish , sunshine is EGA , they are all under JP control . but all the group of company does not register under JP .<br><br>3. On the other hand, it is also a positive thing that by reference, Sunshine Empire is seen to be associated with a larger and substantial conglomerate, with an experienced mentor and advisor in Mr James Phang.<br><br>C.Meaning of Conglomerate .. refer to topic under pierre2084<br><br>4. It is a positive thing that the public awareness is drawn to Sunshine Empire by the ST Â– this is free publicity. Now everyone will want to know what is this Company? Â– This is the best time to sell to them that Sunshine Empire is a responsible company and that the business model works!<br><br>D.Rubbish again , there no free publicity in the world , and yr business model work only when people invest . See how long yr investment can last.<br><br>5. It is a positive thing that the ST did not call Sunshine Empire a scam, or say it is illegal Â– it merely said that the public should Â“take careÂ” and that the Â“business model looks like a pure financial investment schemeÂ”.<br><br>E.Isnt it obvious when ST say ( TAKE CARE )<br><br>6. Over all, the ST article presents an opportunity and a platform for both EGA and Sunshine Empire to engage the public and educate them about the activities of the group and Sunshine Empire.<br><br>F.ST got say that meh ? or u say one . JH wake up yr idea.<br><br>Sunshine Empire Merchants we have taken a lot of efforts together to build up the business and the Company name. Let us not allow rumors and misunderstanding to undermine all our efforts. You shall also be seeing my official press response in the newspapers. I am working with the management team to engage with the MAS and the authorities to clear up any misunderstanding they may have and to have Sunshine Empire recognized as the responsible company and cutting edge business opportunity. Meanwhile, I call on all Merchants who believe in our business model, whose lives have been transformed by participating in Sunshine Empire to come forward and share your testimonial to encourage everybody! Together we shall bring our Company to new and greater strength! Yours Sincerely, For Sunshine Empire Holdings Jackie Hoo President<br><br>G.Rubbish again , JP &amp; JH group of scammers really taken alot of efforts together to build up the $$ business and the Company name.<br><br>Conclusion - Pls dont get involve with them anymore .<br><br>JP &amp; JH group of scammers what a nice move u all taken last week , bulletproofing all yr merchants about the news paper .<br><br>There are more news regarding EGA coming soon ...<br>God bless JP &amp; JH group of scammers ..<br></div>
