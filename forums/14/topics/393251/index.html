              <p>well, from my own in-depth understanding of going around many companies over the years..even they don't exactly understand the main purpose and reason why people buy the idea of MLM, thus even if they are associated with regulated companies, there's no exisiting law that direct or address the problems which are spread in all mlm local companies..</p>
              <p>they are there just to implement the standard Sales Law, but not in MLM business rules and conditions etc..so in a way..its also useless, thus the complaints will never go away..each year complaints are made revolving around the same issues..and the same problems are not be solved..thus even if they are regulated, it's also useless technically so to speak..</p>

              <p>the 2 posts which you posted above..is something that everybody will know..</p>
              <p>eg: the media is only the show..to make it looks good..example: thailand PM now also trying to restrict negative media from flowing out, thus he ordered the close of Red Shirt supported TV boardcasting sation..</p>
              <p>it's the same everywhere de la.. talk is cheap..making themselves look good is even cheaper..just paying lip service only since they have no control over how the business is run as it is not within their control..(yet claiming they will do their best blah blah blah..) [refer to bottom part for my perspective]</p>
              <p>just read previous news articles..it is only when more than XXX complaints are complaint against a mlm company, than only will they act..ask people who have gone down to CASE to complaint directly..</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">try it yourself:</span> in particular those individuals going alone versus those who went in a group..get to know the difference of treatment, without media presence..than you will know..</p>
              <p>they will only get into action..when the rate of complaint is above the normal rate for that depending on the industry benchmark..so to speak..it's not effective..</p>
              <p>plus the other thing..i'm not referring to SE/VE as in this thread...but it is regarding majority of mis-leading sales presentation of most distributors over most of the local mlm companies not restricted to 1 company.</p>
              <p>what needs to be done can only be corrected with the cooperation of the boss of respective companies directly because they can control and contain their own distributors, so even if external forces come into the picture, they can force it shut down, but they cannot solve the root of the problem.</p>
              <p>that is what i mean by effective--getting to the root of the problem which neither CAD/CASE can do it..clearing the surface of the problem will not help..which is what they have being doing as always..so the problem in fact never once go  away..</p>
              <p>the problems can only be solved from the boss of the company only...nobody else can do that..</p>
              <p>internal problems cannot be solved by external help..same like our body/health..if we want our ograns/body to be healthy..other people have no control over what we do/eat except for the host/owner of the body only.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>
              </p><div style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 100%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffffff; padding-top: 0.3em; padding-right: 0.6em; padding-bottom: 0.3em; padding-left: 0.6em; font: normal normal normal 13px/1.231 arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I've got to address this problem. And this is a very big misconception among the industry.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">While Multi-Level-Marketing and "PYRAMID" scheme has various similarities, there are very SIGNIFICANT differences among the two.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">One is clearly a BUSINESS MODEL while they other is nothing but a SCHEME, an EVIL one, otherwise known as THE MONEY GAME.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Very importantly. Point about getting rich. MLM companies are CLEARLY not places where you get rich quick or get quick cash. Hell NO. Money is a result of effort and time. While PYRAMID SCHEMES company like Elle Eff i entice people with big money and quick riches, if you're logical enough, everyone in the world should have joined the company and get rich. Yes? </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Another thing to take note and ask yourself. When members or rather "VICTIMS" of the PYRAMID scheme reveal and talk about their marketing plan, they never fail to talk about how much you can earn, your potential, etc. Ask yourself and ask them too, PROVE it to you they are already earning that money. If not, do not buy their fanciful cooked up story. Similarly, MLM shows potential in earnings and they also prove it to you. See the difference? While earnings is a very sensitive topic, we'll discuss about it in the next point.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Earnings. We all love money. YES? Pyramids main source of income which I also believe rightly is, comes from the MEMBERSHIP FEES of new "VICTIMS". What about MLMs? Services and PRODUCTS sold to CONSUMERS outside the network. Not INSIDE. See the difference?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">MEMBERSHIP FEES. Pyramids "VICTIM"ship fees ranges from few hundreds to tens of thousands. Simply saying, big money which you will NEVER EVER see again unless you can get more victims. In contrast, you can join MLM companies for as low as 0 or just a small amount which is and must be FULLY REFUNDABLE. Do Pyramid schemed companies like Elle Eff i offer that?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Having said that, I have one last point to bring out. PYRAMID schemes is UNSUITABLE for anyone of you here and very CLEARLY , it is NOT MLM. IT IS ILLEGAL. Look at Sunshine and the current renamed company named G_ _.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">MLM MIGHT or MIGHT NOT BE suitable for you. Take every marketing plan with a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Lastly, Elle Eff i is a PYRAMID schemed company which CLEVERLY DISGUISE THEIR PYRAMID SCHEME with PRODUCTS. Its an empty company. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">While I am not from any MLM or Pyramid Schemes, here is my piece of advice and FAIR and JUST comparison.</p>
