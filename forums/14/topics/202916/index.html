            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, let's all put those personal moral issue aside and have a constructive point to point discussions on the MLM business plan compared to traditional ones. And what are their main strategy in market penetration.<br><br>1) Does all MLM companies have a mission statement? If they do, shouldn't they include current practices of retailing, advertising, sponsorship and dynamic MLM to raise product awareness?<br><br>2) Human resource. It seems that there's no limit to how many "recruits/employees/distributors" they can recruit. No company complains of too many end-customers, but for hiring employees, they need to check on its profitable standing to come out with calculated number to sustain its business. As for MLM, a newly recruit is as good as a end-consumer, till he finds his own. Thus, their recruitment drive is as good as selling?<br><br>3) Supply and demand. Without creating product awareness through other means of traditional marketing, how can the products penetrate the market to sustain largely unlimited "recruits/employees/distributors"? Would MLM companies be concerned of market saturation?<br><br>4) Profit and losses. With the task of overhiring recruit/staff/salesrep/distributors and overflow of products, it will eventually sustain some loss along the way particularly downliner. Does the company top make adjustment from the losses? Or do they profit from the losses?<br><br>5) Eligibility. How does one be eligible to be a recruit/staff/distributor of a MLM company? The means to spend thousands on products in intial sign-up or the ability to sell products? If I don't have thousands to spend but willing to help push product sales, would MLM give me monthly salary to work for them?<br><br>6) Failed ventures. How does the top react to so many failed ventures in their MLM company? Any measures in place? Wouldn't it be a bad rep if someone fails trying to distribute the products?<br><br>To sum it up, what's the mission statement of MLM companies? What are their business value? Whats the strategic marketing plan? Are these being spelt out during recruitment talk??<br></div>

I involve in CNI [The GREATEST MLM company in Malaysia  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ] and what i have discovered is that CNI really 'builds' people who have a big dream for better health n future, including me. My CNI has been listed in the main board of Bursa Saham Malaysia. What I have gain so far is more than i can image, including brand new Honda Accord, Peugot 407, and coming soon BMW 328i  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . I emphasis in taking care of one's health before everything else as i realise HEALTHY body brings healthy mind that could forsee better future. Ohh, before i forget, next year i'm buying a house in a golf course. Too good to be true, huh. Well, this is the reason God promise HEAVEN.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
