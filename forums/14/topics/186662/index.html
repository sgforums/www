You must really talk to him, refer him to this and other websites.<br><br>1) Do not let him blindly get into this company without asking him to do some background research into MLM.<br><br>2) Do not let him enter if he is doing so based on the influence of his 'friends' and his 'friend's colleges'.<br><br>3) Check the legiblity of claims of that company, such as awards etc, if they have. (Personally I never heard of this one, only "hot" favourites like EY, BA, LB and NTI.)<br><br>4) If he respects you, or his family, he should really discuss what he is doing...<br><br>5) Look at the company, is it recruitment-heavy? Buying-up of rank? Mattress really working as intended? Any claims/ scientific facts/ patents/ testimonies?Grossly over-priced 'mattress' (lol)?<br><br>I think its good you are worried for him even if he do not want to listen to you. Make sure he thinks of the pros and cons of MLM before he commits, cos once he signs above the dotted lines... turning back is ****ing hard. I learnt it the hard way in Bel' Air.<br><br>The targetting of poly grads, already sounds to me like something fishy taking place.<br><br>Best of luck to the two of you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KerEr.. I understand how it feels.. It's helpless when the person you like is being psychoed by those MLM people..<br><br>MLM hardsell tatics are reali difficult to deny.. They offer "nice-sounding" names like Marketing manager and stuff and even promises you a car when a certain quota is reached.<br><br>But be wary.. i read up on the free car deal and it seems that only the downpayment is paid by the company, installments and stuff, u pay ur own..<br><br>I went down to venture Era b4.. They reali resort to Brainwashing tatics.. I tink those who are ill-willed are easily swayed.. The guy told me that going into Uni does not gurantee a nice future and stuff.. But i say it's all rubbish..<br><br>Of course there are success casses, but the percentage are reali minimal.. And IMO, those who are successful are those that haf minimal conscience as they do not mind earning their frens/relatives hard earned money.. Thats how i feel anyway.)<br><br>Btw, my fren returned from Japan and told me that those so called magenetic matress cannot be sold in Japan, that's y it's all imported to Sg to sell.<br><br>I tink it's reali immoral that these so called managers ask that these kids dun tell their parents bout it.. It's obvious, coz parents noe that there is no free lunch in the world and will naturally see thru these who thing as a fraud.<br><br>Tell ur bf not to be so into this who thing. Best of luck.</div>

And although I do not know how to help you, I am gonna say, maybe let your bf try a few months then later he realise he wasted his time then he will realize how foolish he is? I am speaking from experience coz many of my friends joined and they left after a few months wasted off their life. There may be a success rate, like 0.001% so if anyone wanna join MLM, I suggest you all go buy 4D better chance of earning big bucks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of their employees are students and teenagers.<br><br>Well.... Working there you don't have monthly or basic pay, only by commission. And the products are very very expensive. Basically making use of teenager labour to make money.<br><br>Anyway...my story:<br><br>One fine day (not going to be fine later), one of my 'brothers' in sec sch called me down to the company's office (he works there). For?<br>"Just listening to presentation" and to pass him something i want to give him at same time.<br>Ok I went down. Office at Robinson Point, behind the old TAS Building (Ogilvy Centre) near Lau Pa Sat. Upon reaching the place, he begun to introduce me to the products. Ok... But instead of his, i was made to listen to another classmate's "presentation". I waited very long time, say 1 hour? Before he was finally free to "present". Was sitted at a small table, with the classmate trying to introduce me to the products, which honestly speaking made me very bored. At the end of the 45min or so "presentation", I was asked to grade his speech. Halfway thru, I noticed all others sitting around me were not members of the public, but employees noting down some stuff on notebooks (not those computer kinds) as the classmate spoke. I was getting very impatient. Then 'brother' asked me to stay.<br><br>"The manager wants to talk to you". I was like "what on earth"? Ok, I agreed to stay for a while. But I waited for over 15mins and no one showed up, I wanted to leave, and he kept on stopping me, saying "the venue is already booked, you can't leave". Finally after an hour, the so-called manager came in. I was told by 'brother' he wanted to recurit me. But the 'manager' said it was a "<strong>business proposal (!!!)</strong>" somehow I managed to keep my calm and not get angry. I spoke sternly at the 'manager' and walked out on them.<br>And so the 'manager'? He's a poly student! No monthly pay too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Ok.... MLM company. NO monthly pay. Commission only. Very expensive products. Very bad recruitment. Now.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Three of my current classmates were called by Venture to be recruited. According to the caller, their contacts were gotten from a street survey. ;(<br><br>The "manager" is called We* C*en i believe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HAHAHA! Ive been to venture era. My first and last encounter with "MLM" !<br><br>Went there with my gf cos her friend introduced her to a "job" offer.<br><br>Ok la..so wat the heck.. no harm going down to see what they are doing..<br><br>Once reach the place see alot of "posers" in business clothes. The kinds that look like the typical ppl you see at coffee shops and shopping malls. But they all were trying to look cool and "professional"..<br><br>BUT.. once they open their mouth, from the ENGRISH that comes out from their mouth, i lost interest in what the guy was presenting to my gf and started to look arnd the office. The renovation looked cool with mysterious looking "water purification" and "health" products nicely displayed on illuminated shelfs. They even displayed their "ISO" certifications and badges for different levels of "SALES MAN n WOMEN" HAHA. By the time the guy finished his talking and started to demo the miracle magnet device on my gf i was half asleep. My butt was itching to get out of this place!!..<br><br>But too bad.. we were nice ppl and decided to wait for the "MANAGER" who wanted to talk to us. so while waiting, i told my gf what i tought of this place. Smells like a scam.<br><br>Now it was our turn to waste their time. Finally the manager came n we got into a room. There was this female dressed in smart office attire. But throughout the whole presentation, she was blowing her nose on a piece of tissue infront of us.<br><br>Every "unbelievable" promise she made to us was met with sarcasm from us. it was really entertaining to see how she tried to keep her cool and talk professionally.<br><br>i can remember how she was trying to describe this opportunity.<br><br>Manager: Ok. lets say you are walking down the street and you see something shiny. Like gold. You trip over it. Wont you stop to see what it is ? Just in case its really gold den you can benefit from it.??<br><br>my GF: no . i wont. i will just walk.<br><br>Manager: are you sure ? what if it is really gold ?<br><br>my GF: nolah. i say ready i wont stop . il just walk.<br><br>after that i think the manager finally realised we are not going to be recruited and ended her presentation. And we went to have our lunch at lau pa sat.<br><br>yayyy....stay away from MLM.</div>
