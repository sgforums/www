            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Let me share with you people one of me friends' experience with one of those people inside Venture Era. I shall call just this friend who went into Venture Era, Ken. Both me and him came to knew Ken through a common hobby, but ever since he got into that company he changed quite a lot. Not for the good but more for bad, even though he claimed that his company and his colleagues motivate him to be a better person.<br><br>A better person? In terms of being morally a better person or better in selling and promoting those stupid products? I dont know.<br><br>There was a time when me friend showed me his sms from Ken and told me that ever since he told Ken that he was intending to buy products that would improve his Mom's blood circulation, he kept pestering me friend through sms and calls to close the deal. Like persuading him to allow him speak to his parents about the products and even wanting to go up to his house to demonstrate the use of the products. But we know his motive - It was just to close a deal so that he could earn commission from it.<br><br>Ever since then Ken kept pestering him about it. He tried dropping hints to tell Ken that he dont want to buy those products and one fine day, he cant take it anymore. He told off Ken straight for it that he bought those kinda products from somewhere in Toa Payoh that he know he can trust.<br><br>As for this Ken now, he's just me and me friend's acquaintance. Despite several advices from him, he still insists that his company didnt do anything wrong but wants to help people to live a better life.<br><br>Yeah right. Why make others' life soooo miserable when they claimed the opposite?<br><br>Ken has been there for a few months. And he keeps boasting about how good his company is, how good his colleagues are, there are no office politics inside... etc.<br><br>The thing is, I suppose there're no office politics inside because everyone's just making use of another person to get to a higher position. Of course you would need better diplomatic ties with colleagues inside to achieve their means.<br><br>==<br><br>Regarding the abovementioned posts, I could only say that those people are simply COWARDS. They only know how to intimidate people into joining their company and buying their stuff. If they really got the shi2 li4, they wouldnt need to use these kind of methods.<br><br>Fresh Polytechnic students and youngsters are preys of their ruthless methods because it's often that they need money to support themselves and pay school fees and more. It's often because of financial reasons. THOSE PEOPLE ARE REALLY HEARTLESS.<br><br>The world out there... I've nothing more to say.<br><br>http://www.venture-eragroup.com.sg is their website. But there's nothing much inside except a forum. Asked Ken and he say the website is under construction. If they have the time to promote their bloody products, wont they have the time to complete their website? So tell me, what does that mean?<br><br>Read through the two Venture Era Group thread. I could only say that some of those VE people out there are really ignorant people. I've nothing more to say. If your products are good. You wont need to resort to forcing people to buy your products. They will buy them themselves.</div>
