One question you should ask is if they are teaching Sales or Business. There is a very big difference. Do you learn management? Do you learn HR? Marketing? What exactly do you learn there?<br><br>I don't know why you consult a physics lecturer on "bio magnets" but as far as my research goes, they don't work. Same for the "ionic purification systems". Its just that they are not harmful either. At best, the effects are inconclusive and cannot withstand detailed academic scrutiny. If you could be so kind, you might want to publish their research papers complete with the correct citations for me to read and I might be able to help you filter out the verbage.<br><br>Would you trust a radiologist who can't explain how his machine work? How about a cardiologist who can't explain how the heart works? If the company isn't able to provide sufficient training to allow the staff to be able to fully grasp how the products work, there is something seriously wrong.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think everyone's gettin the wrong idea here... hahs... i said it before... "im not too sure about their products". What i have said about the university lecturers? apparently mag. s.s. has a lot to do with physics... and again i say, APPARENTLY. im no physicist. The woman who had consulted with the physics lecturer only did so because she lost all faith in mag s.s., and wanted to see if anyone can say if it is even the littlest bit possible for it to work. the guy said its plausible. I admit its not like... super effective - i have it... it nothing special to me. All im saying is that for as long as they have a legitimate backup for their products, they have done no wrong. Even though the product dosent work. u wanna knnow the full science of it? well.... read up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>http://www.garynull.com/Documents/magnets.htm#ISSUES%20IN%20MAGNET%20THERAPY<br><br>i recall, however, that somewhere during the start of this year, some journalist decided to diss magnetic therapy in the straits times. I also recall that a whole forum, was after that dedicated to the whole realm of magnetic therapy, and if it works... Alot of the old chaps there flamed and bored holes into the journalists' story. I dont remember the url of the forum, and i dont think i owe it to anyone to go along searching for it - after all, im not an avid supporter of VE. but fact is - its still a debated topic. Debated because no one has been able to find out the true science of it yet. All we have are opinions, is it not? VE claims mag. therapy works through Electromagnetic Induction, working in effect with our body's ions and the magnet's field (as an extensively summarized explanation).<br><br>My beliefs for the products of VE are shakey, at best. Throughout, when i seem to have been defending VE, i am merely stating the point of view from an employee. What THEIR defense is. Dosent mean i buy it.<br><br>but i DO stand by my thoughts that they have done no wrong as of yet. Not legally,  at least.Their ethics may stink, but as i've said before... dosent matter. Their products may just be very expensive placebos - but they did their research enough to know how to handle counterarguments; which is why no one managed to complain so far as to shut down the company for fraud.<br><br>if u were to ask wat exactly i learn from them... i have learnt enough to know that it is nothing harmful to me. isn't that good enough? yeah, they teach HR... management... in its most basic forms... but in this context... i'd be happy to learn it.<br><br>and by god... when i said u can learn a thing or two there? i DEFINITELY did not mean science, "Mos"... if i based my science on them... i'd prolly be a bloody caveman by now... we all know that most VE employees are so blinded by positivity that they dont question at all. But at the same time, you cant just turn away from such a debatable, extensively researched topic with the lines "as far as MY research goes, it dont work." People who have been researching this (under scientific situations) for more than 15 years are still split into two. What more us? Again, these scientists have been replying in that forum i've said earlier... find someone from the inside to tell u the url.<br><br>and another thing - u cant compare mag. therapy to radiology. Radiologists kill if dumb enough. Magnetic therapy? at most, kills people with pacemakers(if those people are dumb enough to use it)<br><br>and yet, somehow i agree with you, eikei. The company is stupid enough to only address serious questions about how a product works when people start questioning.<br><br>the only reason why i joined VE, as i think i mentioned before... is experimentation. It was after my 'o's... i was bored... it wasnt about the money. i unfortunately have enough of that to not value it. So have faith that i wont join another MLM company...<br><br>to eikei... i have never actually heard anyone from VE say that mag s.s. used in hospitals. If they actually told you that... then i guess they are definitely at wrong in this matter... then again... these people would stop at nothing to make a sale. (i would know)<br><br>and i have noooo idea why they dont do retail... i have asked and asked and asked.. to me, the smartest thing to do would be to do retail AND mlm... but they say they can only go either way. sooo... yeah...</div>

You came to this forum seeking information and when you are provided the information you are unable to digest and comprehend the level of discussion here and hence have resorted to broad dismissals as a way of shrouding your personal inadequacies.<br><br>I have done the relevant research and have found the points and information provided for and pertaining to the conclusiveness of the studies made that magnetic mattresses and "ionic water" do not stand.<br><br>On top of that I work with youth startups and I know for certain that the "skills" learnt in VE cannot match real-world experience provided when working for youth SMEs in management, HR, client meetings, operations, logistics, marketing and other areas of running a regular business.<br><br>Before you post another more inconclusive post, why don't you do some research yourself and provide us with something that supports whatever real stand you hold? Somehow with your post I don't believe that you happen to come here for information anymore.</div>

This is a FORUM. all there is, is personal comments. i would also like to see eikei's studies for my own, and my friends' own good (i still hv friends in VE. if mag s.s. is really proven with science to be a scam.. i'd be happy to spread the idea). But at least i wont be arrogant enough to say its baseless and -irresponsible- before even looking at it.<br><br>you wanna be sincere? u wanna stop all this "personal comments" from going round that you oh-so-despise? post your findings - post your studies, and allow eikei to post his. Coz as sure as hell - no one would actually like to meet you (DUH!). meeting only way to prove one's sincerity? no phone? no keyboard? at least if more than one person proves sincere enough... YOU prove decent enough to share the abundance of information you have on why VE is so righteous to all of us.<br><br>oh, and THIS is something personal - stop trying to sound "chim" with your english when you dont know what you're talking about. Its irritating when grammer is all over the place, and words like "hidden agenda" are used as in caps as though it was a proud moment in your life when you knew such a word existed. Speak like the chinaman you were meant to be. At least then, i'd know you dont mean to sound bad. You just do.<br><br>peace<br><br>p.s. wondering why im all of a sudden so negative towards you? don't ask. You'd be gettin a heck of a long post.[/u]</div>
