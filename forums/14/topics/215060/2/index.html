            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Honestly speaking, how successful you are should NEVER EVER be based on materialistic stuff like cars and money and not even academic achievements. I personally believe that so long as your character and personality is good, you are good. And I believe that good people would really want to help others in the society to succeed, be healthier and wealthier and more.<br><br>It's more meaningful in me opinion to engage yourself in community involvements and voluntary work rather than to benefit yourself with cars and money from helping others. It's more meaningful that you receive education so that you have the knowledge to be able to help others.<br><br>So what's the point of trying to display all your achievements here? What's the point of haolian-ing? We will never be able to hold on to our achievements forever because at the end of the day, we cannot take them along with us when we die. The only stuff we could be able to bring it along would be our merits and deeds, how much we've help others but through our hearts and our actions. Not the products which some of you may be selling, not the money and the cars and whatever that you may get from selling.<br><br>I dont claim to know everything. But at least I know what's truly right and what's truly wrong. I believe in working somewhere where I deserve everything that I've worked hard for and NOT somewhere where I work, but other people also gets the credits for something that they didnt work for. If you dont get me, you will never get what I say.<br><br>Let me end with Crazy by Simple Plan.</div>
