So what if you've achieved soooo much? Is that such a need to tell others how much you achieve? If it's not haolian, if it's not boasting, what is it called? Sharing your experiences? PLEASE! This is not the way, I rather you people share experiences about how you people've helped others than boasting off income and whatevers. I am not interested in all these.<br><br>Being able to help others through useful means like volunteering for the old folks' home and children's home should be the way of life.<br><br>GET A LIFE.</div>

Please dont try to challenge people with your childish tactics.<br>You've already showed off that much of your stupid attitude. Why do you want to provoke people unnecessarily.

I'd think we are pretty reasonable people... we don't flame someone just because he / she is a network marketeer (if that was what you think we're doing)<br><br>In a nutshell... I cannot stomach his ego... "Sharing of achievements" should sound like... "I climbed Mt Everest" or "I was a part of the volunteer corps to Iraq" or "I started my own business with $1"... Now, that's what I call news-worthy.<br><br>If you are questioning our intention in this forum... maybe you can answer that for us too... cos apparently you are in this forum as well.<br><br>Please don't blame me too... I just think it is unfair for you to think that we are slaying an innocent sheep... btw... I don't think we went too far... did we?<br></div>
