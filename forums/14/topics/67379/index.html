So the damage is done.<br><br>This is not the first time sgforum is famous for revealing 'stuff'. The newspaper and TV which reported the case of army deaths in SAF get their sources from here, while few prominent journalists also suspected to come here to get info or to discuss.

Then let me tell you guys one thing.<br><br>When ntiparis was at its infancy, well with its infant minded agents, my friends and I tried to persuade those who joined not to, coz we can see nti is full of crap. We wouldnt be surprised if nti people just tell its people not to listen, coz a lot of MLM companies are telling their agents not to listen to those so called 'dreams stealers' What shocked me was firstly the drastic change in attitude and zombie minds of nti agents.<br><br>I have never see before MLMers who seems to like treat their bosses with reverence, such as those given to God. Nobody chose to give nti plans a thought, and jumped in. Like what experienced said, people in Malaysia, who joined NOP also were brainwashed that way. NOP was made hot, but in the end loses money and started to downsize. Why dont you ask many Malaysians who were victims of it?<br><br>Second thing that shocked me was the change in attitude and new hostilities towards others. My friends around those nti agents noted the changes, and pointed it out when we gathered for outings. I also have noted they became more hostile too when i see them.<br><br>Thirdly was this conspiracies theories, attacks on integrities and various rumours that are spread by nti agents. I was a victims of it too. Coz many of my friends knew me closely, they didnt succumbed to these rumours. Gosh, didnt know you guys are part time scriptwriter for Mediacock too...If you guys had been subjected to various rumours against you that are not true, you can feel the anguish.<br><br>Once gugu bird, monkeywarriors and donkeywarriors start posting craps, I knew straightaway they are nti agents without them announcing. Coz what they typed is the same as what I know of ntiagents. Crap. Dont believe me, read songboz, dennislam and other people posts about their friends. They can see the changes too and songboz post about senior agents teaching their juniors how to 'outtalk' newer prospects. You will know what I meant<br><br>Lastly, I must thank all monkey, donkey and birdie who posted here, coz you have shown how 'crap' become the staple of ntiparis brainwashing sessions everynight. You cannot get rid of me here, by justing posting nonsense. Neither can you get rid of other who spoke against ntiparis. Think you can eliminate us one by one here? Haha, think again.<br><br>Btw, gugu bird, here what i think of your postings.<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=65950" rel="nofollow">Bird Droppings</a> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

Don't make it sound like only ntiparis agents are disgusted with your "integrity", you're not that popular lah. shessh... as what i've mentioned, you're abusing your 'reputation' in the forum... starting your own brainwashing session... the pot calling the kettle black... Look at how long your reply is.... aiye.. you're gonna dominate this thread again.. my dear hypo guru.<br><br>It's only fair enough for your friends to be pissed off with you, given your "informative" propaganda against what they believe in. you deserve it. Quit making yourself a victim of the circumstance and do some soul searching... maybe you're not worth their friendship afterall. Eliminating you?? I wonder again...
