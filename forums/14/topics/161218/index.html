            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I beg to differ, currently the business i am in offers 3 months full money-back guarantee. I dun see any shops outside offering the same sort of satisfaction guarantee.<br><br>The reason is simply due to the confidence of the quality of the products by the company and to give the customer full service and satisfaction etc.<br><br>I also give any of my customers full service on the products, after they bought, how they find it etc, and willing to help them if they have any problems..which I personally dun see in any supermarkets. Sometimes we have promotions too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for the price, there are many products that are in fact comparable to supermarket prices if u can analyze it and calculate it. The quality is in fact much better as can be shown by the product demos or even simply trying it. It is quite value for money. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The reason as to why my company's products are so unique and special is due to the 500+ patents. It is not easy to hold 1..but 500 is the confidence that is given not just to us but to the customers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the so called magnetic beds that cost $1500 for a single bed and $2500-$3000 for king size bed.... I dont even feel any difference.. even though there may be statistical results that show magnetic beds are good for health.... im still better off eating well, exercising regular, and maintaining a healthy state of mind.<br><br>plus the so called vitamins and health food they are selling, GNC which is a reputable american company sells them too... and in an array of choices. and they offer great discounts from time to time.... why would I ditch GNC for some weird named health supplement from an MLM company that probably cost twice what I can get at places like NTUC health or GNC?<br><br>oh yah.. the so called personal retailing and services MLM companies provide... guess what??!! outsid retail shops provide them too! GNC has so called trained specialist to provide you help with choosing the supplements of your requirement, provide additional information, and they provide refund too for unsatisfactory results. and for all of that.... at a much lower cost than mlm products...<br><br></div>

That is why basing on that assumption, alot of people were swindled of their money by those African scams via emails etc, because it is by email and it sounds so true that some desperate soul need their help to transfer millions of dollars and give them a cut as commission.<br><br>Anyway, have tried a few so-called fantastic products from reputable MLM global companies. Does zlich to me. Don't get me wrong. I'm not comparing them with supermarket products but I did rather pay the same amount of money for my over-the-counter branded cosmetics which work.<br><br>Difference might be, I'm paying a premium for ads and branding and maybe the image, but isn't it better than paying for a popular MLM brand which is not mainstream and really isn't worth that much as well because I'm supporting a whole line of people  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Of course there are also equally good mid-ranged products which are good as well.<br><br>Ultimately, it still boils down to grossly inflated prices because of the marketing system.

It's how much quality the company is willing to spend on the products and willing to produce really gd products, nothing to do with mlm..we cannot classify mlm and non-mlm products just like dat.
