            <div class='col-md body'>i`m actually refering to the emcom project.<br><br>targeting on human greed and laziness , we tend to go for the easiest way out to earn money . no choice its human nature .<br><br>Put money take money who dont want? haha<br><br>Investors did sign an agreement on watever they invested . its 100% get back . but project earnining money or not is the other issue.<br><br>quote a very simple example<br><br>u dump in $1000 , and every month they will definitely give u back a return of 10% of the whole monthly turn over , distributed equally among those investor . After 10 month u will get back wat u had dump in . say its ard $100 + -<br>than 90% lay? company take lo<br>if theres 1000 people . 1000x$1000= 1 million<br>10% of 1 million = $100,000<br>100,000/1000 investor = $100each person<br><br>so 10 months u will recoup back what u invested.<br><br>balance 90% lay? $900,000 x 10 mth = $9 million.<br><br>2 parties also earn , most importanly is i dump money into 4d also dont want let the company earn , cos u reflect back on the past history of NTI u all should know.<br><br>ORIGINALLY POSTED BY OTHER PEOPLE.<br><br>A Wolf Hiding in a Sheep's Clothings.<br><br>Project No: (Correct Me If I'm Wrong)<br>1) late 1970s- early 1980s if i didnt recall wrongly<br>Magical Kindom which Involves many people in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Each Lot of the Resort cost SG$5000 per Lot.<br><br>He took a lot, than was declared a Bankrupt before.<br><br>2) Life-Time Profit Sharing. (March 2005)<br>Just recalled Back this plan, at the Start of this plan, he already broke his promise of 20% turn-over to Gold Merchants at that part of time, then it dropped to 5% after the 1st pay-out.<br><br>A leader who has no Integrity of holding onto his Promise at all.<br><br>3) Singapore's Own NTI Country Club. (August 2005 around this month if not earlier.)<br>They RENT the whole Country Club for 1 month, than the lease of the developer expired already, thus they lost the Country Club.<br><br>When they decide to rent it, they just look at the surface, they don't look into details.<br><br>So with the 4th project - Emcom. How trusty is the project. time will maybe prove me wrong , or rather correct.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>actually how much is the rate of return stated on the investment sheet? banks are paying a fixed dep rate of what 2 - 3%? and it's the big banks... UT and SP not even projecting 10%, let alone guaranteeing anything remotely there....<br><br>so if this emcom project is full of promises that it can fulfil, two things then:-<br><br>1. regulated by MAS - all financial services that are legit must be approved, however in this case, i believe the MAS ALert List has flagged it.<br><br>2. it would have sold out like mad long ago and it probably should be accompanied by big publicity and advertising blitz.... I didn't see any.<br><br>So I think consumer beware as there might be some truth to what's being dished out here.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just invested in emcom, now i'm worried as i could not even open the link to 'merchant sign-in'. Does anyone know what to do? Was there an agreement or some sort as i did not sign anything. They say that there was never anything that investors had to sign, now i'm starting to feel something is fishy. Obtaining username and password to investors should be a top priority thing, but it has been more than one week. Where is my money? And i saw from the threads in the NTI, there was someone who says that if you do <span style="color: red;">not recruit any member</span> then you will be deemed as to voluntarily quit. is this true? can someone please reply to this? thank you.</div>

Does anyone know what to do? Was there an agreement or some sort as i did not sign anything. They say that there was never anything that investors had to sign, now i'm starting to feel something is fishy. Obtaining username and password to investors should be a top priority thing, but it has been more than one week. Where is my money? And i saw from the threads in the NTI, there was someone who says that if you do <span style="color: red;">not recruit any member</span> then you will be deemed as to voluntarily quit. is this true? can someone please reply to this? thank you. </div></blockquote>hey, check out with ur upline now, the person who brought u in. supposingly there is an application form to sign, n tat application form is very impt to sign, as all the rules n regulations r stated dere. maybe they are holdin up sales, so dun worry.. but if u dunno the person for long, pls go check it out with the person, lest he run away.. =)<br></div>
