Infact he has made the president sound like an angel hasn't he? Let's look at it on the other side of the fence. Which general is dumb enough not to utilize troops that are ready at his disposal? Troops that worship the very path that he treads. Hanging onto every word that he says?<br><br>Ok boys and girls, lets do some basic maths...<br><br>Each loyal soldier = $1000<br>1000 loyal soldier = $1000,000<br><br>The general only need to give out a 10% dividend. This works works out to be a measly $100,000 but a $900,000 profit for the wonderful general!!!! With the newfound trust the general obtained (hey he is giving out money in the 1st month so our dear friend can take taxi everyday...) he can easily recruit another 2000 troops through word of mouth. Perfect and ingenious. Plus this troops probably know little about protecting themselves and have little power to engage in the legal battlefield.<br><br>The start is always beautiful isn't it...<br><br>Regards,<br>BKKboy</div></blockquote>Emcom is not a public listed company, thats why it can't raise money by selling its stocks and share, i agree that business time might be better than newspaper for investment, but i still prefer that someone tell me then i go and see myself.

What i meant is that no shareholders, especially profit-making one, would allow investors to earn to the fullest extent.

Also can give us a feel of how much he put in so that we can compare the scale of the dividend with the amount he put in as it's really misleading?<br><br>Also I'm sure when we sign people up, we do get a small fee. I've confirmed that with several of my friends who are inside.<br><br>Let us know more about your friend's opinion when he gets back. I'm really interested to see how it stacks up with the competition. I'm quite sure Emcom is building something there but the crux of the question is how it stacks up against company like APTG who has chosen an industry giant in this sense to do up a free network. Are Emcom technologies superior? Are they the only one who can promise wireless while traveling at highspeed? What are their plans to counter the free wireless? How much are they going to charge for their services? These are just some of the questions I have now.</div></blockquote>Maybe i can answered some of these.<br><br>The profit-sharing we are getting every month is usually 5-10% of our investment.<br><br>As we are in a MLM company, of cos when we refer people we will get some comission from our com plan.<br><br>How we complete with APTG ?  We are just speed building to outbeat them.  We are already finishing 1 part of taiching where APTG has not even started their building.<br>Anyway the network is not gonna be free like singapore for 3 years.  In fact its maybe for a few months only,  Just for the trial operations.<br>Emcom itself has aids from its D.T Team (Taiyee) which had build tam shui and gaoxiong before, and their infrastructure will enable us to use internet when travelling in moving vehicle, while APTG is only trying to build something similar to what we have in singapore.<br>The charges we have is definately cheaper then current market subscription, but the actual price have to wait til the company in operation.</div>
