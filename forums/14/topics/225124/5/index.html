If we use TV and Newspaper it might be costly and no as effective as most people do not watch commerical or advertisement on paper too closely.</div></blockquote>We all know about the notorious reputations of MLM companies as being come-n-go. Make money, change name/strategy. With such a 'prestigious' project under their wings, one has to wonder why they would choose such a flawed and slow way of generating funds.<br><br>Firstly, I would like to point out that investors do read the newspapers for investment oppurtunities. Of course if you advertise in The New Paper you would be hardup to find investors. However it would be a different story if you advertise in the Business Times would it not?<br><br>I'm sure we all know of IPO's being purchased within the hour. This is definately not through MLM. Millions of funds generated within the hour!! If millions can be generated with little need to give out dividends within the month, why would a company resort to MLM method?<br><br>One possiblity is that the MLM company can effectively skirt the authorities by using word-of-mouth testimonials, and possibly other misrepresentations that would have been questioned by the general public, investments that would be slammed by real investors...<br><br><blockquote><strong> Originally posted by LegacyMan:<br><br>And finally main reason why this investment is in MLM is because the internation president of Emcom is a network marketer himself, he wishes to benefits all his agents under his NM company.  This may sound fishy but its really the truth.</strong></blockquote>LegacyMan has brought up an interesting point. Infact he has made the president sound like an angel hasn't he? Let's look at it on the other side of the fence. Which general is dumb enough not to utilize troops that are ready at his disposal? Troops that worship the very path that he treads. Hanging onto every word that he says?<br><br>Ok boys and girls, lets do some basic maths...<br><br>Each loyal soldier = $1000<br>1000 loyal soldier = $1000,000<br><br>The general only need to give out a 10% dividend. This works works out to be a measly $100,000 but a $900,000 profit for the wonderful general!!!! With the newfound trust the general obtained (hey he is giving out money in the 1st month so our dear friend can take taxi everyday...) he can easily recruit another 2000 troops through word of mouth. Perfect and ingenious. Plus this troops probably know little about protecting themselves and have little power to engage in the legal battlefield.<br><br>The start is always beautiful isn't it...<br><br>Regards,<br>BKKboy</div>

You mentioned that company dun let their agents earn largely, therefore i told you, whether large or not will depends how you define the amount and surly the agent wun be earning more than the company do.</div></blockquote>Wrong. Thats not what i meant<br><br>Agents are not shareholders, but merely investors in a single project. And it is the company management who control the accounts. What i meant is that no shareholders, especially profit-making one, would allow investors to earn to the fullest extent. For example, if its calculated investors would gain 80% of the project profits, do you think shareholders/company gladly take out 80% for agents and leave 20% for themselves?<br><br>the fallen, although i may argued with him, know how it works during investments. There are a lot of hidden costs, creative accounting etc we may not know..and possibly would not know. None of the agents are part of management, so none of them would know. Meaning that comparing investment for investment, i could get competitive ROI from the market instead.<br><br>APTG, being NASDAQ listed, is putting itself up for scrutiny all the time, from auditors to market sentiment. It easier for me to collect info on how it is doing compared to companies like Emcom. Which is another point I raised, how is this investment from Emcom covered and insured under the local MAS regulations?<br><br>Lastly, someone raised another similar point. APTG is strong enough capitally to be listed on NASDAQ. This may have an impact on the market share of both companies in Taichung for the long term. Think about it.<br><br></div>

" DO U BELIEVE U CAN DRIVE A EVO AT THE AGE OF 20 , I DO??" , something like that.....cant really remember the exact sentence he used.<br>seriously.....i dont know this guy stupid or what , actually believes that ppl will be "drag" in to his mlm network this way... omg.<br><br>oh yah , NUS_Superst@r are u really from NUS ? u dont look like one from the way you advertise here.. hehe<br><br>no hard feelings but... i always think that ppl who believes in mlm is either stupid or too naive . the clever ones are those above above above them. </div></blockquote>Hi, I am not too stupid or naive that I never doubt this investment. In fact, the first thing that comes to my mind is it must be a scam. However, after some investigation, I decide to take the risk and invest. I will not want to miss out a n opportunity to make it big so decide to invest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey superstar,<br><br>When you say your friend got back a dividend of how much, do you really mean dividend in the strict sense of the word? Also can give us a feel of how much he put in so that we can compare the scale of the dividend with the amount he put in as it's really misleading?<br><br>Also I'm sure when we sign people up, we do get a small fee. I've confirmed that with several of my friends who are inside.<br><br>Let us know more about your friend's opinion when he gets back. I'm really interested to see how it stacks up with the competition. I'm quite sure Emcom is building something there but the crux of the question is how it stacks up against company like APTG who has chosen an industry giant in this sense to do up a free network. Are Emcom technologies superior? Are they the only one who can promise wireless while traveling at highspeed? What are their plans to counter the free wireless? How much are they going to charge for their services? These are just some of the questions I have now.</div>
