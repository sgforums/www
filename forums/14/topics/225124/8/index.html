I mean we don't even know they can make profits. This is what I think:<br><br>1. They definately have the technology, but the marketing method seems suspect. Why would they need to raise so much funds ($40 million), only to give out dividends? Plus they have not even started operations! How can they ensure that they can continue profits even after using these funds for the infastructures? From the way I see it, new investor funds are used to roll, to keep the old guys happy... mmh one day they will run out of funds to roll if no new investors come in.<br><br>2. Assuming that Emcom loses out to the other company, (we wouldn't know will we? Operations hasn't start yet.) What is Emcoms' strategy? Up to now I know nuts about Emcom's business plan. Their key draw point seems to be the early dividends. Infact that seems to be their only advantage?<br><br>Do keep me posted.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bangkokboy:</div><div class="quote_body">Interestingly they can get so many people to invest without even starting operations... I mean we don't even know they can make profits. This is what I think:<br><br>1. They definately have the technology, but the marketing method seems suspect. Why would they need to raise so much funds ($40 million), only to give out dividends? Plus they have not even started operations! How can they ensure that they can continue profits even after using these funds for the infastructures? From the way I see it, new investor funds are used to roll, to keep the old guys happy... mmh one day they will run out of funds to roll if no new investors come in.<br><br>2. Assuming that Emcom loses out to the other company, (we wouldn't know will we? Operations hasn't start yet.) What is Emcoms' strategy? Up to now I know nuts about Emcom's business plan. Their key draw point seems to be the early dividends. Infact that seems to be their only advantage?<br><br>Do keep me posted. One day I will raise funds for my company using this method.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Regards,<br>BKKboy</div></blockquote>Raise fund is to build the wireless infrastructure.  Anyway there is 2 ROI for this partnership.<br><br>1) gurantee profit-sharing from sunshine-empire (10% sales revenue)<br>2) ROI from emcom's internet and VOIP subscription (50% profit)<br><br>From the start we have mentioned to all investor that the ROI from emcom is not guranteed.<br><br>Anyway the phrases has a end and when thet come we will get ROI from the Emcom if they earn profit.<br><br>U know nuts of Emcom business plan is because you are not invloved with it, even us agents does not know how they are planning to operate.  Anyway there is not gurantee that a company can earn profit, but at least if we dun try we wun know.<br><br>Well if you think the raise fund way is good, i guess no one will obejct that u use it.<br><br>End of the day, we can only wait and see how emcom goes, neither you or i can predict emcom's future.</div>

What I would love to know is Emcom's advantage over Promax, the platorm provider for APTG. What draws investors to Emcom and not Promax now? I'm sure they let on abit of their business plan, if not how to attract investors?</div>

A secretary and 3 directors.  Is there what you are refering ?<br><br>2) I do agree with your points that we should know where the money goes, but as i say the company is not prepare to give us their finanical report.  Mainly because its a pte company too.<br><br>Thats why i always say, if you believe you join, if not better don't.  Anyway they do tell us where the money goes to, but thats verbally not black and white.<br><br>Anyway when u buy a equalilty you also dunno where the fund manager invest it in.  You only know its on certain countries and maybe certain company only.  And of cos high risk equal to high return.<br><br>Anyway here's the link to Emcom's Corporate Blog.  Its currently using blogspot, it has latest news of Emcom development.  Those interested to know more can read in it.<br><br>http://emcom.blogspot.com</div>

Its a nation wide project and any company can participated in it.  The problem now lies on whether are you aids by the govt or doing it as private.<br><br>2) Emcom had already aquired 70% of Bluengine shares.  Whether its personnel or whatever is unknown to us.
