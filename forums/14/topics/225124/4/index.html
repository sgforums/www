If you are afraid, just put your money in fixed deposit. That's the safest but of cos, the return is pathetic. Yes, I already read the contract very carefully and no tricks are involved. That's the way a contract should be or else, why should we even sign a contract? Finally, all I can say is you should invest the amt you are comfortable with. Of cos, when ppl earn back from their investments, you will still be yourself and dun have the sour-grape mentality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
