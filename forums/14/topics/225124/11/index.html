Is it a trusty steed or some cranky old donkey?<br><br>Because emcom's future is still unknown, I will like to tell everyone not to jump to conclusions. It might be a fantastic investment for all we know.<br><br>Personally I feel that everyone has the right to know more about emcom, hence the need for discussions right? It should never be a one-sided affair. There will always be detractors, it's part of life. Take comments positively and if you are right, the truth will prevail.<br><br>What we want people to know is that before they make any investments, do at least some research AND please do know what you are getting in return. I was right about the dividends, the amount of money NUS_Superst@r was getting was not dividends but "capital assurance".<br><br>Will there be a time "capital assurance" outstrips investments and profits?
