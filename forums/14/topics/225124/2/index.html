            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Mmh seems like another overly enthusiatic MLM newbie. In the short term everything will seem ok in the company, but hey lets not let this get to our heads. Before you talk about spending the money you earn in Emcom, let's talk about how much you put in, ie. Time &amp; Money. If you haven't recover your capital put in then it's not profit yet.<br><br>On the other hand, let's say you have recovered your profits, have your downlines recovered theirs? It's a never ending cycle and it's those suckers at the bottom who will curse and swear. Come on, if MLM system is perfect, the whole Singapore should be doing MLM by now. Based on their rosy forcast, everyone can easily find 2 person right? WRONG.<br><br>I know how you feel, because I "made" $7400 in my very first month in MLM... but if you ask me now, I would rather have a normal job, lead a simple and less complicated life. I would also prefer a clear consience...<br><br>Right now I am working in Bangkok (a small little business), it doesn't promise me the big money, but at least I am happy.<br><br>Regards,<br>Bangkokboy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Infact I've never used the word scam. All I am trying to tell you Mr NUS_Superst@r is that in the real world, there is a veil for every single thing. Uncover that veil and what is underneath might be sweet and nice OR rot and bugs.<br><br>Anyway your argument is quite hilarous. Would google hire emcom to do their marketing for them? We cannot take a huge company like Yahoo or Google as a yardstick.<br><br>I use to be like you, over-enthusiatic, over-believing to the point of being irrational. I refused to listen to other people, including people who probably have seen more of the world than me. Experience in the real world counts, every single bit. Everything that we read or learned CANNOT be compared to experiences garnered by one's own action.<br><br>I've walked that path before, all I am telling you is watch out for the potholes, this road is never smooth sailing.<br><br>Regards,<br>BKKBoy</div>
