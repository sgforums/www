            <div class='col-md body'>I kind of share Rustyhong's views on this.<br><br>Why would a company raise funds using MLM through the man in the street instead of getting a loan from banks / venture capitalists or through a IPO?<br>I suspect that the financials of the company is not something to be proud of.<br><br>That is not the only problem. I visited their website and i cannot seem to find any thing that is super wonderful about their prospects. What exactly is their revenue model?<br><br>There's a reason why companies choose to market themselves direct to customers on the street.   Just think about it.<br>Anyway, there's also a long thread at another forum<br><br>No offence to anybody, i am not saying that money cannot be made, but somehow i suspect that it may be blood money.<br><br></div>

Just by reading a few investment books...<br><br>Dun lose money is quite a impt factor, but it cannot be avoid. Sure, u can play safe on your investment. U play safe u earn slow, so that depends on individual's risk level.<br><br>Just take forex as an eg, if the currency u buy drop 1 cent, den u immediately exit the trade. Bec of your dun lose money rule. Then 2 mins later it rise 5 cents. So u lose ultimately. But if you take a risk n hold for another 2 mins things will be diff. Dun just follow book says, U try it yourself.<br><br>Im not saying his teaching is lousy, but the person who write the book is one of the richest man in the world. If you are as rich as him or got lots of fund to take care of, den i will say follow his rule lo, bec losing 0.01% will be in millions liao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nikonman:</div><div class="quote_body">No worries, Legacyman, at the end of this venture, I am sure you will learn more about setting up a company, running a company and managing a company. Read up a bit on proper Corporate Governance, the Company Act, Business laws in Singapore and you will know how to monitor a Company in terms of Funds and Assets management. Take this as a good opportunity to improve yourself and you will be able to get maximum benefits from it.<br><br>Since you mentioned equity and funds, fund managers have to abide by the laws and regulations state down by MAS. Since you mentioned that Emcom dont have to abide by MAS laws previously, Emcom can technically invest your money in any ventures or projects (look at the RCB, is it registered as a trading/investment company too?) as approved by the board of directors.<br><br>So if they want to invest 40 million in oil, buy daimond/gold toilets or a yatch as company assets, pay themselves 1 million bucks per month as salary,  there is nothing u, as investment lot owner can do, why? Cos you are investment lots owners but not a shareholder  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So how do you protect yourself from these practices? A competent and independent board of directors to approve/monitor major fund transfer. Independent auditors to audit practices (say directors can have entertainment fees up to 1 million bucks a month) and best of all, a independet consultancy firms to implement good Corporate governance into Emcom, with proper checks and audits being conducted.<br><br>Hope this will help. Its not a matter of beliefs. Its a matter of knowledge and protecting your own interests.</div></blockquote>Yeah thanks for the info, i will definately read up on it,<br><br>But i guess we have to trust the company that they will not spent the investor money on unnecesary cost.</div>
