They will take out 10% of their month sales turnover and pay to all the investors.<br><br>You could read the term and condition in <a href="http://sunshine-empire.com" rel="nofollow">Sunshine Empire</a> website, click the "Sign Up".<br>The Emcom agreement i can't upload it cos i do not have a scanner, sorry about that.<br><br>About the advertising part, we choose MLM is because we all know that spreading news by mouth to mouth is the fastest way to let most people know and understand about the project.  If we use TV and Newspaper it might be costly and no as effective as most people do not watch commerical or advertisement on paper too closely.<br><br>And finally main reason why this investment is in MLM is because the internation president of Emcom is a network marketer himself, he wishes to benefits all his agents under his NM company.
