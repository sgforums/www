            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LegacyMan:</div><div class="quote_body">1) Ok if there's what you mean then Emcom have,  sorry for my lack of knowledge for Companies.<br><br>In the RCB of Emcom we have, there is 4 names in it.  A secretary and 3 directors.  Is there what you are refering ?<br><br>2) I do agree with your points that we should know where the money goes, but as i say the company is not prepare to give us their finanical report.  Mainly because its a pte company too.<br><br>Thats why i always say, if you believe you join, if not better don't.  Anyway they do tell us where the money goes to, but thats verbally not black and white.<br><br>Anyway when u buy a equalilty you also dunno where the fund manager invest it in.  You only know its on certain countries and maybe certain company only.  And of cos high risk equal to high return.<br><br>Anyway here's the link to Emcom's Corporate Blog.  Its currently using blogspot, it has latest news of Emcom development.  Those interested to know more can read in it.<br><br>http://emcom.blogspot.com</div></blockquote>No worries, Legacyman, at the end of this venture, I am sure you will learn more about setting up a company, running a company and managing a company. Read up a bit on proper Corporate Governance, the Company Act, Business laws in Singapore and you will know how to monitor a Company in terms of Funds and Assets management. Take this as a good opportunity to improve yourself and you will be able to get maximum benefits from it.<br><br>Since you mentioned equity and funds, fund managers have to abide by the laws and regulations state down by MAS. Since you mentioned that Emcom dont have to abide by MAS laws previously, Emcom can technically invest your money in any ventures or projects (look at the RCB, is it registered as a trading/investment company too?) as approved by the board of directors.<br><br>So if they want to invest 40 million in oil, buy daimond/gold toilets or a yatch as company assets, pay themselves 1 million bucks per month as salary,  there is nothing u, as investment lot owner can do, why? Cos you are investment lots owners but not a shareholder  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So how do you protect yourself from these practices? A competent and independent board of directors to approve/monitor major fund transfer. Independent auditors to audit practices (say directors can have entertainment fees up to 1 million bucks a month) and best of all, a independet consultancy firms to implement good Corporate governance into Emcom, with proper checks and audits being conducted.<br><br>Hope this will help. Its not a matter of beliefs. Its a matter of knowledge and protecting your own interests.</div>
