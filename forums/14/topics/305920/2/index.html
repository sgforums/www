              <p>Haha, ya? Laurence82 I do agree to the cunning and cheap part though...<br>Some of them really turned nasty but lucky they are those I do not know so well, phew!</p>
              <p>Oh, cute bear there ^^<br>So what you mean by convincing others the success of his business model rather than doing business with it? Isn't business done this way? Please enlighten me, thanks ^^</p>
              <p>So Akramdin66, I've glanced through a few books on MLM at the Library, they all looked the same. You have any suggestions on what books to read for non-MLMers? I'm very interested in the way they work but I don't want to be involved in it right now, maybe after I've understood what the whole thing is all about. ^^</p>

              <p>aiki, I am currently reading The Science of getting Rich, not an MLM book but an old classic by Wallace Wattle. The first MLM book I read was My First year in Network Marketing by Mark Yarnell. I remember regretting that I had not read the book before jumping into MLM and making mistakes re-inventing the wheel.</p>
              <p>My sister read about 50 books before deciding to do MLM and quitting her thriving real estate business. She went straight into 5th gear and became the top distributor in asia for the company.</p>

              <p>Hi all..</p>
              <p> David here,</p>
              <p> I came across this website and i myself happen to be in a MLM company Venture Era. I must say that in this MLM job. Its not easy.</p>
              <p>There are people who are scared of MLM outside and i agree that most of my friends and even my parents think its a scam or grabing people's money.</p>
              <p>I currently holds a SE rank in Venture Era and i hope to be a ME soon. Up till now, i already got many rejections already and some of my friends post me very hard questions to challenge me about the product that my company have.</p>
              <p> I have gone for a lot of sales appointments already and so far only 2 sales that are closed and 2 more pending.</p>
              <p>But i told myself not to give up as yet. Even though i may have poor health condittion myself, i am working very hard atleast 6 hours aday every 4 days per week.</p>
              <p>My wish for singaporeans is that i hope they will start to look at the bright side of MLM and not to look at it as a scam. Only SAs who give up half way will think that MLM is bad.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I was reading through your posts and found it compelling enough for me to create an account just to post here. I frankly find your behavior very disturbing. It is nice that you put your heart and soul and you believe very strongly in what you do with enthusiasm. But what if I told whatever you have done for was all one big lie? <span> </span>(I’m not saying VE is one but for you to contemplate over)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-That your hard sweat and time just to close a few meager deals would be ripped off by people above you who don’t care much for you beyond the deals that you close? </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-That the products that you sell to others in hopes of helping them are actually overpriced items that have no conclusive or scientific proven benefits. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">-That for those few dollars, you risk jeopardizing personal relationships.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If people making use of your blind faith to do everything above, would you live in self-denial or would question your mindset for once?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To be fair to you, people are naïve and ignorant at least once in their learning years. My advice to you is to get over this phase quickly enough or you will definitely be exploited all your life because you really seem like a person who trusts easily and believe anything he is fed. <span> </span>Your youth is precious enough not to be wasted on these kinds of trivial pursuits. If you put all these effort into a fulltime stable job, you will definitely gain much more in terms of monetary and job progression rewards and I can say that you will probably be "really" successful.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Not say I hate MLM or want to discourage you but sit down, look around you. Look at things from all perspective and not from the hype that those seminars feed you to get you motivated. These are the street-smart skills that you need to apply not just in finding jobs but in whatever important life decisions you make in the future.</span></span></p>
