            <div class='col-md body'>a few days ago, i joined NTIparis, thanks to a "friend" and spend $1600+ which is alot for someone my age. regreted my decisions afterward.. tried to get refund, and can't cos technically i have agreed by signing the MOPI, and the other forms. (yes, i can only blame my stupidity for tht <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br>earning back my money by inviting my friends to join is definitely not an option for me. cos the way i see it, friendship is priceless, and it's not worth to sacrifice tht for a measly few hundred bucks.<br>so i decided to let it go and learn from this experience...<br><br>haiz... is not tht NTIparis is a scam or anything, but wat disgust me is the age group they target which is ppl ard 18-20s who is more naive and gullible<br>and the way they did it... they are professional, they know wat ppl our age really want like quick money, experience, recognition,etc etc<br>they are very persistent too, for me i got a 5-6hours of convincing be4 i finally "lost" ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> too bad i not as mentally strong as other ppl)<br><br>lastly i just wan to say tht i am not anti-mlm or anything, but i just wan to advice everyone out there to be more careful.. nvr act on impulse, and make sure u know 100% sure wat u are getting into<br><br></div>
