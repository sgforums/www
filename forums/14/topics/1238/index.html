            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, i must state that i am not against any company or anyone. I personally feel that no matter which company (Forever Living, Bel'Air, Astral Mag, Asayo, Amway, Newway, Sun Rider, NOP, WBG, Nuskin, Venture Era, Shuang He, Ai Kang, Easecox and so on). Their health products definitely can help to promote health. It's true that the product these companies' products might be abit costly but if it can benefit our kin, i think it's worth it. However, i feel that their price are quite reasonable because no matter what stuff we are buying, the price will be mark up by alot. These definitely depends on a person's perception. Different people think differently. I think most people who are distributor for all these company are good at heart. They just want to help to give their kin better health. Of course, they will get some benefit from the sales but that's not the main point. Maybe i code an example, if i open a handphone shop and my relative want to get a handphone, maybe they will buy from me. Reason is they might want to let me earn rather then others. But of course if i can give them discount that will be better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Morever, more and more networking company will be set up as networking is the trend from the 21st century. If the distributors don't sell the health to their kin, eventually, others will. In years to come, people will not be negative towards networking, rather, it's which company that they are thinking of joining that is the question.<br><br>Every industry will have their grey zone follow by awareness stage and lastly establish stage. A very life example is insurance. No one believe insurance when it's in it's grey zone meaning first started but now insurance is so well establish that almost everyone will have at least an insurance policy. Likewise for networking, it's is now moving towards awareness stage. I believe those people who persist on will be reward one day. Persist is the key word, it's just a matter of whether a person can withstand cristicism from friends, kins and others. Some people can't take it and gave up therefore leading them to the thinking that networking can't work. Also, when friends and kins seeing that they gave up. This also gave them the misconception that networking can't work out.<br><br>I personally feel that why networking is legalised is because retrenchment rate in Singapore now is too high. Alot of big networking companies are aiming the China market now. Once they enter the WTO next year, networking will be legalised in China because alot of people in China will be retrench in the coming years. Networking is actually a way of doing business for people who come from family that's not well off, not born in silver spoon and have don't have heritage of business from parent. Reason is because when network are form commission are split across the network when sales are generated. It's the same concept for tradition business. If 5 person start a business and when profit are make it will be split within the 5 partners and not just contribute to a partner only. Networking works with the same concept. Of course some people will still have the thinking that people are earning friends money by asking them to join the business. If you are a distributor, you have to understand from their point of view also because like i say networking is still not acceptable at this stage to alot of singaporean. Likewise, for people who is very skeptical towards networking, don't blame or boycott your friends if they are networkers as they have their own thinking also. They just have dreams that is different from others. We have to respect others in order for others to respect us.<br><br>As for some aguement towards some companies, i personally feel that these companies are quite ill fated because there's alot of thing we have to take into considerations. There will definitely be a small group of black sheeps in any industry. Same for networking companies, maybe the distributors for XXX company did not do their customer service, some might be using very pushy way to promote their products thurs leaving people bad impression towards the company or networking. But not all people in networking are like that. When situation like these happen, people will pin point to the company instead of the agent.<br><br>Last but not least, just to say something. If you are a networker, persist on and you will be different from others. It's very simple. In networking, those who persist till the end will have the last laugh especially when it's now in it's pioneering stage. If you are not a networker, maybe you can give yourself a chance to know more Who knows? It might be the turning point of your life. However, if you cannot accept the way networking works, it perfectly normal because some people prefer to lead a simple life.<br><br>If from the above msg i offended someone or companies, i apologise, it's unintentional.<br><br>vksg</div>
