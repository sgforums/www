            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, this forum discusses too much about mlm, overall i see this forum is all bad comments about the whole mlm industry, any company u name here, i can say u all are just saying out bad comments here and there. I guess that you all might not have enough knowledge about mlm industry, if you all check out the US, mlm is really a very good passive income for many pple, so are in countries like Taiwan, Malaysia and Japan.<br><br>I guess is just that Singapore is still fresh to this industry as MLM is legalised in 2000-2001. So bad comments is common to shoot here and there to so many different companies in Singapore. Lets be realistic, i believe any mlm company can do one... is just whether the system suits u or not, most important is to ask yourself 3 questions:<br><br>1.  Do you really need to join an mlm company? Can it benefit you somehow?<br>2.  Can the mlm company create passive or residual income for you?<br>3. Can the mlm company brings u what you really one? Can it bring u there?<br><br>Some advice on joining an mlm company.<br>1. Remember that repeat sales is the key to success, not recruitment. Prts must be able to repeat sales.<br><br>2. Is the compensation plan fair to everyone, that means the lowest guy can earn and promote higher than other pple on top of him.<br><br>3. The product must be good and the system must be workable.<br><br>4. Training and education is a must to make sure u succeed in the company.<br><br>5. Once joined, don't give up, keep moving whether fast or slow, as long as u go through the training, education and work on it, you will progress ....<br><br>Some things to ask yourself before joining.<br><br>1. Can u afford the time?<br>2. Do u believe in the mlm company?<br>3. Your attitude counts a lot to succeed.<br>4. Are u willing to learn and progress with this mlm company?<br>5. Life just live once. to be or not to be.<br><br>So lets be realistic, if you cannot do those things to join an mlm company, then don't join, back to your old self. For me, one income is certainly not enough for cashflow, try to get more income not just mlm! Cos mlm industry can change a person's life to be better, and also one of the best ways to lead to financial freedom, time freedom, spiritual freedom and mental freedom if you make it big! But for those who are in mlm already, do your best! strive hard to head to bring yourself to the place u want!<br><br></div>

It is an effective marketing strategy, if you join the right company that is transparent in its dealings, has an excellent marketing product, and is able to nurture its people in the right way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NTI always wanna read the book.. telling us that in business, we wont earn much at the beginning and also need to invest or start up capital.<br><br>this is a very good way to brainwash new agents because the agents are still positive when not earning anything. haiz... its not the problem of unable to finding recruitment. its the problem of NTI bad reputation that makes us very different to recruit people!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think john treed critise too much, but i really agree with him on RK. after reading many RK books i feel it's just  a hype, nothing educational. alot of things he says is tokking cock and contradicting himself. he is just leading u one big round and nowhere.  I comment RK on his intentions to educate ppl about finance. but u cannot take his words for real and what applies for him may not be for you. just like real estate. he kept saying how good real estate is but it's a complicated issue and varies with society. like US rental properties may be good investments because they have a huge population and ppl move from states to states to work n it may be more appropriate for them to rent than buy houses. and they have no HDB like us, so ppl can profit from building low income houses and rent them out. plus there's also the issue of rent control which may not be profitable for real estate investors.<br><br>in singapore, govt promotes home ownership and majority of sporeans stay in hdb and own hdbs, look at the singapore residential rental mkt, it's not doing well, esp for ppl who bought houses at inflated prices during the property boom and the competitive rental charges they offer now does not help cover their investments, many are still using money from their pocket to cover the remaining payments.<br><br>he may advocate mlm but it's not as sweet a pie as he talks about, what are the success rate in mlms?<br><br>the bottom line is yes it's possible for normal ppl to get rich but it's not as easy as he says. and he has his habit of downplaying education which is very wrong. the higher the education the higher ur income. it may not be the case for everyone, but it's a much safer and wiser bet to be well educated. I have seen alot of ppl who have only like O lvls and stuff struggling to find jobs too! im sure if they had higher education, it would be easier for them and im also sure they wish they have more education.<br><br>it's true not all grads are rich but u should never downplay the importance of education. plus let's not keep tokking about money, education embodies more than that. do u think someone who low education is going to find the cure for aids and cancers? solve economics issues?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>These people have misunderstandings on MLM I agree, so does people who are also in MLM.<br><br>Most i see here lack basic salemen skills, saying the wrong stuff<br><br>For example, your income depends on recruiting downlines and customers from the non MLMers, and knowing they have misunderstandings on how MLM works, you go and flame them, put them down, brush their views away, especially those who genuinely put some logical questions on the table etc, instead of correcting those misunderstandings, attracting them on benefits of MLM<br><br>Worse, some are in denial their company is a total scam, yet instead of answering the questions, choose to simply say stuff like "oh, you must listen only to successful people" or "Anti MLMers know nuthing'<br><br>You know, its amazing, some anti mlmers put really good questions on the table i got hard time thinking over, yet they were not answered to the point by MLMers. They were even jeered at.<br><br>These are only responses just to attack the character of the forumers, questioning his knowledge thats all. They still dont answer the questions why there are things lacking in MLM, especially ethics that is the big issue now.<br><br>You know,  pls, have a really good attitude when you want people to understand MLM. You forgot that its a business, where you attract people in, not some sort of Christian evangelism, where its the word of God that you have to spread to others.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Damn!  I spent too much time typing the previous reply that the server logged me out and I have to retype everything again!<br><br>Anyway, I signed-up for Lampe Berger last week after I was approached by a ex-classmate.  A couple of years ago my parents signed up for AMWAY and they signed me up also as their downline.  During then I shun the idea and until now I still never looked at any AMWAY product.  Now I am married and I am having financial problem.  I hardly have any savings at all.  This prompted me to consider switching job or do part-time.  I never like serving hamburgers at McDonalds even as part-time and failed to secure an interview with prospective employers for 8 months, I am forced to see at things differently.  My day job company is a sales base company and despite having a bachelor degree in IT and 10 years working experience, I am earning nowhere near salesman with lesser qualification and much junior than me.  No cash and no recognition for me here.</div>
