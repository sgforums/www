            <div class='col-md body'>Selling skill is important.  Most people got rich selling something, even bread.  Do you have the necessary skill to sell yourself?  MLM companies have one of the best training system in the world, not just product selling, but basic people skill like negotiation and people management.  You ever see a passive salesman who looks shy, doesn't know how to say "hello" or shake hand being successful?<br><br>Basically when my friend told me it's MLM, I went back and disect the whole scenario:<br><br>- Pay RM2,500 and get stock worth RM2,500.<br>- Get 1 chance to work hard and earn additional income.<br>- Get to join skill / product training.  No exam.  Just absorb as much as you can.<br>- Can re-attend training later if you forgot.  Not embarrasing like resit for GCE.<br>- No time limit, but the sooner the better.<br><br>Compare to the RM5K+ I paid for my MCSE course minus the certification, I think this is a better deal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not know how one can simply say they got cheated in MLM.  Maybe their upline, normally people they trusted, really conned them.  This unfortunately are possible.  Even worst crime like rape, incest and murder was done by some close friends and relatives<br><br>On second thought, could it be that the expectation was too high compared to effort?  How come some people can be successful in this field but not us?  Are they successful conmen?  I don't think so otherwise people would have seek revenge on them.</div>

I have other things to worry about then, like my children's UK university placement, my wife's BMW, my bungalow and my retirement.  All this needs money.  Anything less and I will have opt for local university for my kids, my wife will have to drive a Proton, and my bungalow would reduced to budget flat somewhere in Geylang.  Forget retirement, I'll have to work till I die.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh man! i cant believe u people are still critising abt MLM....<br>Please be fair to people working in the industry. Think of it, ain't u all doing MLM also, creating downlines to tell people dat MLM is a scam as well?<br>U all are making eveyone afraid of MLM... I suppose most singapore MLM companies approach are a bit too pushy though. Approach actually makes the big difference. MLM i guess is the next stage for developed Singapore, juz like japan, where everyting goes through MLM system. I dun tink people of other countries react to MLM this way.<br><br>Government gv shares, we complain not enough.<br>Friends work as insurance agent, we all run away.<br>Work a bit OT, no extra pay, we say bad abt company.<br>Spend $$$$ drinking at discos, ktv, we think its worth it.<br><br>"Car tinting at $488, bring 2 friends along &amp; enjoy urs for free!" izit tis MLM oso? Please dun always tink within the box!<br><br>" Banks mass recruit people to sign up for credit cards, dan later people overspend with their cards, resulting people to be in debts, so are banks considered scam as well?"<br><br>We all are adults, we should be sensible to our own decisions &amp; actions. In other counries, people dun succeed they blame themselves, in singapore, we blame companies &amp; give them names but not ourselves.<br><br>I guess product matters alot, Eg: selling pots &amp; pans, an auntie will hv better confidence in selling it dan youngsters. By listening to the plan &amp; dreams, u decide to invest i tink we youngster will bound to fail &amp; end up saying MLM is a scam. Decide whether the company's product is ur market before u invest.<br><br>Businessman &amp; people in MLM business are people dat believes dat working as an employee, the chances of getting rich is minimum, dats y they are willing to invest &amp; try. However, MLM, same as other business, fails too, which refers to people gving up.<br>Common people prefers to be employee as they dun wan to worry abt sustaining their business, they prefer to do normal job &amp; leave the risks &amp; worries to their bosses.<br>To summerise, its all abt one's attitude &amp; vision. It's wat u wan in ur life.<br><br>1. Those in MLM industries, gd luck but please watch out on ur way of approach.<br>2. Those juz joined/failed in MLM, ask urself is the product of ur market, self-confidence is important.<br>3. Those who do not like MLM, continue with ur life, its juz another industry dats all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
