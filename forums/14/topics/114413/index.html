Cos most of the new distributors will think that everyone need their company product, which is a very wrong mindset, the leader that is his mentor will need to correct his downline mistake.<br>Unless the leader/the company education system is "brought up" in this way or the system emphasise (a lot)<span style="color: red;">Â²</span> on sales.<br>MLM is structured in such a way that we are not going to be some super saleman, it is more of a team effort, how to educate them to have a same vision as it.<br>Furthermore, when approaching friends and relatives, indeed one has to be more cautious in handling, cos if not proper, you may ruin the relationship. No point doing it to earn the bit of cash. Some uplines or leaders will say "Wah lau, your friend cannot make it, ++ other sarcastic remarks, like dat also dun 1 2 support." &lt;= first step of inbuilding friend's mindset cannot make it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Sometimes is you tell your friend/relatives for a no-obligation presentation, then your friend/relatives go, but still kena pushed/hard-sell. Chin Jia Lat &lt;= second step of ruining a relationship. there are many others reasons as well.<br>Cos i used to be like that when I was in NOP, luckily my current partners in my MLM company, they corrected me and with their methods, i am building my trust and relationship back for myself and not for the sake of MLM.<br>MLM to me is just a stepping stone for me to build up my capital for my ice-cream palour, relationship between friends and relatives are more important.<br>Juz my 2 cents.<br><span style="color: red;">Â²</span> This denotes that some of the companies have a quota, quota in some way is good for goal setting, but I believe most of the networkers start off with part-time. Some of the companies marketing plan in the intial stage looks more like for full-timer. Of course, there will be some bugger saying, part-timer with full-timer attitude. Â©</div>
