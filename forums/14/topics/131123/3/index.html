Therefore, you are in business of your own, self-employ. And you need to declar tax to the IRAS. Yes, Shuang Hor is a long company, with more than 15 years of history. But, in this 15 years, they have a proven record of gromming at LEAST 2 Vice Manger per month, and 1 DIAMOND yearly! So, what other company can give you that? A Vice Manager earn at least $1500(est) and DIAMOND earn $10,000 (EST). The compensation plan of breakaway, in which way is unfair? They have been using it for more than 15 years, and in facts, created many successful people in other company.<br><br><strong>Originally posted by ANTI SMOKER:<br>dis 1 only nid 2 pay $20.00 as member, can start 2 do business already.
