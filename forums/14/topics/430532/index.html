              <p>Haha,</p>
              <p>You will be surprised that I have more friends and business partners since I began my MLM career 12 years ago.</p>
              <p>In life there are probably 2 types of friends you will have:</p>
              <p>1) Social friends who satisfy your social needs</p>
              <p>2) Business friends who collaborate with you in business ventures.</p>
              <p>To become successful in any business, a definite discernment is needed. For those who tried to introduce MLM to their friends and lost friends, I believe that there are a few reasons:</p>
              <p>1) Lack of knowledge of MLM business they introduce, therefore during the presentations, friends were unconvinced.</p>
              <p>2) Lack of relational skills, therefore offended friends during the process.</p>
              <p>3) Lack of confidence and too much fears within them that indirectlly backfired and hurt the relationship.</p>
              <p>4) Never really have a social friend who can participate in business</p>

              <p>Look at it this way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If some MLM guy comes up to you and asks you to join his MLM, then you just tell him you want to be at the head of MLM pyramid and sit around and do nothing and just collect money from downlines. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he says, no, you need to work hard to make MLM work, then you just tell him that you might as well study hard, get some paper qualification and work for a normal company for money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I need to bust my ass in an MLM, then why the hell do I want to join an MLM for? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Think of it this way:  Just like a real company.  Who makes more money the Employer or the Employee?  In Most cases it's the Employer who makes the most money.  Why?  Because he/she is leveraging his/her time off efforts of other ppl.</p>
              <p>" <span id="aptureStartContent"><span class="body">I would rather earn 1% 
              off a 100 people's efforts than 100% of my own efforts."</span> <br> <span class="bodybold"> <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/j/johndrock165070.html">John

              <p>A Job will pay the bills and depending on your student loans then it may provide a mediocore lifestyle. J.O.B = "Just Over Broke" I mean think about it.  Let's say you have the best job in the world with all the education....how much time did you go to school for? How much are you debt now?  Let's say you have a great job and your income is $250,000 a year.  The follow up question is what would happen if you stop working let's say for a month will you still get paid?  Most likely not.  That's because linear income is when you trade time for money but what will happen when you stop working?  The money stops.  If your in Sales then your only as good as your last sale.</p>
              <p>With a MLM company assuming you did your homework and chose a legit company that has been in business longer than 5 yrs, if it's less than 5 yrs old then it's a good chance they won't be around for a long time, since 93% fail in their 1st 5 yrs.  When you start a MLM it's like going to school except the different is your earning while your learning.  Let's say you stuck it out for 10 yrs since you would probably need that much education to earn 250k in a real job.  Your most likely to reach the top position of the company in 10 yrs.  Assuming you make the same 250k the difference is, it's RESIDUAL.  Once it is built correctly then you can take your month off and still receive your income.  That is true leverage.  Not to mention the income is willable so now when you die your leaving a legacy for your family.</p>
              <p>With MLM company you earn 1099 income just like if you owned your own company.  You get the leverage your time off efforts of others.  The difference is you don't have to worry about all the liability &amp; overhead a traditional company has.  With MLM you just focuss on production and developing leaders to duplicate.  Not to mention with a traditional company your always there, and depending on the type of business you'll need capital to get it started.</p>
              <p>In fact, a traditional company is more like a pyramid scheme than MLM.  How is that?  In the corportate structure you have CEO, President, VP, Regional Managers, Supervisor's blah blah blah... but can the VP make more money than the CEO? NO  Can the Supervisor's make more money than the VP's? NO  hence pyramid CEO is making most of the money.  In a MLM ppl below the person on top can actually out produce the ppl on top and therefore make more money.  It's an equal opportunity.</p>
              <p>Hopefully this will shed some light for those of you who do not understand the concept.</p>
