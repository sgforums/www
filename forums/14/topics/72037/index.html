            <div class='col-md body'>{ i found this email sent to me. what do you people think? Are Rafflesians really that bad?}<br><br>What i received:<br><br>[Super interesting facts about Singapore, if you receive this by mail, please forward it to your friend to show them how xiao rjc is]<br><br>Before I start rambling, allow me to shed some light onto Singapore's 2003 A'level results.<br><br>******************************************<br><br>Here is the ranking of schools:<br><br>1st. Raffles Junior College<br>2nd. Hwa Chong Junior College<br>3rd. Victoria Junior College<br>4th. National Junior College<br>5th. Temasek Junior College<br><br>[The results are compiled with absolute reliability]<br><br>What message I hope to raise in this essay is the likelyhood of elitism in Singapore. As we know, and as proven by many countries, elitism is an insidious form of attack that would tear Singapore apart inside out. Raffles Junior College, and the typical Rafflesian we know, are ultra smart but also ultra xialan, ego and definitely proud. Raffles Junior College, founded in 1985, inherited its 180 years of rich tradition from Raffles Institution. A premier and top junior college, RJC stands out not only in academic performances but also in CCAs and sports (So? Does that mean these people have the right to be so hao lian and act like as if the country owe those smartasses something?) To highlight elitism in Singapore, let me reaffirm my stand with the following statistic:<br><br>[Percentage of 4A(s) among total school population in A'level 2003]<br>1) Raffles JC: 51.3% [* broke record in Singapore's A'level history by going past the 50% mark (So scary hor!) ]<br>2) Hwa Chong JC: 41.8% [* Lost to RJC by 9.5% (approx. 10%) ]<br>3) Victoria JC: 30.6% [* Lost to HCJC by 11.2% (approx 10%)]<br>4) National JC: 20+% [* 20+% but exact figures unknown]<br>5) Temasek JC: 14.5%<br><br>Look at the percentage of 4A(s). RJC has clearly proven itself to be a chao-ji super crazy college with mad results. And look at these statistics. This is an example of social polarisation. Each college has a difference of approximately 10% for the top 3 jcs (see the vast difference?). Who would have thought that a college can actually have 1 in 2 students flushing with 4 straight As? Now let me present another set of statistics. The list of colleges with the number of students who acheived 4 A'level Distinctions, 3 S paper Distinctions, 2 A0 Level A1(G.P and MTL) [Total of 9As]<br>1) Raffles JC [Kwek Li Ern Joy &amp; Tan Shin Eik]<br>2) Hwa Chong JC: Zero<br>3) Victoria JC: 1 [Chen De Feng Clarence]<br>4) National JC: Zero<br>5) Temasek JC: Zero<br><br>******************************************<br><br>Now what's this controversy about a neighbourhood-school boy who dated a RGS girl? RJC guys do not condone it. Yes, they do not wish other Singaporeans from neighbourhood schools to date their girls. And RJC girls will smirk if you tried to approach them or something (They don't want to stick with a redneck for the rest of their lives.) Now you know how sucky these people are. RJC people are : HAO LIAN, XIALAN, SMART, INTELLIGENT... they definitely love to despise and look down on other people.<br>So the bottom line is: Next time you see a RJC person, don't hesitate. Go up to him and kick his ass.<br><br>[ Fellow Singaporeans, what do you think? Should RJC people be allowed to stick together and form a elite colony? Or should the ministry close their school? Do you think RJC people are xialan? Share your experiences!

            <div class='col-md body'>Funny. This thread moderators never make noise. Thought they would. And in another thread, I talk bad about ACJC, moderator come and threaten me. Either moderator is/was from ACJC, or moderator is against me.<br><br>Done whining, now about the topic. Personally agree that academic knowledge is different from knowledge of life. Having good grades doesn't mean the person is street smart. I feel it's better to be well-equipped for life, not just in the classroom.<br><br>But then, how does the info about the A level results link with the RGS girl and the neighbourhood school guy? Doesn't say anything about the opnions of RJC people, just what grades they have. They school statistics good also not proof that their arrogant mah.</div>
