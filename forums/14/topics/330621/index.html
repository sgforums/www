              <p>basically what you guys read about enyouth already...my experience is more or less the same.. still feeling very very angry, and betrayed..</p>
              <p>to cut the long story short.. been tricked by a former friend to come down to that enyouth *coffeeshop*.. you know like long time never see den come meet up.. then i kena psycho for few hrs straight.. like they dun let mi go until i sign the some "smart buyer" contract.. now i feel pissed and so dumb for signing that shit.. but at least i didn't pay that 50++ dollars.. they keep on telling me nvrmind no need to pay first.. f* pressure and coerce la..</p>
              <p>for you guys never get this exp before.. lucky you, it was really the crappiest experience, that your friend can lie, cheat you like this..</p>
              <p>how now? not that i scared kena harassed by them now.. but am i legally binded or anything to them(for anyone who has seen the paper before)? the contract didn't say anything about paying- just that they can "kick me out" for inactivity.. yea like i bloody want to be in it.. i just wanted to go home..</p>
              <p>after i read about all other ppl's exp with this shit, i am so pissed off with myself.. but more with my so-called friend.. how could he do this to me?? like he kena brain-washed.. now I am just going to ignore the crap out of them..</p>
              <p>anybody else recently got this kind of shit? seems to be getting more and more common... yarrrrrrrrrrgh still so pissed..!</p>

(lesson learnt cannot any how trust your friends about such shit..)</p>
              <p>btw the ppl all inside talk and behave almost like some cult grp.. like you knnow those cult that believe their pastor/leader/father is jesus/god.. it's almost that extreme.. they keep on repeating the same ol thing like oh got 5 digit pay and mr or ms so and so got car now and all that success story.. scary man!</p>

              <p>My advice to you is go back there and demand to read the paper you anyhow sign one... Rule (1) in signing contracts, READ the paper b4 signing it... understand it.... I've heard a lot of people say kena psyco this, kena forced that when they themselves never read the contract they signed...</p>

              <p><br>Sorry, if it's just a lawyer's letter, the case didn't proceed to court, they can't claim the legal fees.</p>
              <p>For the case to proceed to court, they first need to ask lawyer to write letter to claim for payment. That will cost his "friend" afew hundred dollars depending on the lawyer he engages. If he pays the $50 at that point in time, his friend would have wasted afew hundred dollars for the lawyer's letter, not worth the effort of his friend.</p>
              <p>If the request for payment has failed, then it proceeds to writs of summons. But seriously, which fool would engage a lawyer to claim back $50. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I would just tell TS to ignore request for payment by friend unless he sends you a registered letter from his lawyer. If he sends you non-registered letter, just dump it in the trash and pretend you didn't receive the letter.</p>
              <p>But by not paying your friends the $50, it just means that your friends will no longer be your friends anymore. I think it's a worthwhile trade, any friend who exploits another friend don't deserve to have friends.</p>
