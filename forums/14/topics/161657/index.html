            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Firstly, I can tell you that the average income of the distributors dun mean anything.<br><br>Even if I tell u I am earning $1 a month or $10000 a month, it wont make any difference to anybody, as this is my earning. Different pple have different goals and different earnings. The 30+ pple you asked most prob put around $400+ worth of efforts.<br><br>There are pple who are earning millions from the business as well as those who are earning less than a $100. But in every business, there are different types of pple, esp Amway, which has a huge diversity, and this can explain the different income by so many pple.<br><br>Even for other companies, it is the same, it all depends on the individual and there is no average etc.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

There are engineers, doctors, students, housewifes, bus-drivers, etc....<br><br>Network is always important, who knows when you lost a job and your fellow upline or downline or even crossline who is a fellow engineer is able to tell you that there is a vacancy at which company etc...<br><br>or when you need have a toothache and need to consult a dentist, and there he/she is, a fellow in the network, etc etc, who knows, can even ask school work or married life advice from the housewives, successful businessman etc...<br><br>Thus, i dont go in for the money... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Good thing about Amway is you only pay $38 per year to subscribe to membership, no people pushing you to sell or recruit people, its all up to you and your ambitions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
