            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>If you truly understand the business, and experienced it, you will know that it is totally untrue.<br><br>Yes, there are some who do not make money, but there are also some who do. And even for those who do not make money, they would not lose anything but in fact have a lot to gain.<br><br>I dun pull people in the water, I just present something which can help them to whatever they desire. I let them analyse for themselves and I will only let them join if they feel they really understand and believe that the business can let them have what they want as the 1st most impt criteria in the business is yourself.<br><br>cheers<br></div>
