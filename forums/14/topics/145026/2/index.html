Learn to take a course in English first before you post. I can speak Chinese, Malay so what's that got to do with this posting.

            <div class='col-md body'>Amway's product is always one of the best.  A good Amway distributor sld always explain to their customer how to use the product and how they can save money.  We are always happy to give a full refund of the products if customer is not satisfied (within 3 mths and 80% left).<br><br>Till today (join Amway for only 9 months) after selling so many items.  The LOC mulit purpose cleaner (Amway's 1st product) is my best selling products (abt 30 bottles) with a return rate: 0%.  The only problem with LOC is because you only need about 3 or 6ml to a pail of water to mop the whole house. A bottle of LOC is 1l. If you use 3ml everyday, you can mop your floor for 333days which means you only need to pay about $0.05 p/day.<br><br>You go and do the calculation for other brands and tell us which brand will help you save money. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just my thoughts...<br><br>it is simple to gauge whether the mlm company that one wants to join is good or not, simply by checking the posts abt the company...<br><br>i have been looking through many threads and i realised that there are just SOME companies that get most of the flamings and angry postrs, while others do not.<br><br>and amway is one of them that does not have many angry people posting here for refunds or complaints abt the lack of business ethics.<br><br>if anyone wants to look at the amway opportunity and ain;t convinced that amway is one of the better and legal company to partner with, you can just go to www.quixtar.com<br><br>that;s the USA website and u will see the vision and potential of the amway business (amways has been around for 45 years.. ). not many companies can PROMISE you the global reach (amway is currently in 90 over countries) and refunds u if u ain;t satisfied with the products and even refunds ur $68 within the year (unlike SOME companies who do not even refund u cos the outgrageous amount of money that they make u fork out to join, is actually passed upwards... YIKES!) and amway actually partners many reknown brands such as Levi's and Addidas in USA and many other countries.<br><br>really... if anyone wants to try the network marketing or multilevel marketing biz... do ur research first. even if amway isn;t ur cuppa tea, don let urself get conned into some of the other companies that ain't ethical at all. don waste ur time and effort. worse, when the company closes down, u lose ur reputation, integrity and friendships...<br><br></div>
