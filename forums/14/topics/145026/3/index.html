            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Every month, we have new Platinums coming up, even Emeralds and Sapphires, and next yr, most likely will have our first Diamond. The sales volume of Amway in Singapore is also growing. The fact is there, and it offers pple a legitimate opportunity at low cost.<br><br>Nobody complains becoz there is in fact nothing to complain about. The products are of top quality with 3 mths satisfaction guarantee. The business kit costs only $68 and is fully refundable within a year. The amway culture is something very special that no matter how most other mlms try, they cannot copy, as the amway business is alwiz build based on the four fundamentals and the sincerity and integrity of oneself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers</div>
