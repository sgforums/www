I'll rather utilise the 12k if I have it on better things than investing it all into multi-level marketing.

You wont want to invest all of 12k in to find that one fine day, you may lose them all due to mishap. And when the tough times come, you'll find yourself in deep hot soup trying to build up more money just to survive.<br><br>I'm sure those ex-Bel'Air people out there will understand what I mean here.</div>
