            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>Please tell everyone you know or the Company CEO of your own networking business, and tell them to spread these news before this US Company "Reliv International" comes in to Singapore and cause your friends to lose money.<br><br>This Company started in Malaysia in 15/9/2003 and did fairly well for the first 1 and 1/2 months but their sales dropped very badly in November till now, so they quickly announced that Singapore and Brunei will open soon. Here are my findings and what I heard:<br><br>a) They invite many forieign distributors from US, Philippines, Australia, Canada to a new country and give alot of testimonials on the products and business in every OPP to lure the prospects in, and mostly asking new distributors to BUY up at least 3,000 to 4,000 SD worth of products to gain higher position and up to 35% discounts. They even give offer to reduce the volume for opening months. That is the problem. My friends now in Malaysia have problems getting rid of the stock !!<br><br>b) They attract prospects by telling them products are money back guarantee if you stop the business(but 10% will be deducted) but who will want to take all these troubles !!<br><br>c) They attract by giving 1 free starter kit worth RM88 for every 5 purchased at one time, isn't this very very unhealthy and pyramid ???<br><br>d) Their products are all in powder form and claim that those in tablet forms cannot be digested in the stomach !! This is something new and can really attract many distributors and customers BUT it's really BS !! All tablets today are made in a form to get digested easily even by a weakest person !!<br><br>e) The fact is, it's not practical !! Can you imagine everytime you take yr vitamins and minerals, you have to put into a shaker and start shaking it to drink ? In the office ? Meaning you have to buy at 2 sets, home and office, in a canister !! And if you do not finish in 30 days, imagine the powder can get moisturised and hardened and even bacteriorised !!<br><br>f) Their Comp Plan, don't be fooled by them !! They only show the best and attractive conditions in the brochures and the presentations. The conditions like having to maintain at least US2,000 group sales to enjoy the maximum are not informed and ignored. This is cheating !!<br><br>g) You will soon see many advertisements in the papers by these foreign and Malaysian leaders looking for pioneers, tell all your friends and Companies ahead to prevent them from joining !! Their plan of paying up to 40% as soon as you join is really attractive and those without networking experience can really be taken in.<br><br>These are just some of the reasons they are no longer doing well in the US(despite 15 years !!) and Philipines, their only country in Asia, before Malaysia is dropping in Sales now !!<br><br>These are what I gathered at the moment, will come back if I can get more info.</div>

Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi laurence,<br><br>Reliv is a U.S. based public listed Company that ranked no. 9 by CBSMarketwatch.com for the year 2002 while Usana(just opened 2 months plus ago in Singapore) was ranked No. 3 in terms of stock performance, but that do not means much to their distributors.<br><br>Most of the other info that are enough to proof that it's not a good MLM are already mentioned in my first message.<br><br>The worse is encouraging new distributors to buy more to get a higher position and get better discount. After that, they will have a tough time clearing their stock. Their business slowed down in Malaysia after just 2 months.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, i would like to share a pointer or two about Reliv... lets start from the very top...<br><br>kindheartyu, i dont know where you gathered your info from and what you heard is so untrue... let me give you the facts.<br><br>First of all Reliv is a Food Science company specialising in Nutrition. Currently we are at 10 countries including Singapore which opened about 3 months now. Every company will start off a little bit slow at the beginning. In Malaysia from september till now Reliv has got over 8000 distributors! Sales dropping? Its ever increasing...<br><br>a) The ambassadors from other countries come to share their testimonies and provide assistance to new distributors. And they present to you an OPPORTUNITY for better health and also a way to make more money. There is no obligation to do the business. YOU CHOOSE to be a consumer...or a distributor...or go straight to the highest and stock up. Maybe your friend is not doing it right.<br><br>b) By taking the product, you will either get your results or your money back. Just like many other companies. Think of it carefully, either way, it is beneficial to you as a consumer...like an insurance. and if you are serious in doing the business, some people stock up to get the highest discount. In any point of time they decide to quit, they will get back 90% refund on all their stocks. It sounds like an excellent risk free investment to me!<br><br>*I realise you use the word attract a lot. What they are doing is sharing with people an opportunity.<br><br>c) For rm88 or SIN$42 you will get 20% on all products an also a distributor kit which contains materials to help you do the business. If you decide to buy kits and sponsor people, you can get 6 kits ofr the price of 5. what has that got to do with pyramid? I believe pyramid selling was touched on in another posted message somewhere.<br><br>d)Reliv does not claim that tablets CANNOT be digested! The person who spoke to you must have the facts wrong. Reliv does not claim anything. We just tell you that research has shown that tablets are not as fully absorbable compared to liquid or powdered form. Tablets absorbtion rate is up to 30% whereas powdered or liquid is up to 98%. of course tablets do work but the point they are trying to get to you is that liquid is more effective. Reliv only do shakes, best bioavailability. why do you think patience in the hospital are given drips? babies are taking milk powder? chinese boil herbs into liquid form?<br><br>e) Practicality? or just plain laziness? Is it so hard to take a minute to shake it up and drink your way to great health? do people bring waterbottles to work? or even their own meal? has human beings grown so lazy because of the technological advancement? think about those times when ppl spend hours to boil herbs. hardenised? moisturised? Do you open the can and just leave it uncapped?<br><br>f) Compensation plans are presented in a very general way to make you see the big picture. other companies will be similar. Only when people are interested in doing the business, then they inquire more about it. Cheating? They didnt force you to sign anything did they? And you wouldn just fork out thousands blindly would you? and for your information, the maintenance is optional and also could be maintaned by your downlines... ask me if you want to know more...and pls do notgo round backstabbing other companies if you only know so much.<br><br>Have you checked their annual report? Check on the Nasdaq under their name RELV. Their sales dropping? From what i can gather their sales have just been booming! And they are not an aggressive company who advertise and promote themselves heavily. Imagine the opportunity one has...Phillipines, Malaysia and Singapore are the only Asian countries and they will be opening in other parts of Asia! They are growing steadily and slowly around the world. Mate you better get your facts right...<br><br>My whole family, friends and relatives benefitted from their products tremendously. Nobody cheated us....nobody forced us....what they did was share their testimony with us. we are in the business because we chose to do so to share these great products with ppl we love and care for. I will be more than happy to share with you the amazing testimonies i have seen coming out of Reliv....<br><br>Reliv....a sharing business<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>I would like to comment that kindheartyu's comments on Reliv are unfounded and immature. I understand your point of view in warning others about the perils of joining conniving and dishonest companies but I assure you, Reliv is NOT such a company. Allow me to elaborate...<br><br>A) Reliv International was set up in Malaysia in September 2003. Sales has been on the increase and they achieved their RM1 million turnover in March 2004. They have 10,000 distributors in Malaysia to date and distributorship are steadily on the rise. In fact, Reliv has one of the highest retention rates in their 16 years of operations when it comes to distributors, approximately 53%.<br><br>B) Maintenance is essential in most MLM companies simply to sustain the company as well as its distributors. Reliv is no exception. The only difference is that you can CHOOSE to do your maintenance and earn more royalties or NOT do the maintenence and earn from just wholesale and retail profits. In any case, the maintenance comes in only when you decide to do the business seriously, be it to stock up or to build your business slowly. The company offers choices and DOES NOT coerce any distributor to stock up immediately. When distributors stock up, they either see that the business is worth doing or they have absolute faith in the products.<br><br>C) Giving away 1 free kit when distributors buy 5 is only an incentive. How, may i ask, is that pyramid? In any case, the Singapore Government disallow companies with the pyramid scheme to operate in Singapore. Reliv was carefully scrutinised (as with other companies that have been allowed to operate in Singapore) before they were allowed to start operations. May I suggest that Kindheartyu look up the definition of "pyramid" before launching on such malicious attacks on the company.<br><br>D) The Compensation plan is simple and straightforward. Reliv is a listed company and everything that you need to know about the company or its financial status is on the internet. The distributor Kit that comes with the distributorship explains all that distributors need to know about the company and its clauses. Everything is open and aboveboard. If your friend did not ask questions or read the manual proper, then it really is his/her fault and not the company's.<br><br>E) It is a known fact that liquids are more readily absorbed by the body than solids. Ask any doctor/nurse/nutritionist. As Red Sonja mentioned, why do you think people are put on the drip when they first present at hospitals and not given tablets? Reliv  have patents on several products and these patents are based  on the entire formulation. This just means that no one else can have these formulas and the products are effective. These products have been approved by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore so there is certification that the products are safe for consumption. If the products works, you would take it in any form. It's just a matter of getting used to.<br><br>The wellness industry is the next trillion dollar industry simply because people are more concerned over their quality of life and hence their health. Many companies have different goals when they are formed, some to help others with their health, other just to make fast bucks from their consumers then shut down. I believe that most companies start with the intention of doing some good to mankind and i feel that we should alLow them a fair run. Which will remain in the market for a long time, which will just pack and leave, we'll have to see for ourselves. Bad mouthing other companies is a very silly and immature thing to do especially when you don't get the facts right. Not only does it embarrass yourself, it embarasses the company that you may be involved with. Let us all keep an open mind and may the better company prosper!<br><br>Beebs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i wonder what he did with his 10%. you mean to tell me he just bought the products to sell and not consume? It doesnt matter if other companies are bigger, or opened up in more countries. either way people are still making tens of thousands a month. and if you wanna compare, Usana and Herbalife is nowhere near Amway. so does that mean that it is not advisable to join herbalife or usana? By the way the picture of lady pushing away the tablets just explains to you that Reliv has managed to put all the essential vitamins in to one can and you dont need to swallow that many different types of pills. I dont know how you compared the ingredients with the tablets. The amount on the label is half of your daily required intake and thats why we take 2 shakes a day for the full daily amount which is sufficient. How are we not honest ? And doctors i have spoken to has highlighted that Reliv has such a broad spectrum of vitamins all in one. I agree with you recently there is a surge of Indians and Malays. Good on them, shows they are working really hard and reaping results. If the plan is not attractive, we wont have other distributors from amway, cosway, herbal life and Eexcel joining the company. Like what beebs highlighted, Reliv has one of the highest retention rates when it comes to distributors . If the plan does not make money, these figures will surely point the other direction. It is a choice of vehicle. Some do shakes, some do pills and some do both. Herbal life mixes powder with pills dont they? why powder then? why not make it all pills? and finally, there are a lot of companies with patented products for eg. packaging, individual ingredients like 'Olivol' in Usana products, amways method of extracting a certain vitamin and even their design of capsules. Reliv has got the patent for their ENTIRE FORMULATION of the product. That to consumers is an assurance that the whole product is SAFE, EFFECTIVE and only AVAILABLE in Reliv. See, many people dont understand that vitamins and minerals needs to be in perfect balance in order for the body to fully absorb and utilise. You need Vitamin K to absorb Vitamin A...You need magnesium for calcium. If you just take all the capsules on the shelf of the market, it might not be at the proper dosage and you might not utilise it fully. the creator of the product has spent years coming out with the perfect balance and he succeeded. Only after they got the patent did they set up the company. I dont have to worry about what to take and how much to take with these shakes. it is so simple. My mom use to pop heaps of vitamin tablets. Now it is just one shake 2X a day.<br><br>hope that helped a bit in explaining a bit more about reliv. we dont want to compare and criticise. each of us out there might be attached to a company for some reason. whatever the reason, we wish everyone the best of luck and see you guys at the top.<br><br>and by the way, its agri FOOD and veterinary ler... woof woof...<br><br>by the way are you guys attached to any mlm company? would be interested to know who we are sharing with <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Experienced,<br><br>Hi Heard your comments and all. Btw, what are you experienced in? Other MLM companies?<br><br>a) You are right in that the company 'charges' 10% to cover their costs. It is an investment. With every investment comes risks. Just depends on how high the risk is. Tell me a investment that does NOT come with risks. Like I said before, distributors invest when they are sure of the biz or when they have faith in the products. NO COERCION. Regarding the customer refund, why would anyone join a company if he/she did not have some sort of confidence in the biz or product? No one put a gun to their necks' to get them to join. So the company says that if you are not sure of the product, you can take it as a consumer for life and get your MONEY BACK GUARANTEE. and if you trust the product, then join and get your own discount/profit. People who have joined the company for purely the discount/profit may find that unnerving but for most distributors, they have faith that the products work so there ios no question in getting another can to sell it to someone else.<br><br>b) They are opened in a few countries less than Usana or Herbalife. Did Usana and Herbalife open in 10 Asian countries at a shot? Reliv likes to make sure that a country is properly settled before starting in another. I can't say the same about other companies. In any case, being new has it's pros and cons. One pro for sure is that they WILL continue to grow irregardless of malicious remarks made against them. The company is strong enough to grow steadily over the past 16 years and little, insignificant comments will not do damage to it's already reputable name.<br><br>c) Doctors in general are not allowed to do MLM on the side due to conflict of interests. Panel doctors employed by companies are basically paid to say what they say. Reliv has distinguished Dr as Distributors who have documented their findings and have shown that the products work. In fact, Reliv is authorised by the australian Therapeutic Goods Authority (pls check it out if you do not know what it is instead of making a jibe and embarassing yourself) and that says that it CAN be used for alternative medicine. This authority is a very strict one and if they say that Reliv is good, who's to say it is not? Especially from a friend who manufactures health food to OUTSOURCE to others. If he really is that good in making these health food, don't you think he would have set up an MLM company of his own and earn his millions?<br><br>d) why do you think Usana distributors are showing that book around? How sure are you that the book is not written by a Usana distributor? They are reliv's direct competitor and thereforwill find something to edge Reliv out. Don't you know anything about market competition? Ina nycase, please look out for the August  copy of Fortune Magazine and you will see how REliv has grown over the years. Btw, pills not being digested as well as liquids are featured in Chiropractic Economics, March/April, Volume 40, number 6. Try telling drs at the hospital to give tablets when unconscious pts first present to A&amp;E.<br><br>e) Dr Kalogris is mentioned all the time. Whether he is still alive or not makes no difference. He  came up with a formulation that has helped millions of people in the world. He will be remembered forever. Maybe your friend hasn't been to enough meetings.<br><br>In short, a few people's poor experience does not make a company dishonest or conniving. If you choose not to have Reliv as a business, that's fine. Reliv is NOT for everyone. But get your facts right. Getting people to join your company need not be at the cost of another company.<br><br>Beebs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Experienced,<br><br>Action speaks louder than words. No point giving empty talk. Let's see what the products on the shelf have done for people. MLM is just another way of selling, besides retailing in shops. People HAVE gotten better on Reliv. We'll leave it up to those who have benefitted from Reliv to decide what's good for them.<br><br>There is no need to put a company, be it Reliv or any company, down especially when you haven't learnt enough about it. That's just my point. Why should you be offended if you claim to be neutral?<br><br>Last but not least, we should be fair to ALL companies and not condemn them until they have proven themselves.<br><br>Beebs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Hmm, sorry to chip in... can't help really thinking when u guys r discussing abt Reliv.<br>I must agree w/beebs that, yeah we cant condemn all companies and only time will tell whether that these companies r really trustworthy or not.<br><br>i have been to the website that redsonja refered previously, yeah gone thru some of the products too.<br><br>There is one particular product i wanted to emphasize on which in ReverseAge<br><br>Frankly speaking, what do ya mean by reverseage? correctly me if im wrong, the product namely reverseage is it goin to make us look younger?? lesser wringkles?? or really reverse our number of age??<br><br>Is it by taking this product, will we look 10 years younger??<br>Then wat is plastic surgery then?? WAT abt cosmetic products then??<br>Well, If reliv is sooo established, i don't think Cher would need to go for a plastic surgery<br>U mean by taking everyday of the so-called powder form product would make ppl look younger??<br>Now thats wat i called Rip-Off. Not only a rip-off but i think this product basicly is just a PLACEBO.<br><br>What is a Placebo?? (pls look for oxford dictionary, thanx)<br><br>Next, Who will b the victims of these so-called reliv products??<br>"Friends and Families"<br><br>Ppl who bought the products doesnt mean that they are interested or even the product works for them.<br>It is simply bcoz of the word oblidging<br>Yes no doubt they will try out the products they bought but will there be a second time purchase??<br>I think Most of the answer would be no<br><br>I have a fren who bought the product simply bcoz he was a very oblidging fren.<br>I asked this fren whether did the product works  on him/her and the answer...No.<br>No doubt every or any product will have to take some time for the effects to show but.. as for the reverseage??? hmm, come to think of it, it could b a product for the ppl w/ low self-esteem<br><br>Well thats just my pov, i could be wrong or true..<br>But if any of u agree or disagree w/me pls...giv yer point of view. thank you<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hiya Reliv people<br><br>Is this a cult? can I join do I get a discount for joining, will I earn lots of money selling this Reliv Product cause u know I jobless and I am pretty desperate to find quickie cash.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Heath Products hahaha that's a good one. Can u imagine how happy the world will be if everyone decided that health products were the future food substance that replaces what we call 'food'. my fellow RELIV SELLERS!!! do u remember the time when u once enjoyed fried noodles, hmm pork chops, beef noodles, ice cream, seafood yummy innit. Why suffer so much, why put yourelf into eating tablets, no wait now it's powder because it absorbs better lol, oh wait I got an even better absorbant way- HOW ABOUT INJECTIONS! rite up the backside, your face will look like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  after that the effect will come and u will look like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  and in the end once you're satisfied u will look like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> , but if you're not happy with the product u will look like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  and we will refund u with a money back guarantee. Unfortunately we are not liable for whatever that has cause your body to become. You will get your money back though and use 90% of your money back guarantee to see the doctor.<br><br>Reliv is for everyone or not for everyone....Hmmm I tell u these days alot of people are trying to sell u things that they market to be good for u. Yes better be cautious and just be happy with your body. Why not, instead of spending whatever it cost to buy these Reliv that will only boost your ego 'PLACEBO' hehe nice word I finally looked up in the dictionary and understand what it means and I think you're rite many advertisements exploit your outer or inner ego to sell their products and I guess Reliv really did a fine job with it otherwise it wouldn't be on the Stock Market yea...Oooo pretty good NASDAQ dude wow, hope there won't be a stock market crash otherwise it wouldn't look good eh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But anyways just eat lots of fruits rite, dun take fatty breakfast, fatty lunchg, fatty dinner, exercise alot and drink lots of water. If u put your mind into it, I am pretty sure you wouldn't need RELIV -nice name by the way but I dunno what it's suppose to mean become alive again maybe. Well if u have the commitment to do that why do u need health products?! Who are the targetted sales ppl when it comes to health products. Those who are already living a healthy lifestyle dun need this products. So I conclude that it only target those who are chubby, those who feels they are old and want to look younger 'Reverse age'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Wow I'm 61 years old and if u reverse my age, now I'm 16! yea!. Ultralite -  are you trying to say that the can that I bought from u is super lite and it's not worth the money I pay cause I will finish it in 4 days? or does it mean that u will make me ultra lite. Anyways, those who are chubby and those who want to look younger will want to buy these products rite and oh yea those who feels that they eat not enuf vitamins and want to have more vitamins. If I was one of those ppl I sure hope I can just take those health products and at the same time not disrupting my normal eating routing habits. I wanna eat pizza, eat fried noodles, drink milkshake, sit down watch tv and slurp on my can of beer and after that feeling guilty take a cup of those magic shakes that I pay so much for and expect it to relief me from being fat. If this is the product that will work like that I would gladly pay 1000 dollars cause this things is precious. But if I have to supplement my meals for that one cup of shake that will make me feel giddy, visit my toilet bowl and cause weird stuff do my body should I not follow strict prescriptions then I tell u this is not for me. Humans are lazy<br><br>Anyways take care now<br><br>P.S Just remember, like every company, if u can't meet your quota, u'll be out of job. If u meet your quota, u will have lesser friends cause u have turned all your the people around u into customers. When everyone is a customer, everyone talks about money. Is money everything in life? Yup? well good for you continue your job well done<br><br>We live in a new era ' The Reliv Age'.<br>Dun take any offence u sensitive people, I was just sufing through to look for relieving stress and accidentally found this funny forum. Just curious and went on the website to find what u guys were talking about. Reliv - just another health product in the market lol</div>

Reversage hmm. Yup the name says it all, It helps to slow down the aging process. Check the ingredients, heaps of antioxidants in it. People are taking lechitin, spirulina, co q10, ginko baloba, omega 3 oil and more, its been formulated into reverse age. Creams, plastic surgery works externally while taking supplements work internally. Some testimonies from my group, improved complexion...better sleeping patterns....darker hair....improved vision. are you sure noooot? yes my mom, aunt, friends(above 40 of courseler) can testify to it. Reverseage ripped them off by giving them these results?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Unfortunately in the market you will find people who go about doing it the wrong way. hard selling and forcing ppl to commit. i agree, make that "victim" obliged to  buy it. hate them style nd they oughta be spanked  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  must always respect ones decision. other products are good, shelf, shop, cupboard, stall, roadside, direct sell, indirect sell, you want i sell &amp; the list goes on.... just share and the choice is theirs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>hey just wondering, is singapore idol on already? me really lost touch with my tv di... sniff sniff? ok gotta go look for food...<br><br>honestly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Red</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's really ashame that any network marketing company gets thrashed simply because of the way they market their products.  It could be the most phenomenol product in the world and someone will still find something wrong with it simply because of the marketing.<br><br>The fact is network marketing is not for everyone, but does that mean that you have to discredit the company because you could not make your business grow.  This is not a get rich quick scheme, this is a REAL business.<br><br>1. In any marketing plan, when you open a traditional store and buy in bulk you get a better discount, correct??  So, why is it not correct to offer that to distributors in network marketing?  And what business or franchise gives you a 90% money back guarantee???  NONE!!!<br><br>2.  When you start any new business whether it's traditional, franchise or network marketing there is an investment.  It can be anywhere from $10,000 to millions.  However, in network marketing or MLM, whatever you want to call it, the investment is a fraction of the cost and because of that the industry gets a lot of people who are looking for a way to get rich quick.<br><br>3.  Network Marketing is just like any other business and it takes a lot of work, committment,  an investment of some sort, focus and belief in your products.<br><br>4.  Unfortunately, because the investment is so low we end up with people who do not do what is necessary to make their business a success and then they blame it on the company or the product.<br><br>Is MLM a real business?  Answer that question after you view this video.<br><br>http://www.anmnow.com/streamofincome/index2.shtml<br><br>In reference to Reliv.  There are thousands, upon thousands of people who have had life changing results.  If someone did not get results it's because they were not taking it properly.<br><br>If a doctor prescribes a medication to you and gives you specific directions, do you follow the directions??  Well, that is the same with Reliv.  There are specific directions that people DO NOT follow and then they blame it on the product when the problem is they didn't take it correctly.<br><br>I am on my way to Singapore in September because of many, many people who have had great results with the business and the products.   And Reliv will grow regardless of naysayers because it WORKS and it changes peoples lives.<br><br>Check Bigcharts.com to view the growth of the company and where it is headed.<br><br>Lisa</div>
