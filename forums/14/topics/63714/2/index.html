In the passage, some of you use the word "listed" I would like to know does it mean that it is listed on the stock exchange? Cos I head there ia a company who just newly listed in the stock exchange.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Rgds</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to all the pro-mlm people in here,<br><br>no need to talk so much lah. If they are anti-mlm, let them be. They are just shuting themselves from a diamond opportunity. But of course, if everyone can see the opportunity, then it is no longer one. So, as my friend put it, we must thank these anti-mlm pple, without them, we wun be at the top, say 5 years from now.<br><br>I understand that mlm teaches sharing and other good values. But too bad, at least I havent learn of the "not comdemning anti-mlm people" and "give them a chance" values yet.<br><br>haha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>2 things I like to share here:<br><br>1) Do not think that public listed companies in MLM are bigger or better. It could mean the opposite. A company go public listed only for 1 or more of these 3 reasons:<br><br>a) They are short of capital and needed public funds.<br><br>b) They are looking for an exit strategy; or<br><br>c) The officials use the opportunity to manipulate and make money from the share market.<br><br>None of the above reasons prove to do any good for their distributors. In US for instance, there are more successful MLM Companies in the private sector than those public listed; and most of the public listed do not prove to be bigger or stronger. Reliv, for instance has much much less products or turnover than many of those which are not public listed.<br><br>2) When a Company management teach their distributors to be confident and positive and NOT to condemn others who condemn them COULD actually meant they knew their wrongs or weaknesses and they have nothing to defend for themselves. So naturally, the best means to to keep quiet and pretend to be nice. A "poor conditioned" Company's best training advice to their distributors is to tell them not to give up regardless of what others condemn on them. Afterall, if what orders condemn on them is right, they have nothing better to defend.<br><br>My opinion is it is good to have more anti-mlm people around. This way unscrupulous Companies will not be able to make to much from the people, don't you all think so ?<br><br>Note, don't ever think US Companies are better than local Companies, I have seen so much of bad practices from US Companies.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Glad to share the news with you that they are on the way down in Malaysia, so badly that you see majority Indians now active with them and the Management placed advertisement in the Star Paper to recruit distributors, asking people to invest between 2K to 14K. This is the first time I see a MLM Company advertising for distributors after one year of operations.<br><br>Is it because their business is really so bad or that their practice is bad ?<br>Whichever reason, its still bad, very very BAD !!<br><br>So Singaporeans beware, don't be fooled by them into the business !!</div>
