            <div class='col-md body'>this company is dealing in organic type of products, ie health supplements, food, etc. If I am not working, it goes by binary pattern. Competition is strong in health supplements, cos there are also others wanting a share in the pie, i.e like Amway, Nuskin Pharamex, Elken, Sunrider, Herballife, Cosway, and many others some of which started because wanting a share in the MLM industry. Not forgetting the normal retail shops that are selling them also. (Talk about Sensation, the new dunno whether itz MLM anot cos got OPP <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">) Of course, I must agree that every company have a strong product to back the business up in order for it to survive till today.<br>My downline went for their presentation recently, she told me the setup of the office is very nice (quite high class), but a lot of youngsters there. Cos a successful MLM company will attract people from all ways of life and different age groups.<br>But nevertheless, this is just my 2 cents. do as you deem fit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Went down to WBG today at suntec. The place looks very modern and cosy, there were lots of ppl (agents and customers) there. Bought a product from them @ $30+ just to support the agent whom i know, then i automatically become a member of WBG as buying a product can be a start up fees. To be a distributor, it is $0. Wasn't listening much from the agent toking about his boss background, achievement etc. But i noticed there are some good looking female distributors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That company's a load of bullshit man. They were out to siphon money out of people just to get them to attend a 'success talk' ($400). I would rather have bought a self-help book for $20 instead.  I thought that I'll go take a look becos my fren asked me to.<br><br>Had such a bad experience from their pushy agents claiming that if I sign up, I will be guaranteed success in life becos we will have 'successful' people to 'guide' us. They also kept saying that this is to 'help' us. Seriously, if they really intended to help others they wouldn't be asking others to pay money. Why not just be a charitable organisation?<br><br>Their so called definition of success is also very twisted. To those MLM'ers success = material wealth.<br><br>They also said they will teach MQ (Mastery Quotient), under which they will teach communication skills?! Oh my goodness, just look how persistant that agent is, is that how their so called excellent training has taught them to negotiate?<br><br>Well since it was my friend who recommended me to join and I refused, I don't think I'll ever want to keep in touch with such a person again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
