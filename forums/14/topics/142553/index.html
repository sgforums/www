            <div class='col-md body'>i'm former a manager in NTI and i'm very disgusted by the way the company run everything. i feel guilty after cheating my friends to invest so much money into this company... i'm too naive previously... i thought the company is really teaching me to be a businessman..but after i found out the truth.. they are simply using me and my friends to help them earn money. those sweet talks and motivations are simply trying to make me and my friends to fight harder for them. the RSDs are not making alot of money as what the company have projected to us. its all a setup to paint nice picture to lure youngster like us into believing and invested our savings into them. i really feel cheated after finding out the truth.. please, dont follow my footsteps. i feel very sad to lose my friends who are trying hard to get me out of NTI.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....... Very confusing lei. What car exactly is jackie driving? Why you say 318, some say 320? Mr Lian Jie, care to clarify? I'm very curious. I mean you're a former manager, you should know better than any others. Someone before you say its a 320, but you say its a 318. So what exactly is the truth?<br><br><blockquote>yah.. i feel cheated when company tee up jackie car... but after my uncle told me to truth.. i feel disgusted. its just an old car ready to be scrapped. its just an old 318 coupe... not much market value. haiz... i'm very ashame after i keep telling how successful jackie is to the people around me.. its like slapping my own face after i found out the truth.<br><br>to the other nti people reading this forum, please find the truth!</blockquote>I've been reading this forum and keep seeing different versions of the BMWs being mentioned. Somebody say Alan Mok drive 5 series, then others say 3 series, then next day somebody claims its a 5 series again. Which one is it? Makes me wonder if all these information in this forum is credible or not, and if the people here really know their stuff at all. Just wondering, what if these guys have been mistaken all along? I just hope they are not from other networking companies out to confuse pple, cos I have been down to a few companies, and I dont like the way they condemn other companies. Worse still, if its condemning using the wrong facts and information.<br><br></div>

And what position were you when you left? So can we trust your uncle's judgment? Like i said, lets have the correct facts and information. Cos my NTI friend says jackie's car is a 320. Somebody else in this forum also once said its a 320. So abit blur.<br><br>Its a brand new week! Cheers.</div>

The methods they used are typical NOP pattern, not MLM! People like David Pang, Alan Mok, Jackie, Desmond, Garry all last time small fry from NOP - that's why they all recruiting smaller fry now!<br><br>My advice - GET OUT OR REGRET!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
