            <div class='col-md body'>i must agree with some of those who r neutral or support network marketing. but i am not saying i disagree with those who dislike network marketing. i admit i am working in a network marketing company. i wish to share my thoughts and opinions with u all and not trying to influence anyone. i believe all of us have brains and can think and can differentiate what is right and wrong.<br><br>1) first of all i believe that not all network marketing companies are bad or networking marketing is bad. it is the ppl who r doing it that r bad. network marketing is just a way of doing business. some of u may think 'of course we r toking abt the ppl, y would we tok bad abt a name?' tt's right! since u agree that it is the ppl and their way of doing it or the products they sells r bad, then y should we condemn tt all network marketing companies r bad, if some of u do.<br><br>2) we should not despise or outcast our friends if they are working in network companies. it is also a decent job if they are truthful and honest. for example if the products they sell really benefit ppl and they r not overcharging the price, then y should we despise or outcast them? they r just like any other salesman or insurance agents. i believe most of u do have insurance and bought them from agents as well.<br><br>3) pyramid scheme is illegal and banned in singapore. though mlm is legal, there r many restrictions and laws in singapore to prevent abuse of the system. comapnies operating mlm need to be registered as well. hence when a company says that it is a network marketing company, i dun see any reasons to doubt or flame them. by doing so, u r also indirectly doubting or not having confidence with our government. do u think in singapore where u r %@@^ing fined for the smallest things in the world, will the government allows companies to operate illegal and cheat us?<br><br>there are some advices or opinions i would like to share with those supporting or neutral with networking marketing. first of all when u see and set ur goals, go all out to achieve them, just like u go all out to chase a girl/boy. there will bound to be discouragements and difficulties on the way. but dun give up easily because success belongs to those who r determined. at most if u fail to succeed, take it as a lesson learnt and experience gained. though some of u may think money and time r wasted, but think of it another way. use the money to buy lessons and gained experience which u may not get from other line or trade. dun u also invest or spend money when u go after ur girl/boy?<br><br>for those who dislike network marketing, my thinking is do not despise or outcast them. like i say it is also a job. what if they do is honest and truthful, y should we? take the case of insurance. or lets say a class with many students and the teacher is a professor and the best u can get in the world. i can confirm that not all students will get the same results though wat the teacher teach is the same and equal to all. and if 1 student is a gangster and bad discipline, can we judge all of them r gangsters as well? respect everyone's job or career. i believe if u dun wish to purchase anything from them, they will not use a gun to force u. just tell them straight in the face and show tt u r determined. warn them if they r ur friends that u will be angry and might leave him if he keeps pertering u. i believe he will not do tt again cos no ppl will one to make more enemies than friends. they will respects ur decisions just like u respect their jobs. instead if they r doing it the ethical way, they will be gladful u r willing to spend time listening to them. it is both an experience for them and a lesson of the product for u.<br><br>who knows u may be working in the same line in the future or ur business may employ network marketing to sell ur products?!<br><br>last is to those who r about or thinking to join a network marketing company. i advice u should do some research first. check out the company financial status. whether it has delays for payments to its agents, or there delays in delivery of stocks or goods. it it does, the company is not financially secure and may close anytime. next if it ask u to buy the products upfront, dun be so stupid to do so. u may end up losing more money if u r unable to sell. or if they insist, ask abt the refund system.<br><br>http://www.mti.gov.sg/public/NWS/frm_NWS_Default.asp?sid=38&amp;cid=950<br><br>check whether it is selling real products that really benefit ppl. u wouldn't want to go cheating ppl of their money with false products rite? check the way the company works. whether the ppl have strong bonding or they r just using one another.the company will surely close if the managenment is bad no matter how gd their mkting plan is. for some u may think it is difficult to tell in such a short time. but there r tell tales signs so look closely. look at the way the ppl communicate. whether they are close and true to one another. see if the seniors r helping the juniors willingly and truthfully. or r they giving excuses to avoid helping them. u should be able to sense tt. top management is very important!! or if u want to 'test' them, tell them u r working. go through the training and 'waste' some of their time and efforts to train u. then make up some excuses to quit. if they r unhappy or wat, then u should not see them again. if not u may really want to consider working so make another excuse to join b again. last but not least, if u suspect their mkting plan in the sense tt the top earn more than wat they claim or legal levels, the only way to find out is to climb up urself. dun ever be so stupid to ask them cos u will never get the truth. one more thing, most ppl hate the 'brainwash sessions'. but i think of it another way. it is to instill a sense of belonging to the company. most business companies will do tt because they do not wish the ppl they train so hard to betray them by joining other companies or set up one of their own.<br><br>these r just my 1 cent worth of thought and opinions. i am not trying to influence anyone here. like i say all of u all can think for ur own. i am be wrong also and i welcome and comments.<br><br>______________________________________________________________________________________________<br>do not see things from one angle. it is important to have an open mind. u will learn more things and the truths usually are the opposite. dun be a toad in a well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>can i dun say which nw company i work for? i have just joined it. i think a good system payout is where the asgents get their checks timely every month without fail. and the company has no stocks or goods problem. this at least shows tt the company does not have any financial problem on the surface. a good product is 1 which benefits ppl. this can be ur own belief or there are scientific proofs or there are ppl who have used it and claims it is good. of course those ppl have to be someone not in the company. just like insurance. some policies allow u to be insured but at the same time it also works like a savings for u. so although u pay every month, it benefits u.<br><br>_______________________________________________________________________________________________<br>do not see things from one angle. it is important to have an open mind. u will learn more things and the truths usually are the opposite. dun be a toad in a well.</div>

They further provided me with info that 5 years ago a company with the same name, JapanLife, as them, selling biomagnetic products went bankrupt!!!<br><br>So those biomagnetic companies in Singapore claim to import products from JapanLife in Japan or even bought the production plants from JapanLife, IT IS ALL BULLSHIT!!!<br><br>PLEASE stop working for those companies before it is too late.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i'm new in dis forum. Well all dis biomagnetism talk is interesting. Last few wks there was an ariicle in 'Life' abt biomagnetism.<br>Anyway, as some of u may have tried 2 guess, yes, i wrked in biomagnetism sales b4. I wrked in a single-level marketing(SLM).<br><br>I quit not 'cos de company 'cheated'. Even de products r actually very effective. My relatives and i have bought them. De products work for us. Anyway, frankly speaking i was jobless 4 a while b4 i wrkd in that SLM company, so when i got de job there, i'desperately' grabbed it. But i told de interviewer(who later turned out  b my supervisor) that i'd just "give it a try" as i was never interested in that type of sales job. In addition, i was intrigued by the biomagnetism concept.<br><br>I found de employees there relatively nice. Most of my customers were my relatives &amp; frens(we didnt do cold-calling). Initially i was accompanied by my supervisor when i met my customers. After a while i cud go by myself, but realised that although my product presentation was good, my skill on closing a deal(i.e getting de customers 2 buy de products) was like shit, hehehe. So my supervisor still had 2 accompany me often. Wat irks me was that my supervisor has a problem wth punctuality even after i've politely commented and advised him on it. But to no avail; let's just say that we were often late in meeting our customers. My customers aka my relatives and frens of cors, out of courtesy, said "it's ok" but i felt very paiseh. My supervisor cud @ least try 2 give me some face!<br><br>One 'tactic' i did was 2 bluff my supervisor like dis: I arranged 4 us 2 meet a customer @, say, 3pm, but i'll tell my supervisor that we'l meet de customer @ 2pm. Get de idea?<br><br>Although i mentioned de employees were relatively nice, the way they 'operate' gave me d creeps. I was annoyed by the 'brainwashing' sessions. I can understand the motivation part (cos it's only natural for any company 2 motivate its wrkers). But when they started saying things like:<br>-if u know abt how gd our products r but u dont want 2 recommend to other people, u r stupid.<br>-if u r too worried abt not getting enuf comission, it means u r not thinking longterm.<br>-if u tink that de price of our products r too expensive, u have not understood the true meaning of 'value for price'.<br>-if u know that our products can benefit u but dont want 2 buy them, u r stupid;,<br>etc<br><br>Some of wat they said may have their logic but really, if u've been there &amp; heard it urself, u'll know how pissed i felt. I really felt that they were very being unprofessional. I mean, i even overheard some empoyees gossiping abt their customers who didnt want 2 buy de products. These fellas really called de customers 'stupid'(behind de customers' back of cors)!. And they were actually ANGRY @ de customers for not wanting 2 buy de products.<br><br>Then there was de recruiting sessions in which i helped out. I even assisted in some of de interviews wth de jobseekers. &amp; i really hated de way some senior employers 'slowtalked' de jobseekers in order to lure them 2 wrk wth us. De senior employers beat about de bush abt many things. For example, during de q&amp;a session, some jobseekers asked straightforwardly whether de job has basic pay or is purely comission-based(de truth is de job in dis company is PURELY commissionbased; NO BASIC PAY). But of cors the jobseekers got some longwinded answers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Continued fr my  previous post.<br>According 2 my supervisor, being too straightforward will cause people 2 NOT be interested in wrking wth us. He said that many people r still not willing 2 accept commisionbased job that has no basic pay. Ya i can understand that, but they didnt need to be so 'dishonest' and longwinded either. Speaking of that, as u may know,  all dis slm, ntw, mlm, etc things is related to entrapreneurship. So my de folks @ my previous wrkplace was also 'psychoing' people about how, if they join slm, they can show how 'hardworking' they r.<br><br>Oh, and did i mention how they CRITICISE other type of jobs, especially de basic-salried ones? Ok, so people criticise comissionbased jobs a lot, but usually people just leave these comissionbased fella alone. However, u shuld've heard wat those slm people say! For example, sometimes we wud kepo kepo read de particulars on de jobseekers's job application sheets. And some of my (ex)colleagues wud make fun of de previous jobs of de jobseekers! They were saying things like, "Oh, u know how much a teacher earns?" , "How long u tink dis fixed salary will last?" , "U tink getting a fixed salary is so good is it?" etc.<br><br>In short, they acted as if their slm job was much much better than many other jobs.<br>And when someone resigns, they wont let de person off easily. They say to u things that will make u feel that u r STUPID for wanting to resign.<br><br>Oh, and not forgetting...we always got out 'salary' late. And there was almost always delayed product delivery too. But like i said, my customers mostly said "its ok". I know that a few other employees' customers complained and asked for refunds but i guess there werent enuf complaints to bring dis company to justice. So i guess de company got 'lucky'.<br><br>Anyway, i eventually got another job and resigned. Like i said, they didnt let me off easily. Occasionally, i get smses fr my ex supervisor asking if my relatives who bought de products wud be intrested in some 'new products', bla bla bla....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was in de company for less than 10 yrs(it was said that it's been in Sg for more than 10 yrs). So i didnt know how things were during de yrs b4 i joined. I only know that while i was there, there were LOTS of late deliveries and delayed pays. And it turns out that my supervisor wasnt de only ones wth a punctuality problem. De best answer we cud get fr our superiors were "We dont expect u 2 fully understand". They have dis 'donno dont talk' policy.<br><br>I agree wth another member of dis forum. I forgot his/her nick. I also feel that gd sevice isnt all about not cheating. So wat if u never cheat ur customer?If ur customer always never gets de product on time, thats also bad service!<br><br>And wats wth de criticising of other jobs? I feel that people who do dis r only all de more showing their unprofessionalism! Thats not de way 2 lure people to wrk wth or for u. It's no wonder companies who practices such unprofessionalism have such high turnovers.<br><br>I dont intend to sabo any company here, be it mlm, slm, etc. Even de usual business companies. Only God knows how many companies r operating despicably and, like that other member of dis forum mentioned, "got away wth it".<br><br>There r of cors advantages of joining mlm, slm and the likes of such companies. I mean, some people r meant for all dis entrapreneural stuff. And u get 2 learn how to run a business('businessminded' doesnt always mean '$minded') For some others, it's no harm trying. But  once u suspect sumtin fishy, dont wait until it's too late  escape. Depending on the company, u never know wat will happen to u. And it's wise to research b4hand de company u want to join. De company i was in claimed they have been in sg more than 10 yrs and is a registered company but i find it strange that they dont advertise, only depending on 'word of mouth' promoting by their agents and customers. I mean, dis company was like Oh-we-want-to-share-sometin-that-benefits- the society, but why de hect isnt it doing any proper advertising?<br><br>Anyway, thats all i can say for now. Hope i didnt offend anyone. Best wishes, u all..</div>
