              <p>I recently replied to a PM, but think this is worthy of a topic itself.  The PM to me read as follows:<br><br>"I have read some of your postings and think you are very experienced in MLM and would like seek your advice on the followings :-<br><br>1) I have great difficulty in getting my downline duplicating - can you share some of your experience to overcome this ?<br><br>2) what are the recommended resources available in improving our performance in MLM ?<br><br>Thank you." (name held for confidentiality)</p>
              <p>1 - see below for extended commentary</p>
              <p>2 - Resources . . . Linelogix and gotomeeting - see below for expanded comments</p>
              <p><br>To answer on broader note, Duplication is always one of the biggest challenges in network marketing and goes hand-in-hand with working a "proven" system to enhance successful performance. In working any MLM business, it is important to implement a training regimen of downline for duplication of success. It is imperative that team members learn how to "work" their businesses in a conformed manner - you want to make it as easy as possible. For this reason, it has always been important to have someone "show or teach" you how it is done. You want to learn from those who are ethically and honestly gaining success in your business. Attend trainings and learn to become proficient at gaining sales and recruiting business partners.<br><br>The problem with most people is they do not wish to take the time to learn and therefore effectively fail (give up) at MLM, thereby giving the industry a bad name when they say MLM does not work. The reality is that most people will fail at almost everything because they do not or will not give enough time or effort to learn how to become successful. Anyone can do it  . . . it just takes learning the right principles, practice, and perseverance (over a period of time) to succeed.<br><br>I am growing my organization (over time) and continue learning from my mistakes. I also have mentors to help guide me. In the past, I could not be everywhere for everyone and I cannot not possibly expect everyone to be at or go to trainings. It was a frustrating challenge to grow my organization initially and have everyone on the "same page". My organization grew, but it did so slowly until I began to seek out and use other resources available to me. I now have a huge team subscribing in my organization (PM me if you are interested to know which one) in a number of countries - but it was not always that way.<br><br>I was introduced to online resources that positively changed my business and helped me to grow my organization. These resources have made the job of duplication much easier and allow me to share information and train my team - even when country borders are an issue and I cannot be somewhere in person. My organization is now flourishing and it is rewarding to see it grow and contribute to other people's success, and see them do the same for others, in turn. We are of service to others first - our success comes from this posture.<br><br>One resource is LineLogix (website is just like the name)<br><br>With this resource I am able to share video training with my team – duplication has become much easier because my team can play the video over and over and learn to duplicate, and I can share training resources. I am able to communicate with my team - or just certain team members if I wish. I am able to generate leads online and work leads as customers for my products or as potential recruits into my business via custome email campaigns and auto-responders. LineLogix has so many tools and resources available to network marketing and MLM – it does not matter what product or service or are with – it works. I recently now have my own customized system with the LineLogix. The price of a single account (US$9.95) is inexpensive compared to the incredible gain I experience with my team.  <br><br>I have also an account with gotomeeting (website like name). This allows me to share my computer desktop with my team and train them as well via online meetings and webinars.  It has a free trial, and is worth the (US$49.95).<br><br>In the end, it DOES MATTER what you are doing to enhance your MLM efforts. You must possess a burning desire to succeed and engage sound principles and resources in pursuit of your success. One must be diligent and work for success. No one ever succeeds without first expending effort to learn how to be successful in a networking business, or any business for that matter. Anyone who tells you otherwise should not be trusted – as to think otherwise is to conspire against the laws of the universe.<br><br>We have all heard the motto “you don't get something for nothing”. There is always a sacrifice of some measure. However, here is a caveat . . . working hard is sometimes not as effective as working smart. When I learned to work smart and use online resources I mention above, it helped me to launch my MLM business faster than prior to using “system” tools. There are other resources available, yet these are what I use and they have served me well.  <br><br>Anyone who wishes to add comment or other resources, please do so.<br>To your success . . . . PLUTO</p>
