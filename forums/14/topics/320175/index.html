              <p>From another Bro:</p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> Considering that LFI is a
              major sponsor of Miss Singapore World 2007 and sent the top finalists
              of Miss LFI straight into the Miss Singapore World 2007 pageant, will
              it have a negative impact on our very own Miss Singapore World pageant,
              Miss Chinatown pageant and other pageants associated/linked with LFI
              and LFI winners?<br> <br> * Should we have clear guidelines/regulations for celebrities/pageant
              winners becoming the spokesperson/ ambassador for health
              products/health supplements and other associate products?<br> <br> Gosh, was thinking about this right now. Some action needs to be done
              as a public face can really attract a lot of media and exposure to
              these health products and health supplements.</span></p>
              <p>****************</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I  think he made sense, Remember a minor exchange of words in a previous LFI beauty pageant here and the LFI supporter listed the products are safe as its being endorsed by Tay Ping Hui.</p>

              of "Mentalk Candy", a type of confectionary for health, which has been
              found to be laced with aminotadalafil, a type of medicine to treat
              erectile dysfunction.<br> <br> Health Ministry Pharmaceutical Services Division warned that consuming
              the candy may result in heart failure and depression apart from loss of
              sight on its prolong use or by taking it at a higher dose.<br> <br> Although Tadalafil has been confirmed safe for the treatment of
              erectile dysfunction, the safety profile of its analogue, in contrast,
              has never been tested and it appears to be a new chemical entity which
              has never been detected, the division said in a statement.<br> <br> "Mentalk Candy believed to be used for the same propose (erectile
              dysfunction) can be dangerous if consumed because of the
              pharmacological side effects of the analogue in the human body," it
              said.<br></p>
              <p>It urged the public to report to the authority if the product is
              still available in the country and warned manufacturers and
              distributors that they can be prosecuted under the <strong>Poisons Act 1952</strong>,
              which carries a fine not exceeding <strong>RM5,000 or jail not exceeding two
