Yes, is good that you treat network marketing as 2nd income. First, I'm in no position to discuss more about NTI as I'm not the distributor there and had not get in touch with them before. Here what I know - NOP had been around many years ago, around 90s. My mum was once a distrubutor there, also, I had know many people there, like Mr. Chew, Benny, etc. Mr Chew was the TOP earner. Then, A.Mag, is also another company. It seem they have some inter-link. As for NTI, you have to do your own research, if not, let me know more details, like company details, products, price list, compensation plan, and support that they give. Most industry expert will do this for a fees, but not me - I'll do it for you free.<br><br>Now, about Nuskin, I know about this before it come into Singapore, a great company with well reputation. But it seem some of the people here does not really follow how the system works down in States. But, still, worth looking at. If you are looking at Nuskin, you need to be sure you have a passion on their products. Now, USANA, I also know about this company before it come into Singapore. I also personally know some ex-USANA leader such as Sue Seward, Daren Falter, Rod Nichols,...also Dallin Larsen who was a ex-VP of USANA...too much to list in details. If you ask any USANA Distributor, they know them. USANA's compensation plan had been listed as GOLD 3 years in a row over in the States. A great compensation plan, with great products.<br><br>Hopes this help. ANy other matter what you need, feel free to get in touch with me.</div>

Nti is not a bad company its because of some member inside uses some methods that make other dislike ... so u can consider it, but pls choose a good group which will really teach u on the biz and guide u, fight with u and not pushing u for sales only ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Be reminded all business' main aim is to earn profits, and one of the means is to earn their way thru your heart, whether you are an employee or a MLM distributor.<br><br>No doubt some bosses are genuinely kind hearted, but it pretty irks me whenever people keep talking along the line of good and bad, ethics. moral courage and so on, rather than business ethics, for example, providing good quality products to customers, prompt payment of income due etc etc...<br><br>It worsen, to the point of labelling a company good coy, bad coy, good people, bad people...<br><br>As long as there are masses, even if not all of the groups in a MLM coy behave in an undesirable way, that means the coy is losing control of its distributors. In the long term, the company may not be able to make it, as it loses it image, and hosts of agents and customers leave the company.<br><br>Besides, nti management has never been honest or trustworthy. Look at the number of people leaving in droves, the number of requests for refunds, the number of victims, plus the continual change of refund policy whenever someone try to get his refund, and till the contract says no refund at all, which is illegal under the MLM Act.<br><br>When the last i look at the timetable, only one or two day was reserved for so called product seminar. The rest was many of those 'Hitler fire-torch-like' shows. The whole scheme was not abt pushing for products or services, but to recruit as many people as possible, each could possibly be throwing thousands of dollars, and refused refunds, and labelling it 'good business or investment opportunity.<br><br>When i said, join in and see whether you have earned from it, THAT is alredi professional advice, unless the professional advice you wanted is solely people who will agree with u.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last week, my friend brought me to NTI located in Shenton Way. I was introduced to a manager call Mr Melvin from the SANCTUARY group whom I thought that he had presented in a very professsional way.<br><br>On the contrary to what most say about this company, I was never pressurised to join them or buy any product. When I told them that I need to consider first, they were very friendly and told me to consider carefully to join them. Then I went home that day without joining them. This is surprisingly to me because I had actually read about this company before going there.<br><br>Also, I was shown that their leaders from SANCTUARY group had actually expanded their market in China.<br><br>Unlike other MLM companies such as COSLAB, VENTURE ERA and DW,that kept asking their uplines to talk to me and pressure me to buy their product, it was so pressurising. They refused to let me go and I was like being "locked up" for hours in these companies! Then my friend kept calling me and told me how much $ he have earned and 'forced' me to join him.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When I asked about overseas expansion, they didn't mention a thing to me. Told me that it's still under planning stage. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

I was introduced to a manager call Mr Melvin from the SANCTUARY group whom I thought that he had presented in a very professsional way.<br><br>On the contrary to what most say about this company, I was never pressurised to join them or buy any product. When I told them that I need to consider first, they were very friendly and told me to consider carefully to join them. Then I went home that day without joining them. This is surprisingly to me because I had actually read about this company before going there.<br><br>Also, I was shown that their leaders from SANCTUARY group had actually expanded their market in China.<br><br>Unlike other MLM companies such as COSLAB, VENTURE ERA and DW,that kept asking their uplines to talk to me and pressure me to buy their product, it was so pressurising. They refused to let me go and I was like being "locked up" for hours in these companies! Then my friend kept calling me and told me how much $ he have earned and 'forced' me to join him.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When I asked about overseas expansion, they didn't mention a thing to me. Told me that it's still under planning stage. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>thats good!! join NTI!!!!<br><br>by the way, you dont have to use such technique to cover up NTI...<br><br>i really don't understand why nowadays, NTI dont dare to say they from NTI..instead act like third parties to score points for them.<br><br>either they are shame of their NTI or they trying to con people again..<br><br>HAIZ  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

There must be something that people does not understand or misuse it.<br><br>I don't consider myself smart. But I will be here to clarify any doubt if need be. Whether it's a terrible mistake or not, I consider myself a lesson learnt. Afterall, if there are people out there who have proven that they can earn big bucks, why don't I give myself a chance?<br><br>It's a small investment afterall compared to those thousands of dollars to set up a business.

I am not a salesperson, just a purchaser...... But his projects never take place!!!! and i ended up paying for things that are never completed. Mr Phang, if you are reading (i doubt so, as you must be thinkg of more scams to cheat pple), i want to let you know that there is a group of pple who really hate you and we are hoping that you will fail and never can harm pple again.<br><br>As for his management, Desmond and Jackie, i know them personnally as well. If you want to earn as much as them, you may want to consider working at MacDonalds instead who may be paying more and afterall, you will not be harming pple.<br><br></div>

(Mind you, the China market's pie are for those Pioneer batches, however, not all....)<br><br>Well..you seriously go n think about it yourself...i'm not against you joining or been part of NTI...anyone's free to do what they feel is right....<br><br>Btw, if anyone of you think that by not stressing you for any sales make you feel comfortable or the company's not pressurizing you and still can talk nicely to you..hMz..u call that sales?

Never Say Die attitude? <strong><span style="color: red;">SUCCESSFUL</span></strong>?????<br><br>No one has ever answer me the questions which i've brought up years ago...if the Boss of NTI &amp; his upper managements also can't answer my questions, what makes you think his employees/downlines can?<br><br></div>
