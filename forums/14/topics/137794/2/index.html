Being a Director or Manager of any companies is an honest job. Not trying to say that NTI's doing some "dishonest" thingy, but ever thought of why so many ppl (including those who had joined NTI or any simliar compaines) are regretting n felt that they've been cheated or tricked?<br><br>Well...you may say that it's becoz they did not earn $$$ n that's y they're "saying grapes're sour"...<br><br>Also, if you're thinking of doing something big n earn big bucks, y not you invest in shares? 50-50 in shares...chances of working so hard to see big bucks under NTI's very slim compared to shares.<br><br>Not saying that you'll fail in working with NTI, but then, it's still up to you to decide what you want...money's not easy to earn, but easy to be tricked becoz of greediness....<br><br>Btw, i've known a few businessmen who're bosses...two of them had their companies public listed in the main board. What's their recipes? Hardwork n high IQ ( Smart )...<br><br>I believe you still do not have a clear vision of what NTI's doing...i believe you strongly believe in NTI is becoz of the ways they manage n talk to their employees...how's &amp; what's the company's prospects? (Do you think that you're able to make ppl believe in NTI when the ratio of ppl against NTI is 1:5? or manye even worse...) If that's so, do you think you can succeed in NTI? Also, how long do you intend to give yourself a grace period to see your success in NTI?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

I believe by doing so, NTI'll never going to be a good name to ppl outside...what ppl may feel that NTI's just trying to make money n turn their employees into very successful ppl...but then...what's NTI's products? Are they selling products or promoting their scrolls of success? It beats me.....<br><br>You dun prove your products in these ways...i mean, majority of ppl's impression of NTI's not good already, and so, y shld you wanna argue with them? You shld be selling ur products instead of trying to revive the name of NTI into good impression.<br><br>Remember, it's a sales job...you need to have sales...and lots of sales to be earning big bucks n successful....make ppl trust ur products n not the company..that's what i do not see most NTI's employees are doing...they're arguing or rather debating that how good is NTI doing...<br><br>What i've seen in LPS, every NTI employee at LPS's doing circles &amp; lines....all the SIR thingy &amp; etc....but hey...where're the products? As a consumer, i'm more interested in your products rather than to know how you make your money thru these money-making plans n recruiting ppl....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Have you gained any knowledge of the laws associated with doing business? What about understanding the economy and what about the global economy? Do you know how to read a company's financial statements? Can you develop any level of understanding about the health of the company thru it's financial statements? Do you know where your company stands in terms of the local economy? Do you know how to valuate your company? What are the risks your company is exposed in terms of long-term debts? How vulnerable is it to a recession? Does it have any durable competitive advantage? If you are the owner of ur business, you should at least know a little of what I've mentioned. Only an employee need not necessary to know about such things.<br><br>At the end of the day, you are just an agent for the company, selling or recruiting and gaining comission from the sales of the products. What is worse is that you probably work as hard or even harder than a salesman in sony gallery, and you dont have a stable income like him.

A word of advice for you - spend your quality time recruiting MORE people than posting ur comments here. you at least will get more sales there. There were many like you, advocating for NTI religiously, but then in the end registered a new nick and shot nti to kingdom come. go read all the previous posts on nti. Nti DOES NOT represent mlm - the way they operate people already know. Many of us we say based on the facts that occur - ALL nti people are like that.

            <div class='col-md body'>now tht u mention it, makes sense<br>i agree with u on tht<br>the products is more or less just a facade.<br>when i was there they emphasise more on "providing opportunity for the young," "learn biz in a sheltered environment," blablabla..<br>they seem to be using tht as a selling point, and it's working quite well i must say, especially on the vulnarable young adults like myself...<br>then once they're in, they'll be "trapped" and will have to drag more ppl in if they wan to earn back their money...<br></div>

You are only selling products or recruiting ppl to join you, where the f can u gain any business knowledge or experience? You are no better off from a salesman in Sony Gallery. How much of a businessman does that make you?<br>Telling you that mlm gives u a chance at business is like talking with my asshole. Have you gained any knowledge of the laws associated with doing business? What about understanding the economy and what about the global economy? Do you know how to read a company's financial statements? Can you develop any level of understanding about the health of the company thru it's financial statements? Do you know where your company stands in terms of the local economy? Do you know how to valuate your company? What are the risks your company is exposed in terms of long-term debts? How vulnerable is it to a recession? Does it have any durable competitive advantage? If you are the owner of ur business, you should at least know a little of what I've mentioned. Only an employee need not necessary to know about such things.<br><br>At the end of the day, you are just an agent for the company, selling or recruiting and gaining comission from the sales of the products. What is worse is that you probably work as hard or even harder than a salesman in sony gallery, and you dont have a stable income like him. If you spend some effort to learn how businesses and economies work, you will find there are many more creative, interesting and profitable way of doing business. And MLM ultimately only benefit the top guy or the owner of the company. YES the owner of the company... that is his business.... not yours. He's the one with the business knowledge and resources, so what if this mlm company doesn't work, he can always start another one and start the whole process again. you are the one losing out. If deep in your heart, you have totally no doubts about NTI or the concept of MLM, then good luck to you..... hope you find financial independence.....</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ...straight onto the dot...that's the whole prob and crapz with NTI. They didn't tell me about their products nor do they show any intention to tell. They talk about how you can become rich, and how they are expanding, but they cite no figures to substantiate. Looking at their financial statements and balance sheets are definitely out of question. All they want to do is to charm their way to capture your heart and your money, just like how a guy could do to a gal to bed, even when he could be a jerk afterall. I can't believe how they have the cheek to suggest that I put &gt;$1k into them(when they obviously knew I'm an NSF), when I know nothing about their company nor their products, besides their 'great' compensation plan, and all the sweet but shallow talks.<br><br>It makes totally no business sense. No real businessmen in his right mind would put his money into a company when he doesn't even understand the products they sell, how much sales are they making, their financial health, their prospects, their future plans, etc, besides shallow and crude knowledge such as 'you have to take risk to reap rewards', blah blah blah<br><br>"Never invest in a business you cannot understand."<br><br>"It is optimism that is the enemy of the rational buyer."<br><br>"The ability to say "no" is a tremendous advantage for an investor."<br><br>- Some words of wisdom by Buffett....<br></div>

He only do reply in his personal email.<br><br>Ok, Amway had been around for many years, and many think that Amway is the Grandfather of MLM which in fact is not true. There is another company which started much early than Amway. In total, Amway is not a bad company. They have open the China market with a very grand office.

In actualy fact, as what I know, YSLYSL was a pioneer in one of the Top MLM Company, however, some of his downlines earn more than him.</div>
