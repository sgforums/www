Maybe is not a scam or fraud? Pls enlighten me?

Maybe the price to start the biz is a bit expensive i guess, thats the bad point i guess? Pls enlighten me if wat i research is wrong?

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm former a manager in NTI and i'm very disgusted by the way the company run everything. i feel guilty after cheating my friends to invest so much money into this company... i'm too naive previously... i thought the company is really teaching me to be a businessman..but after i found out the truth.. they are simply using me and my friends to help them earn money. those sweet talks and motivations are simply trying to make me and my friends to fight harder for them. the RSDs are not making alot of money as what the company have projected to us. its all a setup to paint nice picture to lure youngster like us into believing and invested our savings into them. i really feel cheated after finding out the truth.. please, dont follow my footsteps. i feel very sad to lose my friends who are trying hard to get me out of NTI.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
