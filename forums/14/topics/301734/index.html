            <div class='col-md body'>Why must use main stream to sell that items? Yes they could do that and let the intermediaries to gain those money (transport, retail, wholesale agents, advertiser ) What Melaleuca do is that they have their own shops they have their own transport they do their own research but skip the advertisement fees and give it back the their customers.<br><br>Is that really bad to do such things? The CEO himself said that he want people to gain wealth together with him by just doing what? refer to other people as long as you feel that the products that you are using is good. All he wanted is people to change brands like dynamo to a more eco-friendly products , Is that wrong? Even if you don't like his products anytime, you could just change back to any other brands. Is that hard? no.<br><br>The system are somehow "like" multi level but how different is Melaleuca to other companies, You need to find out more yourself and give your comments. if you just take a look from a bigger view. It's just a company who open a eco-friendly supermarket and don't advertise but asking members to refer the products to people.<br><br>Yes the only thing that is similar to MLM is that you get $ from the purchases down the 7 levels. Just treat it like Manufacturer to wholesale to retailer to customers. Yes the top might get all the profits. But why the top levels get lots of profit. Take an example, Hp Printers. The manufacturer sell them to many wholesale in different region of asia. In singapore they might be many retailer and each retailer sells to different customers. So is the top getting most of the $?<br><br>I try to explain as well as i could. It might still be flawed. Clarification are welcome. If there is something that i really can't defend and agreed with you. I will do so and if the bad points are over the good points. I still not defend anymore.<br><br>Like many people said, i might got psycho by those brain washer. So maybe you could wake me up. I've been purchasing their products for 4 months. And still not starting because i really don't want to give out false information to my friends. Maybe i could use this channel to get more ideas.<br><br>I appreciate that guy who call me to look around first. But i've been around looking on this type of things since 2-3 years or more?. See my date joined you might know how long i've stay inactive looking through those post once every few weeks or month, and seriously i get sick at looking at the wars around the posts in Enyouth and VE.<br><br></div>

              <p><strong>Melaleuca is NOTHING like Amway or those Multi-level deals</strong>.   I've been a customer for over 14 months now and I can tell you from first hand experience they are not like those multi level companies. </p>
              <p>They dont have distributors.  As a customer I just shop from the store and pick up what I want each month.  They do have a discount program where I get 40% off everything I buy which I love (and I love saving money :)</p>
              <p>I've never been told to recruit anyone (though they do have a customer referal program I believe) </p>
              <p><strong>I shop with them BECAUSE they have some of the best cleaning products I've ever used - and they're more natural and better for the environment which I like as well.  Their prices are good and their quality is great. </strong></p>
