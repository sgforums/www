Even though mlm is supposed to benefit the individual who have no captial to set up businesses like wal-mart's, most mlmers are worse off than b4 they entered mlm companies. I dare say this becoz from looking at my brother's friends, my friends and my close friends' friends. none of them have yet drove the bmw and drawing 5k salaries that mlm companies promise them. Many have quit,  1 or 2 did get a new car but couple of months later sold it coz unable to pay installments.  OK, given that they are F up and cannot make it big in life, this fact also shows that most ppl will not succeed in mlm. they are better off, working in a job that pays stable and constant salaries. </div></blockquote>you need at least 2 to 3 years to see your results... i never heard any business become so profitable immediately upon setting up.<br><br>to be true, most business in singapore collapse after 2 to 3 years.. its not whether mlm can be done anot... its about who is the person running the business.<br><br>"winners never quit and quitters never win"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing in this world is no risk got gain.  Before you start up a business how much money do you need to invest?  How much time do you need to invest?  Can you definitely guarantee results after 1, 2 or 3 years?<br><br>The point here is Amway or other MLM can let you continue your full time job while buliding your business part-time, if you don't see any result say 2years then you may not be suitable in doing MLM.  At least you are able to continue your job without facing any financial hardship.<br><br>Reasons for your failure may due to,<br>1.  Not harworking<br>2.  Not enough training<br>3.  No product knowledge<br>4.  Your upline do not help you when you meet challenges<br>5.  The product itself do not convince your potential customer<br><br>So the point here is some people are too ambitous or over confident, they assume that they will definitely succeed in MLM thus qutting their job.  After 1-2years they found that they are not earning any money, they become frustrated, angry and start blaming the MLM company, finally giving negative feedback like MLM company is a scam, only fools will what to be involved, blah, blah, blah.  This is human nature, they will always blame others instead of themselves.  [/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by teekh:</div><div class="quote_body">Why isn't it appropriate to compare Wal-Mart with Amway? I think you grossly underestimated the scale and the range of products that Wal-Mart is selling. Wal-Mart, in fact, sells everything from groceries to household products, from electronics to CDs/DVDs, from books to toys, and from jewellery to pharmaceuticals in their hypermarts! In fact, the things Amway sells are parallel to what Wal-Mart sells. As long as they sell similar products, how could it be an unfair comparison? It's not as if we are comparing McDonalds to Charles and Keith. MLM is just a sales model, not an isolated industry.<br><br>Wal-Mart was founded in 1962 while Amway was founded 1959, so Amway actually had a headstart.<br><br>So how are they doing now?<br><br>Wal-Mart raked in US$256 billion of sales in the year 2004(2 times the size of Singapore's GDP), and have actually been growing at a rate of more than 10% a year for the past 10 years and beyond. In the same year, they also made a pre-tax profit of US$15 billion in the same year.<br><br>Amway, on the other hand, only raked in US$6.2 billion of 'estimated retail sales'(A term used by them since 1963), in the year 2004. 'Estimated retail sales'? They couldn't even know for sure themselves how much worth of products they themselves have sold!? Furthermore, they have been languishing at this level for the past 10 years!<br><br>For every dollar worth of products that bought from Wal-Mart, 77.4c of it goes to the cost price, and that means Wal-Mart keeps only 22.6c of it. After paying the controversially low wages to their employees, rentals and everything, the actually earned 5.8c for every dollar of products they sold, after taxes, the figure would further reduce to just 4c.<br><br>So how does Wal-Mart earn so much, when they keep so little of what they receive? The answer is simply 'volume'. They buy their products in bulk, in order to get them at a lower price than other competitors, so that they can pass the benefits to the consumer. And with such low prices, and good service, people couldn't compete with them. Just think of Kmart, which got beaten badly, and declared bankrupt. If you've read the papers and TIME/Newsweel(not tabloids ie new paper), even bookstores and toy specialists such as toys 'r us are also struggling to keep up with them now.<br><br>How could Amway compete with them, when commissions to agents actually marked up the price much higher? If Amway agents were to compete with Wal-Mart, they probably would have to undercut their commissions such that they don't earn enough to feed themselves. Firstly, Amway, as long as they are selling other people's product, can't get their goods at the same competitive price as Wal-Mart does, because they don't have as much of a bargain power as Wal-Mart. Secondly, as long as  total commissions to the so many layers of agents is more than 16.8%(a high likelihod in MLM; 22.6 - 5.8 = 16.8 ) of the selling price, they will also fail to compete with Wal-Mart in terms of staff and operating costs.<br><br>Wal-Mart worried of Amway?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> It's not an apple to orange comparison. More like an elephant to mouse comparison. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Of course, there probably will plausible scenarios that MLM may work. But companies should decide their sales model accordingly to the products they are selling, and the industry they are in, to best serve the consumer. Many MLM start-ups, at least in SG, are either scams or just MLMing for the sake of MLM.<br><br>agree <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> agree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> 100% agree <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> , who is BMW and who is Proton now huh ?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

As said in the above post, there may be plausible  scenarios that it may do well(though I haven't really experience one...maybe forever living or herbal life?), which I think is more likely on higher end and luxuorious products where perhaps service quality(one to one service) and exclusivity(ie Having what others don't) counts more than price; Where pricing isn't an issue at all.<br><br>I, however, disagree that MLMs can change very much the way we buy our daily groceries and household products, especially when price/price-for-performance is the key to decision-making process of buying.<br><br>Counting something as one's business means having at least a part-owenership in something; owning at least a share. Whatever else you are doing can only be called a profession. I think Rich Dad, despite my criticisms, explained it quite well, citing Ray Kroc(then-CEO of McDonald's), who said that selling hamburgers is his profession; his business is in real-estates(because McDonald's own the stores).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have see too much down here, and recently, after one of my training that I conduct down in Malaysia, I feel, not all will accept MLM, and not all are for MLM. I mention this because if all will to get into MLM then , who will be there in tradition business? Will will attend to us if we will want to be on the plane? Who will be there for us if we need to have some great food?<br><br>So, in total, I feel, those who accept MLM will be able to enjoy life in they put in enough effort, and of course, those who did not accept will also be able to enjoy life.<br><br>Lastly, I give my highest respect to thsoe who are in normal tradition industry, without you, I won't know where to go during all my time during holiday. Thank you and keep up the Great work.</div>
