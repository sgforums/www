I do not want to quote any famous brands or talk about some great books or even what a famous person says. To me, MLM is juz another form of distribution channel/medium from a main distributor<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">agents<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">consumers. Unethical MLM networkers will engaged in hard-selling prospects into consumers/networkers. This is due to poor management of the upline organisation and lack of training in the company. Loyalty programs of consumer products like some of the brands we know sells, they aren't scams. for example, buy 10 cups of ice-cream, get one free. would you bring your friends to the palour for ice-cream for your own selfishness, i bet most of us will do it. What about yourself? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Juz my 2 cents, read my signature, you will know.</div>

If advertising, hiring a few thousand staff and having various expensive distribution channel works, why doesn't Amway do it?  Different companies, with different target audience have a different direction they want to move towards to.  Hence, each will have a different way of marketing their own products.  Furthermore, Walmart doesn't have their own brand product.  They are merely a supermarket like Carresfour.<br><br>Why don't insurance companies run like Walmart, having outlets all over USA, instead of using Personal Selling way of marketing?<br><br>And about Amway, not every distributor is doing the business.  Some are just users, who signed up as dist to get the discount.  Hence, there are some with $0 sales for months.  Therefore, we cannot look at the sales in terms of average of each distributor.</div>
