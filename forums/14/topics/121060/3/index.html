Having Â“forsakenÂ” his family, children and denying self, he is most willing to stand by you in fighting this victorious MLM war.<br><br>Company-&gt;technology:<br><br>3.

Know nothing but still blow cannon. :S<br><br>Rich Dad Poor Dad may be a good start to learn in some ways...but treating Kiyosaki's book as your bible to business success, is a very much road to financial suicide.<br><br>It's also ironic that while RDPD and others was written with financial prudence in mind and the theme 'the rich don't work for money', the very same books contradict themselves preaching 'working towards the materialistic wants you want to achieve' and and very much tells you it's cool to boast around your material possesions and other extravagance.<br><br>Read books on the lives and success of Sam Walton, Warren Buffett, Micheal Dell, Ray Kroc(the man who made McDonald's famous) and even George Soros and you'll see how frugal these people are as compared to Kiyosaki.

I think you grossly underestimated the scale and the range of products that Wal-Mart is selling. Wal-Mart, in fact, sells everything from groceries to household products, from electronics to CDs/DVDs, from books to toys, and from jewellery to pharmaceuticals in their hypermarts! In fact, the things Amway sells are parallel to what Wal-Mart sells. As long as they sell similar products, how could it be an unfair comparison? It's not as if we are comparing McDonalds to Charles and Keith. MLM is just a sales model, not an isolated industry.<br><br>Wal-Mart was founded in 1962 while Amway was founded 1959, so Amway actually had a headstart.<br><br>So how are they doing now?<br><br>Wal-Mart raked in US$256 billion of sales in the year 2004(2 times the size of Singapore's GDP), and have actually been growing at a rate of more than 10% a year for the past 10 years and beyond. In the same year, they also made a pre-tax profit of US$15 billion in the same year.<br><br>Amway, on the other hand, only raked in US$6.2 billion of 'estimated retail sales'(A term used by them since 1963), in the year 2004. 'Estimated retail sales'? They couldn't even know for sure themselves how much worth of products they themselves have sold!? Furthermore, they have been languishing at this level for the past 10 years!<br><br>For every dollar worth of products that bought from Wal-Mart, 77.4c of it goes to the cost price, and that means Wal-Mart keeps only 22.6c of it. After paying the controversially low wages to their employees, rentals and everything, the actually earned 5.8c for every dollar of products they sold, after taxes, the figure would further reduce to just 4c.<br><br>So how does Wal-Mart earn so much, when they keep so little of what they receive? The answer is simply 'volume'. They buy their products in bulk, in order to get them at a lower price than other competitors, so that they can pass the benefits to the consumer. And with such low prices, and good service, people couldn't compete with them. Just think of Kmart, which got beaten badly, and declared bankrupt. If you've read the papers and TIME/Newsweel(not tabloids ie new paper), even bookstores and toy specialists such as toys 'r us are also struggling to keep up with them now.<br><br>How could Amway compete with them, when commissions to agents actually marked up the price much higher? If Amway agents were to compete with Wal-Mart, they probably would have to undercut their commissions such that they don't earn enough to feed themselves. Firstly, Amway, as long as they are selling other people's product, can't get their goods at the same competitive price as Wal-Mart does, because they don't have as much of a bargain power as Wal-Mart. Secondly, as long as  total commissions to the so many layers of agents is more than 16.8%(a high likelihod in MLM; 22.6 - 5.8 = 16.8 ) of the selling price, they will also fail to compete with Wal-Mart in terms of staff and operating costs.<br><br>Wal-Mart worried of Amway?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> It's not an apple to orange comparison. More like an elephant to mouse comparison. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Of course, there probably will plausible scenarios that MLM may work. But companies should decide their sales model accordingly to the products they are selling, and the industry they are in, to best serve the consumer. Many MLM start-ups, at least in SG, are either scams or just MLMing for the sake of MLM.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what he's trying to say here is that personal retailing aka direct selling aka mlm is not necessary superior like what mlm companies advocate when compared to normal retail. Even though mlm is supposed to benefit the individual who have no captial to set up businesses like wal-mart's, most mlmers are worse off than b4 they entered mlm companies. I dare say this becoz from looking at my brother's friends, my friends and my close friends' friends. none of them have yet drove the bmw and drawing 5k salaries that mlm companies promise them. Many have quit,  1 or 2 did get a new car but couple of months later sold it coz unable to pay installments.  OK, given that they are F up and cannot make it big in life, this fact also shows that most ppl will not succeed in mlm. they are better off, working in a job that pays stable and constant salaries.</div>
