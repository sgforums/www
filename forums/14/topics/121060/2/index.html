The majority must be sold to outsiders.<br><br>The test often used to establish what "majority" of sales by US courts is that 70%  of sales must be to outsiders. (People who buy the product for its own sake, not with the intention of earning comissions by recruiting others)<br><br>The reason that this is so important is that if most sales are made to fellow members, then if sales are to continue new members must be recruited.

The best guide to use is that of an independent government regulator. This way one is sure that the advice given is free of bias.  The US Federal Trade Commission's guide is very helpful.<br><br>it is available here:<br><br>http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/invest/mlm.htm<br><br>Amongst other things the FTC advises that people should watch out for the following:<br><br>'If a plan offers to pay commissions for recruiting new distributors, watch out! Most states outlaw this practice, which is known as "pyramiding."'<br><br>"Why is pyramiding prohibited? Because plans that pay commissions for recruiting new distributors inevitably collapse when no new distributors can be recruited. And when a plan collapses, most people -- except perhaps those at the very top of the pyramid -- lose their money."<br><br>They also advise that:<br><br>1. Avoid any plan that includes commissions for recruiting additional distributors. It may be an illegal pyramid.<br><br>2. Beware of plans that ask new distributors to purchase expensive inventory. These plans can collapse quickly -- and also may be thinly-disguised pyramids.<br><br>3. Be cautious of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your "downline" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through sales of products you make yourself.<br><br>4. Beware of plans that claim to sell miracle products or promise enormous earnings. Just because a promoter of a plan makes a claim doesn't mean it's true! Ask the promoter of the plan to substantiate claims with hard evidence.<br><br>5. Beware of shills -- "decoy" references paid by a plan's promoter to describe their fictional success in earning money through the plan.<br><br>6. Don't pay or sign any contracts in an "opportunity meeting" or any other high-pressure situation. Insist on taking your time to think over a decision to join. Talk it over with your spouse, a knowledgeable friend, an accountant or lawyer.<br><br>See also:<br><br>http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/pyrdalrt.htm<br><br>The Australian government runs a site that  gives useful tips on avoiding them here:<br><br>http://www.scamwatch.gov.au/content/scams/scams.asp<br><br>Some known scams are listed here (by the State government of South Australia):<br><br>http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/scams/03_pyramidscheme.html<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do some companies insist on members maintaining min. volume points or sales every month?<br><br>This is the question that has been bugging me.<br><br>Some companies (not to name any here) require members to maintain at least approx S$300 worth of volume points every month.  This means that the member will have to purchase S$300 worth of products from the office and the company assume that the member can clear the stock every month.  If the member fail to fulfill the min. in a month, he will be downgraded or demoted (something like that).<br><br>I feel this is not the right thing and it's not fair to the distributor.  What if, in a certain month or period, the distributor slows down in his business for some reasons?  He will be demoted and has to work hard all over again to go back to the original level where he came down from.  So many people got their fingers burnt because of that.<br><br>I think a good MLM company should not require the member to throw in money just like that or force the member to invest in so many stocks.  What if the member cannot clear the stock before it expires?<br><br>Some MLMers or those interested in exploring are retrenched staff, housewives with little allowances from husband, jobless ones etc.  We cannot expect them to throw in a few thousand dollars and call it an investment, while they have not even made their first dollar from the business.  A good MLM company should have avenues for such people, and should only require them to pay for the membership processing fee (that's all).<br><br>If a MLM company requires members to purchase a min stock to do the business, what difference does it make from pyramid or time sharing company???  Unfortunately, while MLM is a great opportunity for most people, there have been a lot of black sheep in the market.<br><br>Luckily there are still good companies that don't "eat" their members' money.  So for those of you exploring the business, do keep your eyes and ears open.  Don't be afraid to say "I have to think about it" if you really need time to research and think deeply about it.  If the particular distributor force you to go into the business (what we usually call Hard Sell), but the company system is good, just walk away and look for another distributor of the same company.  You wouldn't want to work the business with pushy people, right?</div>

So for those of you exploring the business, do keep your eyes and ears open.  Don't be afraid to say "I have to think about it" if you really need time to research and think deeply about it.  If the particular distributor force you to go into the business (what we usually call Hard Sell), but the company system is good, just walk away and look for another distributor of the same company.  You wouldn't want to work the business with pushy people, right?  </div></blockquote>I agree wholehearted with you although many have been said that with maintainance, there is a fixed income, otherwise, where did the money comes from.  I know of some companies, ( regretfully very few ) that do not requires you to maintain.  You only need to buy what you need and still allow you to earn from the sale you downline make..  I have been victims of hard selling too.  more often than not, you end up losing a friend by not joining ...   Well that being the case I do not mind losing it since they do not care for your welfare in the first place....  who say, you will find out who is your friend after you join MLM.  You can also judge your friend who join MLM....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that some companies out there wants you to maintain a min volume for a few reasons :<br><br>1. It is to ensure that everyone is 'forced' to produce so that products will get moved. Think about it, if no one does anything, will any company survive? This is especially if the products from the company is not an ESSENTIAL product.<br><br>2. The management simply thought of this clause in the marketg plan to make more money. The fear of loss of distributors in case they get demoted will always means they will buy up the volume be it they need it or not.<br><br>Personally, i know HERBALIFE does not requires any min volume to keep your status on a monthly basis. Once you get to a level called Supervisor, you keep the status for a year at least ( correct me if i am wrong). The way i see it, it is rather fair as it gives you a year to build your customer base so that the business you generate from OUTSIDE your group will automatically qualify you again.... and isn't this what a healthy business should look like?<br><br>I studied their marketing plan and they do not have any monthly fixed target you are FORCED to maintain. It is absolutely voluntary... if you work (retail or recruit or from your group volume) you get paid. Fair enough....</div>
