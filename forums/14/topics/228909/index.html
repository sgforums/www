            <div class='col-md body'>Yah think it costs more. It should be in the 5 figure region if you take up their distributorship.

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought only youngsters would fall for this trick. Ok, it's not that fair to say it's a trick, but it's IMO anyways. Usually, it's the corporate world savvy adults esp. parents who would warn their kids abt MLM and pyramid sales. For it to be the other way round, this is a very weird case indeed.</div>
