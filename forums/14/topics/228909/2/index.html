            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I think if the parents are seriously willingly to invest their time mounting to years to run MLM business, I dont think there is any big issue here. 40 sets can be marketed conservatively over a span of 1 to 2 years.<br><br>However, most people are just interested in short term, fast cash and I hope this is not the case. Most people do not have the patience and perservance to run through their MLM business for more than 2 years, thus resulting in failure and lossess.<br><br>I think we can just encourage them to market out the 40 sets successfully in the shortest possible time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, everyone has their own point of view. Just happen to be free and post it here.<br><br>Yes, I agree that you should not front load to a certain extend. Alot of people are hurted when they invested a sum of money into the business which they are unsure or not fully understand. But isn't business talking about investments too? All kind of business need capital. Do something which you can manage.<br><br>Main reasons could be that they are not suitable for the business or even  lack the confidence to really deal in the business. There are cases where people cleared the stocks faster then they ever expect in many companies. Lucks play a part if there are people who wants to claim it this way. But end of the day is the person's credentials and ready contacts.<br><br>In a business point of view, maybe we can first understand your parents why and how long have they been in the business? Even in traditional business, people have to invest money which is even more frightening figures. They even lose money in the process of starting a business. People tends to be able to accept the facts on losing money on traditional business but not in MLM business ya.. How come? The human behaviour seem like to claim that MLM must not lose money and make money straight away? Is it the right way to analysis? Try to spend time to think in their shoes too.<br><br>Have any one here fly into USA and Europe countries to view trade shows? People pay thousands of dollars to fly n attend those trade shows and paid money to purchase the samples or even materials just to understand. They have not earn a single cents too but it is an investment. They could even ended up without a franchise business back home. Running a business is not easy as everyone thinks. Starting is easily, maintaining, sustaining and running it will test your judgement, foresights and insights. Like wise is the same as MLM. If you go around asking people who lose money in traditional business if they will do business again, they will say yes. But if you ask someone who is in MLM before, most of them will tell you no, Why? Isn't it a little contridicting too?<br><br>Be it traditional business or MLM business, people must know what they are doing. Businessman knows what to expects and they are very focus too. They do not have the time to be emotional or even time to bother about small issues. They look into many aspects in where they can generate profits, like wise same in MLM. A businessman must think of how much money he can afford to lose in the business too, which means he has a backup funds or capital. He will prepare a sum of loading capital where he will plans on when he will get his return of investments. 3-5 years if he is fast and pray hard nothing is going to happen like unknown factors like floods, earthquakes, sars, WAR, terrorism etc. These factors can wind up his business  but not MLM. MLM business is a compressed methods of running a business, where most people need not to worry about renting a office, setting up factories, meeting products dealline, custom clearances, product quality, after sales service, shipping n handling etc. The MLM people just get the end products and all they need to do is to market it well. It is just humans who failed the system.<br><br>Why are banks rich? They lend money to businessman, bank earns the interests of what the businessman loan. In fact, the banks are worried that the businessman will not earn enough money to pay the interests n become bankrupt, which bank may not even get a single cents too. Therefore, business and MLM, people still needs to run it like a business, urgency etc. Many aspects to be learn n actions.<br><br>Business has many traps and rewards. It is up to how a person can identify what is for him and what is not. There are cases where this person fail in this MLM company but he succeed only maybe on his 3rd company. The valuable experience and knowledge he earns will make him a better person n leader to be too. Likewise same in MLM.<br><br>OK, have to end here, i can stilll carry on. I know this a free speech forums, wouldn't it be better if everyone try to be more open to take in answers with respects rather than running down on it?<br><br>Take care everyone<br><br></div>

I have also asked him to research more about the product and the company and he has also gone for their seminar last weekend, after that he feels that this company is a good one and the product is sellable.<br><br>Maybe one day I should go down there myself to have a look.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by y0ng81:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, everyone has their own point of view. Just happen to be free and post it here.<br><br>Yes, I agree that you should not front load to a certain extend. Alot of people are hurted when they invested a sum of money into the business which they are unsure or not fully understand. But isn't business talking about investments too? All kind of business need capital. Do something which you can manage.<br><br>Main reasons could be that they are not suitable for the business or even  lack the confidence to really deal in the business. There are cases where people cleared the stocks faster then they ever expect in many companies. Lucks play a part if there are people who wants to claim it this way. But end of the day is the person's credentials and ready contacts.<br><br>In a business point of view, maybe we can first understand your parents why and how long have they been in the business? Even in traditional business, people have to invest money which is even more frightening figures. They even lose money in the process of starting a business. People tends to be able to accept the facts on losing money on traditional business but not in MLM business ya.. How come? The human behaviour seem like to claim that MLM must not lose money and make money straight away? Is it the right way to analysis? Try to spend time to think in their shoes too.<br><br>Have any one here fly into USA and Europe countries to view trade shows? People pay thousands of dollars to fly n attend those trade shows and paid money to purchase the samples or even materials just to understand. They have not earn a single cents too but it is an investment. They could even ended up without a franchise business back home. Running a business is not easy as everyone thinks. Starting is easily, maintaining, sustaining and running it will test your judgement, foresights and insights. Like wise is the same as MLM. If you go around asking people who lose money in traditional business if they will do business again, they will say yes. But if you ask someone who is in MLM before, most of them will tell you no, Why? Isn't it a little contridicting too?<br><br>Be it traditional business or MLM business, people must know what they are doing. Businessman knows what to expects and they are very focus too. They do not have the time to be emotional or even time to bother about small issues. They look into many aspects in where they can generate profits, like wise same in MLM. A businessman must think of how much money he can afford to lose in the business too, which means he has a backup funds or capital. He will prepare a sum of loading capital where he will plans on when he will get his return of investments. 3-5 years if he is fast and pray hard nothing is going to happen like unknown factors like floods, earthquakes, sars, WAR, terrorism etc. These factors can wind up his business  but not MLM. MLM business is a compressed methods of running a business, where most people need not to worry about renting a office, setting up factories, meeting products dealline, custom clearances, product quality, after sales service, shipping n handling etc. The MLM people just get the end products and all they need to do is to market it well. It is just humans who failed the system.<br><br>Why are banks rich? They lend money to businessman, bank earns the interests of what the businessman loan. In fact, the banks are worried that the businessman will not earn enough money to pay the interests n become bankrupt, which bank may not even get a single cents too. Therefore, business and MLM, people still needs to run it like a business, urgency etc. Many aspects to be learn n actions.<br><br>Business has many traps and rewards. It is up to how a person can identify what is for him and what is not. There are cases where this person fail in this MLM company but he succeed only maybe on his 3rd company. The valuable experience and knowledge he earns will make him a better person n leader to be too. Likewise same in MLM.<br><br>OK, have to end here, i can stilll carry on. I know this a free speech forums, wouldn't it be better if everyone try to be more open to take in answers with respects rather than running down on it?<br><br>Take care everyone<br><br></div></blockquote>I disagree with the portion where u stated that MLM businesses are not affected by natural disasters or other shocks to the economy. You're implying that floods do not destroy MLM factories and new regulatory laws will not affect MLM companies in any sense.. You have to factor in that not all MLM companies have legitimate schemes/ genuine products.<br>Are you indirectly promoting only the pros of direct-selling? Human failure contributes to failure, yes i agree on that.. BUT to state that MLM is a safe business to venture into, i absolutely disagree.. Why are there companies which have been dissolved then? (ponzi coys for eg)<br><br>Effort and on-going improvements are essential for success, but what is more important is the company you choose to work with to achieve that..<br>What i feel, MLM vs Traditional = No proper regulators + loopholes + limited control vs Full control of integrity and ethics + regulated if not by law, also by ourselves...<br>The risk borne thru these two bizs are entirely different, as a distributor/partner, you are limited to doing what everyone else does.. Top mgt may occasionally interact with you, but it doesnt mean you're gonna be part of them..<br><br>hmmm, maybe set up our own MLM biz? that would be ideal, everything will be within our control   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to raitoh2007<br><br>Thank you for pointing out that. I have misphrased and caused some misunderstanding on that. Point taken. There are also portions which I have missed out as well on the choice of the companies and products etc. Could be too much of writing and overlooked in that area too.<br><br>As for the portion which was indicated that I m more infavouring the MLM industry, maybe to a certain extend but not totally too. I appreciate your correction on my posting.<br><br>To state as MLM is a safe business to go in, I guess I did not make the indication but still agreed on your statements too. There are quite a few companies that could be really in the business and scam is also running it in a hidden mask. But still, it still requires the intellectual being to discover too. Decision can be made wrong at different level of awareness.<br><br>On the part on natural disasters affecting MLM. It does affects, the message that was trying to bring across is people are easily complaining about they have lose money etc. Traditional boss has even more burden and<br><br>Frankly speaking, there are many many arguement points and hope that all people to be able to think fairly too. There are real people who are doing networking the real way and we should give them a chance to earn a living too. It is a blessing that most of us are borned in Singapore and able to receive many things. Everyday is a learning lesson, it is only until we have learnt then we will realise that we have not known so much.<br><br>All these stated above are just personal and do not indicate any person or companies. If of any similar indications, it is all purely coincidence.<br><br></div>
