              PAY FOR ADVERTISING IN DIRECTORY LISTINGS? 
              He nearly signs deal for $4k until...  
              The Newpaper, April 08, 2008 
               
              http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,161438,00.html
              
              HE spotted an error in his company information in the document which he thought was from Yellow Pages.
              
                
              TNP File Picture  
              Mr Simon Quek, 52, owns an audio records store but the document listed his business as 'communication, advertising and media'.
              
              He wanted to amend the error, sign the document and then fax it back to the company.
              
              But the document, which he received on 1Apr, wasn't from Yellow Pages. And if he had endorsed it then, he would have to pay over $4,250 for a two-year advertisement contract with Asian Business Directories (ABD), something which he did not ask for.
              
              While Mr Quek didn't read the document carefully, he did the right thing by showing it to his brother-in-law, Mr Wee Cheeh Eng, a 65-year-old retiree, who remembered reading previous media reports on disputes related to some business directory.
              
              Yellow Pages provides simple listings for free and charge only for display advertisements, while ABD charges for any listing.
              
              On 17 Mar, ABD published an apology to Yellow Pages in The Straits Times for 'having infringed their copyright in the Yellow Pages directories' and declared that they are not related to the latter.
              
              Yet, three weeks after the apology was published, Mr Wee called The New Paper, complaining that his brother-in-law received documents from the company.
              
              Mr Wee said: 'How can a business deal be sealed by just faxing a document?'
              
              MATTER CLOSED 
              
              When contacted, ABD's assistant general manager, Mr Benjamin Koh, said its recent apology had nothing to do with the similarities of the two companies' logos, publication names and business directories.
              
              Ms Sharon Liew, Yellow Pages' marketing communications manager, said the company had accepted the apology and considered the matter closed.
              
              The Straits Times reported that Case and the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore have received at least 53 complaints since ABD's registration in mid-2005.
              
              Case executive director Seah Seng Choon told The New Paper it has received three enquiries on the matter since the published apology.
              
              If companies have already bought ad space in ABD and they are unhappy, they could turn to the Small Claims Tribunal.
              
              Mr Koh noted that ABD was getting only 90 complaints a month about mistaken identity, from the 30,000 mailers it sends every month.
              
              Mr Koh said: 'If they don't want to buy the ad and just want to amend their company details, they can just amend it on the document, but not sign it, and fax it back to us. This way, they won't be charged any fees.'
              
              But Mr Wee feels that business owners may still unknowingly commit themselves.
              
              He said: 'There're enough complaints and media coverage for something more to be done.'

              Hi,
              
              I had similarly received the notice way back in April 2005 ( I think ) I must be one of the first batch of companies that they sent out the mailer. Like most people, I had signed and faxed back and received the invoice about 3 weeks later. I immediately call and write back to infom of my wish not to proceed with the advert after knowing the costs. I was simialrly very troubled by their varios letters of demand and threat to sue me. However, I stood on my ground and refuse to pay and kept all the documents of correspondence with them as evidence if there is a need when they do sue me. In about august 2005 the matter was reported in the straits time and i contacted one of the victim listed in the paper - i think its Mr Willy Sng and he assure me that he is grouping up similar victims to resist against the unfair tactics employed by the company and we agree to stand together if any of this group of people were really sued by ABP. I was even prepared to contribute to legal fee if need to - to fight the case. He also told me to stop responding to their mailer and reminder as that will just keep us in their loop and they may keep their radar on us. Since then, I have not receive any further letter nor sue letter from them so my advice to all is to NOT PAY THEM AND DO NOT GIVE IN TO THEIR DEMANDS. I also receive calls from similar victims( they found out my company from the listing ) and I similarly advise them so and gave them Mr Sng contact. I am really surprised and appalled at the audacity of these people who will continue to scum the unknowing people. I was alerted to this forum by an email posting ( my staff print out the docs then put inside the recycle tray but i happen to see it and saw there is a link to SG Forum and came in to see what is it about ) and thought I should share my experience since I must be one of the pioneer batch that kena the mailer. So, my message to all is IGNORE THEM, DON'T PAY THEM AND GANG UP TOGETHER TO FIGHT AGAINST SUCH UNSCRUPULOUS COMPANY AND PEOPLE !

              <p>Hi all,<br><br>Sad to say our company is another one con by this company ABDPL. Same thing happened to me in March 2007 and today I just received another payment reminder letter to pay up the $4,547.50 else they will escalates to the Collection Unit to handle the case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have sent them numerous letters and emails clarifying the case last year. I even remembered spoken to Benjamin last year to cancel the advertisement whom claimed to be just a customer officer. I also received an email from Bella on the various options available to me. What baffled me was the document being posted to us by ABDPL do not have the terms and condition being printed on it but a photocopy of the fax copy they posted to me have the terms and conditions. Unfortunately I have since discarded the original post as I thought it was another business listing for us to confirm our contacts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since then I have written to them to clarify our case but the only respond from them were notice/final reminder for payment and stating that they escalates to the Legal Unit to handle the case. It disturbed me greatly because I was the one who signed it and it was during the absence of my boss. Initially I was so afraid that I may have to fork out the money for the 'mistake' (did not keep the original post from them) I made.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although I am not alone on this, I felt it is so unfortunate that so many of us were being con by this and there is no government bodies to turn to (correct me if I am wrong). In fact, I think there are others who are ignorant may have paid them without knowing this scam.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It really puzzled me that a business deal be sealed by just faxing a document. Also, how can a cost of advertisment be determined without any artwork?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought our case was closed since the last final notice I received from them 4 Sept 2007. However, I was wrong. Today, I received another payment reminder from ABDPL with a different address.</p>

              Wanderlust412,
              Thanks for sharing. Yes, I have most of the victims contacts, and many who are ready to stand up against ABDPL in court. I do have some news that their days are numbered ... so to all the victims, do not be troubled, just IGNORE them or if you have time to spare just tango with them and keep them busy ... what Collection Unit, Legal Unit, full of bull shit .... the next time they threaten you to escalate it to the collected unit ... invit them to your office ... I have done that, and their collection unit is just the Customer Service / sale personnel. Why not ask Belle and Benjamin Koh (the GM, not their other Benjamins in the company) to come to your office to discuss the matter, I will gather all the rest to attend too ... including the reporters from various media, that will be real fun!

              Chubb05 and others,
              A victim has suggested that we should put pressure on Yellow Pages by cutting the ad spend with Yellow Pages. We can misled by ABD that they are YP, but YP has done nothing ... lets all protest by cutting the ad spend on them.... don't worry if you think that it may affect your sales lead, I have better alternative for you, cheaper too ... send me a private msg and we can discuss about it

              Chubb05,
              There are more than one Benjamins in ABD last year, the Ben you spoke to was in Customer Care cum Sales, I suppose.
              
              Interestingly, Benjamin, the GM and Belle, both have the same Last Name "Koh". I wonder if it is a familiy "business" other than the Ang Mo German owner?

            <div class='col-md body'>Just like Chubb05, I also received a letter threatening escalation to Collection Unit a few weeks ago. 3 days ago, I received my 3rd fax from them since this whole thing started, asking my company again to verify my company details and sign to confirm etc etc. The fax was exactly the same as the previous 2. It certainly looks like they have not stopped their activities, and the apology to Yellow Pages made not one jot of difference. It's almost defiant! I don't understand. If Hong Kong can prosecute these kind of scams, what's stopping Singapore from doing so? How many more companies have to get affected before something is done?!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Why are there so many scams targetting at Singaporeans and Singapore Companies.  Do the laws in Singapore make it easy for these con men and scams to operate?  Are the govt ministries involved and CASE working together to preventing these kinds of scam?.  Are they really helping Singapore companies especially the SMEs who are vulnerable, to prevent this kind of cheating and punish these cheats with a deterent sentence.  Or are they going to be like SLA, by not letting the victims know until it is too late that Virtual Maps is not the owner of the copyright thus allowing Virtual to continue to threatened and demand payment from the victims.   Plain complacency??? </p></div>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm also another victim of SBP.  Similarly, I signed on the fax thinking is just a business details update.  The first time I received their invoice I immediately clarified that it was a mistake and requested the invoice to be withdrawn.  A customer officer by the name Andy replied with lots of proposals to make me pay.  He played tai chi by passing on to another department which he didn't say which dept was that.  After about 3 months I received an invoice reminder to pay up.  I called Andy but was told he was in the meeting. Left message for him to call back.  That didn't happen.  I wrote an email to their cust. service email and asked Andy to call me as I preferred to speak and not ding donging with emails.  Again, didn't call.  2 days ago I received a final reminder from them saying if I don't make payment within a specific period, they would submit the case to court and I have to pay not just the full fee but also the legal fees.  It is very frightening on my side as I acted on behalf on my company while my bosses were overseas.  Despite reading all the postings that says "do not worry", I'm still very worried. For this final reminder, I choose to be silent without calls or emails to them. It seems like there's no use to keep calling them as they will just keep telling me to pay up. Sigh....</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I would like to join in the victim group. This year I get caught into the Singapore Business Pages Advertisement Scams. Although I read about the scam case and did not sign last year. I receive a call from Singapore Business Pages last Friday, 18 July 2008, asking me to pay up SGD 4250.</p>
              <p>Is there any one receive lawyer letter from SBP? Any one that I can talk to?</p>
              <p>Ho</p>

              Dear All, as the starter of this thread, I have to remind all the victims again:
              
              1. Just send one email or fax to them saying that YOU have mistaken them with Singapore Yellow Pages as the form give you the impression that they are Singapore Yellow Pages
              and they have misled you with the form and you hereby you hereby shall terminate the form.
              
              2. Keep this copy and do not attempt to communicate them futher regardless of their reminders, ignore them completely
              
              3. Sleep well, nothing will happen

              <p>The following agencies were notified but it seemed like they are unabel to do anything. Some victims had voiced this to their MPs. I suggest we do the same. If all of us are to do that, someone will sit up and notice.</p>

              <p>These people are now doing the scam in South America. The Chile TV video is in spanish but you can see the contract (same logo as in Asia) and can be understood. The other links can be translated with Google. See the links below.</p>
