            <div class='col-md body'>After reading this blog, I guess I am not the only one that was trick by their special tailored documents. I was so surprise when I received an invoice stating that I have advertise with ' Singapore Business Pages' because I thought that document send to us was purely a verification document. I call them and scolded them about the way they write their document. Firstly, there was no title to tell us that it is a contract. Secondly, it starts with a verification statement and they purposely make the services wrong so that we will change it without awareness of the top portion that states the contract because it looks like yellow pages verify document. We assume that the services were wrong and change and sign and than fax to them. Totally disarmed our awareness that this is a contract. Than 19 days later they invoice me stating that I have advertise for the directories. I complain but they say you have 7 days to cancel. I complain that it is a pure misinterpretation but they suggested that I can cancel the contract but have to pay cancellation charges.<br><br>After a while I notice something strange. Which is? When I sign the documents I did not get their acknowledgment (like a courtesy call or a thank you call or a invoice) within the 7 days, than how on earth I can know that I have made a mistake and cancel it within 7days???? They only send me the acknowledge invoice after 19days.<br><br>Something even more strange is that when I was told to write in to cancel the contract by the lady. I wrote in and ask them to void the contract due to misinterpretation. You know what? They can come up with a long list (About 2 pages A4size paper) on terms and conditions for cancellation just within 2hrs and 36mins!!!!! Amazing isn't it!<br><br>Acknowledgment for document takes 19days but cancellation takes only 2hrs 36mins. Wow! That's strange?<br><br>Than I know this company actually focusing on making money based on other people's mistakes through their specially tailored document rather than through proper business practice. But I am still no sure until something prompt me to search on the internet to see whether there are similar cases. And not to my surprise, I found that I am not the only one.<br><br>They are definitely not practicing  a fair business deal.<br><br>I am very annoy with them and I would appreciate some advice or suggestion as to  how to effective counter such unfair practice business company.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You may want to ask Aaron Wu and Benjamin to pray  that their destiny will not be like his colleagues in Hong Kong who were arrested by the Hong Kong Police.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by warnerw:</div><div class="quote_body">Looks like we are one of the latest victims!!<br><br>We had recently been billed S$4547.50 by Singapore Business Pages, which we had no idea how we incurred! After some investigation, we found out that it was a fax that we faxed back to them, thinking that it was a free service. I then called to ask to terminate the contract as we really did not want to advertise with a publication that we have never seen, especially not for S$4000+++!<br><br>I was told by a Benjamin to write in to ask for a termination of the contract. That is when all the nastiness surfaced!! This so-called "Customer Service Officer" by the name of Aaron, who sounded more like a gangster more than a customer service provider!<br><br>See the latest email between Aaron (his reply starting with "-" ) and me below:<br><br>Dear (my name omitted)<br><br>First things first I will like to clarify some point that you misunderstood.<br><br>Firstly, we were MISLED BY YOUR REPRESENTATIVE who called up to promote this service to my Manager, stating that it was a free service. We only faxed the contract back, thinking that it is a free service, which your directory was promoting to get new customers.<br><br>-          our marketing department prepare the mailer and sent it to various companies. We do not have staffs here to call your manager and promote your service. We have few very well trained customer service officers who can attend to you, but I am sure they wonÂ’t advice that is free. Most importantly there is not a single word in our letter that is free.<br><br>Secondly, we are giving you ample notice period to terminate something that you are only printing in March. We should not be asked to pay for any services not rendered to us.<br><br>-          To us this is an official contract. The issue here is not about when you fax in for cancellations is the terms of the contract.<br><br>Last but not least, nobody from you company even came to meet us to tell us anything about your publication and any cancellation policy. We have not come across any reputable publications or agencies that would ask clients to pay for a 2-year contract without even sending a representative to present their publications and do any follow-up for artwork submission<br><br>- We will not know that you need someone to attend to you when you have not make the payment. Our policy is art work after the payment.<br><br>We are aware that we are not the only organisation that have been misled in this matter and am now giving you FINAL NOTICE to terminate this contract.<br><br>-          since you have know that there are many other companies that do not read the contract and sign it with a stamp and send it back to us then how come you are doing the same thing? Are you trying to challenge us?<br><br>Sorry XXX I believe I have make myself very clear and my stands, we are not going to take your so called FINAL NOTICE to terminate the contract.<br><br>With Regards<br>Aaron Wu<br>Customer Service Officer<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
