How dare they bring the matter to court regardless of their wrongdoings, and even worse they are using our government money to go against innocent small business employers/es who misforunately fell for their well-set trap! It is intolerable but sadly they are still in business! The number of victims is increasing over time and I sincerely hope the government can step in and save us victims!<br><br>It takes only a USD quarter for them to buy a stamp and mail out the tricy "contract", yet it costs a victim USD 2,500 for cancellation fee here! What a profit margin and of course those fookers are not going to give up!<br><br>So victims please do your part and not to give in to the scammers! Every penny you give them encourages their dirty business and causes more innocent people to suffer.<br><br>Please keep me posted on any news regarding this scam in Singapore.<br><br>Thx</div>
