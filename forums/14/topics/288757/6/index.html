            <div class='col-md body'>hi got cheated,<br><br>pay for cancellation ?? the book is not even printed out yet, what to pay for cancellation ??they are really out to CON you. it a matter of squeeze u more juice out from your pocket. If they r really a honour &amp; honest Company, this matter would not have been raised. By using a photocopy acknwledgement slip to deems as agreement and send u back the confirmation after the cancellation grace period. This is their tactics of getting more $$. They'll get retribution sooner or later.<br><br>Afterall, really very sad that our Authority is not doing any job for this ......<br><br>Sigh.....</div>

They asked $1275 for my cancellation. slightly cheaper than yours. But I am not paying them. Hahahaha<br><br>Just tell your boss about this special tailor document that is going around to trick people into signing on the dotted line. To verify this matter, tell him about this forum. This is to confirm what you say is the truth. Also asked your victimized friend to see this forum, so that she knows she is not alone. Ask her to join us.<br><br>One of the reason why they are so successful in intimidating us is because they try to make us believe that we have make a mistake and we are alone and there is no one to help us. But we didn't make that mistake we are misled by their special tailored documents.<br><br>Look at this forum, they have started this many years ago. And have pry on many innocent victims. If we pay, we are encouraging them to target on more people and they can get very rich you know. They are banging on others mistakes through their special tailored documents.<br><br>Think for a moment. What type of business will take so much time and energy into convincing you to pay for something that you didn't sign for? A slimy company that is not honest and have no integrity.<br><br>We must expose their unfair business practice and create public awareness, so that they can't victimize on us and others anymore.<br><br>We must all act together! What say you all!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is posted on Straits Times online Forum:<br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Online+Story/STIStory_162247.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/ST+Forum/Online+Story/STIStory_162247.html</a><br><br>Home &gt; ST Forum &gt; Online Story<br>Oct 1, 2007<br>Dispute with Singapore Business Pages over advertising contract<br>I HAD a very terrible experience with Singapore Business Pages (SBP) recently.<br>My father received a letter from what he thought was Yellow Pages asking to verify his company's particulars. He signed it and faxed it back.<br><br>A week later, we received a tax invoice from SBP, asking us to pay $4,547.50 within seven days. The letter that my father had signed and faxed was an advertisement contract and is supposed to be valid for two years with one payable edition per year.<br><br>We wrote in to request cancellation and explained that we had no intention to take up the advertisement and that we could not afford to pay the fee.<br><br>Despite various e-mail, letters, faxes and tele-conversations with them, they insisted that they will only allow us to cancel the contract if we pay a termination fee of $1,062.50.<br><br>My dad works alone, running a small firm and is illiterate. He does not understand the terms and conditions stated in the letter. The logo on the SBP form was square and yellow, very similar to the logo of Yellow Pages. The terms and conditions stated therein were in very fine print. The amount was also in small print and the currency was written as 'SGD' instead of just a dollar sign ($), of which the recipient might probably have noticed if it was written as $4,250 instead of SGD 4,250. The entire contents of the letter were very ambiguous and misleading.<br><br>Since the publication is not even out yet, I wrote in to them again requesting them to cancel the contract without imposing any termination fee but I am willing to compensate them by paying a nominal fee of $100 for the inconvenience caused.<br><br>We also do not see why we should pay since we did not engage their services. No artwork, logos, company's description, et cetera, have been supplied to them for the so-called 'advertisement'.<br><br>In spite of all the counter proposal and explanations, we received reminder invoices and a final reminder letter from SBP saying that should we not pay up the full advertisement fee of $4,547.50 within seven days from the date of the reminder (which is due on Sept 25), they would hand the matter to their legal adviser to recover the full invoiced amount, including legal fees and interest.<br><br>We tried to seek help from Case but it is not able to handle it because this is a business-to-business dispute. We went to Singapore Mediation Centre and, unfortunately, they cannot come into the picture unless both parties agree to go down to see the mediator to resolve the dispute.<br><br>Today, I found out from the 'Legal Assistant Blog' as well as some other websites that I am not the only victim. In fact, many have lodged complaints against Singapore Business Pages (also called Asian Business Directories Pte Ltd). Attention was brought to Case, the police, the Commercial Affairs Dept, Singapore Mediation Centre, commercial fraud centre, et cetera, by different victims. But it seems they cannot do much about it.<br><br>I really hope the authorities can step in to prevent this company from doing the same thing to more business owners.<br><br>Cindy See Seow Hwee<br><br></div>

I'm in the MCST line and had received a letter from them which looked so yellow pages asking me to sign and send back to them to include us in their pages for the next publication.<br><br>Very little was mentioned about the cost and I almost sent back after signing. Luckily I looked through again and realised the part on payment, otherwise I would not know how to answer to my client as I am authorized to sign menial things on their behalf. Frankly, the writer is right. Why will they want to put it as SGD instead of S$ if they are not out to confuse?<br></div>

They sent the same letter to me, and as I represent my company, I check it, made the necessary corrections, and as your father did, faxed the letter back to them without the intention of taking up the ad. In fact, in my fax cover sheet, I told them that my company had no intention to take up the ad.<br><br>A letter then came and asked for payment of the same sum - $4,547.50. I called them up and informed them that there must be a mistake as I had specifically stated in my fax letter that my company had no intention of taking up the ad.<br><br>They asked if I had read their fine print. I said yes, but their letter was misleading, which was why I had replied stating clearly my company's intentions. They refused to to budge in their arguments, saying that since I had read and had signed, it's a standing agreement. I was appalled. My instructions were explicitly clear, more so than their "fine print".<br><br>They will only allow my company to cancel the contract if my company pays a termination fee of $1,062.50 - same sum as yours. If my company does not pay, they would hand the matter over to their legal advisor as well.<br><br>I suppose this "Singapore Business Pages" is legal...if it even is at all, and if so, just as Cindy does, I do hope the authorities can step in to prevent this company from doing the same thing to more business owners as well.<br></div>

Since Cindy See knew how to write to the Forum Page after her dad got into such unfortunate contract, I'm just wondering how come she did not pay attention to those similar warning letters appeared in the Forum Page previously about SBP and warn her dad.<br><br>My bro-in-law who does not under English also received similar letter from SBP in 2006 but he took the trouble to check with me, thus avoided being deceited.<br><br>The relevant authorities should immediately stop SBP from further deceiving unsuspecting companies since the relevant authorities are aware that this kind of canny selling tactic employed by SBP indirectly can dupe business owners. Just like the government has stopped those businesses from practising the Â“never-endingÂ” closing down sales, the relevant authorities should come down on SBP on such fraudulent transaction.<br><br></div>

AT least from my POV. It's "only" few thousands to them. "Cancellation fees" are "only" few hundred. The court fees will already exceed it. It's 100% pure scam.</div>
