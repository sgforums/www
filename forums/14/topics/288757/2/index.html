Response from others:<br><br>Your email has actually speak from my heart; in other word, I have "kanna" the same incidence as your wife's company did.<br><br>Initially I received a letter to update my company product, thought is Singapore Business Pages by Yellow Pages. Then I signed the letter with company chop without any doubt until I received an invoice asking me to pay 4K+. Then I was realize the whole incidence is a business strategy. I then called to this company and told them I did not realize this is actually an advertising agent not from Yellow Pages. In the phone I requested to reduce the size of advertisement to quarter page with amount of S$1,800+ and they agree.<br><br>Few weeks later one of the staff call me to give them the artwork for my company logo, product or even photo. There is no artwork approval since then and till this moment I have not received any what your called "Singapore Business Pages 2007". This is the first time and going to be last time for my mistake. I have learn my lesson and I hope will not "Kanna" again.<br><br>What about your case? Do you pay any money?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are not alone !! Response from others:<br><br>Ur message received and yes,I share the same sentiment as you on this 'unscrupulous" tactic used. In fact,I do not know that my company was listed as one of the "intended advertiser' because I refused to pay up when they kept chasing for payment.It has been 3-4 months since I last heard from them.<br>We actually thought it was merely an update of company's particulars and replied readily.We only came to realise that it could be a scam after they started to send us invoices for the intended advertisement fees.I called back and spoke to the receptionist immediately to inform them that it was a mistake and we had no intention to advertise at all but thought it was an update of informations only.I was told to write in ,which I did with faxes as well as e-mails explaining our stand and request to de-list our name from the advertisers' list.<br>As expected,they came back stating that we have entered into a contract and that legal actions would be taken on us if we do not comply.I refused to accept their "threats'' and argued back that why it took them 3 months from the time our first fax reached them til the time they came back to me with the invoice and in between this period of time,nobody came to us requesting for company's profile such as scope of businesses,products listings,pictures taken for advertising purposes?<br>It took them another 3 weeks for them to reply with a counter proposal at a discounted rate of $3400 or $2500 (half page) or $1478.50 for cancellation fees if I were to decide to cancel totally!<br>Of course I did not accept his proposal and still waiting for their lawyer's letter(if any).That was the last time we heard from them(25/06/2007).<br>Anyway,I will also write in to ACRA to complain and thanks for sharing your experience on this issue.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are not alone !! Response from others:<br><br>I am so glad to hear from you and to know I am not alone in this 'scam'.<br><br>I received a fax from the company asking me to look through the listing to update the information.  Thinking that it was from one of the directories which I advertised on a regular basis, I amended the details and fax back without much thought.<br><br>A few weeks later, I received a faxed invoice from the company.  Attached to the invoice was the 'contract' which I had supposedly signed for. I noticed the contract was pasted on the company's letterhead which had detailed information on the contract which I had not notice before. I got suspicious and ignored the invoice.<br><br>Some time passed before I received a letter from the company threatening to follow up with a lawyer's letter if I did not pay up.  I called the company.  The person who picked up the call sounded like a foreigner - possibly a Filipino.  I explained to him the situation and aired my displeasure. I left message with him for his boss to call me to explain the situation.  Of course, I never heard from anyone.<br><br>I thought the matter was closed as the perpetrator would have been scared off.  But recently, I received yet another 'final letter' warning me that I would have to face court action if I did not pay up.<br><br>I have no intention of paying a cent nor do I want to spend time and money on legal fees too because there is no proof that I signed any original document nor approved the artwork for the advertisement.<br><br>However, I will be most willing to support all others who have been duped.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are not alone !! Response from others:<br><br>Thanks for writing. In fact I fell into the same scam.<br><br>I received an invoice which stated something like artwork and design (something like that). How can they just published and charge me when I have not even seen or agreed with the artwork? And if I know that they are going to charge me for that, I will surely not want to proceed with any publication.<br><br>When I receive the invoice, I did call and tell them to cancel but they play delay tactic and decoyment and say that they did not receive my instruction. I also wrote to them and they told me they have already published and wanted me to pay a cancellation fee.<br><br>It has been past number of months and they wrote letter threathening to sue me. I simply ignore them.<br><br>You have my support to bringing it up to the authority before more people fall prey to their unscrupulous trick.<br><br>Rgds<br><br></div>
