              <p>Good news for everybody affected by these crooks! See the Straits Times today. They published there their official apology to Yellow Pages (Singapore) Limited for having infringed their copyright in the Yellow Pages directories and undertake not to commit any further infringement of the copyright in the Yellow Pages directories. Yellow Pages took our advice and sued them ..... as a result this apology. But, they are being let off lightly. Sh continue to sue them until they are bankrupt and then wind them up.</p>

              THE STRAITS TIMES FRIDAY, MARCH 21 2008
              BY SHOBANA KESAVA
              
              Businesses claim they were duped by firm's ad mailer
              
              Unhappy at having to pay for ads, they say ABD's document was too similar to Yellow Pages'
              
              THE document in the mail asked her to check that her beauty salon's address' was correct.
              Madam W.C. Yeo, 52, faxed back her reply, thinking she was saying yes to a cost free Yellow Pages listing.                 â€¢ :!
                She did not realise her reply would be taken as an arrangement to buy a full-page advertisement in the Asian Business Directories (ABD) and to pay $4,700 for it.
              She is among those who feel duped by the ABD document, which looked like it came from Yellow Pages. At least 53 complaints have been lodged with the Consumers Association of Singapore and the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore since ABD's registration in mid-2005.
              
              Recipients of both ABD and Yellow Pages mailers point to their similarities: Both company logos feature a yellow square framing an icon of an open book; both ask for
              the company's listed details to be updated by fax or mail; and both mailers display the deadline prominently. 
              
              The difference is that ABD runs its ad rates in fine print, while the Yellow Pages offers listings for free. The latter charges only for its display ads.
              
              On Monday, ABD published in this newspaper a public apology to the Yellow pages for copyright infringement and declared that it had no links to the 41-year-old listed company. The quarter-page notice  cost it $7,862.
              
              When approached, ABDâ€™s assistant general manager Benjamin Koh said the Apology was worded according to Yellow Pages' wishes.
               He declined to elaborate on ABD's discussions with the Yellow Pages that led to the placing of the notice, but denied that his company was trying to pass itself off as the Yellow Pages.
                                 
              He said the logos "have so much difference" between them, and noted that ABD was getting only 90 complaints a month about mistaken identity, which pales against the
              30,000 mailers it sends out every month.
              
              Yellow Pages marketing communications manager Sharon Liew said her company was satisfied with the apology and that the matter was dosed.
              
              Meanwhile, Madam Yeo has been told she has been locked into paying for the ABD ad.
              She said she had explained that she could barely read English and that she had mistaken ABD for the Yellow Pages. But she was told that since the contract was binding, she could choose to take out a smaller $950 ad for $850, payable in two instalments.
              She has made one payment, but feels resentful. She said: "They were firm and the letter said that it's contractual and legally binding. I didn't want too much trouble, so I took up the ad, but it s a very unethical way of doing business."
                  Sino Chemical's manager Chang Sieh Yong, 47, has refused to pay up.
                  He said the ABD document required a faxed response within "a very short time", and he acted quickly because there were factual errors about Sinko that he did not want to see in print.
                  A copy of the document obtained by this newspaper gave a deadline of three weeks.
                  A check online uncovered complaints against ABD on sgforum.com; a notice posted last July by Hong Kong's Commercial Crime Bureau, indicating something similar had happened there, called on victims of "possible fraud" to contact the bureau.
                  Calls to the bureau were not immediately returned.
                  Many other firms The Straits Times contacted declined to be quoted, for fear the ABD would alerted to their unpaid bills.
                  But they need not worry, said lawyer Rajah Chettiar, because their contract with ABD "probably wouldn't stand up in court on the grounds of misrepresentationâ€�.
                  ABD has threatened legal action against companies which owe money, but a check uncovered no lawsuits filed by it so far.

              THE STRAITS TIMES FRIDAY, MARCH 21 2008
              BY SHOBANA KESAVA
              
              NEARLY 40 inquiries about Asian Business Directories (ADB) â€“ about one every week â€“ have been sent to either the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) or the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore in the past nine months.
              But the issue raised in these inquiries do not come under the purview of the consumer watchdog or the advertising standards watchdog, said Caseâ€™s executive director Seah Seng Choon.
              He suggested that companies attempt dispute resolution at the Singapore Mediation Centre. However, if they have already bought as space in ADB, they could turn to the Small Claims Tribunal.
              He added that businesses now have a strong case because they can cite ABDâ€™s public apology as its admission that it is misled them into taking it for the Yellow Pages.
              Mr Seah said companies in danger of violating copyrights should seek legal advice to stay on the right side of the law.

              <p><strong>MY advice to all such victims ........ just bloody ignore their letters. Above all ..... PLEASE DO NOT PAY! If u pay this will provide them the working capital to 'stay in business' and cheat more people ..... those local traitors in their employ do their biddings because they are paid salaries from monies cheated from this scam. If u do not pay they will not have salaries ...... u think these bastards live on love and fresh air?</strong></p>

              This is my first post. It's sad I know, but it's a relief to hear that I'm not the only one who replied to the fax from Singapore Business Pages unintentionally. I won't go into what I did when I received their invoice, which was in July / August last year. I did the same thing and received the same "discount". What I did subsequently was
              1) Checked with a lawyer friend who says that this sounds like misrepresentation. He advised me not to pay.
              2) I also contacted CASE and CAD. I'm sure you all know that CASE cannot get involved in this because it's Business to Business. I spoke to the investigative officer at CAD and he also advised me not to pay. He told me that they have a file on APB and are monitoring the company closely. 
              
              I liaised with this person in APB called Winson, and told him that if ABP doesn't stop harrassing me with demands for payment and legal threats, I will make a police report, as I have been advised to do by CAD.
              
              Since then I have ignored all their faxes. I thought that episode was behind me because I stopped receiving faxes from them for some time, but today, I received yet another fax from them threatening that if I do not pay or meet them to discuss solutions, they will escalate this to the Collection Unit to "handle the case". Anyone received such a fax? 
              
              How will writing to ACRA help? If it helps, I'll be very happy to do so. I think it's a good idea to present a united front to the ABP and the Authorities. If other countries can prosecute companies like this for fraud, I don't know why Singapore isn't doing it. It's really good to hear so much support and encouragement on this forum and that we're not alone in facing this.

              T3Chee, 
              Sad to know that you are in the same boat. Just ignore them completely, if they do dare to take legal action on you, you know that you are not alone. Also, you may wish to consider writing to the PM'soffice. This is probably one way to get CAD to act on it.
