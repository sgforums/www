            <div class='col-md body'>I think the scammer is trying to sugar-coat their dirty business on the Internet as much as possible. If you google Singapore Business Pages and Hong Kong Business Pages without quoting the names you will find a lot of links to it, and those links are either irrelevant or advertisements created by the scammer on some random sites to promote the scam. The purpose of doing that is to avoid people do a search online and find out forums and news articles about the scam. Usually victims only do a quote search after realising it is a scam but it is already too late.<br><br>What I can say is that it is a very sophisticated and well-thought scam. Scammers are very familiar with the loopholes in the law. Their business logo appears to be "trustworthy" (ie. closely resembles to either some very well known advertisement pages or the government business pages). They prey on small companies who are unfamiliar with the law concept of a "contract". When I talk to other victims I found out that some of us actually read and understood the small prints on top but failed to recognise a letter without both parties' signatures could be a contract. And there really are magazines or directories around with similar letters for a free subscription. And some victims even called to ask the scammer and were told it is a free update! So it is not only a scam for busy workers who fax back the letter in a rush without reading it. And it is so wrong that the scammer try defend themselves saying we get ourselves into it because of our carelessness and we deserve to pay for our mistakes! Shame on them!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All the police in the world are acting on Directory scam ... what about ours<br><br><a href="http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/11/29/directory-scheme-traps-businesses.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2006/11/29/directory-scheme-traps-businesses.php</a><br><br>Directory scheme traps businesses<br>Five companies are now in litigation against Swiss firm<br><br>By Paul Voosen<br>Staff Writer, The Prague Post<br>November 29th, 2006 issue<br><br>Intercable Verlag is suing Bob Peppett's company to collect.<br><br>It starts with the whir of a fax machine, the opening of an envelope or a knock on the door at the end of a long business day. You're presented with a simple form, reading "European Internet Register" across the top in bold type. At first glance, the form appears to offer a free update to one's business's listing in a Europe-wide directory.<br><br>But, in carefully worded fine print at the form's base, it becomes clear that, by signing and sending the form back to the publisher Â— Swiss-based Intercable Verlag Â— you are entering into a contract to purchase three editions of a business directory, at a total price of 2,070 euros ($2,670/57,774 Kč<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. Repeated invoices soon follow, putting pressure on the business to pay, and litigation may be threatened.<br><br>Five Czech companies that say they were duped by these forms into entering contracts with Intercable Verlag are now fighting back, contesting lawsuits brought against them in Czech courts by Intercable. These cases are currently being heard or under appeal in regional courts, some the culmination of years of dispute.<br><br>"Anyone that does not want our paid services returns the form unsigned," said Adrian Wittmer, Intercable Verlag's managing director. "It is general business practice to read what one signs; consequently, the signee cannot be misled."<br><br>Some 1,500 Czech companies or nonprofits have paid Intercable after signing its forms, says one law firm investigating Intercable.<br><br>Sixty-one-year-old Bob Peppett, a British businessman whose Czech-based furniture company, Brastan, signed an Intercable form in March 2004, is now fending off an Intercable Verlag lawsuit against his company for failure to pay.<br><br>Peppett still has a photocopy of the original signed agreement, kept in a phonebook-size black binder of invoices, e-mails and faxes he has collected, the fruits of several hundred hours of research against the company. "This form may look primitive, but it just stays in the bounds of legality."<br><br>When his company received the first invoice from Intercable in April 2004, Peppett faxed back a terse response reading, "This order is not genuine. Please cancel, as we will not pay." He then told his staff to throw out any subsequent invoices, thinking there would be no follow through. He was wrong, and Intercable continued to contact Brastan with invoices and eventually letters from management. Peppett was urged by a nervous staff to act, and so he went to the Internet.<br><br>There he found a sprawling community of businesspeople from across Europe, including other Czech companies, who felt that they were victims of Intercable's directory scheme. He began contacting Swiss and European authorities.<br><br>Intercable Verlag's Wittmer said he does not understand why Peppett is trying to destroy his business in the Czech Republic. Wittmer tried to come to an understanding with Peppett, he said, but now they must let the courts decide the dispute. Intercable has also filed a slander suit against Peppett, to be heard in January.<br><br>"We get a lot of complaints about these types of scams," said Katie Carroll, spokeswoman for the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA). The largest number of complaints have been against two companies, European City Guide and Construct Data Verlag.<br><br>The practices of both companies, based in Spain and Austria, respectively, are similar to those of Intercable Verlag. All three companies may in fact be owned or influenced by the same man, German businessman Meinolf LÃ¼denbach, said Christian BÃ¼tikofer, a Swiss journalist who has investigated Intercable and related companies over the past year for the newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.<br><br>The Swiss government is aware of the controversy Intercable and similar companies based within its borders have caused. It has issued warnings against the businesses. Swiss police raided the offices of Intercable Verlag June 20, spurred by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO); the raid was an expansion of an investigation into three other companies begun the previous year.<br><br>Guido Sutter of SECO confirmed the investigation of Intercable Verlag but declined to comment further on related cases now before the Swiss courts.<br><br>"The Czech Republic is very popular for Intercable, as are Poland and Slovakia," said BÃ¼tikofer. "The particular trick with Intercable is that it works with people," he said, using freelance sales representatives who approach institutions in person. This is unlike any other directory scheme BÃ¼tikofer knows of.<br><br>The law firm IMG has been following Intercable's activities in the Czech Republic after it, too, signed an agreement with the company. According to its research, 60 percent of the Czech organizations that have signed agreements with Intercable Â— which include schools, hospitals and town halls Â— were approached in person by sales representatives. Receptionists and assistants would then sign Intercable's forms, with the contracts going to five years in length at 1,290 euros a year.<br><br>Unlike Brastan, IMG did not receive an invoice from Intercable until a year after the first form was signed. A lawyer from the company who declined to be named attributed this delay to Article 23 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, which allows one year for a contract to be challenged if one party feels deceived. To this point, IMG has received only invoices from Intercable and has not been sued.<br><br>Other companies have not been so lucky, and Intercable has suits open against five different firms. One suit, against CS International, is now in appeal, and, according to IMG, CS International has a great chance to win. Even if the suit is won, under the Czech judicial system, this does not establish a precedent in the Anglo-American sense. Intercable could still win related suits. CS International declined to comment on the case.<br><br>The day before Brastan's case was to go to trial, Nov. 23 in ÃšstÃ­ nad OrlicÃ­, east Bohemia, Peppett predicted that the case would be adjourned, based on an excuse raised by the prosecution. Such an adjournment would perfectly match Intercable's tactics, he said Â— delaying the case is one more way of pressuring him to settle.<br><br>The next day, the court adjourned Brastan's case.<br><br>Naďa ČernÃ¡ contributed to this report.<br><br>Paul Voosen can be reached at pvoosen@praguepost.com<br><br>Other articles in Business (29/11/2006):<br><br>Skewed advertising<br>ČSA replaces half its top brass<br>EU directive will aid Czech service industry<br>10 Questions<br>Movers &amp; Shakers<br>Biz Week<br>Biz Events<br>A slightly better nightmare<br>Browse the Current Issue<br><br>If you enjoyed this article, why don't you subscribe to the print version!<br>We accept secure online transactions provided by PayPal and Moneybookers<br><br>Reader's comments:add your comment<br>[10:52 05/12/2006] : Never pay, should you be foolish enough to fall in the trap.

The woman who answered assured my staff member that the services were indeed free and to send in the form. This is a ploy commonly known as 'bait &amp; switch', in which a company 'baits' a customer with an offer of free services, then 'switches' them to a billable service using tactics that include language that is misleading or easily misconstrued. A 'bait &amp; switch' agreement cannot be deemed 'good faith' and in most countries, in order to be binding, a contract must always be entered into 'in good faith'. The language used by these guys may be legal in the sense that they may escape prosecution, but it is not legally binding in court if you contest it. So don't worry. These guys are in the intimidation racket.<br><br>Richard Holby<br>Lille<br>Note: These opinions do not represent opinions of The Prague Post.<br>Add your comment<br><br>Full Name: *<br>City: *<br>E-mail: **<br>This comment can be published in the print version of The Prague Post<br>Enter the text on the right:<br><br>Comment: *<br><br>* Required field.

The defendants allegedly scammed numerous small businesses and nonprofit organizations out of millions of dollars by billing them for directories and listings they did not order or authorize.<br><br>The FTC alleges that when consumers refused to pay the invoices, the defendants turned them over to their collection company that masqueraded as an independent debt-collection agency. This in-house collection company proceeded to harass consumers in an attempt to get them to pay.<br><br>According to the FTC?s complaint, the defendants have made unsolicited telemarketing calls to various businesses and organizations across the United States since 2003. The defendants tell consumers that they are merely verifying the consumer?s name, address, and telephone number for a listing in a business directory. The defendants mislead consumers into believing that someone in their organization previously authorized the purchase of the directory and listing.<br><br>If consumers are reluctant to verify the listing information, or do not believe that their company has ordered the directory and listing, the defendants assure them that they have a trial period, typically 30 days, during which they can review the directory at no cost. The defendants then record consumers verifying their business information.<br><br>The complaint alleges that the defendants subsequently mail invoices to consumers, typically billing them between $349 and $459 for the Commutel Business Directory CD-ROM, and between $249 and $399 for the American Business Solutions Directory CD-ROM. Unlike the defendants? representation in the initial telephone call, however, the invoices list the consumer with whom the defendants spoke as the person who authorized the order.<br><br>After receiving these invoices, the FTC alleges, many consumers realize that no one from theirorganization ordered a directory listing. When consumers call to cancel the orders, the defendants claim that the recorded verification call is a ?binding oral contract,? and thus refuse to cancel.<br><br>In many instances, according to the complaint, when consumers refuse to pay the invoices, they are referred to the defendants? in-house collection company, which allegedly harasses them with frequent telephone calls, dunning notices, and threats to initiate legal action and damage consumers? credit ratings.<br><br>When consumers advise these collecting defendants that they do not owe anything because no one in their organization ordered the business directory and/or listing, or because they were assured that they had a trial period during which they could review the directory, the collecting defendants nevertheless continue their collection efforts. The FTC contends that many consumers ultimately pay the invoices because they believe it is the only way to stop the harassment.<br><br>The FTC?s complaint names Global Management Solutions; Commutel Marketing; American Business Solutions; Ty Nguyen, a.k.a. Hiep Manh Nguyen; Cory Kornelson; Byron Steczko; Kelly Nguyen, a.k.a. Phu Minh Huy Nguyen; and Minh Tam Vo. American Business Solutions and Commutel Marketing run telemarketing operations out of Victoria, British Columbia, and Montreal, Quebec. Global Management handles debt collection for American Business Solutions and Commutel Marketing out of Montreal, Quebec.<br><br>The federal district court in Washington has granted an order temporarily halting the defendants? business practices and freezing their assets. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for March 15, 2005. In addition, on February 22, 2005, the Victoria Police Department executed a criminal search warrant against the American Business Solutions business premises and arrested Kelly Nguyen, the company president, on fraud charges. The same day, the Canada Competition Bureau executed a criminal search warrant against the Global Management Solutions? and Commutel Marketing?s business premises.<br><br>Report Your Experience<br>If you've had a bad experience with a consumer product or service, we'd like to hear about it.
