I have never come across such a thing, that a business deal is sealed by a faxed contract," he told Today.<br><br>After seven days of trying to contact the company to nullify the contract, he was told to pay 70 per cent of the fee ? or $2,975 ? to withdraw the contract. Mr Chia refused and was later sent a warning letter by ABD, saying it would take legal action if it does not receive the money from him.<br><br>Ms Lim Mei Jun, a senior marketing communications manager at Yellow Pages, told Today that her company had received "less than 10" complaints about ABD from advertisers.<br><br>When told that people have complained that they thought the letter was from Yellow Pages, Ms Lim said: "Yellow Pages Singapore is a known and reliable brand. Hence it is not surprising that it is 'used' by other directory companies to appeal to businesses."<br><br>Yellow Pages has since sent letters to advertisers, asking them not to mistake the Singapore Business Pages for it.<br><br>In all, 51 business owners are known to have signed and returned the contract.<br><br>Of these, 24 paid between $800 and the full amount to ABD, said computer games shop owner Willy Sng, 34, who also found himself in the same plight as Mr Chia.<br><br>As of three weeks ago, 19 companies had paid up to $60,000 in total. Some of the firms that Today contacted did not want to speak about the issue.<br><br>Mr Chia and Mr Sng are among an initial group who banded together to report the matter to the Commercial Affairs Department. Spokesman for the police, Assistant Superintendent Stanley Norbert, told Today that the police have recently received several complaints against ABD, but have decided to take no further action upon reviewing the cases.<br><br>An irate Mr Chia also complained to the Consumers Association of Singapore but was told to go to the Singapore Mediation Centre or the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) for help.<br><br>But he did not, saying that if he went to the SCT, it might be taken that he had agreed that the contract was binding and that he would have to pay a lower fee to get out of it. Until now, Mr Chia has not heard from them, nor has he received any lawyer's letter from the company.<br><br>When contacted, Mr Christian Hamoeller, one of ABD's directors, said potential clients had enough time to read the contract and reply if interested.<br><br>"(These are) people who haven't read the contract and try to blame us for their mistakes," he said, adding that lawyers' letters have been sent to those who refuse to pay. He declined to say what his firm would do if they ignore the letters.<br><br>Now Mr Sng, who also refused to pay, is worried that this contract will return to haunt him because there has been "no closure", even though he has not heard from ABD for several months.<br><br>In such cases, lawyer Vijai Parwani of Parwani &amp; Co said if negotiations with the company fail and the firm insists that they pay up, they have to decide whether the case is worth the cost of defending it in court.<br><br></div>

I was conned on the phone by a young woman into faxing them back the contract on the 3rd April 2006 thinking I was renewing my advertisement in the publication 'Singapore Agri-Food Business Directory' (the format of the advertisement in the contract was exactlywhat I had placed in this publication previously). Imagine my 'horror' when I received their bill later for S$4,250 p.a. for 2 years' advertisement. I immediately called them on the phone telling them the mistake and my intention to rescind this contract but I was refused with them saying I have to pay failing which they will pursue legal actions against my company. I ignored their request and they continued to pursue me for payment via letters and also writing to me with suggestions to settle this matter amicably. On the 15th March 2007 they send to me another invitation to advertise which I replied by calling them on the phone to stop their attempts to scam Singaporeans of their hard-earned money. I have not heard from them since! Now the question that bugs me is this : Singapore pride itself on having good regulations and a good system of checks and balances by the way of licencing to ensure that publication businesses are approved and properly licenced ..... How Did This Business Get Its' Licence To Publish In The First Place?</div>

However, the letter also contained a paragraph printed with smaller letters outlining the terms and conditions, which require them to pay for subscribing advertising service.<br><br>The case revealed that without going through the terms and conditions in details, the victims signed the reply slip, endorsed with a company chop and returned the slips by post or fax. They later found themselves having entered into an agreement with the letter originating company and were were liable to make payment from ten to some ten thousands dollars.<br><br>Police appealed to the public to be aware of such possible fraud case and anyone who has come across such similar suspected fraud case are advised to make a report to CCB hotline at 2860 5012.<br><br>Police Report No. 4<br><br>Ends/Thursday, July 19, 2007<br>Issued at HKT 19:17<br><br></div>

Same thing happened to me almost the same time as Jack and to-date there is still no reply from them although we have sent them numerous letters and emails.  The case was still pending and when we called them at their office the receptionist always claimed that the Manager is engaged in the meeting and the Director is not the office.<br><br>No communication from this office.  Still wandering whether they existed until now that I receive this forum that the company is still doing such unscrupulous things to other companies.<br><br>We are all victims and need help from the authority to catch these guys who are at large to con our hard earn monies.<br><br>Let's join hand and put our resources together to fight against cheater......<br><br>I believe there are a lot of companies like us who are trapped by them.  Come on lets stand up.  Can any authorities from the government help us in this matter.<br><br>PLEASE HELP !</div>

Response from others:<br><br>I make a mistake by faxing to them their pre-filled form, containing my company's details, thinking that it was the usual Singtel phonebook directory update.<br>When I discovered that it was a 2 yr contract with them costing quite a lot of money, I immediately wrote to them to explain my oversight and that there is no reason for me to advertise in this directory when my business is not active at all.<br><br>They were kind enough to cancel the contract at no cost though initially I was told that I may have to incur some admin. charges.  I believe many have been mislead by the letter.<br><br>By the way where did you see my listing?  I thought they would have removed it from the directory.<br></div>
