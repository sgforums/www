            <div class='col-md body'>since when was it ever declared legal? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>if u read my point thoroughly enough, unlike Malaysia, where a new MLM company required government checks before being granted a license, any company in Singapore is basically do at your own risk. The Chairman of DSAS himself has made this statement before, in the articles I posted last year.<br><br>He advised people to join any company in DSAS, and even then, DSAS companies arent certified legal, but followed strict guidelines on refund policy and hard selling.<br><br>The question that nti scheme is illegal in spirit, but not technically. Singapore law is not comprehensive enough, allowing many companies to exploit this loophole. Same with the law on Frauds, and many lawyers have been asking the Singapore legislature to change the laws too.<br><br>That has always been the issue in this topic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Degree of diversification is never used as a measure of business success in the business world. Its merely a strategy.<br><br>One of the uses is actually stave off the effects or danger of running a single or few business. The more you diversify, the less risk you gonna have with. But will such move benefit JP, or its to serve his own interest, aka save his own backside? You decide. Most large companies in the MLM industry is actually a single company. The advantage, or rather, the good thing about this is that the bosses actually focus all his strength on that business, and aim to improve the welfare of the distributors by channelling all profits towards them, such as organising more seminars, cutting the prices of products.<br><br>Another use, is like what other say, is to earn quick bucks. Related to the point above, its very unusual for a company, even for successful ones, to diversify so quickly. Plus all the potential quick scam a binary system could offer, you can see where i am going... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have to say something though.. Might have already been highlighted.. just that too many pages to read through..<br><br>What I feel is that, I'm not against NTI.. Legal wise, yes it is legal I have to say.. That is no doubt.. The issue here is about ethical issue.. Ethical and legal issues are 2 different things.. Let us not forget that we are humans, so we have feelings and thoughts, so both issues come in.. Unless we are all robots, then there is no ethical issue to talk about.. Its the method NTI used I guess that is the main concern.. Everyone has his/her own ethical level of what is acceptable and what is not.. Its just that to many people, NTI is not ethical, up to individual though.. Again, its up to individual to make the choices.. Most importantly is that consider carefully before making decisions, not to make decisions due to unnecessary pressure..</div>

Might have already been highlighted.. just that too many pages to read through..<br><br>What I feel is that, I'm not against NTI.. Legal wise, yes it is legal I have to say.. That is no doubt.. The issue here is about ethical issue.. Ethical and legal issues are 2 different things.. Let us not forget that we are humans, so we have feelings and thoughts, so both issues come in.. Unless we are all robots, then there is no ethical issue to talk about.. Its the method NTI used I guess that is the main concern.. Everyone has his/her own ethical level of what is acceptable and what is not.. Its just that to many people, NTI is not ethical, up to individual though.. Again, its up to individual to make the choices.. Most importantly is that consider carefully before making decisions, not to make decisions due to unnecessary pressure.. </div></blockquote>Agree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> is the ethical and dignity issue................  everyone can be in sales but crucial part, what kind of sales personality u going to display, a respectable sales rep or a sale rep whom everyone condemn.......   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

For example to you and I, we feel that it is a very wrong system and very not ethical way to do so, which I really do feel that way. However, there will still be people thinking that this is a good system for them to earn a lot, since they feel that it's easier to look for people. But the sad thing is that there are such people around.<br><br>Laws are dead, but human brain is moving. There will be people who will exploit the loop holes. Laws are set up cos people felt that some actions are not right or not ethical. Just like why do we implement a death sentence to a person who own above a certain amount of cocaine, while in some countries, like Holland for example, its legal. It's how we feel about an issue, then make it black and white and implement that in the law book.<br><br>Now that cos of loop holes, NTI looks legal on top of the common law, sad to say. Unless the MLM Act is amended to clear up all the loop holes, there will still be companies which exploit the loop holes. That's the only way I see so far.<br><br>Rather than letting the such companies closed down through courts, why not stop letting such companies exist in the first place. Differentiate them into black and white areas through laws, instead being in a gray area as of now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main reason MLM companies exist and even on the increase is largely due to human's greed, desperation and desires to make large bucks with little work within a short period of time. Yes I agree it is possible to make alot of money with little work and within short periods of time, but ppl who are able to do that spent yrs learning how and are experts in what they do.<br><br>What do the average citizens know? Many young ppl are enticed to join MLM companies because they have huge dreams but little knowledge of how to execute their plans and turn dreams into reality. Therefore, it is not difficult for MLM promoters to misled these youngsters.<br><br>As long as they are ppl who wants to get rich fast and does not want to put in the effort to increase their knowledge about amassing wealth, there will always be MLM companies out to exploit these ppl.<br><br>If you want to stop the killing of rhinos for their horns, stop buying such medications, if you want to stop MLM from cheating ppl, stop buying products from them. Without sales, there will be no revenues, without revenues, ppl will start quitin n eventually unethical companies like these will cease to exist.</div>
