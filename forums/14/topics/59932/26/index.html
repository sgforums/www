            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hjxfabio:</div><div class="quote_body">Its how people react to it. For example to you and I, we feel that it is a very wrong system and very not ethical way to do so, which I really do feel that way. However, there will still be people thinking that this is a good system for them to earn a lot, since they feel that it's easier to look for people. But the sad thing is that there are such people around.<br><br>Laws are dead, but human brain is moving. There will be people who will exploit the loop holes. Laws are set up cos people felt that some actions are not right or not ethical. Just like why do we implement a death sentence to a person who own above a certain amount of cocaine, while in some countries, like Holland for example, its legal. It's how we feel about an issue, then make it black and white and implement that in the law book.<br><br>Now that cos of loop holes, NTI looks legal on top of the common law, sad to say. Unless the MLM Act is amended to clear up all the loop holes, there will still be companies which exploit the loop holes. That's the only way I see so far.<br><br>Rather than letting the such companies closed down through courts, why not stop letting such companies exist in the first place. Differentiate them into black and white areas through laws, instead being in a gray area as of now.</div></blockquote>That has been precisely the whole idea why I mentioned the Malaysian system, although corrupted, but has many good fundamentals in place. Coupled with Singapore law enforcement system, it can really work against those scams.<br><br>However, the only negative side is what you mentioned in the first few paragraphs, that there are gray areas in deciding which company is legal or not. Overregulation can kill entrepeneurship.<br><br>I would have suggested a hybrid system. Instead of issuing licenses, the Singapore government should tighten the regulation, meaning a company is decided to be illegal after it started its operations.<br><br>And in anyway, even if the scamsters are caught and sent to courts, it doesnt matter. The hard earned money of those foolish people would neevr be recovered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi there,<br>I've been one of the recent victims of NTI (niutrends international), haven recuited anyone in as i'm not too sure what the company is really doing, after a day of thoughts and researching online, i agree with the facts that have been said...<br><br>Personally, I have a sense of ill-boding with the company. But the tactic that they used to hire new recruits is really being planned geniously, they have consider all the factors that might influence the potential "victim" client for their decision to invest.<br><br>I hope that i can get a refund back on the investment. It's truely a loss-win situation, as you will earn money only if you get new recruits who are your friends. If it's really a win-win situation, there will be ppl of all ages there instead of just youngsters.<br><br>In the Psychology point of view, Only youngsters are the ones who wanna earn quick money, that's the reason there are mostly young ppl there...</div>
