            <div class='col-md body'>i'm former a manager in NTI and i'm very disgusted by the way the company run everything. i feel guilty after cheating my friends to invest so much money into this company... i'm too naive previously... i thought the company is really teaching me to be a businessman..but after i found out the truth.. they are simply using me and my friends to help them earn money. those sweet talks and motivations are simply trying to make me and my friends to fight harder for them. the RSDs are not making alot of money as what the company have projected to us. its all a setup to paint nice picture to lure youngster like us into believing and invested our savings into them. i really feel cheated after finding out the truth.. please, dont follow my footsteps. i feel very sad to lose my friends who are trying hard to get me out of NTI.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I have gathered from many fancy MLM talks, not many individuals  personally can show me actual income statements showing income generated from high repeat sales or repeat re-ordering. (however I only saw one exception from another company)<br><br>Because, if main income comes from registration or recruitment, you and I as distributors along the food chain will be starving once we slow down recruitment activity. hahaha ... and by then all our friends would have run away from us !<br><br>And another scary thing is called Binary system. Theoretically you're supposed to balance. In reality when the business goes international (again not many MLM products can truly penetrate international markets fast enough), how will you ever be able to track and balance left and right... dream on !!  And forever, you'll be short-changed, i.e., technically you will not be collecting the income that you are entitled to.<br><br>I've narrowed my choices to only 1 or 2 left that truly passed my checklist of criteria and will be making my selection this week.<br><br>To those who are seriously considering MLM -- BE VERY CAREFUL... DONT BELIEVE EVERYTHING THEY PROMISE , DONT BE EYEWASHED BY PEOPLE DRIVING FANCY CARS OR HAVING BIG HOUSES. Have a complete checklist and every point must pass...  To those who want to know my checklist, send me your email via the personal message and I will send it to you when I check the forum mailbox.<br><br>Goodluck guys !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hihi..<br><br>i've a friend who has been thoroughly brainwashed by NTI and i really don know what to do with it. worse, she thinks i am trying to pour cold water upon her... i have had experience in some companies b4 but never really did anything cos i did not have that desire to pursue this.. i won;t say that i have more experience than her in this network marketing arena, yet when she dragged me along to see her compensation plan, it was just so fundamentally wrong. pardon me, but isn;t multi-level marketing or network marketing essentially the movement of good products to consumers thru the network and as a result of getting people to do the same, u get to earn part of the points or money?<br><br>my question is, why doesn't she get it, that NTI isn;t a very upfront and honest company? lousy products (where got the repeatability of sales?) and scheming psychological methods to get people in (youngsters?! where got experience?) most of the other companies i have seen do have professionals in them and do sort of know the ethics of the biz. why doesn;t anyone in NTI understand this? mlm or nm, it does not matter and it is a good avenue.<br><br>i showed her the MTI website on the mlm prohibition act and she still did not understand.<br><br>according to the law,<br><br>there should be a cooling period for the sales of the products, sorta like a money back guarantee of sorts... to protect the interests of the customers.<br><br>but when i asked my friend abt this, whether i can refund the money, she said that it wasn;t really possible. her reason? if everyone returned their things when they ain't happy with thier products then how can the company continue to operate? in other words, i suppose it means that the moeny from the goods flows upwards? well.... i guess that's weird cos in thier smart plan, they do not separate the Business centres from the registration fees. which essentially means that a simple person who is listening to the plan for the first tiime would think that each BC is like a registration... and that the products are inevitable stuff that comes along with the BCs.<br><br>like excuse me!<br><br>in the eyes of the law, no one is to be pressured into buying products other than that of training materials etc . why is NTI functioning like that? worse, there should NOT be any monetary gains from the recruitment of people into the network. so many grey points that begs each other... wad the hell!?<br><br>can anyone tell me how i can help my friend ouit of this crazy and meaningless company? it is not only her time and effort wasted. i have seen others who lose friendships and treasured relationships when their companies fail them.<br><br>i really do not want to see her suffer eventually.<br><br>i feel that NTI, being flawed in their biz plans and equally lacking in ethics, would not last long, but hey... this nti thingy has been around for almost 3 years?<br><br>*sigh*<br><br>i really dunno what to do. CAD won;t be helping rite? if they did they would have clammed down on this long ago....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Selling products and telling people they cant return?<br><br>One, it seems they cannot provide a guarantee for their products. If they are assured of their product quality, why would they be afraid of large number of people refunding the products?<br><br>Second, we heard from nti agents how they rave the ingenuity of their boss. Walk around most successful stores or other MLM companies in Singapore. Most likely they have some form of products guarantee or refund policy. Wanting to be the best but leeching off the customers? Thats the ingenuity of the boss?</div>
