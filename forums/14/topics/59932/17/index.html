I find this mlm my fren introduced quite attractive as hte company is established n professional in its dealings ..or at least htat is what i gathered ...and its at its infancy stage in Singapore right now, so theres probably some first mover advantage to be gained.<br><br>aHowever, i heard so much about how it is bound to fail in spore given our social climate ...we are just not entrepreneurial for it to work and most people still hold negative connotations ot mlm.<br><br>Anyone care to address these concerns of mine?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiz, I'm new here.. But i guess there is something I need to post here. I juz helped a friend out of NTI with a <strong><span style="color: red;">100%</span></strong> refund. The refund took around 2 weeks.<br><br>Now I wanna go through how i helped him. After he told me that he was from NTI, He wanted me as his downline. But i told him that I wasn't interested and got a few of my friends to talk to him. He realised that NTI wasn't reliable and wanted to pull out from it. The refund period was actually only 3 days, than it changed to 7 days before the Oxy8 launched. Next, they changed it to 30 days after Oxy8 launched and they immediately changed it to 60 days after my friends and I wentup to NTI to help that friend of mine as he was helpless about the refund. His upline told him that there's was nothing he could do for him. So I got my other friends to help him out in this matter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>There's anything I wanna stress is that this company do not issue my friend any receipts, invoice or even product even after he paid for 4 accounts. The other best part was that his upline signed the authorization form on my friend's behalf without my friend's knowledge. The form is to authorize the upline to collect the products on behalf of my friend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Next, there's no termination form at all. I had to prepare a termination letter and ask my friend to bring it down to the company on the day he went back for a refund. Told him to let the administrator to sign and have a company stamp on it.<br><br>Just beware if you are in it... For those that need help can pm me... I'm juz trying to share my experience. Sorry for any misuse of words if there is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest every1 to get out of THERE (NTI) 1st. I don't mind you try other reputatable MLM companies with at least 20 history. I believe they have superb SKin Care Product compared to NTI.<br><br>SOme MLM companies that i think of those good quality are:<br>- NSP Nature Sunshine Products<br>- Nu Skin<br><br>these companies are very clear of these specifications.. They have their own R &amp; D stuffs and product training for it distributors..<br><br>If you need to find out more about them, feel free to PM me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand from the people there that the Oxy8 product has oxygen injected in it to improve skin conditions... They say it's made of oxygen and vegetable extracts... But when I questioned further, they couldn't answer me the lab test reports and what kind of technology they use to produce Oxy8... I believe the product is not safe to use as they do not have any lab reports to support it... If you go down to Bugis Junction, you will see a push cart selling aroma bottles and they do have NTI's bottle too... The price is definitely less than $288...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
