            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys,<br><br>before this topic is embroiled in total flame war, I hope everyone read the posts thoroughly before making comments. Initially we have people who been down to check ntiparis out and me who provided the articles and links. Then came timandra who does not agree with what I said, but provided point by point account of her experience. If reading binary plan books change her mind on binary, her posts also change my perspective on binary, and prompting me to read up more. <strong>Even then she has sided with ntiparis, did I admonish her or made personal attacks on her?</strong> We exchanged few PMs and she gave me more details and insights. Up to then, she admit this thread is very intellectual in debate. This point, she can vouch for me.<br><br>So we continues, and many like ghost, co-7, tibirg, stevie wonder, dennis lam, songboz, lobang, awaken, notyboy came up.<br><br>If you read my exchanges with awaken, I asked him for more details. <strong>Did I again attack awaken?</strong> He let out the first sensitive part on ntiparis which I knew a bit, and probe him further if you read my exchanges.<br><br>We have DennisLam coming up. He may be anti ntiparis, but remember we argue whether its good to report police? I have my points, he have his. He has admit as much, his posts are emotional rather than objective.<br><br>By this time, tibirg is part of the second group which spoke up. She has admit as much her relationship with her friend worsen. Timandra came up, and tell us of her trip to ntiparis. We still debate, and not once had I ever question her integrity. Open your eyes to read her and my posts.<br><br>Songboz came up, we also exchange PMs. If you guys think songboz is a young prick in MLM, think again. Really experienced MLMers dont look at cash displayed on table. Its like maths, how you know what to play around with numbers. I share his sentiments when we talk about earning money off ntiparis, cause the flaws in ntiparis was noted to me by my insider friend. So I deduce songboz is no simpleton. Look at his posts, he said he is not pro ntiparis, just someone who knew how cash really flows around. I must applaud him for his ingenuity.<br><br>Second sensitive info came from experienced. Why I question experienced on his nationality and how he know so much. Read his posts eyeball to screen. He just blab out some stuff that I suspect he come from the MLM circle in KL. Nothing wrong with that, and also I may be wrong on his nationality, but again he is also no young prick in SG-KL MLM circle. Even know much about James Phang connection up to Taiwan.<br><br>Lobang came up, did I made personal attack on his integrity or did I ask him to check his facts. Did I made nasty sarcastic comments to him? Check your facts. Same goes for notyboy. They are pro nti paris, and have they replied that I hinted they are evil or stupid or anything like that?<br><br>How about troddenjaw? His one is shocking enough till someone call him James Phang Jinx. Look at his details and points provided. Arent they glaring enough?<br><br>After all this, at songboz request, I typed out by hand ST articles. Newspaper reports, not some rumours I concocted.<br><br>All in all, there are those who provided articles, facts and links, while another group just wanted ntiparis down. Third group, sad to say is only timandra. She may not be against ntiparis, but she is the only person to ever provide points by points argument against me, which I found to be challenging. I have no interest to debate with those who choses to do otherwise.<br><br>Ok, people may argue those with facts may be wrong, those who experienced ntiparis may be mistaken but those who choses not to believe them (except for timandra) choses to do personal attacks.<br><br>Seriously, to be nasty, I can also point out two strange points long ago. Why hellodoggy choses to comment on me personally instead of providing more facts? And why he takes similar line like donkeywarriors, who are simply a very clever fellow in crafting sarcastic posts?<br><br>If anyone sees any of my post being personal attacks on another person before hellodoggy and donkeywarriors choses to comment on me personally, please point it out in a haste!<br><br></div>

Dont care the police, if they are really good enough, coz many of us here are still living in dreamland underestimating the ingenuity of scamsters.I mean this is SIngapore what, we are living in comfort zone, while sadly, those from other countries are mostly in the know about how scams work.

Coz you never seen what kind of attitude monsters they turn into, doesnt mean you can just wave it off like that. Look what happened to my friends, best friend's brother and many others.

Why hellodoggy choses to comment on me personally instead of providing more facts? And why he takes similar line like donkeywarriors, who are simply a very clever fellow in crafting sarcastic posts?<br><br>If anyone sees any of my post being personal attacks on another person before hellodoggy and donkeywarriors choses to comment on me personally, please point it out in a haste!<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Dear Laurence82, How did you know Timandra is a she? You mean you knew beforehand? Once again, you are being over-defensive. A few words and you had to type an essay proclaiming your innocence.<br><br>So you mean you can joke but others cannot? I put a smiley face at the end of my msg, but you took it seriously. I can say that is a blatant guilty conscience.<br><br>You said I was targeting you?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Hey man, seems like more than 50% of this forum is filled with your posts!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> And plenty of incongruencies to boot. I pointed them out, and boy were you affected.<br><br>And may I know who are you to define everyone like that? Saying whether they are on the good or bad side? Are you God? Does being in a unidentified MLM company yourself make you a supreme expert to judge everyone? Listen, I speak for myself, and am not as immature as to form new identities to antagonize you. My comments and reasoning are clear enough.<br><br>There's my post before the new year, and go on, I can't stop you. Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Up till then, I had not pointed or accuse anything at you. Then you started this stuff about "me in another company, and having hinting that I have vested interest to see ntiparis down so I can profit"<br><br>Defensive being one thing, coz a scam is a scam. You can flog me whole day on having biasness, vested interest suspicions of this and that. Why are you doing this to me? I devoted one post only to reply and comment on your personal attacks, while you have devoted few long posts which keep implying various suspicions. Trying to bring down the integrity of my posts by cleverly pointing out suspicions of my own personal self than my points of argument?<br><br>I called timandra a she, coz her name implies, just as in other forums I made mistake on people gender based on nickname. You want to imply suspicions based on this? I started nti posts, but since ghost started one, might as well continue here. You want to imply more suspicions based on this too? And also try to be defensive of your own integrity by "other guys keep out of it, I only attack laurence82 only? read your posts, if you have come up with facts for ntiparis fine. But all your posts keep hinting suspicions on myself, and when I defended, called me defensive.<br><br>My whole life, I avoided clever people like yourself coz I am seriously afraid of you. Yes you. I am afraid of you. Why? Gals can actually do this better at noting the cleverness of people and the damage they bring. Its called intuition, and also from experience. Basically, yes you are quick enough to imagine several suspicious facts based on my posts. But they are not true. And you continue hinting that me keeping secrets such as my own company, my sources and stuff. Why dont you also question other people sources of info. Why am I afraid of you, coz your ingenuity is making you trying to break me down, layer by layer. How much I know wouldnt convince you, and you keep going on and on, while I just posts some articles. you continue doing this.....<br><br>Therefore I must beg you, seriously, what you really want? What do you want me to do? Must I go down on my knees to beg you, please stop buggering me. This is SERIOUS. I am begging you now to let me off. You want me to go to you and beg you to stop bugging me.Fine. Just let me off.<br><br></div>
