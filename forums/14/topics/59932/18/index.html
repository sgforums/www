For electrical appliances, it is a must to be sent for safety testing. As for drug, cosmectis, food, dried food,etc,etc, there are no law that it is a must to be sent for testing. There are millions of products in local market and new products up to thousands are in the market monthly.<br>The only law that stated for consumption is to state the ingredients. Just like Slim 10, is it alright to sell, however it's the responsible for the dealers if anything goes wrong. As for consumers, it is your duty that you are aware of what you are consuming/ using.<br><br>What HSA does is to do QC for products without the dealers/ agents knowing. They will do testing when many complains on a particular product are received or when they suspect that there are banned substances in the products.<br><br>HSA will base on the current list of banned substances. Yet if the products were tested before and then the contents changes or HSA has newly banned one of ingredients in the products,  it is not requested to submit for testing again unless the products got complained or suspected of banned substances.<br><br>SPRING Singapore do not only test electrical appliances. They represent Singapore government to do testing on anything to check the effectiveness, safety, percentage, environmental friendly of contents. This is to ensure that all products tested are under international standard. Spring test is one of the most recognised in the whole world for its extremely strict, reliable and high standard testing, no undertable problems.<br><br>As long as a company has Spring lab test reports, it's widely recognised. However many and really many products do not dare to be sent for testing. In addition,many companies will state that due to the small scale of the company, they do not have the money to do testing. If a good company no matter how big or small scale, they will send for SPRING testings no matter how much they have to pay as they do not exchange money and conscious to consumer's health, safety and life.<br><br></div>

He mentioned that behind every products should stated wat are composition of all ingredients. by writing on another piece of paper, cannot prove that particular products DOES HAVE these specifications written down! They are smart to make that move, and they will eventually get away easily. The booklets being given should involved all the standard procedures in apply it (Skin care products) and not specifications on ingredients.

He mentioned that behind every products should stated wat are composition of all ingredients. by writing on another piece of paper, cannot prove that particular products DOES HAVE these specifications written down! They are smart to make that move, and they will eventually get away easily. The booklets being given should involved all the standard procedures in apply it (Skin care products) and not specifications on ingredients.

Some do not have the contents written on their bottles or box, but in small booklets in the box, like Brand Essence of Chicken type, or in a booklet, brochure or product guides detailed to explain the contents, source of products etc etc.<br><br>For me its all right if the box cover do not contain the ingredients list, but the company must have literature ready to explain the safety, effectiveness, accreditation, composition, etc etc of the products, then I am satisfied. Many people say the companies can bluff in this area, but consumers should be checking this part up too, like checking with the associations or institutions that back these companies up.<br><br>For now, I am digging up on the approval part. Although someone present the facts we might have to use the products at our own risks, I am going to check this part up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wat hjxfabio has just mention earlier is that, the booklet is found in the BAG and not in the packaging or not in the boxes containing such products..<br>The booklet Not included together with the products may be questionable in a sense that, they will deny it which has make claims about the products. they will definitely defend their products by saying that is it just a brochure or something. making other claims such "It can cure mircales"!<br>Other MLM co. also uses catalogues tat describe their product, claiming that it can heal numerous diseases. BUt have u guys ever noticed that, behind the catolgues, it say "Independent Distributor Booklet" or something similiar to that..<br><br>Wat is the reason for quoting this sentence to be in? Have u wondered? it is solely deny the misinterpretation of the product, and the company can simply get away from legal charges from consumers as products mentioned does not really meet their expectations.<br><br></div>

This is a freedom of yours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As you are not an expert in comestic, food or chemical, all the above may look new to you. These are common chemicals or extracts used in the market. If you are free, drop by the NTUC or Watson or any other shops that sells cosmetic. You will find the same content here and there.<br><br>Though I might not be a "medicial expert" like Songboz, but I do have cert n practical knowledge on medicals, herbs and chemicals. I have noted that there are some chemicals which are safe in small amount but not more than the safety level. I will like to suggest that you prevent using Lightening UV Shield SPF 18 that might result in side effect .<br><br>Just a few examples of some contents:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lactic Acid</span> or Lactate is produced by the body all day long and is a key chemical which is used to dispose of dietary carbohydrate and also helps you from getting fat. In <strong>Gentle Tonifying Lotion</strong>, it's not made from the one in our body yet it has the same function.<br><br>Kaolin is a type of clay that commonly referred to as China Clay or Paper Clay. It is a hydrated silica of alumina with a composition of approximately 46% SiO2; 40% Al2O3, and 14% H2O. Not only your product has, many other cosmetic products or food used them. For cosmetic products, it is actually used to block the sun and UV ray, that is why <strong>Lightening UV Shield SPF 18</strong> has included it. Side effect of it can be unthinkable....<br><br>Imagine you apply clay onto your face everyday <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  Even a little or tiny amount everyday will mean alot if you keep using for a long time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Just a suggest  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Know what you are using and buying.
