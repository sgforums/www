            <div class='col-md body'>Woo.. interesting... looks like I'm so many years late for the prom! There's so many discussions here about MLM. Am I too late to chip in some words now?<br><br>I'm an entrepreneur and naturally, the people around me owns companies too. Damn, we loathe MLM people so much. They look like clowns to us!<br><br>I share the same sentiments as some people here who would like to close companies such as NTI-Paris down. I would like to do that too man but only people with "Power", "Authority", "Connections" can play the chess game with these thugs.<br><br>Have you guys ever thought of signing petitions? What do u think.<br><br>Anyway regarding evidence (I din finish reading as theres too much postings haha. Read this sumwhere in-front), I tried gathering evidence too, to help my friends. Studied Law and know lawyers, I told my little cousin who was in MLM to get me the contract u signed, terms &amp; Conditions, all documentation that they showed you. Well too bad, my little cousin, who is considered "infant" in the legal aspect, don;t even remember what he saw. He did not read the T&amp;C, he did not go through the documentation and he cannot get these stuff I need.<br><br>If you guys are still interested in closing these (this) company, how about starting a new thread, or let's form a yahoo or messenger (I think they have) group. We see what we civilians can do from there. Cheers to laurance, I only remember him from the posts infront. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Oh the irony! I laughed when I revisited my posts earlier on.<br><br>I left NTI jaded and mentally drained. To me, it seemed as though I wasted a good one year there (not to mention a few thousand dollars on their products which until today still sits in my cupboards at home  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ).<br><br>Did I earn much during my one year there? No. In fact, I managed to earn back only 10% of what I had put in when I joined them. When I left that place I carried with me a loss of $1000+.<br><br>Did I slog like an animal?

I didn't think so. I put in more hours than they did, I was more articulate, I was proficient in both Mandarin and English and even conversational dialect. I have been in leadership positions since secondary school. I read more books than they did. Did these count for anything? No, not at all.<br><br>Did I learn anything about how to do a business? No. Zilch.

I was personally coached by the tier-3 network marketers, my so-called up-up-uplines, if I may use that term. Yet today I have nothing much to offer whenever friends come to me for advice on their business plans.<br><br>Ask successful entrepreneurs out there who made it on their own and they will tell you that you can learn how to set up your own business by yourself. Definitely not through MLM.<br><br>I left NTI just before I entered university for my undergaduate studies. Most guys my age entered university with a bank account chock full of savings from their NS allowance. I went in penniless. I see my friends going out and having fun during Freshmen Orientation and my heart ached because I didn't possess the spending power they did.<br><br>Two years down the road and I've never regretted leaving NTI. The way the top brass conducted themselves over at the office leaves one to wonder whether they are really as brilliant as they claim themselves to be.<br><br>One might say, "Hey, NTI Paris is still around after so many years. Doesn't that mean something?"<br><br>Yes, it does. It just means that youngsters nowadays are increasingly impressionable and easily swayed by marketing tactics. Many of the network marketers in NTI were bordering on illegal working age when I left, though I hope that the situation has changed by now.<br><br>For those of you proficient in English, take a look at their website. Look at the sheer number of spelling and grammatical mistakes within it.<br><br>Totally unprofessional. And this is a company which claims that it can compete with MNCs in terms of professionalism, work ethics and economies of scale.<br><br>All this being said, I have a friend who joined NTI with me 3 years back (we were crosslines) and has worked hard enough to make BDM in NTI. I'm happy for him, seeing how he enjoys network marketing and how well he has performed in it.<br><br>Still, he is but one success story. For every person like him, there are probably 100 others who have failed to achieve the MLM dream.<br><br>Hopefully, my personal experience will discourage those of you who come across this from taking this big gamble (even soccer betting has a higher chance of generating profits). If you haven't joined, that is.<br><br>For those of you who are currently in MLM but have doubts about the industry, maybe this post will help you reach a decision.<br><br>For those of you in MLM, strongly believe in it, believe that you will do well and drive a big car within one year, I wish you all the best.<br><br>Cheers all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well very long and purposeful post.<br><br>i think ppl who are contemplating whether to join mlm, should seriously consider how u are going to at least break even from ur so called investments. many ppl join mlm without thinking or with the 'fake it until u make it' mentality. i.e. pretend to be very rich to lure friends into mlm, hoping one day u recruit enough to really start earning. I think it's very dangerous to have that kind of mentality. it's good to have a desire to make it big in life, but u also need a good plan to carry out. everyone also has desire to be rich. but the one who made it are the ones with a concrete plan.<br><br>if ur plan is to pretend to be very rich, well dressed, project the successful image to ur friends when u haven't reach that status, u are just putting one foot in the hell hole.</div>

Most guys my age entered university with a bank account chock full of savings from their NS allowance. I went in penniless. I see my friends going out and having fun during Freshmen Orientation and my heart ached because I didn't possess the spending power they did.<br><br>Two years down the road and I've never regretted leaving NTI. The way the top brass conducted themselves over at the office leaves one to wonder whether they are really as brilliant as they claim themselves to be.<br><br>One might say, "Hey, NTI Paris is still around after so many years. Doesn't that mean something?"<br><br>Yes, it does. It just means that youngsters nowadays are increasingly impressionable and easily swayed by marketing tactics. Many of the network marketers in NTI were bordering on illegal working age when I left, though I hope that the situation has changed by now.<br><br>For those of you proficient in English, take a look at their website. Look at the sheer number of spelling and grammatical mistakes within it.<br><br>Totally unprofessional. And this is a company which claims that it can compete with MNCs in terms of professionalism, work ethics and economies of scale.<br><br>All this being said, [b]<span style="color: red;">I have a friend who joined NTI with me 3 years back (we were crosslines) and has worked hard enough to make BDM in NTI</span>.</strong> I'm happy for him, seeing how he enjoys network marketing and how well he has performed in it.<br><br>Still, he is but one success story. For every person like him, there are probably 100 others who have failed to achieve the MLM dream.<br><br>Hopefully, my personal experience will discourage those of you who come across this from taking this big gamble (even soccer betting has a higher chance of generating profits). If you haven't joined, that is.<br><br>For those of you who are currently in MLM but have doubts about the industry, maybe this post will help you reach a decision.<br><br>For those of you in MLM, strongly believe in it, believe that you will do well and drive a big car within one year, I wish you all the best.<br><br>Cheers all. [/b]</blockquote>BDM? So what?! I know a few BDMs/BRMs in NTI as well, but they are as poor as a beggar. What is your friend's name? (You can pm me) Maybe he is/was from my camp. Maybe i know him. Then i will tell you how he fair in NTI.</div>
