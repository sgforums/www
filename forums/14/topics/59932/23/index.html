In the end, they gave me a Product Refund Request form to sign, and after signing, they told me to wait for another 2 weeks for confirming (though they also said it's not 100% refundable.)<br><br>I don't know, but somehow I felt I have not written enough or convincing reasons for refunding in the form.

            <div class='col-md body'>U r absolutely spot on! This is according to someone's experience who related it to me regarding this company that's spoiling the name of the industry. I have a fren who used to be a distibutor in ntiparis. He told me that he cannot withdraw his commissions becos his account is being freezed. And he is so pissed off by it not only becos of that but also becos he had to wait for a few months. According to him,  he had to constantly go down and ask if his commission check is ready. Alas the counter said NO!!! My fren said it's becos his upline had wanted to leave ntiparis for another company and that  the whole network also decided to shift together. I guess becos of this his upline's upline who is also part of the management position decided to freeze everyone in his network from getting their commission  checks!!! What kind of attitude is this? My fren said that in order to collect the commission checks he had to ask from that top upline who freezed the accounts. I mean this is some political issue goin on here it's totally separate issues. ntiparis is really spoiling the name of the mlm industry. Good companies' distributors have their commission checks sent to them to their mailbox every month no matter what happens!!!  There are good companies to look out for and bad ones to avoid. Unfortunately, ntiparis fits the latter!!!</div>

Why never touch on how they are going to sell the products? Their products so ex and useless, how they sell sia<br><br>After being bomb-barded with all the benefits NTIparis offers, they assumed I will be interested and eager to sign the form with them, heck, they even draw out the plan for me.

            <div class='col-md body'>All I can say is this.<br><br>MLM do emphasise on income earning too. When human greed or foolishness kicks in, even if the company emphasise or is trying to sell its products, members may override such system and focus on the benefits of huge income potential.<br><br>On the other hand, companies may use products as cover up, I will point out again and again, when a business is set up, its sole purpose is to sell products or provde services, no matter what marketing system. The product or service cannot be secondary or bonus to the earning potential.<br><br>When a company management, without considering its distributors, tries to focus on 'huge income potential' and use nice words such as 'investments'. it plays along the line of money game, where people 'invested' in a money system, churning out money to uplines, causing downlines who 'invested' to wait hopefully for the next downlines 'investments'. Distinguish this from the income earned from genuinely trying to sell products, where you are offering value for money products, and even without recruiting, you benefit.<br><br>nti, in my opinion, has led many people to believe in few myths.<br><br>- Registration of company = Legality<br><br>Nope. When a company is registered, it only complete a few legal obligations and formalities. Frauds and scams are later found out and investigated by CAD<br><br>- Great income potential, plus distributors really earning a lot = Legality.<br><br>Nope again. Earn based on what? I would ask. Read my first few paragraphs.<br><br>- Boss invested a lot into the company, even setting up overseas branch. Therefore, he intends it to be fair and aboveboard.<br><br>Another myth. Relate this to the scams of past years. Many has registered as business, and set up posh offices at Shenton Way and White House. Refer to the commodities scams of 1994 period. If returns negate huge initial investments, why not? Sophiscation will the keyword.<br><br>Lastly,unlike dcx, (paiseh), I will not take a neutral stand, Consider the impact of such companies. Truly the attractiveness of nti is that many do earn initially. But troubles sets in the long term, when such great income earning is not supported by considerations such as value for money products, lacking legal support, flawed management etc etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just look at this ... isn't it clear that the NTI logo has been pasted on top of a snapshot of a building using Adobe Photoshop? This picture was extracted with the help of Sothink SWF Decompiler from NTI's flash presentation at <a href="http://www.ntiparis.com" rel="nofollow">www.ntiparis.com</a> .

            <div class='col-md body'>DCA even though u haf deleted ur posts but tt doesnt mean NTiparis is not a crap company. Even though u haf apologised tt doesnt mean the damage to NTI is not obvious. Even if u deleted ur posts and apologised to Desmond or JAmes Phang, it doesnt mean everyone agrees with u. Thanks for spilling out the beans on NTI. More ppl will know abt their doing n will gladly be wiser to avoid this so-called mlm co.</div>
