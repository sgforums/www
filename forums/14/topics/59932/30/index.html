I've met up with quite alot of forumers who were involved in NTI. I've called NTI management but they refused to talk to clarify any issues that we pose. Next, we've made a police report about NTI already, don't worry about that, let them finish their investigation.<br><br>Secondly, unless you show proof that we are clones or Amway agents, please don't vomit your baseless accusations all over the forum. We aren't involved in any MLM scheme so there is nothing to quit from. Moreover, we are NOT against MLM, just against some unethical and potentially illegal practices of some MLMs like NTI.<br><br>You tone is definitely not befitting of someone who has something substantial to add to this topic.

My friend thought something was fishy as well cos people normally don't recruit employees thru Friendster, and the mix of businesses it was involved in was suspicious as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any company can have dealings with a Bank. If I open an account in my company's name in DBS, I have a dealing with the bank. Anyway if my company offers discount to all DBS customers, it is also a dealing with the bank. The bank really does not care what they actually do but since they offer the discount, the bank will just take it.<br><br>When in doubt, DO NOT GO.
