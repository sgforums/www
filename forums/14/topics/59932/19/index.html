Whether or not the company has some quota to meet ie maintenance or using the accumulation method, or a variation of the two methods actually doesnt affect me.Well considering all other factors to be the same, i am more concerned if the the company practice either or both in an unreasonable way.<br><br>Period maintenance - Main complaints is high maintenance quota, plus also low payouts. I have seen some companies which practise forcing people to maintan high sales quota to be qualified for certain bonuses or commisisons. These can last from one to two to three months depending, and worse people have to do that, or total personal sales or group sales is demoted to zero if the quota is not reached, i.e one have to restart the selling. Even worse still, one particular company I seen do this to its new distributors, who have no experience in this altogether.<br><br>Better companies practise monthly maintenance, but low ones. Some would lower the quota as the distributors gets promoted higher and higher. Why? One of the pitfalls of increasing maintenance quota (i heard this from ex pioneers of some companies) is that because as they progress, not only they have to keep up with the personal sales quota i.e selling, they also have to maintain group sales, ie devoting time to train downlines as well as helping them to maintain their sales. Since they have to spend so much time on either side, either way, their commissions might suffer. So its no wonder for them to get increasing income at the start and later suffer.<br><br>Accumulation Method - Seems all right, but if company is 'all right' too. One factor I am afraid is the developing slack attitude. There should be also some form of pressure on the distributors like monthly maintenance, otherwise we can see varying degrees of success within the company. Provided the company does not have high accumulation quota, like one of the the companies mentioned in this forum. I am afraid of company using accumulation method and high payout, unless al other factors are equally good too.<br><br>I seen some which actually practise both, accumulation for new distributors as they have no experience and no strong customer base ,and maintenance for experienced distributors as they already well have experience so as to speak.<br><br>All in all, whatever method, its still depend on the company structure.<br></div>

Thus the sales bonus should be paid out to the lowest distributors in the network and those on top will only get after all their distributors got their sales commission.<br><br>As for those that is on top will only get very little commssion because they have to share the commsion to all his distributors first.<br><br>That is why as top distributors, they have titles such as ruby, diamond, etc. The company will pay then titiles bonus and this money comes from the company and not from the lower title distributors.<br><br>Too much details involved, thus I cut short this conversation.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

I did recommend DSAM and US DSA, before plus those sites or examples I put up on "Useful Websites and Stuff' in Kopitiam.<br><br>And true, what stormax said.

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa, me bit dizzy from reading all this.<br><br>Firstly, this is ntiparis thread, please move all discussion on Amway to the relevant thread. Thanks.<br><br>To richyeap, I cant comment on the marketing plan personally coz like you said, you cannot communicate out much on net, its very limited.<br><br>However, I disagree on this maximum payout and non monthly maintenance.<br><br>Why, if a MLM leader is able to grow his business, he is limited? What if I move beyond four groups? Why should the company say no if I aim for sales which will get get me commissions of more than $40,000 in year end bonus? What I meant of course is percentage of sales, not fixed $40,000 or whatever amount.<br><br>On the surface, the company might try to present itself as ethical and low-level-distributors-centric, however, earning big bucks is the ultimate aim. Its true one earns when downlines earns, but it is ridiculous when downlines get more relatively than uplines for same amount of effort. So, the performance bonus should be given at same time, rather than lower level first, the higher level.<br><br>I feel downlines should be eligible to earn more if a) they have higher sales b) build larger network  than uplines. Not just merely accord them more rewards relatively.<br><br>But of course I must qualify that I gotta look at the marketing plan before making more comments.<br><br>On monthly maintenance, its also sounds ethical to say no monthly requirement. Btw, still need your clarification, on what kind of maintenance method does Amway based on? From your points, its accumulation method?<br><br>Its very important to have targets. Monthly quota is meant to pressure distributors. Why not? Like I said about accummulation method, distributors might slack..in name of ethics?. Company will not be performing, and how does one get sales commission or a precentage of year bonus?<br><br>So one doesnt meet the monthly quota, assumming its reasonable. Some companies practise giving the distributors profit right at the start. Some percentages of the products sold is given directly to the distributors, whether or not they meet the target, You sell one, you earn some percentages straight. Its called retail profits in some companies.<br><br>Monthly quota is abused when it is high, forcing distributors to frontload products to get commissions. It kills them coz of the high amount of cost to pay, and storing large amounts of products in the storeroom. So one have to exercise judgement base on the exact quota a company wants, instead of making sweeping statement on companies which requires a sales target every month.<br><br>Now, who but idiots join companies requiring them to sell a lot in a month?<br><br>Ok enough said, move this topic to other thread please.<br><br>Btw, anyone have more report on ntiparis? Firstly, CAD ,as said maybe investigating, but of what results or the process CAD wouldnt reveal, so no speculation. Secondly, like I mention before, it doesnt amaze me nti is cleared if that is the results. Those who was once victims or promoters of such schemes would tell you without a batting an eyelid, there are numerous scams which has slip thru the hands of CAD or without its knowing. Dont ask me, ask them, I mean the scamsters.<br><br></div>
