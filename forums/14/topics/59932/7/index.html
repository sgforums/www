            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hellodoggy:</div><div class="quote_body">hey guys, while NTI might be in the news, until the time the police actually caught them, or there are actually people complaining to the police, let's not draw conclusions shall we? I could accuse someone of something but until he is found guilty, I wouldn't draw conclusions as yet. Maybe I think since that laurence82 is so negative about this company, I think that you should look for the police and inform us of your updates.<br><br>Did some research (hope I can call it that) and found that the actual boss of Nti is not james phang, rather it's someone called david, their executive director. He's the one running the show...so I think it's inconclusive to link nti to NOP since different people...james phang is there more as a speaker<br><br>well that's what I know so far. People you have more facts do bring them up... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Firstly, different people tell me different stuff, so I will be sorting thru the mess. As to who owns ntiparis, I wouldnt be surprised to know that David Phang owns it.<br><br>One thing I noted, is that many of us chose to look at any business or even politics (Speakers Corner) on a theoretical basis or shallow manner.<br><br>Such as timandra going down and eventually to find nothing wrong with ntiparis,discussing on how ntiparis is closely following the binary plan, hellodoggy doing research to find that David Phang who seems to be the one owning ntiparis, many agents coming to me telling me ntiparis is a registered biz, so it cant be illegal blah blah...i am not surprised or shocked to know this. I have already gone thru that period. Basically, I am not biased against  ntiparis on personal or emotional reasons, you can even flame me on this thread and I dont even care.<br><br>Two reasons. I chose to go deep, very deep into my findings on ntiparis. Heck, altho many recommend me to read books on success and network marketing and stuff, I didnt. Basically, these are on theoretical basis or other experience, and mostly does not apply to Singapore underworld context, although they may be right in some ways.<br><br>Networking (i dont mean network marketing) is very important. Approaching experienced networker, promoters and victims of scams, how about even close associate of James Phang <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. Let me tell you guys one thing all scamsters told me. What you guys wrote here features that defeat ntiparis as illegal or dubious scheme, has actually been practised in commodities and pyramid scams before, and are still being practised. And they got away with it.<br><br>Remember how I wrote about bosses having many companies, police must have experienced conman with them to catch other conman, features of ntiparis, articles (especially this) blah blah. It is not meant to tell why I think ntiparis is dubious, its more on leading you guys to realise and understand the magnitude and sophiscations of present world problems. Essentially, many experienced networkers look out for the essence of the business, not the form it takes. Even up to the point when ntiparis is cleared or get away with it, I am not shocked. Neither would these people be surprised too.<br><br>When I mean digging deep, I do mean dig deep. I wonder whether I posted this before but no harm repeating.<br><br><i title="Cool"> .&gt;<br><br>Well, you can sift thru the flaws of the story and say the wife isnt that, the husband should have blah blah, but thats not the point. The simplicity of the story, and my intention  is to let you realise what I had been saying and emphasising. Remember S888.com. Essentially the police charged it for running in the spirit of a pyramid, not because it has legally broke the law. I read this article somewhere and will post it.<br><br>Somehow, knowledge has given way to instinct and feelings for many networkers. Its like saying, "Hey I think this is illegal becos they emphasise on recruitment and has no credible stuff".....and you are probabaly right.<br><br>So my point is to dig deeper than shallow surface.<br><br>Secondly, I have reach a point where it is not neccessary to care for friends who join. Read my posts with advice to DennisLam on why I do feel there is not need to report police. Well, suckers are born every minute ,and these people cannot be influenced to give matters a thought over. I dont mean to change, but to think something over. Rather pointless once they got hook.<br><br>We can still discuss the legality of ntiparis and argue and flame and whatever......my only advice for people who cares....Dig Deeper.<br><br></i></div>

So if these suckers deserve it, let them go through whatever they have to go through. Why waste so much time?

But then again he mentioned suckers are born every minute.

I'm not saying that he is a good guy, but having a sibling or relative who is a criminal doesn't not necessitate you to become one, nor being condemned as one. Also, I think claiming to know a person or even his close associates does not add credibility to my claims (I might know him but he might not know me. I know he smokes Salem. So??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br>I am not writing this as a pro or anti-NTIparis sentimentalist, but I do tend to nullify contradictions if I observe them. One more thing I need to add is that laurence82 is also in MLM, but he is not disclosing which company it is. Why? Because the vicious cycle will start again?<br><br>All I want to say is that NTI is still young, people who have bad experiences can speak up, and those who have good experiences can do so too.

Happy New Year everyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Firstly, when I say dig deeper, its for those who choses to defend or against nti.And I am still doing that, finding out the going ons.Not joining does not mean hell it got nothing to do with me.<br><br>Secondly, bringing police action against nti might not help, as i emphasise and explain again and again, but no harm in telling people what one know and made people more aware.What I have explained was, if people chose not to listen, let them be. At least I have made a stand. Dont know why you chose to mix up suckers are born every minute and warning loved ones.<br><br>Thirdly, I never point out knowing close associates as main source of info (thats rather stupid) Look at my past posts.<br><br>Fourthly, if you wish to emphasise as me joining an mlm as having a vested interest to flame "young growing company", go ahead. Post it not only once, but twice, thrice....I am encouraging you.Seriously. It just obliviates me as human rather a networker isnt it. Might as well name me as the person with the least reason to speak up.<br>Why!? In my life, only two people has ever question my honesty and integrity. One is a bastard whom everyone avoid. And the other....Typical sceptical Singaporean.<br><br>Fifth, I dont know what u mean by having close relatives who are fiends does not neccesitate one to be equally so. Out of context here. Never even hint at this point.<br><br>Sixth, as I have posted before on this thread, look at my points. Have I ranted? I would have joined DennisLam in his (he admit as much) emotional speech.<br><br>Seventh, if you chose to put me as overzealous blind guy, (I guess as much) go ahead. I am also encouraging you. In fact, I am not sarcastic here. I just wish you would do it. Right now.<br><br>Eighth. I am also not suprised at your post. Didnt I hint in the preceding post that post like yours would come up? Just as I forecasted last year that going by my observation of my friend, he would join in a get rich quick scheme, and who and who would join in ntiparis, I dd hint in my preceding post someone (and it happen to be you) would put comments as you had just posted.<br><br>Happy Chinese New Year to you too!!!<br><br></div>

You just have mentioned the first method, but in fact I know of other methods to rip off those guys.<br><br>However, why I wouldnt encourage is I cannot assure you will be all right IF (hope hellodoggy is reading this properly) the police caught up with ntiparis. Your name is on the list of agents. Minimal is warning letter...max you know the consequence.<br><br>And if you think "aiyah its all right arh", let me advise you, assumption and presumption are the father and mother of all screws up....so........<br><br>I guess you already know of other methods and to forecast when to pull out?

In Malaysia, they call him "the Conman of MLM in Singapore" because of NOP. When NOP started in Malaysia, he created a big hoohaa by having a very large office. In less than a year, it lived up to its name "No-One-People". Last year, he reduced his office to a very small size, reluctant to close, in order to safeguard his reputation and started "Dynamics Elixir" selling beautiful cystal items to compete Bel Air and Lampe Berger. Of course, it don't do well. Now NTIparis, is the products value for money ? Evaluate yourself !!<br><br>James Phang, in Malaysia is already well-known for over-claiming and over-selling himself as well as forever over-pricing in products.<br><br>He claimed his brother is the best fortune teller and his crystals(in NOP times) can bring good fortune, wonder why is NOP a flop then ?<br><br>Basically, I think there is nothing wrong with a binary plan if the products charged are fair and value for money.

            <div class='col-md body'>To add to Experienced's points,<br><br>Firstly, I have stated I have close contacts with people who was in scams before. Why is networking (I dont mean network marketing) important? Even my lecturers in SIM can tell you networking or having a close circle of friends or biz associates helps in getting information faster and more accurate, or even help. Within scams, there are also a circle of conman who kept contacts with one another. So its like who's who in the scam industry.<br><br>What Experienced just pointed out reflects what I know too. In fact I can even tell you the second generation of conman in the commodities scams are making a comeback now.<br><br>Secondly, I would like Experienced to put forward more information or even stuff we can read about (so as to avoid accusations of bias or having vested interest or whatever people can throw)<br><br>Thirdly, I got a question. Is the brother who is a fortune teller having anything to do with Taiwan? i had known before within ntiparis or nop ,there is this supposedly powerful fortune teller who came from Taiwan who seems to be able to read fortune, as well as selling magical items (like those crystal people used to con old people). i would like more info on this thanks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha... Songboz! u dun have to repeat your post. Seens u are part of nti, U should stand on the nti side but not here to back stab your own company. And u shouldn't have any doubts on nti. U should trust them. But i'm here to say one thing to all nti ppl is that "There's no easy money or free lunches in this world. If u think money comes so easily? then you got to pay the price" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
