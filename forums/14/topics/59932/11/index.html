            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Times Forum, Dec 30 2003<br><br><strong>Dangers of multi-level marketing</strong><br><br>I ma writing to raise awareness of teh recent rise of multi-level marketing firms that may engage in underhand or even illegal tactics.<br><br>Several weeks ago, I attended a seminar on multi-level marketing in Shenton Way. During the seminar, the audience, mostly teenagers, were subject to what could be tremed 'brainwashing'.<br><br>They were inundated with fantastic claims of paths to riches, using a gimmicky prsentation style which involved loud cheering and enthusiastic clapping from staff. At the end of the seminar, which focused almost exclusively on the cost of livingand how the company can help one achieve one's dreams of material well-being, I was left bewildered. Thre was absolutely no mention of teh product they were selling.<br><br>When I questioned this, I was told: "Does the product really matter? I could go on and on about the benefits of aromatheraphy, but what is important here is our marketing technique."<br><br>As it turned out, this marketing technique closely resembles pyramid selling. To join the scheme, you pay a fee to buy an aromatheraphy product. For each person you sell more products to, you receive a commission. And for each sale, the person who got you to join the scheme receives the same commission.<br><br>The chain continues ,with more people pulled into the scheme, and those on top getting rich quick.<br><br>What is suspicious is first, the focus is on the sales method rather than the product. Second, they seem too eager to impress the audience and the potential customers with flashy presenters and pushy marketing.<br><br>Third, the commission structure is strange, to say the least. The commission is the same for the person who sells the product, and the person above him in the chain. This means those higher in the chain can simply live off the fruits of others labour. It encourages continuous selling until there is no one left to sell to.<br><br>I hope to draw  attention to such schemes as the amounts involved are not small and those who join later will definitely be left disappointed.<br><br>As such scheme proliferate, I hope the authorities can clarify what is legal and take action against any perpetrators who are engaged in illegal activities.<br><br><strong>Leow Zi Xiang </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F**k off<br><br>Let me tell you one thing<br><br>If you are James Phang, you should know when to stop this scheme of yours. And stop cheating so many people, enough already, with your schemes that started in Malaysia and now doing in SG!!<br><br>If you are just an agent whom I know, and surname starts with letter Y, I gonna go over your house and kick your butt. Wake up from your idea. Look what kind of monster you turned into. You are now so different from the boy I know many months ago. Many of your friends are freaking concerned for you. They said they gave up on you, but I know they still care. Whenever they talk about you, they are not talking in a backstabbing mood. They are freaking worried, and they tried not to show it. So I am begging you, please, leave that company before you get into big trouble. Nobody is your dream stealer, gonna take away your dreams or jealous of your achievement. And this is a hopeless dream at this point.<br><br>If you are just another agent of ntiparis, for hell sake think of these guys future. Having a record with police is NOT a joke. If you got a f**king heart, stop drawing people in.<br><br>And freaking stop this nonsense if you are not serious in debating. Why dont you emulate some of the forumnites , like timandra or songboz, who can view things from different perspectives even if they are an agent or pro-binary plan MLMers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Times Forum, Jan 1 2003<br><br><strong>Beware of hard-sell tactics</strong><br><br>I refer to Mr Leow Zixiang's letter, 'Dangers of multi-level marketing' (ST, Dec 30).<br><br>I was recently persuaded by a friend to go for a talk about a "business plan". It turned out to be a talk by an MLM company. Like Mr Leow, I was told it was the 'business plan', and not the product, that was important.<br><br>I succumbed to the pressure from the sales representatives and paid $864 to start three accounts and to buy some aromatheraphy products.<br><br>I was taught the methods they use to get prospective members to join the scheme, which include:<br><br>a) Never telling the 'prospect' that it is an MLM scheme. Just say it is a business plan.<br><br>b) Not letting the 'prospect' go home and 'think about it', as he is likely to have second thoughts.<br><br>I felt cheated as these tactics were used on me and I was now expected to use them on others.<br><br>I demanded a full refund but was told this was possible only if someone else come and took over my account.<br><br>I wish to alert the public about such hard-sell techniques. I advise those who are easily persuaded to stand their ground and join only when they thoroughly understand what the company is offering.<br><br><strong>Lim Jia Qing</strong></div>

Like him, I paid $864 for three accounts and I am sure that we fell prey to the same multi-level marketing (MLM) firm.<br><br>In one meeting I had with its representatives, the firm arranged for three people to turn up, evidently to try to intimidate me. They were willing to drive me to the nearest ATM at 1 am to make sure I did not back out.<br><br>A week later, when I asked for my money back due to financial difficulties, they laughed and said the only way out was to get someone to take my account.<br><br>I have since realised I have been cheated. Can I lodge a police report about it?<br><br>The start up cost in this scheme is unreasonable for the amount of products paid for. The aromatheraphy products are also not described clearly in presentations and on the company's website.<br><br>I hope the Direct Selling Association of SIngapore and the authorities will act against this firm. I have gone for talks by other more reputable MLM companies and I ams sure the one Mr Lim and I have been pressured into joining can be deemed illegal.<br><br>Lastly, I would like to appeal to all to be wary of this company, which has an expensive-looking flash website and claims international links. In fact, all it does is to emphasise recruitment.<br><br><strong>Lim Yan Ting (MS)</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Donkey Warriors, if your only defence of MLM (and NTI Paris, in particular) is to post one-liner sarcastic replies to this forum which are neither funny nor informational, then I would kindly suggest that you get lost from here, take your sarcasm with you, and close the door on your way out. And if you are indeed a NTI Paris, James Phang-worshipping, brainwashed agent, I'd also love to ram a red hot poker up your sorry ass. Who says civet cats are the only animals that needs to be culled?</div>
