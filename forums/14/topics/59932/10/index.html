            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I'm sorry for the long lapse in posting; it has been a rather busy week. I have been talking to several people regarding this NTI Paris issue, including a police officer. He has assured me that the police are looking into it, although I am beginning to worry about their difficulty in finding evidence of wrongdoing. Unless people within the company come forward and tell more about their company's practices. After all, laurence82 was right ... you cannot use a binary pyramid sketched on rough paper as evidence of fraud. Nonetheless, I have also talked to a friend who joined NTI Paris and urged him to get out of the scheme and report to CAD about it.<br><br>Having said that, I must also say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the large influx of posters in this forum after the New Year. I am even more surprised that some of these posters came from NTI Paris themselves. Kudos to them for seeing the light at last. It takes a lot of soul-searching to break away from the brainwashing that NTI Paris continuously dunks you in. I would also like to point out that ^lobang^'s posting "i actually join for onli 1 mth plus ... but i got back the $$$ i put in less than 1 mth...its effort tat counts..." clearly shows the problem with most agents in the company. Blinded by greed. It doesn't matter where or how the money comes from. As long as they get it. Yes, NTI Paris does earn, but as I have reiterated (and so has many others on the board), it comes from the people at the bottom of the binary pyramid. I make no distinction between the expansion factor here; whether it is a "binary" scheme or "ternary" or some other expansion factor, if the company makes money from recruiting more than product placement, it is still a pyramid scheme. And money comes from the poor sods at the bottom of the pyramid. So please, don't give me all the crap about the fault lying in the people and not the company. All this "double-speak" makes you as culpable as James Phang when it comes to swindling. Don't even dare compare yourself to McDonalds. At least they sell products, and they're not afraid to tell you what their products contain.<br><br>Most of all, it's the cult mentality of NTI Paris that deeply scares me. I cannot imagine how people in the company will take to the company crashing down to a shruddering halt when it is finally exposed. I agree with TroddenJaw ... step back and think a bit. Otherwise you're going to hurt yourself, and everyone around you. Will James Phang come by and whisper to your ear, "be strong, failure is the mother of all success" when that happens? Even if he does, are these motivational messages going to count for anything?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For songboz as promised.....<br><br>Straits Times, Dec 19 2003, Main, page 2<br><br><strong>Two years on, no sign of promised club</strong><br><br>A thousand people paid up to $3000 each for membership in a country club near Batam. Now plans for it are shelved.<br><br><strong>By Crystal Chan</strong><br><br>Two years ago, about 1000 people paid up to $3800 to be members of a planned country club on an Indonesian island next to Batam.<br><br>But after about $1.7 million was collected. the lease for the land fell through and plans for the club have been shelved.<br><br>Now, at least eight of them have asked the police and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) to help them get their money back for what was marketed as a Magic Kingdom by Singapore company NOP Investment.<br><br>It was to have been developed on 200 hectares in Rempang by PT Magic Kingdom, an Indonesian company, with NOP as a major investor. Rempang is linked to Batam by the Barelang Bridge.<br><br>The facilities promised include a hotel, a chalets, a golf course and even a 1000 sq m shopping mall. The club was to open its doors tentatively in July 2003.<br><br>However, on May 8 this year, NOP Investment called off the project, a company's senior official, who declined to be identified, told the Straits Times. But members were not informed of it and some found out the unpleasant truth only when they asked to visit the club.<br><br>They then also discovered the NOP was no longer operating from Lion Industrial Building in Arumugam Road, off Paya Lebar Road, when they were directed to an office in Shenton Way.<br><br>There, the company's senior official blamed the Sept 11 attacks in 2001, the Bali bombings in 2002 and the Iraq and Sars outbreaks this year for the project being aborted.<br><br>He said: "The Sars outbreak was the final straw. Some of the 700 members who paid the membership fee by instalments defaulted.<br><br>He said the company was unable to inform them of its decision because we needed to hire auditors to sort out the accounts and to seek legal advice.<br><br>He gave the assurance that the letters on the club's fate will be sent to members this month.<br><br>However, members like Mr Richard Tang are sceptical.<br><br>"They failed to inform us when they cancelled the project and moved their office without telling us. I dont think they will resolve it."<br><br>The 56 year old businessman, who paid the full $3800 membership fee, said an NOP saleman sold him the membership at his Chai Chee office. " I just signed the agreement without reading the contract thoroughly as I was busy," he said.<br><br>Others interviewed said they bought theirs at roadshows and after being approached by its sales agents.<br><br>Case received seven complaints between June and August this year.<br><br>It would mediate only if both parties seek its help, said executive director Seah Seng Choon. But he added: "The safer thing to do in such situation is to wait for the club to be set up and runnning."<br><br></div>
