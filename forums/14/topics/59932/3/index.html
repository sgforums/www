            <div class='col-md body'>Hiyah guys<br>about ntiparis,Elixir Dynamic and NOP (Number One Products),<br>I have been asking my contacts about these companies and here's what I found out.<br><br>Firstly,when I ask my friend who presented to me the marketing plan how long this company ntiparis has been running, he says 13 years.I was shocked as MLM is only legalised from year 2000. So I went check to it out, it was supposedly Elixir Dynamic which is running for 13 years.Maybe my friend got it wrong. Elixir Dynamic is also supposedly supplies the Lorenz aromatheraphy products for ntiparis and both are owned by James Phang.<br><br>Here are the questions I have on the origins of the company.<br><br>a) If Elixir Dynamic is owned by James Phang for 13 years, he should also be running NOP at the same time. Or he didnt? NOP was confirmed run by him during the 90s as a Single Level Marketing company. As to why it failed, its easy to guess.SLM is a marketing plan similar to a company hiring insurance agents or saleperson directly to handle sales for the company. It does not use the power of leverage like MLM, thus is not profitable in the long term. As to its products, they sell Buddha statues,crystal and other weird stuff as purported by this forum topic.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=2464" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=2464</a><br><br>This is the NOP website last time<br><br><a href="http://web.singnet.com.sg/~fchew/" rel="nofollow">http://web.singnet.com.sg/~fchew/</a><br><br>b) So we dont know how long Elixir Dynamic exist as a company or as how long it is owned by James Phang. Now, in KL, Malaysia, there are roughly 1000 direct sales,mlm,slm companies running there. One of the main problem of these companies is that the boss set up the first company, and after finding it no longer profitable,attempts to set up a second one, making the second one hot and profitable.But, the boss will then pump money from the second one into the main company, in order to revitalise it. One of the reason why most MLM companies dont work is because the boss attempts to find which company he owns is the most profitable.They do not focus on distributors welfare, and you will find them looking for the bottom line instead of channelling money to its distributors. Thats when the distributors suffers.<br><br>If you look at companies like Amway, Nuskin,  Herbalife,  etc, their management has only that one company and focus on that direct  selling business, increasing welfare and profits to its distributors.<br><br>Questions is,did Elixir Dynamic act as a supplier company to NOP or as a second company to James Phang? There is nothing wrong with ED supplying goods to NOP.Every company need its supplier if they are not the main manufacturer. And definitely nothing wrong with the supplier owned by the same boss.<br><br>c) Now,why NOP close down? It can be because SLM doesnt work anymore. According to the tsinoy.com link I provided, there are a lot of hush hush about NOP closing down. One source (Forgive me, I gotta disclose this) told me NOP faces lawsuits last time.This was told to the agents by James Phang himself. It was purported by some agents NOP was the best SLM?MLM company last time. I didnt know that.Neither does few 'lao jiaos' I talked to.<br><br>Worse news is,is NOP closed down as said, or changed to an investment unit as told to those agents? If NOP close down,its ok, But I am worried if it is run as an investment unit. It tells me that the boss is not focusing on ntiparis as main business.<br><br>d)Well, not all the agents are dancing to the same tune,I have another friend who works in nti since last year, but few people told me nti was operational few months back.So maybe there is an operational ready date and and an official opening date?<br><br>So these are the questions running in my head about the origins of NOP,Elixir Dynamic and ntiparis.Haha, onli if i can get into nti paris and listen in, then I wouldnt have so much questions.<br><br>Just hope people who encountered or is an agent of the company could give their views here.Who knows, I might be wrong.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Concerning binary plan,it does have its hybrid too.Imagine you have your network in a two by two system, meaning you have two person under you,and each in term have two people under them.<br><br>In another marketing plan, you could have many downlines under you (width and depth) as wide and deep as you want, but you could only earn few generations deep. Otherwise it is a pyramid.<br><br>Now in order from a binary plan to progress to  this matrix? plan (sorry I forgot what is it called), you gotta open up accounts, meaning you pay the company to enable you to have another network altogether, but also in binary way. Looking at your whole network altogether, your individual binary network look like the matrix network.<br><br>Now,I find this crap. Other company allow you to open your network as wide as you want FREE. Why would I need to pump money into the company in order for me to build another binary network, in the end my individual networks add up to look like a matrix one.<br><br>Second,to me it seems to defeat the purpose of binary, where ducks walk in two by two (hee hee just a pun).it is telling me your own binary network doesnt work, and you got to build it wider. But with 'investment into the company' , you could increase your width.See my point?<br><br>I heard this is applied in nti.Is it true? Plus I hope some binary expert (timandra, she is the one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) could provide us more insight into this.<br><br>Good morning to all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys,<br>this is urgent news! Now I have mentioned James Phang might have turned NOP into an investment unit, and running ntiparis at the same time. This just came in on Friday. Please read the ST article carefully.<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,226015,00.html<br><br>Many points I have noted.<br><br>1) One of the sgforumers confirmed NOP was used to be behind Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre in Arumugam Road. This NOP investment, according the ST report is also there. The victims were referred to an office in Shenton Way, voila, thats where ntiparis is<br><br>2) Many members were not informed of the cancelled projects, and offices were moved without informing members.<br><br>3) Many people were approached by saleman and in roadshows. Thought such mega project must be held at permanent exhibitions and company premises and the likes.<br><br>Hope professionals in this industry can comment on this.<br><br>Well, is this the beginning of the end?<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
