            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings all,<br><br>First of all, a very happy new year.<br><br>I realized that my very first posting on the subject was rather vehement, and could possibly seem as an overly emotional flaming of NTI Paris. I now clarify, however, that I am not tarring all MLM companies in a single brush stroke. I will concede that there are MLM companies which concerns as much about the products that they are selling as the customers they recruit, and that perhaps many of the posters on these message boards do belong to such companies.<br><br>That said, I am still very much against the marketing policies of NTI Paris (if they even deal with "marketing" in the first place). The spate of articles in the Straits Times forum page should be sufficient to prove my point. I would like to draw attention to the interesting fact that among the 4 letters, only 2 were accusatory. And both pointed to NTI Paris.<br><br>I disagree that Mr. Leow's Dec 30 article was a result of "lack of knowledge" in the plan. Many of his accusations are exactly the ones that my friend and I experienced in NTI Paris. It would also be naive to attribute such hard-sell tactics to a few rogue agents because it takes considerable effort from the ENTIRE company staff to organize and present the seminar. If NTI Paris started in July last year, and they still do not have the sales kits for their members six months later, can you blame me for being suspicious of their motives? If they follow the binary scheme, would they not experience an exponential growth in members? And there are no plans made for such an outcome? I don't think you can only point the finger at the "greedy agents." Quite simply, the way in which the employees conduct their businesses is a true reflection of the company strategy itself, the strategy formulated by oh-bow-down-to-cult-leader James Phang himself. I would also like to add that simply because a plan is legal in no way absolves the company of any crime if the methods of recruitment and product distribution are pyramidal in nature.<br><br>timandra has noted that ".. given such a painful lesson they (NTI Paris) learned for this few days, I'm sure they'll change their approach." Judging from the current behaviour of the company's agents, this may not be happening. My friend who invested an equally large sum of money tried to retract his investment, only to be told that he could not do so. (No surprises there) Furthermore, he was asked to continue with the hard-sell tactics used by NTI Paris agents on him to recruit more members into the fold and recoup his "losses." Nothing was mentioned about the advertisement and sale of aromatherapy products. Well, somebody please convince me that the aromatherapy products are not a front, albeit a rather exotic one, that hides the true nature of the company's dealings. I am not amused. Neither are the teenagers who have thrown in thousands of their/their parents' hard-earned money into the venture.<br><br>I would also like to point out that hellodoggy's earlier claim "time and especially his paycheck will show all" is not exactly correct. It is not how much you earn that counts, but how you earn that much that counts more. If a fat paycheck is indeed the overriding motive, then we might as well go into the drug industry. Similarly, I am furious with NTI Paris because when the entire scheme collapses around them (especially for the members who joined late), the people who fleeced the most wealth are the founders of the company, and not the ones who have been conned into investing later (such as our friends).<br><br>To laurence and tibrig, don't worry I won't sit by and watch the ship sink with my friends on it. I will be talking to a police officer friend tomorrow regarding the legality of the recruitment methods/scheme. I urge you not to sit and wait for things to happen too. I shall attempt not to be cliched, but only by our combined efforts will we bring down the scourge that is NTI Paris. And get your friends out of their mire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Dennis, while you mentioned that your earlier posting seemed to be overly vehement and flaming, it does not seem to lose any of its fire in the next post  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, I guess I need to clarify myself here. "Time and paycheck will show all" - here time refers to all things generic, such as the reputation, culture and other status aspects of the company. But most importantly, it is still the paycheck at the end of the day that matters. If a company does not have what it takes to ensure its distributors make money, it will never go far no matter its claims. Even if they have the most excellent products but distributors can't make money, there's really no point in joining in the first place, is there? And I personally think that it is rather immature to compare network marketing to the drug industry. Most join MLM because of money - does that mean they are corrupted?  If NtiParis were illegal, it would definitely be a matter of short notice before they would be forced to shut down...and I guess they wouldn't be in the papers so publicly.<br><br>I have gone down to NTIparis before, but only a brief while...my friend who brought me there told me the company was only 3 months old...making it 5 months old to date. While I found the presentation clear, I did not join as I thought they did not have sufficient credentials on the product. There were no hard sell tactics whatsoever, in fact they actually let me go back home to analyse and consider, which impressed me as this was a far cry from the doings of AMH.<br><br>As far as I can gather, there are different groups in Nti (perhaps due to their rushed startup) and therefore different sub-cultures too. I believe your impression of Ntiparis, as well as the impressions of those writing to the papers were tarnished because of some black sheep in the company. But then again, which company doesn't? Still, let's not base the company's reputation on just a few of its ill distributors. All I can say is, NtiParis will only start to grow when it has a more dominant ethical culture and better product credentials. In the meantime, those who adopt lousy ethics and hard-sell tactics will meet their own doom.<br><br>Myself, I will lay off MLM for some time...Singapore does not seem to have a really good MLM company that can go far...cheers   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am NTI..i have been through alot of MLM companies.(does mean i join all) they all usually used the same tactic.... did they actually talk more abt their product or their compensation plan? to them "money" always come from.. MOney is the root of all evil...this create alot of black sheeps who are blinded with that..As a networker, product is truely very important to me... without product the company eat wat.? am i rite? i have done alot of research about NTIparis... especially on the questionable product that they put it on display...<br><br>As you aromatherapy is quite "New" to us, how much do you really know abt it..? some will say.. after smelling it...it will create miracles for you.... in fact, essential oil is more effective than other herbal products... let me go in further detail<br><br>Let quote a example, there is two different of lavender... lavendin and lavender... lavendin is a cheapo lavender which grew faster and taller than the true lavender... as for best lavender, it can onli by found in France...the soil condition is ideal to produce the finest lavender than other place of the earth.. what u normally see in the market now..are Lavendin.. which is cheap and have the same smell.. for ur information..., it takes about 100 lavendin to make into one pound of essential oil... as for the true lavender... it take abt 4000 lavender to make into one pound essential oil...which have more medical value compare to lavendin... Would u mind paying more for the real one?<br><br>Another thing, the NTI bottle seems like any other cheapo stuff that you can find in pasar malan..it take a certain kind of glass material to make into a one good one... the burner and the glass is very important to ensure the prolong life... why i say that... to have a good bottle to hold the flammable essential oil... it is true that the essential oil provided has a mixed of alcohol tat help the rate of diffusion.. As alcohol is very flammable..we need a bottle that can withstand high temperature of burning and leaking probs..the bottle also serve other purpose..is it able to withstand the heat from the sun.. you know that glass can easy reflect rays into the bottle... it might cause an explosion anytime.. if you have tat bottle now, do yourself a little experiment... try to put in the sun... see what happens..gif it a try if have doubts about it...<br><br>i am onli crazy person in NTI tat is willing to try tat... ahaa... i am once a science student.... i learn the information from a Doctor of mine...believe it is up to you..<br><br>i was like you, is this scam? Scam? Questions? i am a distributor in Nuskin... i was told tat i can refund 90% of my product... in the end i get less than tat... is it a SCAM....? the package worth more than a thousand..!<br><br>Black Sheeps are everywhere in the corner...i have to live with it..! i know most of the ppl in NTI dun have much knowledge about aromatherapy, just like all of you hear.. if i dun writte wat i know, you all will think aromatherapy is smelling medicine...HAA..i wun blame you...<br><br>i feel that binary system is onli way to help my ppl under me...maybe it looks like a pyramid...other ppl in the company may portary that kind of image to you..because of their ignorance and no knowledge abt what they are selling...<br><br>anyway, it onli worth $288... why not to do something different from the rest? you will eventually reap what u sow... Experience is the thing that you can get...As for me... everything new... is having a good experience is the first priority for me.. anyway i am just like most of you all here... still studying...<br><br>Keep soo many money in your bank, doesnt get to somewhere to desire to be... you are onli a slave for the bank... working hard to pump soo many hard earned money to the bank every month... and you onli get a pathetic 1% or maybe less than tat... Ask yourself, are u really worth tat much...? or  can youreally do or learn something tat money cant buy? ..To me, banks are just like another other MLM companies with a full refund policy...no special difference to distinguish btw them...<br><br>type soo much liao...anything abt aromatherapy or business opportunity... i more than willingly to share with you.... email me..irish_crappo@yahoo.com<br><br>ENjoy whatever you like! what other ppl think abt you is none of your business! wat u think abt yourself is important in no matter you do!<br></div>

He said nope, should be shorter than that.<br><br>Not to be mean, I urge all ntiparis agents to self reflect and to read ST. Why read ST? Seems none of my ntiparis friends read papers, and my contact explained that they are probabaly too busy earning money. Haha, ok enough of mean jokes.<br><br>Hope to hear from DennisLam soon, and sigh just wish this will be over with.<br><br></div>

I could accuse someone of something but until he is found guilty, I wouldn't draw conclusions as yet. Maybe I think since that laurence82 is so negative about this company, I think that you should look for the police and inform us of your updates.<br><br>Did some research (hope I can call it that) and found that the actual boss of Nti is not james phang, rather it's someone called david, their executive director. He's the one running the show...so I think it's inconclusive to link nti to NOP since different people...james phang is there more as a speaker<br><br>well that's what I know so far.
