            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm all ears for reason but apparently your over dose of emotions-if that's what they call profanities nowadays-has exhibited your zeal and that raises one big question, is this the way you voice your doubts? If so, i really ponder about how you present yourself to your clients or could it be that your whatever shrine of a company teaches you to do it this way?<br><br>Something that struck me strange about this company is that they do not possess any documents about their products which they suggest you must pay first so that you can attest for it's quality which is their form of advertisement. But the oddity is that they insist on not selling the product but instead selling this 'strange alien business' concept which they cannot put into words. The one who presented his case said this :<br><br>Me : What Business Concept are you talking about?<br><br>Priest : Business Concept LAH!<br><br>Wow! I must profess that the details are so intricately fine one will find it amazing! Anyway, why is it that clients or should i say potential worshippers must go down to the COMPANY for the presentations? I mean if this is to show off the cathedral, sorry amigo it didn't work for me. But anyway, I think that a coffee stop would suffice for that kinda stuff.<br><br>One more thing, what's wrong with the other colours? Why is it only black suits? Mourning the loss of something?<br><br>Once again, I'm looking forward to the forthcoming posts especially that of a certain uncouth and crude person i shall not insinuate any further.<br><br>Btw, wilsonz are u with NTI?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi  aswanderers,<br><br>You wrote very well about what you think of NTI and also how you appreciate WBG education and culture system but have you ever thought it also applies to yourself as for what you think of NTI distributors. I have studied WBG for more than 2 years.<br><br>a) I know they use an education and culture system to camourflouge the whole pyramid scam, yes I consider WBG a big pyramid scam for some reasons below. Nowadays most MLM that do not sell value for money products will  use "culture".<br><br>b) The first few food supplements that WBG sells do NOT show their manufacturer names on the label !! They will tell you that was because of "trade and technology secrets". This is bullshit !! They will tell you the ingredients, the technology, the manufacturing are all from 3 different countries around the world but packed in Singapore. It only showed that the stuffs are not reliable !!<br><br>c) Later when less people believe in the heathfood, they brought in negative ions bed pads. Mind you, those electrical bed pads do as much bad to your body as it can do good and the cost is very very cheap, it's just an electric wire that does the effect, nothing else.  A good bed pad that can produce negative ions effect do NOT need electricity now, and can do the same demonstration effect for the cigarettes, lemon juice, sauce, etc. Live electricity is no good for the body ! Their selling price are very very cheap in Korea too.<br><br>d) The "body stretching" was a trick many companies used before, you don't need anything to do that trick. By using such trick, you know the integrity of the Company and the people behind it. Using tricks don't last, Asayo used that trick many years ago, where are they now ?<br><br>e) Late last year, WBG made a big hoohaa opening in Malaysia but now, they claim that they have been "cheated" by others on the direct-selling license for having bought a fake one ! In the first place, many see it as a trick again. Why in the first place they don't apply for a legitimate license themselves ? Some say the actual fact was the government suspended their busines on the products background. They gave the "fake license" excuse to the distributors.<br><br>Please ask your top management this : whether it was true that 2 of their items are manufactured in Malaysia by this scoundrel by the name of Steven Lai(his GMP factory was suspended and closed due to manufacturing products same as the "slimten" 2 years plus ago. Apparently, WBG now claims that their license in Malaysia was "arranged" by this Steven Lai and cheated by him. Well, I will say they are both crooks !<br><br>Well, i think the above are enough to make you or anyone consider carefully on this company. I suggest you do not put do much effort. I have seen many of their earlier distributors earning themselves very bad image and reputation from friends.<br></div>

Besides minus ions, they  also have bio-magnetism, BAE(bio-activated energy) and FIR, using the lates NANOtechnolgy.<br><br>There  will be participating in the Holistic living spring festival at Fort Canning Centre (8-9 May 10am ~ 9pm) featuring healthcare products and methods with over more than 60 stalls participating.There are also free workshops and performances.<br><br>HEALTHWISE will be participating at stall 22.

All companies have their legal backing but it does not include whether are they legal in MLM system or pyramid system. It also does not include how they run their own company and ethnics.<br><br>You can call Lee&amp; Lee to check what are the services they provide to NTI. For your info, most companies using this company will also inform you that it's a legal company related to Senior Minister Mr Lee K.Y.<br><br>However, this does not mean that the system or company culture, etc is legal or acceptable.  For example, company A started and use the service and legal advices from them, however, what is happening in the company does not concern them, unless something happened or they get into some legal problems.<br><br>I hope dis helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Direct Selling is only one of the network marketing models.<br><br>2) I'm in netural position. No one is perfect, i guess the only debate here is in which point of view do you look at? Do you just sell? recruit? Hard closing? Doing a salesman biz? or really doing a biz?<br>For consumer, nothing is cheap as they will want things to get cheaper, while on the other point of view, if you are doing a biz, you have your basic expenses to cover.<br><br>3) I believed you are fair and wanted to voice out. For me, I think some of them have been in it and while some of them are experienced MLM people, therefore they see it from point of view. Maybe can we stated that if someone tell you that selling luo han fish is nt a gd biz, will you care to look from their own point of view or will you still insist that yours is correct?<br><br>4) You got to know the person and from not just what he said but from all areas to understand. No one will say bad things of himself, right? Maybe look at the history. It'll be fair. Don't you think so?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

I thought he was telling me a joke, but he looked so serious, i jus had to laugh..it's so damn hilarious when fools make such definitive statements..And if NTI helps him to be a PM, i guess i will set up a MLM company now and i can be the President of the US!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MLM is legal 'cept they call it Network Marketing bcos MLM sounds like a darn pyramid. Anyway, MLM is legalise but it borderlines on the Pyramid/MLM. And the companies that does MLM are covering the loopholes.<br><br>Like this money back in 60 days, it's not a pyramid because u can get refunded. Pyramid schemes have no refunds. But MLM companies are looking so nasty cos they dun talk abt their products and items. they just go on and on abt the amt of cash you will earn.<br><br>I went to NTI twice, was damn turned off cos each time I went  the presenter was telling abt planning for the future and how pathetic i will earn if i dun join MLM. And thru out the whole aimless beating the bush session i din even had a glimpse of the product. How convincing can that bloody be?!??!!</div>
