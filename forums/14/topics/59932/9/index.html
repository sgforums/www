If i'm not wrong, The nti agent paid for u to open acc first rite? then after that when u earn money then u have to pay them back...

My firend who knows about scams offer to help me check out. He said he would ask the agent to help him pay for his account first as "he had no money".<br>If the agent offers to help pay first, then the scheme is dubious.<br><br>Now honestly, I have not gotten out of my friend what is the reasoning behind this. Doesnt mean any agent of any company offers to pay for first account has dubious scheme, just that only my friend would have an answer to why he would employ this method.<br><br>Surprisingly, stevie wonder also mention this phenomena, along many other I had been thinking about and tried to reason out for myself the casue behind these.</div>

So u dream for a while. Then they grab a peice of paper and show u how ur money can grow by geometric progression to obscene sums if only u will join them. Except that they forgot to tell u the no of pple needed to join under u grows by the same geometirc progression too. So after just 22 levels everyone in singapore including LKY n the expatriates would have join too.<br><br>Shortly after they've siphoned away ur money, their hu2 li2 wei3 ba1 start to show.<br><br>"Psst... u r new to this ya noe... so dun go around tell ur fren that we r mlm company... else they all scared will run away... u noe lah a few years back got some pyramid scheme company, make us mlm company lose reputation... so if u tell pple we mlm u surely cannot get anybody to join... so u tell them u have a special business opportunity for them... a new type of e-biz thing... if they still not convinced u can tell them (a certain reputable bank) is providing our e-banking services... but remember dun tell them too much cos u still new mah, so may tell them wrong info..."<br><br>So i went home feeling kinda wierd. If u r really so good then why u wanna hide info from potential agents? Nevertheless being a good agent i must spread the gospel and get my frens to grab this exciting opportunity and make $$$ b4 it slips away, even though i'm beginning to have doubts. So being unconvinced myself,i tried to convinve a camp mate to join the organisation. I'm thankful i didn't sound confidant at all, cos my fren asked me many qns and i eventually spilled the beans. He told me the products sounded familiar and brought in the same product to show me on the next bookin.<br><br>"Yup, that's the aromatherpy thingy. How much u got it for hah?"<br><br>"This is my uncle one. He got it for about $120 but i not sure where he got it"<br><br>I coughed up $288 for that thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Nevermind. Let's give nti a chance. So i went to attend a ceremony to reward all those agents that have done well, prior to which i joined a sharing session with some lao jiaos.<br><br>"When somebody asks u a qns, u must answer him in the most unexpected way... for example he asks, 'Will the company collapse or not?' u dun answer him no. instead u ask him back, 'Will microsoft collapse or not?' Then he will be taken aback and u can continue on... The most important thing is to make sure u answer him in unexpected manners n keep talking so he will feel confused n gong gong... once u can get him down to our office, we will surely be able to get him to join..."<br><br>I listened in disbelief.<br><br>Anyway, we all trudged into a room to attend the ceremony soon afterwards. The ceremony make the top agents seem like heroes and the host will keep asking the audience "ta1 men2 shuai4 bu4 shuai4 ya1?" n the audience will echo loud loud "shuai4!!!" (btw the pple there seems to have a fetish for mandarin. somehow it's their official language...)<br><br>What's more, the hero frenzy is fed by bright n colourful lights, loud music and NTI anthem(??!!) MTV. Seems like somebody still remembers Hitler's propaganda minister Josef Geobbel favourite trick in the 30s is torchlight procession. Sick.<br><br>Not to say that pple have been forced or tricked into joining the alliance, but the agents themselves r so thoroughly brainwashed they dun what they r doing. All day long they can only dream of how to get more pple to join their club, yet never a second to think of how to sell the products. I seriously wonder if any of the agents actually sold the product at $288.<br><br>Now u noe where all ur $$$ come from? Look down ur line. ALL ur $$$ comes from those pple below u who have paid their $288 worth of share. Logic will tell u someday this cannot continue and someone down ur line will be stuck with $288 product that is only worth $120 and there's noway he can recoup his losses cos there's just no one left to recruit. Simple maths will tell u just how big this pool of losers will be. But who cares? u've made ur $$$.<br><br>And about the macdonald thing. They r not only mad about getting pple to open up more franchise, they r also mad about advertising their products and getting pple to eat their burgers. N pple have to eat everyday. Do YOU use aromatherapy everyday? Even if u do, will u pay $288 to buy a kit n $50 every week for a bottle of essential oil?<br><br>Just wanna urge all nti agents to step back and think a bit. Stop all these nonsense</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing i would like to share with u all... I got one friend of mine who had joined nti for the past one month. She told me this company is really very good. The agent always give inspirations &amp; quotes which will boast her confident. hahaha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Which i think is full of rubbish! &amp; more like a brainwashed session. The worst part is whenever there is any occasion like, members birthday or watever... the agent will said something like "Think of wat u have done in the past then... blah blah... " and those members around there will become emotional and some will even cry!!!! can u imagine that??!! Wah... I'm wondering did the company practise cult??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

At least "vamoose" is enough. But the damages done, kaoz, onli if people will realise the magnitude of this problem. In many areas, it is much more sophiscated than many dubious schemes I have seen. With James Phang experience for many years in Malaysia and Taiwan, its no wonder. For this I am giving JP a salute man.<br><br>For me, I am worried about the aftermath. Two things, what would happen to my friends who invested much money, time and effort? The zealousness of this company agents are unbelievable. Imagine for yourself after climbing so high, then you fall. When I decided to venture into MLM, my friend whom I mentioned was once in commodities scam before told me "Laurence, I will support you in this venture, but if anything happens, rest assured I would be there to catch you if you fall." This comes from a man who has seen the horrors of the real world.<br><br>Second, would the agents continue in their self denial, reluctance to accept the truth, and continued path of "destruction" even after the company collapse?. My friend disuaded me from going to talk to these guys. "Laurence, you can put your facts right in front of their face, and they wont accept it. They have earned money, and that is for them the "proof" the company works. They cannot accept the truth." One interesting facet of human behaviour psychologist trying to unravel. i am already scared by the sudden changeover in my friends. Sometime I want to ask them, hey are you really XYZ? They have shown so much negative changeover, that people around them are alarmed. Most of all, what will happen after this saga? Will I regain their friendship, or will they be in self denial? Like denying JP at faults, but rather the work of other jealous companies? Denying they have been conned?<br><br>Sigh....hope everyone of us will think about this.<br><br></div>
