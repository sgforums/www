            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all..<br><br>it come to my attention two things. Many ex agents and customers actively seeking refunds. Some are successful, and one did an out of court settlements. And its common, even in this forum, that ntiparis claimed to have Lee &amp; Lee as a backing. So far, no proof in this.<br><br>However, any request for help from me will be redirected to another person who can help you better. He is more experienced in seeking refunds from nti.<br><br>Second thing, which makes me really laff when i saw it, and it also happened to one of our forumers. It is the fact that many do not know how the laws operate in Singapore. Firstly, everyone has equal right as guaranteed under the law, meaning, no one order the other guy around.<br><br>i have heard of stories, and recently in one of the blogs, I have seen demented nti agents demanding a) apologies for any misstatement made upon them b) demand or pressure  people sign up for their schemes c) people who made such statements be courageous, moralistic blah blah blah...<br><br>Again, may i inform the public at large they cannot do such things.<br><br>Second thing is, thinking they owned the world, they try to scare everyone who is clueless about the law that they can sue for defamation. Again, the process to qualify something as defamation is tedious, and that you will be equally liable if you threaten legal rights without substance or action, especially if you are trying to scare people off.<br><br>Anyhow, if they have legal backing, why the out of court settlements with one guy who tries to get refunds through his lawyers?<br><br>Again, hope those who seek refunds get it back.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After seeing many posts and topics, i realise one very common point...<br><br>many people seem to join a particular company by comparing the marketing plan and the ease of how easy it is to make money from it at many times is the geez of the topic.<br><br>Personally, i feel that the bottom line should be that everyone should ask himself this question: If you are not doing the business, will YOU yourself still keep on using the product?<br><br>If yes, i feel that the sincerity to share the opportunity is more credible. This is due to the fact that he/she is sharing the chance for another person to use a product that will benefit him/her first and as a result, gain monetarily as the reward. (Like what Brian Tracy call this business, WORD OF MOUTH business)<br><br>If No, then i believe the stability of the organization is at risk. As the whole group is built on riding on the marketing plan, anyone will simply lose his whole group when another plan that pays better comes onto the market.<br><br>Why not just choose a company with a product or services you will always use, and the company pays reasonably and punctually. There will be no pressure on anyone then.. right? The problem is that many networkers work too hard to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>convince</strong></span> people, and not to simply <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">expose/educate </span></strong>people about the opportunity .</div>
