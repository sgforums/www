Alot of the people there are friggin brain washed..<br>The woman i love most is into it and can u imagine how i feel??? She throws in 24/7 at the company, and ever since i provided her another perspective of her company, she actually said a numberr of nasty things abt me.. Her only friends now are those at the MLM comp, all her frens are avoiding her coz she rants on and on abt MLM and when she asks her ex-frens out, they decline for they fear she's gonna sell them or rather recruit them.. I'm losing the one person dearest to me, and each day passes as we drift further and further..I cant do anything at all coz the only sounds she hears are those of her team...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I have a couple of friends that have been asking me into NTI too.<br><br>But from the website, i somehow feel that its a binary style of MLM. Yet if they follow the real binary style, I guess that company may survive. Yet this company is only 1 yr old. Is it really that stable? No doubt new companies will go all out and have full potential yet there still may have flaws. To see whether a company is stable, we must see whther the plan is able to survive for 3 yrs 1st. From their site, they said they have just recently open Indonesia Market, but its not that easy to survive there.<br><br>Plus does NTI have patern in their product? If not, it will be like "pai du mei yan bao". This product origin from NOP, and it was sold at a very high price. yet after a while one company took over and sell at a cheaper rate from 90 to 60. What a big difference.<br><br>I am confident that NTI has relations with NOP since I have the people inside saying that their high position personnel is from NOP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just my PERSONAL OPINION.<br>Please forgive me, if I ever say something wrong and offended anyone of you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers</div>
