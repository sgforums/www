            <div class='col-md body'>Binary systems, are mostly for heavy-hitters, and top-notch sales people who can sell others on the plan and not the busines/products itself. Network Marketing should be about selling/marketing quality products directly to consumers and receiving compensation for the sale and not the recruiting of a new rep.<br><br>Network Marketing is one of the most viable ways to make much more than a good living and there are plenty of good companies out their that really sell quality products at good prices. If you can find a company that has a consumable product that people need and can use every day or month then you may have a company with a strong basis for being run as an MLM/Network Marketing company. However, you will then have to look at the company's structure, its compplan and determine if the company have a duplicatable marketing system. These are some of the necessary aspects to consider when looking for a good MLM company.<br><br>The binary system is not good in my book, I say this because the average person may find it very hard or nearly impossible for them to succeed in such a business venture.<br><br>More on this later.....<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by timandra:<br><strong>Greetings, the below info is meant for those who can see the potential of MLM as a legitimate business/ marketing strategy.<br><br>The conversation regarding the compensation plan of ntiparis spurred my interest to participate again. :p<br><br>Hmmm... As of today, from my own personal knowledge, there's currently 4 main compensation plans in the industry. 1) Stairstep Breakaway 2) Matrix 3) Unilevel 4) Binary (latest compared to the previous 3). Each of these individual plans has their pros and cons. But since the emphasis is on Binary Plan, allow me to share my 2 cents worth.<br><br>One of the common misunderstandings revolving around Binary Plan is that it's a money game, get rich quick scheme that should be avoided at all costs, by any networkers. I must confess that I had that perception before, but after reading through some books and mags, it brought a whole new insight to my belief system. Also, the misunderstanding was brought about by many unscrupulous companies that employed the explosive growth of the Binary Plan in the past. To the extent of overpaying to distributors that ultimately results in the closure of such companies... This sure sounds like a pyramid scheme!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>If anybody wants to realise the benefits of Binary, you must look at it from a neutral point of view without any bias tendency towards other plans. One unique aspect about Binary plan is that it focus on 2, no more or less, income centres as your frontline. Which is beneficial if you were to take into account the amount of focus you can employ, thereby improving your effectiveness, as compared to other plans which recommend more frontlines eg 3 and more at one time. Also, commission will only be rewarded if one can balance the volume their 2 income centres. Let's say for eg, my LH group achieved $1000 sales volume, RH group $500, I'll not get anything if the company commission payout is at $1k. Until my RH group can achieve the remaining sum. It propels the upline to focus on helping the weaker side.<br><br>Other than that, additional sales volume, sponsoring performed by the upline group MUST be added down the list. So those along the line will benefit together from it. Profits are shared among them. Hardly noticeable in other plans, whereby , upline sales volume will normally be absorbed by he, himself. That's when one WILL see EXPLOSIVE growth in their group, thereby giving Binary plan the bad name of money game... Also, there's no Breakaway from the group! Which is beneficial for many networkers who often have a hard time of re-establishing a new group all over again.<br><br>However, some cons include no max. cap for the amount one income centre can earn. Some Binary companies employ the tatic of grossly exaggerated figures one can earn with no limits! Please be careful then, because based on figures, it will shutdown in a few months time.. Reason? Over payout of more than 100%. Imagine monthly turnover to be $1k but commission payout of 1.2k... So legitimate Binary [b]MUST</strong> include a max cap. Also, some companies practises flushing of unbalanced sales volume. From previous eg. 1k &amp; 0.5k will be flushed if you can't balance it!! A good Binary company MUST safeguard against this. Another point to note for any plans is the safeguarding against extreme front loading!! I've heard of many 'reputable' companies asking new distributors to pump in thousands of dollars for the inital investment... *faint*<br><br>One more thing to note is the accountability of people, because of the explosive growth, it makes accountability of uplines and downlines confusing... Imagine I bring in a friend but he's placed 10 levels below me.. That's when you must find a good company that employs a good system! A good MLM company should employ such a system whereby your presense is not absolutely essential of the success of your group! Talk about time freedom.<br><br>Reason why Binary looks like a pyramid because of the idealogy of income centres being added down the group. Also because of it's explosive growth since 2 is the max for frontline directs. But please bear in mind that income centres MUST also include sales volume, not solely on sponsoring! Which means there must also be sales/ customers etc. Guess those people whom some of you met dunno what they're saying, if not careful, they'll have authorities coming after them. However, this is something very contradicting, because MLM is a business, in which sales should be accomplished without door to door retail sales. If people focus solely on looking for customers, they're just doing direct selling &amp; not employing the power of leverage... if they focus solely on sponsoring, it's pyramid...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> a balance is the best from my point of view of cos.. I guess it's safe to say that the people you all met merely meant personal sales is minimised but not totally eliminated.<br><br>Binary can fulfil much explosive growth as compared to other plans, but the ideology is the same. The same amount of effort applies! Not just because it employs a different concept, it should be 'condemned' by many networkers alike.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  If you do look at it carefully, the emphasis meant growing 'deep', unlike other plans which go 'wide', as to which is better, I leave it to individuals to decide!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Also for information, we do have a reputable local Binary company doing well! Heard of WBG?? it has already internationalise to korea, australia, japan, and the regional countries within 2 years!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Guess this plan is not that bad after all lah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Also, haha, guess I can never end... due to this new wave in network marketing, more hybrid plans (combination of 2 of more plans etc) are coming out, so be amazed by what the future can behold! Be expected to see even more exponential growth for the same amount of effort one may be putting in! The power of evolution! So let's keep an open mind <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Would love to share about other plans if I have the time... Haha. And please, I come in peace so no flaming... turns people off.. Also hope that this topic is unlike those topics about other networking companies... plenty of flaming.. we're doing quite fine till now. Till then! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Any queries, just private msg me.[/b]</blockquote></div>

Up till then, I had not pointed or accuse anything at you. Then you started this stuff about "me in another company, and having hinting that I have vested interest to see ntiparis down so I can profit"<br><br>Defensive being one thing, coz a scam is a scam. You can flog me whole day on having biasness, vested interest suspicions of this and that. Why are you doing this to me? I devoted one post only to reply and comment on your personal attacks, while you have devoted few long posts which keep implying various suspicions. Trying to bring down the integrity of my posts by cleverly pointing out suspicions of my own personal self than my points of argument?<br><br>I called timandra a she, coz her name implies, just as in other forums I made mistake on people gender based on nickname. You want to imply suspicions based on this? I started nti posts, but since ghost started one, might as well continue here. You want to imply more suspicions based on this too? And also try to be defensive of your own integrity by "other guys keep out of it, I only attack laurence82 only? read your posts, if you have come up with facts for ntiparis fine. But all your posts keep hinting suspicions on myself, and when I defended, called me defensive.<br><br>My whole life, I avoided clever people like yourself coz I am seriously afraid of you. Yes you. I am afraid of you. Why? Gals can actually do this better at noting the cleverness of people and the damage they bring. Its called intuition, and also from experience. Basically, yes you are quick enough to imagine several suspicious facts based on my posts. But they are not true. And you continue hinting that me keeping secrets such as my own company, my sources and stuff. Why dont you also question other people sources of info. Why am I afraid of you, coz your ingenuity is making you trying to break me down, layer by layer. How much I know wouldnt convince you, and you keep going on and on, while I just posts some articles. you continue doing this.....<br><br>Therefore I must beg you, seriously, what you really want? What do you want me to do? Must I go down on my knees to beg you, please stop buggering me. This is SERIOUS. I am begging you now to let me off. You want me to go to you and beg you to stop bugging me.Fine. Just let me off.<br><br></div></blockquote>Upz!! ooh ooh ooh!</div>
