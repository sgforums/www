            <div class='col-md body'>Yup. those who read the latest news yesterday.<br><br>The New Paper - 06 Mar 2004<br><br><strong>THE OFF-BATAM CLUB THAT NEVER GOT BUILT </strong><br><br>First money, now people gone... like magic<br><br>By Arul John<br><br>HE eager civil servant thought it was a good deal.<br>For around $3,800, Mr Edmund Chua, 28, could join a country club near Singapore with its own marina.<br><br>As he dreamt of owning his own yacht someday, he thought the proposed PT Magic Kingdom Island Resort Paradise (PTP) would be perfect for him and his homemaker wife.<br><br>But his dream club on an island near Batam never materialised.<br><br>The developers, PT Magic Kingdom (PTM), dropped the project, he learnt last year.<br><br>By then he had already paid more than $3,000 in instalments.<br><br>He has little hope of getting his money back as the firm that promoted PTP is nearly bankrupt.<br><br>HE DIDN'T TELL HIS WIFE<br><br>Mr Chua's wife of three years does not know of his predicament and he is the sole breadwinner earning $3,000 a month.<br><br>He did not tell her about the club, hoping to surprise her by taking her there one day.<br><br>He learnt about the club in October 2001 at a roadshow in Suntec City. The club was to have its own golf course, shopping mall, sea-sports club and jackpot rooms.<br><br>Besides the $3,800 membership fee, he only had to pay a monthly subscription of $15.<br><br>In November 2001, he signed up as a member, paid $400 up front and had the balance deducted in monthly instalments of $170 payable to PTP through his credit card. Every month, he received receipts from NOP Investments (NOPI), the club's marketing agents, for the deductions.<br><br>But last June, he checked his credit card statement and found no deductions made since April 2003.<br><br>He called NOPI and was told the project had stopped development since May 2003. He was then given an appointment to meet one of NOPI's managers, Mr Bob Lim.<br><br>He said: 'In June or July last year, I and about four other members met Mr Lim and his secretary, Ms Jenny Chan, at an office opposite Lau Pa Sat. He said the PTP project failed because of the poor world financial situation since Sep 11, 2001, the Bali bombings on Oct 12, 2002 and the Sars outbreak last year.<br><br>'When another member asked why the members were not informed of these problems earlier, Mr Lim said NOPI did not do so for fear of a panic and because they wanted to wait for the audit results before making an official announcement.'<br><br>When Mr Chua, who paid $3,120 for the club membership, called Mr Lim last November, he was told the audit was still on.<br><br>NO MORE WORD FROM NOPI<br><br>Mr Chua said he had called Mr Lim and Ms Chan at least 10 more times but could never get through.In late January, he went to the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) for help to recover his money, but was told his chances were slim as NOPI had filed for insolvency.<br><br>He was advised to make a claim through the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT), but has not yet done so because of his work schedule.<br><br>He said one of the four other members went to see the police but was told it was a civil matter and referred to Case instead.<br><br>Construction firm director Don Ang, in his 40s, would only say he had paid 'not much' for the club membership so far. A friend is trying to help him get his money back.<br><br>Mr Chua still dreams of a place to berth his dream yacht and practise his golf swing.<br><br>'But this time, I will make sure the club is up and running before I buy a membership.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>CLUB WOES<br><br>About 1,000 Singaporeans paid about $3,800 each in 2001 to join the club, according to<br>The Straits Times. The club was supposed to be built on Rempang, an Indonesian island linked to Batam by a bridge, and start operations last July.<br><br>But NOP Investments (NOPI), the marketing agents appointed by the Indonesian developers, called off the project last May.<br><br>A Case spokesman said seven investors had complained to them so far. He added it would be hard for them to get back their money since NOPI had filed for insolvency.<br><br>When contacted by The New Paper, Mr Bob Lim of NOPI declined to comment.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

Won't say anything to convince you. Just visit us at (   www.lifestyles.net    )  You guys seem to know the business.... you decide.  We don't have a single distributor in singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all... i'm new to the forum but this thread just happened to catch my eye, especially the portions on NTI, james phang and NOP.<br><br>i'm a distributor with NTI now and would like to offer opinions coming from someone 'inside'... actually I'm not exactly sure that NTI was started by james phang to recoup losses from NOP, because the payout percentage is really pretty high.<br><br>And yes, i do admit that due to the high payout percentage, the company is unstable and is in danger of folding up. That was something that I was very concerned about as well when deciding whether to join the company.<br><br>However, the reason why I finally decided to join NTI was based on the scale as follows:<br><br>|-------------------|<br>Stability         Opportunity<br><br>On one end of the spectrum, you have stability, with very established companies at the forefront (won't mention names here since the topic's on NTI). On the other end, you have opportunity, with new and upcoming companies going all out to achieve results.<br><br>I chose NTI due to the opportunity provided, with a compromise in stability. A company cannot provide stability and opportunity at the same time - it's either one or the other. Well, it all depends on what you look for in a company.<br><br>As for the NOP ruckus, let's just say I couldn't be bothered to find out. Today, a hinder to many people's progress is that they cannot afford to put the past behind and look forward. Maybe it's a generalisation or a sweeping statement on my part, but that's just my 2 cents worth. I want to look ahead and see what NTI can provide me with, not look back at the past and criticise mistakes or wrongdoings.<br><br>Cheers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You guys know what, i was approached by NTI agents 2 weeks back and they are like mosquitoes to used sanitary napkins, they were pretty aggresive into getting me to join, but i declined due to the fact that there were serveral grey areas that were vague and they were VERY VERY evasive when questioned about validity. Nevertheless, i gave the parting statement of 'considering their proposal' which i did and there was somehing that was bugging me that this facade this company is using is pretty fishy, some nagging feeling that something's amiss. Anyway, i stumbled upon this forum that was discussing this topic and i found the one word that nailed the comapny agents "Brainwashed". The personels are amazingly or rather grossly attached to their founder and their so called mentors. Their attitudes were almost cult-like and perhaps even genuflective and it's weird that it is of this way, even to the point that it's scary.Some of my friends who were inducted behaved in this manner that i have to avoid them.<br>I reckon this will spark a controversial row over the loyal members or their 'priest' and 'priestess'. Jees, i guess they can award James Phang for matyrdom if he is ever hanged or convicted.<br>Anyway, I believe that someday somehow the appropriate authorities will catch a whiff of this sickening stench and come up with suitable measures to end this abomination.<br>Well, that's my thoughts and i believe members of the James Phang clergy will react with expected reactions.<br><br>"First they ignore us, then they laugh at us and finally they listen to us "<br>Mohandas Karamchand Ghandi</div>
