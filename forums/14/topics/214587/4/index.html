            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Honestly speaking, I really do wonder how exactly good and beautiful as what you claimed about Multi-Level Marketing. From what I see in these few posts, you are merely just praising multi-level marketing and telling us to understand and catch the grasp and whatevers of Multi-Level Marketing.<br><br>I see your enthusiasm in talking about multi-level marketing. But what I want to know is why it is good, what it is good of, not all the praisings and whatevers. I dont need that.<br><br>--<br><br>Just want to ask about something if it can be related to multi-level marketing.<br><br>According to what I've learnt, business is a general term that describes all activities and institutions that provides goods and services to satisfy the needs of the society.<br><br>Tupperware Singapore also does direct-selling. But their products is a needs of the society because we need them to cook food for our meals, store our food, etc.<br><br>But to compare it to water filtration systems, magnetic mattresses and whatevers, I find it weird and awkward. Are these abovementioned really a NEED themselves? Why do we need them?<br><br><strong>EDIT: You people can argue whatever you want. I just want to clarify me doubts, thank you very much.</strong></div>
