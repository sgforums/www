We have nothing against how companies choose to conduct their business, its only when people in it lie or misrepresent, or cheat people of their money then we take offence.

So based on my experience would you say I have failed? I decided to quit because I no longer wanted to assosiate myself with all the negative things my company was doing. I could not face myself and the people whom i asked to invest their hard earned money if i continued. I have seen too many people from too may companies and heard too many plans already and I can say that the perfect MLM company will never exist. Because there is always the human factor that will spoil things because of greed. Did you know, the perfect ideal business ideal is actually MLM? but in practice it never works. The perfect utopian system of government is actually Communism, he he. If you actually study Karl Marx.
