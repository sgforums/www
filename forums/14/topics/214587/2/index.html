That sounds exactly like the emotionalistic nonsense I used to motivate my downlines with in the past. That holistic-self-improvement-teamwork-brotherhood-Learning-experience-life-enriching-self-empowering CRAP that senior MLM people feed to new recruits all the time. Do you know why uplines are trained to feed downlines with that nonsense? It's so that when you are not making any MONEY they can motivate you with all the intangible benefits of this business. They cater to the herd mentality of humans, to create a place where you feel you can belong, where you feel comfortable, so they can make you come down EVERYDAY. Then they SHARE all the worst experiences they have ever had in the past before they join MLM and how MLM change them blah blah blah like in Church like that. Than all cry, bonding, group hug, shout slogans together, etc. etc.<br><br>You know how tired I am of all that nonsense?<br></div>

That sounds exactly like the emotionalistic nonsense I used to motivate my downlines with in the past. That holistic-self-improvement-teamwork-brotherhood-Learning-experience-life-enriching-self-empowering CRAP that senior MLM people feed to new recruits all the time. Do you know why uplines are trained to feed downlines with that nonsense? It's so that when you are not making any MONEY they can motivate you with all the intangible benefits of this business. They cater to the herd mentality of humans, to create a place where you feel you can belong, where you feel comfortable, so they can make you come down EVERYDAY. Then they SHARE all the worst experiences they have ever had in the past before they join MLM and how MLM change them blah blah blah like in Church like that.

I don't even know what is the ORIGINAL POINT that you were trying to make. Whatever lar, dude, dudette. If you are working at a MLM company now and making money and your downlines are also making money then good. But to me MLM is utter nonsense. You are telling me all the ideal things but we are living in the real world. Business is like that. You tell me people don't do business with emotion? Thats not true, because MLM always, ALWAYS use emotionalism to control their people. I don't need to pick up any pieces or anything, because although I quit MLM industry, I am now doing 10 times better and earning 10 times more than what I used to earn last time. I have already achieved my financial freedom and hitting five figures every month in income. So to me MLM is a total waste of time.</div>
