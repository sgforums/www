Ask your uplines for the 10 Basic Rules of MLM.<br><br>Follow the rules, and you will learn much faster, when your knowledge is sufficient, and you can share the products to your friends without them rejecting your sharing, that's why you start to understand the basic and correct approach to sharing without doing sales nor giving them the hard-selling feeling.<br><br>Learn more from the uplines, don't be too eager to share what you know in here, as there's lots of negative people who's skeptical towards mlm here, thus if you don't know how to handle such replies, learn first and upgrade yourself.<br><br>FYI, from time to time, if you're lucky you will be able to read quality replies from those who knows their stuff.<br><br>As for your information which you posted above, I think in the passed, I've already clarified and address to individual problems already. Thus there's no need to explain and put good words for your company. Moreover, there's no negative remarks for both these 2 companies in the forum yet right. So why the need to defend?<br><br>Time will tell who's the proper mlm companies. There's no hurry, in fact with more explainations, it could make things worse, which is exactly opposite of what we intended initially, thus it's unwise to post and tee-up your comapny.<br><br>Some times, it's better to leave things the way it is.<br><br>Peace <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I hope my advice helps you in one way or another.<br><br>Disclaimer: Above reply are based on what I felt, no offence intended nor to lecture anyone, but just sharing what I know, and what I seen happening, thus I just want to prevent history from re-happening again and again.</div>

I have noticed your comments in various threads. They only make you look ignorant &amp; uncouth.</div></blockquote>Nah I don't need to understand this industry. It's just cheating.
