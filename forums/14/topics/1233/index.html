            <div class='col-md body'>Why on earth would the molester lend her his phone to call the police?<br><br>Another thing that struck me when I read the article was that in essence, this man had to leave his job, and got sentenced to 10 weeks in jail... WHY? Because "District Judge Audrey Lim said the woman was a reliable witness who had no reason to lie."<br><br>WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?<br><br>Were there ANY other witnesses besides the victim? none mentioned in the article...<br><br>Was there ANY incriminatin evidence to support the victim's claim? nope... only her word.<br><br>Do courts in Singapore convict men of molest based on the "victim's" word?<br><br>Who knows... maybe next time us guys might get approached on the bus by pretty girls who whisper sweetly into our ears, 'hand over the wallet and handphone or I'd scream molest...'</div>

And he was kind enough to lend her his phone...so innocently...<br><br>he only touched her once! and the article does not even specify WHERE he touched her...if it was her shoulder or even her back...I don't think the sentence is justified or even necessary.<br><br>this is like the exact opposite of some Islamic countries...if you were raped, they would require you to have witnesses if you want to press charges. who gets raped in front of many people?!?!?!?<br><br>but this is ridiculous...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a major area of concern in the local judiciary system. The words of an alleged female victim can destroy a man. Look at the recent reports of false rape and molest. The papers are quick to defend the women and demonize the men, even in the absence of evidence beyond the victim's statements...<br><br>*sign*, in today's world, men are as likely to be victimized by women... Maybe it's time to afford men some protection.</div>
