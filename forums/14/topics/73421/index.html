            <div class='col-md body'>Just curious if anyone saw Amway having advertisement on TV before?<br><br>I just saw one at Animal Planet with the advertisement ending "Nutrilite  Amway"<br><br>Is it normal to see one for media advertisement?<br>I know some appear as sponsors and supports on charities, national events and global events. Yet TV advertising to bring awareness for the company, does it mean more than that?<br><br>I know some companies are doing advertisement on cabs. Then it probes me too on whether ' What does it mean more than awareness?' or ' Are they struggling to survive?'<br><br>Anyone has any suggestions or ideas?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually I avoid companies who advertise, because of two reasons.<br><br>a) Desperation. Network marketing is supposedly based on people to people contacts, and I know some companies resort to this after they fail in this area. Might as well go back to just open some retail stores.<br><br>b) Similar to above, although many argue by reaching out to mass media, network marketing will be easier to do, but many fail to realise this gives heavier weight to quantity over quality. One has to consider strong bonds and network made by personal presentation and interactions. Mass media, even internet limit the amount of information we wish to give to prospects. Even on sgforums posts, flame wars occurs because we perceive and assume the others intentions just by his writing.<br><br>On intentions, many a times we rejected ads on TV by going for toilet breaks, throw away flyers given people at MRT stations and flip over newspapers ads because we can easily ignore them or we can easily cry out "Scams!" because of limited information - meaning rejections at first hand.<br><br>Lastly, its easier to do business presentation and build bonds with known relatives and friends than strangers off the street. Strangers on the streets have very little obligations to listen or even wish to continue the business with you. This is how I threw away my upline in Herbalife.<br><br>However, i only support businesses which advertise well known products or well demanded stuff. For examples, if Panadol decides to go into MLM, we can easily advertise this over internet as the product is well known. Network is built by simply stating the name of the products.<br><br>We know everyone has a HP, it is in large demand, almost everyone has it. If I were to build an MLM business based on mobile services, many people are able to calculate and discern prices or costs of such services....we debate about Singtel, M1 and Starhub service almost everyday!<br><br>Well, these are just simple illustrations.<br><br>Oh yah, btw Gedanken, maybe you want take this points too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when a company advertise to make others aware of their existence it is not out of desperation. It is a long term plan structured to make the general public aware of its name and logo. Their next step will be to bring products and services into advertisements. I would consider the advertisement that you saw a forerunner of the advertising evolution process.<br><br>It is a strategy that their management and board has sat down and discussed before spending those ten thousands for that advertisment.<br><br>cheers</div>

The company stated here is a MLM company which is well known that they do not advertise only through words of mouth. The company maybe appear in charity events, national events or even global events, but not advertise just to promote their products or services.<br><br>In addition, Amway is an old brand with more than 50 years of being MLM. It has been their pride that they survive even without advertisement and this is what they have told consumers that cutting down the advertisement costs to reduce the retail price.<br><br>Therefore, when the MLM companies started to advertise their products, brands, isn't there other reasons?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that there is nothing wrong for MLM Companies to advertise BUT the money spent should be better paid to the distributors in a better compensation plan.<br>Amway, as everyone is aware, pay the LEAST to distributors, so they can afford to spend more on advertisement.<br><br>The question one can ask is:<br><br>Will you prefer to be paid more without advertisement or paid less but with the help of advertisements ???</div>
