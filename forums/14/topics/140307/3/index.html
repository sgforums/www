            <div class='col-md body'>If u have read my first post over here, I am sure u know of the bad experience that I have been through... Hi shoutcast, if I am not wrong, they must have told u, the director of LAdy Warriors is a 21 year old female, only a ITE graduate and earning $10 + K a month rite? and they say she has earned herself a baby mercs or sth from the company. She know how to act very well infront of her new staff.<br><br>Get this right, that was what they told me last year and up till now, this lady director still hasnt drove her "baby mercs" over... They are just trying to mark up the amount of money they earn.. If they are really earning $10+ K per month, their annual income would be ard $120K a year, meaning they are eligible to apply for a PLATINUM card. A plat card, not a GOLD card. U can ask them to show u, I doubt anyone of them has it...<br><br>and yes, one thing about them is that they drive luxury cars, if I am not wrong, in the garage near New LEaf cafeteria, there is a blue jaguar, several mercs of the same silver design and a Fair LAdy right?? It is just for a show... They have to do this so that they can CONVINCE people how successful they were, so that people will join this.<br><br>IMPORTANT: They will become rich ONLY AFTER u have joined them, not before that. Therefore, they need to fork out money to create a image, a branding. After they have convinced u, they make the money and its your turn to lie to others about how successful u were.<br><br>I only earned $100 plus during my 3 months there. So, I really hope people out there especially those finishing A or O Levels not to get cheated by them.. They aim for this people whom they think are gullible and easy to convince..<br><br>They cheat ur money after u placed the order by not delivering the goods and eventually not giving u ur goods..<br><br>Ya, i agree.. i was there for abt 6 months and i only earn hundred plus..<br><br>they will say that pple like us did not strive hard to do the sales, all CRAP!! Her name is Miss Christin.. and her Lady Warriors are all AH LIANS..<br><br>Those who believe they can earn big bucks are really idiots.. OH MY GOD..<br><br>In DW Group when they make full use of you until dun need you, they will terminal you. An live example is the female JVD promoted just on July 04 from LW Holdings. She contribute a great number of sales to DW last yr and became the top sniper of last yr whole yr some more... But during she was a JVD she nv contribute much sales, so the company terminal her off and came out a Memo and set to all JV holdings abt her. I feel that the company was very bad and i feel no secure if 1 day i became JVD, will i end up like her?? In fact Christine only know how to squeeze your money, when you no longer in use, she will stab you infront of Joey. So you get sack..<br><br>I'm been in dw for 1yr plus .. i had quit the com for bout 1yr plus.. basically i try to clear the doubt of all u guys had..<br>The product is really gd, i know it as i check info bt biomagnetism, it just tat all the managers and directors there are all blood suckers... come let start from the beginning till u quit ..<br>There lots of way they get u in to the company, by friends who is already working at there, thru newspaper articles, by survey etc..<br><br>Actually in line u can really make alot of money ... i am once one of the top salesman in the company but i get in return is all lies and lies.. who say christine teh frm LW earn bt 10k/per mth, pls lor the credit card she holds is juz a sup card from joey tan lah... they had a affair or i should say she is joey tan mistress... Not only tat, her BMW (2nd Hand with numerous of accidents), Bills and Daily Allowance are also from him. i had a friend who once work under astral mag, he is one of the managers there, he told mi tat all the goods they have is true indeed from supplier but guys do u all know how much is the product ? for a product selling @ 1.5k the cost price is only $30 so now dw they sell their product @ ard 2k let guess how much is the cost price.. actually not every joint venture is bad of cause as for now i dunno cause at my time there wasn't so many venture... &amp; to ziggyboy to earn 1.6k/per mth u tink is alot pls wake up lah u still dun understand the system lah..<br>reason y i quit the company or i should say the joint venture is cause i am being betray by the person closest to mi.. he took over all my credit, sales and sales group even my salary , and when i came to know bt it is all my director instruction u all know y ?? is cause i am a person tat cannot be brainwash unlike the one who took over mi he is juz a coward ... i tink i better stop here cause there is really too much to say bt them, and all the bad stuffs ... just wanna tell u all if u guys wanna know anything bt the company just msg mi or post in the forums i will get back to u all and let u all know as much as i had experienced ... thanks<br><br>I also guess that Christine Teh doesn't earn that much, but her affair with Joey Tan is a bit unexpected??? oopz.. I am only interested in the gossips.. as for the ****ed up things of the company, I think it's already overwhelming!!<br><br>Even before I was allowed to leave, they put me through a barrage of talks on successful people don't give up so easily and such things. But heck, I just nodded my head and said I've made up my mind. Anyway, before I left Christine (if I didn't remember wrongly, the ITE girl?) went out with me and she told me not to give up so easily in life.<br><br>With that, she went to the staircase to smoke.<br><br>Strangely, after many months I've left DW KCG, Christine called me and asked me for one referral saying she needs one last sales to meet target and get promotion. I said no and that's the last I've heard of them.<br><br>Christine (if I didn't remember wrongly, she is a bimbo) heard she cannot pay the rental for her own office at level 16 tat's Y she closed down LW at level 16.<br></div>
