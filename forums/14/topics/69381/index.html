            <div class='col-md body'>With such bad publicity  widely known, I am sure DW's future dont look good. The worse part is their own agent volunteered to tell the press. I am most of the other agents' parents will discourage their children to continue with them.<br>Anyway, serve them right, heard their boss is not a good person.<br>How could he tell the press that no one has the right to to say on the daughter whether she choose to study or not. It only showed his Company is not doing well and very desperate to "keep" the girl.<br>heard they only have very young agents, of course, the elder ones are smarter, will not join them.<br>Whenever you see that a MLM Company has more youngsters, it's a sign that their dististributors income will not be good or their products has problems, otherwise the elder ones would have joined them.<br>I can bet DW's new move will to shift their office away soon, hoping future agents and prospects will not know they are the same company as the one in "Apex Tower published in the papers".... or<br>they will start appointing "franchisee" to have new addresses elsewhere...<br>For those who maybe attracted by their cars, take note, don't be fooled !! The boss says he earned his car too, of course la, he is the boss, his profit margin is far more than the agents, and just like most MLM, you still need to maintain your sales target otherwise, you will have to pay your own instalments or lose the car.<br>I have seen enough people who have their pictures taken with their "earned" car but only lose it later, not just the car but their "face" too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i totally agree with you. THe tactics that DW used is really ruthless.. those who are ex agent will know.. and how come ex agent will come out and talk? cos i think he/she want to let the public know the truth and that share thier experience.. Seriously i think those who believe that they can be successful in THAT company is really  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> . cos there have been so many side reports of DW and they still go for it... are they idiots???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So far in this forum what companies we complained about..<br><br>Venture Era<br>Asayo<br>Astral Mag<br>Amway<br>Herbalife<br>Unicity<br>ntiparis<br>Belparis<br>DW Group<br>Forever Living<br><br>and many reports on unknown ones like Reliv etc etc<br><br>urm, then are we like going through every one in the DSAS including Lux, Tupeprware, Nuskin, Elken etc etc, and many un-DSAS ones....???<br><br>Aiyoh, what i feel is that all biz are profit making, no matter they are selling services or products, and they may be (bless me) endowed with lousy biz management. The point is to sift out (well if i say good and lousy, people will hantam me), exceedingly mismanaged or just purely scams. These are the paramount task to do now, while sg is in formulative years in mlm.<br><br>When direct selling business are falling in heaps due to mismanagement or scams, they have very, I do , mean very large impact on direct selling in sg, given the 'hostile perceptions given to it by singaporeans'. ( I would actually like to state 'given the lousy-living-in-comfort-zone-lack-of-drive Singaporeans attitude, but that would be an unwise exercise in this present situation)<br><br>There are still questions abound in direct selling - people earning from downlines? commisision unviable? saturation? overpricing?. Many people, who have not even enter this industry before have foolishly stated the above with a loud bah!. No one could put together the real life out there, the real business vehicle of MLM, differentiation between companies etc. There are also 1001 reasons to do and not to do MLM, but too bad, no one I seen in this forum have yet to come up with the reals reasons not to do MLM. Many have blatantly just stated the common myths.<br><br>Well, too bad then. Urm, btw this got nothing to do with experienced's post or DW.<br></div>
