              <p>actually, i rather be sitting down to discuss specifically why many scams get away with it</p>
              <p>like, the admendments to the MLM act does not differentiate between pyramids schemes putting products as a front and real schemes which are genuinely selling products</p>
              <p>rather than answering general smart aleck questions scammers like to ply their victims with, like why over in another country this company get caught in this country this yet another company didnt get caught</p>
              <p>there is no equitable comparisons between the nature of the scams, the laws, the enforcement of the two different countries, you just lump these two together avoiding the different situations in which the companies are in</p>
              <p>no wonder scammers are clever and their victims are imbeciles</p>

              <p>Hi Laurence82,, don't mine my rough attitude. i just can't
                  stand of seeing people getting wrong information. i trying to
                  correct it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you say professional as in what way?</p>
              <p>I know that i'm not talking professionally. i trying to tell
                  whatever i know here.</p>
              <p>To let you know, i just signed up last night because of this
                  topic. *sigh*</p>
              <p>Hi the_fallen, joining MLM company is not a joke :) ok?
                  Investing in a company is risky. You have to do all kinds of
                  homework.</p>
              <p><strong>If you're interested in knowing this new company, Em-Max, please
                  call the Sunshine Empire Customer Service Counter for details.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would wish to quote to all people out there who is reading
                  this topic right now.</p>
              <p>If you think MLM is a scam, it's because you hear too much of
                  hearsay. And also lack of homework.</p>
              <p>If you could silent your mind and think.  You might notice
                  that most people who lose money or scare their money lose or scare
                  the company shut down, those people might split all kind of
                  nonsense.</p>
              <p>Don't believe, do some human research =) And ask yourself, are
                  you like them?</p>
              <p>Ok. Thats all for tonight. Anything else, please feel free to
                  post.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>i see now that u guys have being taught to push the stuffs to somebody "professional" to answer those questions..</p>
              <p>it's a step too late that they shld have done it previously when the game started.</p>
              <p>do you don't understand english or what?</p>
              <p>i mention i like to understand more in person.</p>

              <p>although u're also a investor.</p>
              <p>I AM also an investor like you. but more senior in a sense, invloved in the previous projects thus got the current account free (actually being forced to in a way to attempt to win back our trust.)</p>
              <p>There are still methods for them to return money to fellow 'distributors' if your news is most updated.</p>
              <p>You just dunno the scam methods which they have used.</p>
              <p>Add on: The reason why I don't want to talk to their so call hotline, is because I know by doing so, they will push the blame here and there, delay time, hope it will be forgotten soon.</p>
              <p>By having professional help, they are pretending to be professional, but when u ask the distributors who recommend the 'investments' to others, they are just customers technically speaking with no license to sell.</p>
              <p>By having professional hotline, they new agent who knows nothing about the passed events, will end up like you perhaps, innocent waiting for them to be unfroze, which will not have a chance to do so.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Jackie Hoo,</p>
              <p>I refuse to follow your orders to sow discord by calling CAD about Coslab and Long Far. I think they are not involved in any money game. However, I had accompanied my friends to Outram Park CAD to report about SE. Hopefully it will help some of us redeem at least our capital.</p>
              <p>How about you start asking some of your BRM to start behaving in St James Power station and MOS? It is quite embarrassing to meet Rick womanising, you know?</p>
              <p>And can you please tell our dear BDM Ming Jie, why do I need to know that the Room 6 BRM got his downline-cum-finance pregnant and then dump her. For your information, the Room 6 BRM is a very honourable man and he sings well!</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNUFjObhxg</p>
              <p>Business is business. Whatever he did to the girl is non of my business. So what if he tricked her family to buy 16 GP from JAB division? That BRM is already very pitiful. Friends abadoning him. Downlines disrespecting him. His real father (not James Phang) is a gambling addict. This BRM personal life should not affect his judgement as a business man. He is so well respected since NOP/NTI. And he always lose a lot of money in Genting since NTI days.</p>
              <p>Please ask Ming Jie to stop spreading his personal life secrets around. It is very bad for business. People will lose trust in him, although I admit, people have already lose trust in him.</p>
              <p>I mean, who can trust a BRM who forced his own wife-to-be to buy 16 GP, make her pregnant, and after the CAD launch investigation, dump her. This is his personal life. It should not be told to anyone especially the 16-17 year old naive memebers in J-division. It is very bad for Sunshine Empire reputation, you know? Even EnYouth people are laughing at him.</p>
              <p>I also suggest to you to terminate BDM Ming Jie as he is pulling away Sunshine Empire Merchants to that Palm Oil company. Here is his friendster profile, in case you forget that you just scolded him face-to-face.</p>
              <p>http://profiles.friendster.com/4009633</p>
              <p>In future, those Taiwan, Hong Kong and Genting trips, I suggest to you for the company to issue condoms, especially to the BRMs. It is very bad that they might bring unwanted disease back to Singapore in your sexual exploits. Please also ban information that the BRM likes to show off their BMW and cash in the casino.</p>
              <p>I have 100% faith that you, a 29 year old President can fix the mess in Sunshine Empire; as you have always promised to do so since NTI when you first became the 'Zhong Cai'. I do not believe that James Phang is a despicable man and that you are made a scapegoat.</p>
              <p>I also have faith that the world will always know that no matter what name,</p>

              money game. However, I had accompanied my friends to Outram Park
              CAD to report about SE. Hopefully it will help some of us redeem at
              least our capital.</p>
              <p>How about you start asking some of your BRM to start behaving in
              St James Power station and MOS? It is quite embarrassing to meet
              Rick womanising, you know?</p>
              <p>And can you please tell our dear BDM Ming Jie, why do I need to
              know that the Room 6 BRM got his downline-cum-finance pregnant and
              then dump her. For your information, the Room 6 BRM is a very
              honourable man and he sings well!</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNUFjObhxg</p>
              <p>Business is business. Whatever <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">he did to the girl is non of my
              business. So what if he tricked her family to buy 16 GP from JAB
              division?</span></strong> That <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">BRM is already very pitiful. Friends abadoning him.
              Downlines disrespecting him. His real father (not James Phang) is a
              gambling addict. This BRM personal life should not affect his
              judgement as a business man.</span></strong> He is so well respected since NOP/NTI.
              And he always lose a lot of money in Genting since NTI days.</p>
              <p>Please ask Ming Jie to stop spreading his personal life secrets
              around. It is very bad for business. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">People will lose trust in him,
              although I admit, people have already lose trust in him.</span></strong></p>
              <p>I mean, who can trust a <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">BRM who forced his own wife-to-be to buy
              16 GP, make her pregnant, and after the CAD launch investigation,
              dump her. </span></strong>This is his personal life. It should not be told to
              anyone especially the 16-17 year old naive memebers in J-division.
              It is very bad for Sunshine Empire reputation, you know? Even
              EnYouth people are laughing at him.</p>
              <p>I also suggest to you to terminate BDM Ming Jie as he is pulling
              away Sunshine Empire Merchants to that Palm Oil company. Here is
              his friendster profile, in case you forget that you just scolded
              him face-to-face.</p>
              <p>http://profiles.friendster.com/4009633</p>
              <p>In future, those Taiwan, Hong Kong and Genting trips, I suggest
              to you for the company to issue condoms, especially to the BRMs. It
              is very bad that they might bring unwanted disease back to
              Singapore in your sexual exploits. Please also ban information that
              the <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">BRM likes to show off their BMW and cash in the casino.</span></strong></p>
              <p>I have 100% faith that you, a 29 year old President can fix the
              mess in Sunshine Empire; as you have always promised to do so since
              NTI when you first became the 'Zhong Cai'. <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">I do not believe that
              James Phang is a despicable man and that you are made a
              scapegoat.</span></strong></p>

              <p>(after the court review on 28 March, 2008, Jackie tells all his
              BRM that SE will be kept as an empty company for CAD to investigate
              for an infinite amount of time.)</p>

              <p>Haha, the most detailed posting i've ever read to read..</p>
              <p>with clear steps of their tatics..</p>
              <p>although only insiders will understand certain methods written as per above</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Highlighted text as per above in <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>RED </strong></span>and <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Orange</span></strong> are just some tatics taught to those seniors in previous batches of networkers on how to con, play with ppl's trust and many other tatics, just that they learnt it without knowing they picked up wrong stuffs..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Text highlighted in <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Blue</strong></span> are some problems which I faced years back when I was part of them too.. But nonetheless, now the tatics taught by them to fellow agents are just plain dum-ass..</p>
              <p>Giving orders and doing it without asking any questions..That's why a lot of 'investors' are being conned of their assets without knowing how they were conned. Thanks to the so-call Professional Helpline, thus the independent distributors can't picked up any "newer/similar tricks" which they taught us years back  thus we were smart enough not to follow him since his methods  never change,  just with a bit of modification here and there..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are so many other stories..which I might not have known, but definitely i'm sure my seniors would know them...</p>

              <p>Only fools invest into empty promises. They dont know how to look into the company's accounts and go find out about the physical assets the company has. Too naive into believing promises than justifying facts. This shows that people who put their money in SE or some other MLMs are making a huge risk. I wouldn't classify them as investors either. They are fools, speculators, money greedy people. Time and time again, people never learn to get educated into investments.</p>
              <p>If you are too lazy or busy to read up on investments to improve your financial intelligence. I suggest you put your hard earned money into Fixed Deposits or SG bonds. Its better than losing it right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>Hello Singapore</p>
              <p>On my last visit to the Toa Payoh office, I felt that enough was enough.</p>
              <p>Yes, James Phang and Jackie Hoo can cheat young people all they want.</p>
              <p>But when I saw how some BRM quarrelled with the aunties and uncles, I felt really bad. <strong>The elderly are not morons;</strong> they believed that a GP was a savings plan and all they want is to get back their savings. Please, to all those who choose to stay in Em-max, touch your soul. Why are you cheating the elderly? They didn't even sign any forms. They just passed the cash to the BRM and that's about it. (I'm serious)</p>
              <p>My regret is that I did not believe lawrence82's post since 2003 in SG forum and The Straits Times (2003-2004). I still remember Jackie Hoo using lawrence's name to anger and stir NTI agents during the BIP (Business Introduction Program).</p>
              <p>I have decided to leave NOP/NTI and now SE.</p>
              <p>Good luck to Em-max.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Er... so how? Am I convincing enough? Are you crying? I'm trying to learn James Phang's secret of crying and saying the same old stories in all rallies since 1997. I think I will learn how to dance like him.</p>
              <p>What do you mean you don't like it? At least I did not charge you (50 e-points) S$80.00 to say 'Sorry' to you, unlike James Phang.</p>
              <p>I have a BIG SURPRISE coming up. I hope it boosts the morale of all Singaporeans. Stay tuned...)</p>
