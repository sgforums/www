            <div class='col-md body'>I just got this from a blog of this guy called Rokson from mindsay<br><br><blockquote><br><br>August 21, 2007 at 12:52 AM<br><br>My opinion about Sunshine Empire<br><br>Before I was deciding to join Sunshine Empire, a few very good friends of mine came to me out of good intention to warn me about the company.  Saying it the boss is a Scam Artist where he will cheat our money and run away.  Yet I found it to be a strange story that cannot be accepted at face value.  If he is a Scam Artist according to his past record, then why is he walking freely in Singapore.  I'm sure that the Singapore government is very good at catching people of such nature.<br><br>Being an independent minded person, none of the rumors affected my choice to find out more about the company and about the boss, James Phang, who is the International President of the Sunshine Alliance Group.  If I can lived through a religious discrimination 20 years ago, I can go through anything.  I went to the office daily to learn more about the company and about the people running it.  I even went to the company convention at Genting from 12 - 16 Aug.  I found nothing wrong with this company.  In fact, I found everything to be of good values.<br><br>James Phang grew up in a poor family.  Nothing was easy for him through out his growing years.  Due to his hard work in balancing work and studies, his stressful life has cost the sight of his left eye.  He learned about the power of Network Marketing and became passionate about it.  He said that "once he became a networker he will die as a networker."<br><br>James Phang started the company called NOP (Number One Product) few years ago.  The company also initiated the Property Development called "Magic Kingdom".  Unfortunately, con-artist manipulated James Phang's brother who was in control of the company finance at that time which resulted in bankruptcy.  James Phang only collected $1millinon down payment for the Magic Kingdom project, but he had to pay-out $6million to settle the whole matter.  During this trying moment, many of his close friends and associates turned their back on him and started the unpleasant rumors which lasted till today.<br><br>When I came to know about this company, I found out that the company is having a Resort Property development in KK (East Malaysia).  The name of this resort is called Empire Magic Kingdom.  If he had been a Scam Artist, why is he calling this new project the same name as the one that had failed?  In the convention, he told us that he did it on purpose so that he can prove to the world that he is not a Scam Artist.  He was genuine, but due to stroke of fate the previous project failed.  This time round, he has enough money to do any kind of project he desired.  Once this new project is completed, he will not sell, but instead, he will give it away for free.  To whom?  To the victim of the previously fail project.  I do not know how is he going to do that?  I love to see how it's gonna be done.  So my question is whether it is fair for those who had turned their back on James Phang to receive a free unit on this new Empire Magic Kingdom?  Will they be embarrassed for the rumors that they have told about him?<br><br>In the course of his presentation, James Phang gave his word that - "He will deliver whatever he had said."  So far, I have not heard any corporate leader would say such a thing in front of 3000 participants.  He certainly has a lot of good values that we can learn from.<br><br>Personally, I would like to thank James Phang for his vision in creating the Empire Group Alliance that has such great resemblance to GNN of OKA.  At least there is a chance for me to fulfill my dreams now.<br></blockquote>Members only blog <a href="http://rokson.mindsay.com/my_opinion_about_sunshine_empire.mws" rel="nofollow">http://rokson.mindsay.com/my_opinion_about_sunshine_empire.mws</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my 2 cents. (Don't flame thanks.)<br><br>I've 'invested' in SE a few months back, buying a few gold primes at that time, i was highly doubtful of such a good deal of getting many times of what i put in as it was sounding too good to be true. A good friend introduced it to me and he told me h invested and it was trustable. I decided to give it a try to make some quick bucks.<br><br>Okay just to make it clear, SE isnt much of investing, but more like some customer rewards rebate program. You are actually buying some mobile phone line thing which is from emcom and the money they return you is something like an extra reward (but in actual fact, we're more interested in the money aren't we all<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)<br><br>Back to story.<br>So i bought about 8 gold primes (at about S$80k, which was a big part of my personal savings at that time) to test the system. On the following month, i got my rebates of about 10% of what i put in in rebate points which can be used to do e-withdrawal, or cashed out by selling the points to another member of SE (cashing-out). This continued for about 9 months when i got my initial deposit amount back. On the eleventh month, i was half expecting them to make up some BS about the company folding up or some other lame excuse so that the 80k i paid was actually some no interest loan they took from me. However, I still continued to get my monthly 8k rebate.<br><br>After that i decided to purchase a few more primes, and now i'm making a 6 digit "salary". Okay you might think it's some lie to make SE sound better but if you really wanna clarify stuff i'll be glad to do it.<br><br>ANYWAY, for those that are saying SE isnt paying out what they promised, sad to say that is true AT THE MOMENT due to CAD freezing their accounts for the so called investigation. They even froze their operating cost budget and stuffs. There are other ways to cash out though. Not only thru e-withdrawal.<br><br>And for those that are screaming SCAM all over this thread, due to friends/relatives etc. not getting their payouts, how about trying to go to the company at TPY and finding out how to get an alternative method to cash out their e-points.<br><br>And for those that dont even know what are e-points and screaming that they have been scammed, get a life and stop adding oil to fire when you don't even have a part in this.<br><br>A side note, even if the govt manages to kill SE singapore, not to worry, there are other branches worldwide eg. msia, HK, middle east, korea etc. So your 'investments' are safe. (About the govt bashing SE thingy, its another story)<br><br>lol @ my rant, i just can't stand people who wanna cuss and make up stories to join in discussion, you know who you are  &lt;3</div>

              <p>for this i agree with you,  having 100+ gold prime doesnt mean that the company is genuine at all, like swisscash from what i heard, when their plot was exposed as a scam, they were not declared bankrupt or whatsoever, they carrying on scamming ppl  who are still hiding in the dark or some knew that the company is a scam, they put their moral aside and work for money.</p>
              <p>In order to prove us all wrong, providing some statistic and evidence would be a great help, other than that is all adding oil to the fire.</p>
              <p>nightmares, you said "if you say its a scam company, why would
