              <p>Thanks to redstone, kiyoshirou, laurence82 and brains.</p>
              <p>please keep up the good work.</p>
              <p>JP just sang 'lao shu ai da mi' (mice love rice) in the International Leaders' Conference. I kid you not. Seems that the Hongkies and Thais are more gullible than Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The CAD are really 'kiasu'. It is as if the info about NOP, NTI, China Dream, Sunshine Empire and EGA are not enough? We even brought ancient aromatherphy products from NOP &amp; NTI!</p>
              <p>The revelation was that the many BRM that I worship and idolise are actually ex-convicts.</p>
              <p>No shame in that... illegal passport peddlar/forgers? Drunk driver? Personally, I have no issues with their pass criminal records and I am sure they have changed for the better, right? But some of them display character traits that suggest otherwise. If a BRM can betray friends, wife and even family to protect his interest in JP and JH's corporation, then... what kind of corporation have I joined? Or is it a mafia or cult?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Why should I still believe my BRM when Lorna Tan, Grace Chen and even <strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Larry Haverkamp</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> do not approve of this revolutionary business.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Dramatic Music, Spotlight and Smoke from Dry Ice... and techno music)</p>
              <p>Have I been cheated by my upline, my sponsor, my BRM... and ultimately my  childhood friend? Of whom, he himself is cheated and lied to by JH and JP? Perhaps, I should give a quick call to ask my BRM asking him about the latest developments instead of logging online to check for updates?</p>

Concerns centre on the fact that participants can potentially pocket big monthly 'rebates', which are not guaranteed, without ever buying or selling these goods.<br><br>The rebates are based on the participants' cash outlay, as well as Sunshine's global turnover.<br><br>Six Sunshine participants were applying for refunds when The Straits Times visited the company's headquarters in Toa Payoh yesterday.<br><br>One, who declined to be named, said he placed $12,500 in a gold plan in August. He received two monthly rebates of about $700 each, but these stopped once the CAD began its investigation.<br><br>Another participant, who also sought anonymity, said she was 'very worried' about losing her savings of $35,000, which she placed in four gold plans from November to early this year. Her rebates have ceased in recent months.<br><br>'If Sunshine is declared bankrupt, I will not get my money back,' she said. 'Can the authorities give direction on what to do?'<br><br>She will not transfer her accounts to Hong Kong, as she is unsure if the move is legal because of the ongoing investigation.<br><strong><br>Sunshine adviser and spokesman James Phang denied any knowledge of the alleged Hong Kong option when he spoke to The Straits Times recently.<br><br>'I'm under investigation, so I'm not at liberty to reveal anything,' he said.</strong><br><br>'To my knowledge, there were no meetings at Sunshine (about the Hong Kong option). People can come in and out. They can join any company. I have no control over the members. They are independent people.'<br><br>Mr Phang did confirm that Sunshine had stopped giving rebates in the past few months.<br><br>It was earlier reported that Mr Phang was linked to a failed investment scheme that resulted in 1,000 Singaporeans losing about $2 million.<br><br>The Consumers Association of Singapore's executive director, Mr Seah Seng Choon, cautioned participants against transferring their money to Hong Kong, as it would put their investment outside Singapore's jurisdiction.<br><br>'Recovering money from a foreign entity is always difficult if the company is unable to continue its operation here as a result of the current investigation,' he said.<br><br>Mr Seah advised consumers unprepared to stomach further risks to ask Sunshine for refunds - advice he also gave in November. <strong>He urged consumers to report to the police any new development or changes made by Sunshine.</strong><br><br>Sunshine was placed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's investor alert list in September. This means it is not allowed to conduct regulated activities.<br><br>It is reported to have attracted 20,000 clients since it set up in Singapore in July last year.<br><br>The police declined to comment yesterday, as its investigation was still ongoing.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:lorna@sph.com.sg">lorna@sph.com.sg</a></span></p>

              <p>SE will be closed down completely once CAD result is released. I can side bet this with any takers.</p>
              <p>There's enough evidence to charge SE as a money game model which another words is illegal and the company is guilty of mis-representation. CAD is now pending investigation on evidence of its money laundering activities. Even if its not guilty for the 2nd charge, the 1st charge is enough to stop all its activities.</p>
              <p>Jacky and James are all going to get whacked by the police but their worshippers may feel comforted to know that they already have a couple of millions in their offshore bank accounts.</p>
              <p>I wont argue with those who doubts what i say here. My information comes from someone high up there. In fact he is one of the first 8 members who joined SE when it first started in 2006. For those in SE long enough, its quite easy to guess.</p>
              <p>Singapore SE members will NEVER get back their capital from EMmax because Emmax existed for the Hong Kongers and those that sign up members for them, NOT free loaders that sit in Singapore waiting for their capital. Unless you sign members for EMmax, else u can kiss all your money good bye. I know that your upline has told you that you dont need to add in money or sign up members to get back your capital.... just watch: It will be communicated to you in 6 months time to sign members OR add money....</p>
              <p>Why 6 months? - so as to keep you guys from applying for refunds and going to CAD so pro-actively withine these period of time till they are done with CAD and shifted all their assets out of the country!</p>
              <p>And yes, i am also quite surprised to learn tonight that many SE agents have gone to CAD for help.. contrary to what most of us believe earlier that most SE agents are still sticking by JP closely.  </p>
              <p>We can soon close the thread for SE - I believe Emmax will not be as active in Singapore as SE cos not easy to convince Singaporeans to put money in an unknown/unheard company overseas....well then again - we never know.. haaa </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Having once been a founding distributor in the old days NTI and a business owner in Singapore, perhaps I should just take the liberty of joining in this heated debate over the controversy of SE. I simply couldn’t resist the temptation to write after navigating to 17 pages of varied comments. For interested readers, this may be a long post (since I am suffering from insomnia due to the coffee earlier), but rest assured this will probably be the most informative post in this 17 pages.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Being one of the founding distributors of NTI almost 6 years ago, I had the opportunity of knowing this bunch of SE leaders (or BRMs) when they were small fries. In less than 3 months of joining the company, I left due to the fact that I simply could not tolerate the ridiculous hype and lousy product series the company sported. At that time, I could be considered one of the leading distributors, with a sizeable network. I maintained casual contact with some of the current leaders, but did not question their endeavours whatsoever (purely friends).</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Just before the start of the SE compensation plan, one of these leaders approached me to rejoin the gang. Perhaps being a business owner for long enough, and having the bad experience with the culture of the company in the past, I decided to carefully check almost every single document I could find. The plan seemed perfectly ok, with the exception of the “X number of years to pay out rebates” clause. In the end, I declined the offer.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In the following months, the hype grew, and as more people placed their money in as short term investments, money spun more money, and the rebates got higher. If one were to question the possibility of the business model being a money game, I would not beg to differ. However, I take a less critical position when it comes to such “taboo terms”.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Philosophically, this world is very much like a monopoly game-board. Everyone is out to fend for themselves and aim to be the last man standing. This includes official bodies. As politically wrong as it may be, we all know that throughout history, there has never been a political body that is free of corruption and self-serving people. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Having been in business for a good time in Singapore, we often lament the fact that the government (one run by a singular political party since it was founded), operates more like a company, with the exception that the accounts are never very transparent. They also don’t like to share the pie of riches, and will put everything in place to make sure we continue to be poor so we can work as long as we live.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From a solely personal point of view, SE is a money game. In fact, it is a very good one. The model channels money from the masses to a common pool, of which a percentage is drawn to rebate people monthly, and the rest invested into low-risk, high-return businesses, of which a portion of the profits are drawn back to further rebate these “investors”. For those who solely invest their cash, if all goes well, they would get back the maximum rebate amount in a short time. For those who wish to market this plan, it works well too, as long as there is proof of rebate and a proper commission scheme.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Making a logical comparison, the government bodies and public / private banks are not very much different. One the surface, the govt collects taxes and charges (and CPF), and makes investments here and there to increase their reserves. Banks take your money to do the same. Rebates are in cash or kind, and often a very low percentage of the invested amount. Below the surface these institutions simply take the fruit of your labour and regulate your consumption by giving you “money”, so that you don’t consume so much to the extent they have nothing to consume.

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As with any business, you always seek the fastest way to make money. JP came up with this brilliant idea of take money from the public, using an MLM model of run a money game that rebates substantially and yet gives him the capital to start / buyout profitable business entities. <span> </span>Logically everyone gains, so the plan explodes. Housewives and students suddenly draw 5 to 6 figure income streams, and everyone is happy.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Seeing the massive influx of cash, the leaders and management continued to push for sales, without ever looking at the possible ripples of having ATM machines emptied every other day. To most people, and perhaps JP and friends, as long as everyone is happy things should be ok.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; text-indent: -18pt; "><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;     " lang="EN-US"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2)</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>      </span></span></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Authorities</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Large incomes are drawn, and little taxes are paid, plus the outflow of funds to aid the development of foreign infrastructures.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">To banks, imagine have millions of dollars withdrawn per month. I think this is quite direct.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Quite simply put, this whole episode can be described as a conflict of interests. What SE is doing is directly drawing resources of out the authorities’ resource pool, and making money elsewhere, and giving people a chance to report a less transparent income statement. What the government is doing is trying to stop SE before it grows to a size beyond their control, for if it does, it may almost topple the system of slavery. What would slave-masters do without their obedient slaves?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

I can only say, think logically, and would it be better for JP and gang to run away with the money, or to keep the ball rolling? I leave the answer to you, readers.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I sometimes marvel at how we Singaporeans can take in information wholesale from the press that is ranked as one of the last in the world, and a monopolized government comprising of ministers that draw 6-figure salaries.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Having once been a founding distributor in
              the old days NTI and a business owner in Singapore, perhaps I
              should just take the liberty of joining in this heated debate over
              the controversy of SE. I simply couldn’t resist the temptation to
              write after navigating to 17 pages of varied comments. For
              interested readers, this may be a long post (since I am suffering
              from insomnia due to the coffee earlier), but rest assured this
              will probably be the most informative post in this 17
              pages.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Being one of the founding distributors of
              NTI almost 6 years ago, I had the opportunity of knowing this bunch
              of SE leaders (or BRMs) when they were small fries. In less than 3
              months of joining the company, I left due to the fact that I simply
              could not tolerate the ridiculous hype and lousy product series the
              company sported. At that time, I could be considered one of the
              leading distributors, with a sizeable network. I maintained casual
              contact with some of the current leaders, but did not question
              their endeavours whatsoever (purely friends).</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Just before the start of the SE
              compensation plan, one of these leaders approached me to rejoin the
              gang. Perhaps being a business owner for long enough, and having
              the bad experience with the culture of the company in the past, I
              decided to carefully check almost every single document I could
              find. The plan seemed perfectly ok, with the exception of the “X
              number of years to pay out rebates” clause. In the end, I declined
              the offer.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In the following months, the hype grew, and
              as more people placed their money in as short term investments,
              money spun more money, and the rebates got higher. If one were to
              question the possibility of the business model being a money game,
              I would not beg to differ. However, I take a less critical position
              when it comes to such “taboo terms”.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Philosophically, this world is very much
              like a monopoly game-board. Everyone is out to fend for themselves
              and aim to be the last man standing. This includes official bodies.
              As politically wrong as it may be, we all know that throughout
              history, there has never been a political body that is free of
              corruption and self-serving people.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Having been in business for a good time in
              Singapore, we often lament the fact that the government (one run by
              a singular political party since it was founded), operates more
              like a company, with the exception that the accounts are never very
              transparent. They also don’t like to share the pie of riches, and
              will put everything in place to make sure we continue to be poor so
              we can work as long as we live.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From a solely personal point of view, SE is
              a money game. In fact, it is a very good one. The model channels
              money from the masses to a common pool, of which a percentage is
              drawn to rebate people monthly, and the rest invested into
              low-risk, high-return businesses, of which a portion of the profits
              are drawn back to further rebate these “investors”. For those who
              solely invest their cash, if all goes well, they would get back the
              maximum rebate amount in a short time. For those who wish to market
              this plan, it works well too, as long as there is proof of rebate
              and a proper commission scheme.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Making a logical comparison, the government
              bodies and public / private banks are not very much different. One
              the surface, the govt collects taxes and charges (and CPF), and
              makes investments here and there to increase their reserves. Banks
              take your money to do the same. Rebates are in cash or kind, and
              often a very low percentage of the invested amount. Below the
              surface these institutions simply take the fruit of your labour and
              regulate your consumption by giving you “money”, so that you don’t
              consume so much to the extent they have nothing to consume. A more

              perspectives:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As with any business, you always seek the
              fastest way to make money. JP came up with this brilliant idea of
              take money from the public, using an MLM model of run a money game
              that rebates substantially and yet gives him the capital to start /
              buyout profitable business entities. <span> </span>Logically everyone gains, so the plan explodes.
              Housewives and students suddenly draw 5 to 6 figure income streams,
              and everyone is happy.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              leaders and management continued to push for sales, without ever
              looking at the possible ripples of having ATM machines emptied
              every other day. To most people, and perhaps JP and friends, as
              long as everyone is happy things should be ok.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              Authorities</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From the viewpoint of national income, with
              this plan rolling money around and out to investments in foreign
              land, with no particular channel of gain for the government, this
              is not a good business. Large incomes are drawn, and little taxes
              are paid, plus the outflow of funds to aid the development of
              foreign infrastructures.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">To banks, imagine have millions of dollars
              withdrawn per month. I think this is quite
              direct.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Quite simply put, this whole episode can be
              described as a conflict of interests. What SE is doing is directly
              drawing resources of out the authorities’ resource pool, and making
              money elsewhere, and giving people a chance to report a less
              transparent income statement. What the government is doing is
              trying to stop SE before it grows to a size beyond their control,
              for if it does, it may almost topple the system of slavery. What
              would slave-masters do without their obedient
              slaves?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Regarding the issue of whether CAD froze
              the funds or not, it is up to the individual to imagine. I can only
              say, think logically, and would it be better for JP and gang to run
              away with the money, or to keep the ball rolling? I leave the
              answer to you, readers.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I sometimes marvel at how we Singaporeans
              can take in information wholesale from the press that is ranked as
              one of the last in the world, and a monopolized government
              comprising of ministers that draw 6-figure
              salaries.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then again, this is perhaps success in
              propaganda, for the best slaves are those who think they are
              free.</span></span></p>

              <p>But a similar case happened when I lambasted a MLMer for comparing MLM company selling health products and hospitals &amp; small stores.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They use a common denominator to do a comparison (in this case money investments or health products), while conveniently ignoring the background of these entities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The tight financial regulations of banks and FIs, the expertise of doctors in the hospitals, the amount of professionalism in these entities would never be matched by mere MLM companies</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also thought that GTL is proposing that gabramant is a devil, and its allright to give our money away to another devil, doubling the stupidity of this argument.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi guys, I don’t think I have actually tried to represent SE as a legitimate company. The argument I am placing is not about whether they are legal or not. Read a bit into history, and you shall find that since there was civilization, there was war. Both parties take their claim to the throne, and the survivor tells the tale THE WAY HE WANTS IT TO BE TOLD. You are illegal if the authorities SAY SO.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From a moral standpoint, I believe both parties have the right to stick to their beliefs. JP believes that what he is doing is for the greater good, and that he has done nothing wrong. From his perspective, he did help a lot of people to make money, whatever means, so he should be on the moral high ground.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From the government’s perspective, they are trying to safeguard national interests, and prevent too much funds from flowing out of the country, affecting the local economy. For banks, apart from guarding their self interests, you can say they have to guard customer interests too, and it would be dangerous for the remaining customers of the bank should reserves be depleted rapidly (cutting short the rolling capital for investments).</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

No qualms about that, Singapore is indeed too small to not be tempted into cutthroat competition scenarios.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I’m not taking sides here. I may be travelling around now, but I still love Singapore for a place with unrivalled good food and many of my best friends. I may not be in SE, but I still maintain my friendship with those I knew back in NTI. What I am proposing, perhaps, is simply to take a rational viewpoint, so as to see the bigger picture.</span></span></p>

              <p>So from your perspective that we are all self serving beings, and that we should ignore rules and regulations if they do not serve our sole purpose of survival and prosperity, may I suggest afew of the following?</p>

              <p>1. That when we are hungry, we can go steal food and eat</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Having once been a founding distributor in
              the old days NTI and a business owner in Singapore, perhaps I
              should just take the liberty of joining in this heated debate over
              the controversy of SE. I simply couldn’t resist the temptation to
              write after navigating to 17 pages of varied comments. For
              interested readers, this may be a long post (since I am suffering
              from insomnia due to the coffee earlier), but rest assured this
              will probably be the most informative post in this 17
              pages.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Being one of the founding distributors of
              NTI almost 6 years ago, I had the opportunity of knowing this bunch
              of SE leaders (or BRMs) when they were small fries. In less than 3
              months of joining the company, I left due to the fact that I simply
              could not tolerate the ridiculous hype and lousy product series the
              company sported. At that time, I could be considered one of the
              leading distributors, with a sizeable network. I maintained casual
              contact with some of the current leaders, but did not question
              their endeavours whatsoever (purely friends).</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Just before the start of the SE
              compensation plan, one of these leaders approached me to rejoin the
              gang. Perhaps being a business owner for long enough, and having
              the bad experience with the culture of the company in the past, I
              decided to carefully check almost every single document I could
              find. The plan seemed perfectly ok, with the exception of the “X
              number of years to pay out rebates” clause. In the end, I declined
              the offer.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In the following months, the hype grew, and
              as more people placed their money in as short term investments,
              money spun more money, and the rebates got higher. If one were to
              question the possibility of the business model being a money game,
              I would not beg to differ. However, I take a less critical position
              when it comes to such “taboo terms”.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Philosophically, this world is very much
              like a monopoly game-board. Everyone is out to fend for themselves
              and aim to be the last man standing. This includes official bodies.
              As politically wrong as it may be, we all know that throughout
              history, there has never been a political body that is free of
              corruption and self-serving people.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Having been in business for a good time in
              Singapore, we often lament the fact that the government (one run by
              a singular political party since it was founded), operates more
              like a company, with the exception that the accounts are never very
              transparent. They also don’t like to share the pie of riches, and
              will put everything in place to make sure we continue to be poor so
              we can work as long as we live.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From a solely personal point of view, SE is
              a money game. In fact, it is a very good one. The model channels
              money from the masses to a common pool, of which a percentage is
              drawn to rebate people monthly, and the rest invested into
              low-risk, high-return businesses, of which a portion of the profits
              are drawn back to further rebate these “investors”. For those who
              solely invest their cash, if all goes well, they would get back the
              maximum rebate amount in a short time. For those who wish to market
              this plan, it works well too, as long as there is proof of rebate
              and a proper commission scheme.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Making a logical comparison, the government
              bodies and public / private banks are not very much different. One
              the surface, the govt collects taxes and charges (and CPF), and
              makes investments here and there to increase their reserves. Banks
              take your money to do the same. Rebates are in cash or kind, and
              often a very low percentage of the invested amount. Below the
              surface these institutions simply take the fruit of your labour and
              regulate your consumption by giving you “money”, so that you don’t
              consume so much to the extent they have nothing to consume. A more

              perspectives:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As with any business, you always seek the
              fastest way to make money. JP came up with this brilliant idea of
              take money from the public, using an MLM model of run a money game
              that rebates substantially and yet gives him the capital to start /
              buyout profitable business entities. <span> </span>Logically everyone gains, so the plan explodes.
              Housewives and students suddenly draw 5 to 6 figure income streams,
              and everyone is happy.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              leaders and management continued to push for sales, without ever
              looking at the possible ripples of having ATM machines emptied
              every other day. To most people, and perhaps JP and friends, as
              long as everyone is happy things should be ok.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

              Authorities</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From the viewpoint of national income, with
              this plan rolling money around and out to investments in foreign
              land, with no particular channel of gain for the government, this
              is not a good business. Large incomes are drawn, and little taxes
              are paid, plus the outflow of funds to aid the development of
              foreign infrastructures.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">To banks, imagine have millions of dollars
              withdrawn per month. I think this is quite
              direct.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Quite simply put, this whole episode can be
              described as a conflict of interests. What SE is doing is directly
              drawing resources of out the authorities’ resource pool, and making
              money elsewhere, and giving people a chance to report a less
              transparent income statement. What the government is doing is
              trying to stop SE before it grows to a size beyond their control,
              for if it does, it may almost topple the system of slavery. What
              would slave-masters do without their obedient
              slaves?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Regarding the issue of whether CAD froze
              the funds or not, it is up to the individual to imagine. I can only
              say, think logically, and would it be better for JP and gang to run
              away with the money, or to keep the ball rolling? I leave the
              answer to you, readers.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I sometimes marvel at how we Singaporeans
              can take in information wholesale from the press that is ranked as
              one of the last in the world, and a monopolized government
              comprising of ministers that draw 6-figure
              salaries.</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Then again, this is perhaps success in
              propaganda, for the best slaves are those who think they are
              free.</span></span></p>
