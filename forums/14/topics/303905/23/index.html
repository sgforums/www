              Phang was in the news back in October 2007 after his multilevel

              <p>Another man, Sunshine's president (Asia Pacific) Jackie Hoo Choon
              Cheat, 29, faced 10 charges including running a fraudulent business.
              Two other people, including Phang's wife, also faced related charges in
              court yesterday.</p>
              <p>The main charge alleged that the two central figures were running
              a Ponzi-like scheme involving many millions of dollars raised from
              members of the public.</p>
              <p>In Ponzi schemes, investors are lured to hand over cash on
              the promise of high returns - but the returns simply come from funds
              pumped in by new investors.</p>
              <p>The charges allege that Sunshine, based at Toa Payoh HDB Hub,
              was selling packages which offered returns in the form of cash rebates.
              The returns were paid from the proceeds of packages bought by later
              Sunshine participants.</p>
              <p>According to Deputy Public Prosecutor April Phang, the
              revenue generated by Sunshine, which has a paid-up capital of $150,000,
              between August 2006 and November 2007 totalled $189 million.</p>
              <p>It is believed that many investors have their money stuck
              with the company and it is unclear whether they can get it back in
              full.</p>
              <p>Phang and Hoo also faced charges of failing to maintain proper accounts.</p>
              <p>The criminal breach of trust charges involve nearly $1 million.
              Criminal breach of trust takes place when an offender has the
              responsibility of holding money or assets on behalf of others but
              misuses the funds by using them for other purposes. The maximum penalty
              is life imprisonment, along with possible fines.</p>
              <p>In addition, Phang faced six charges of falsifying accounts
              and two related to possessing obscene films. Phang's wife, Neo Kuon
              Huay, 46, was charged with falsifying accounts in relation to sums
              exceeding $592,800.</p>
              <p>A director of Empire Investment Group, Yong Wai Hong, 27, was
              charged with making false declarations involving $1.45 million. This
              had allegedly given Sunshine participants the false sense that its
              affiliated firms have strong financial standing.</p>
              <p>Yong is also chairman and chief executive of a Hong
              Kong-listed firm Emcom International, which was acquired using
              Sunshine's sale proceeds.</p>
              <p>The prosecutor, Ms Phang, added that the bulk of Phang and Neo's assets are in Hong Kong bank accounts.</p>
              <p>Three of the accused, apart from Yong, were arrested on Monday
              afternoon and spent that night in remand. Yong was on police bail then.</p>
              <p>Ms Phang stated that all four are considered a 'high flight
              risk' as CAD has information that they are involved in some business in
              Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Their passports were impounded and bail was set at $600,000
              for each of them. Last evening, they were released on bail and were
              driven away in a convoy of Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs.</p>
              <p>They were represented by lawyers Noor Mohamed Marican and Subhas Anandan.</p>
              <p>Phang, who has four children aged 15 to 23, was addressed as 'Lao Da' ('chief' in Mandarin) as he got into his car.</p>
              <p>The Empire Group Alliance, a group spanning several Asian
              countries, was set up in 2003. It claimed to have interests in network
              marketing, entertainment, energy, real estate and telecommunications.</p>

                                      indicated that the video is 'Back online, due to popular demand...'
                                      The video has a unnamed narrator introducing the video in mandarin.
                                      The opening shot shows a BMW car that is registered as '<strong>SGT
                                      8554C'</strong> being driven. 17 Sunshine Empire Merchants were
                                      subsequently introduced with their vehicle and each Merchant had a
                                      short 'thank you' speech in mandarin except Andrew Boo, Ho Ming
                                      Jie, 22, Tan Yuan Jie, 23. A Volkswagon Beetle was also seen and
                                      linked to Loy Mei Khay, 24 the first female to appear in the video
                                      who also thanked 'Mr Jackie'. A BMW Z4 linked to Xu Jia Yuan was
                                      not seen clearly in the video and a Mercedes Benz linked to Sally
                                      Cheng &amp; Goh Tiam Hai was also not seen. The second last closing
                                      shot shows a BMW car that is registered '<strong>SFX
                                      4086D'</strong> being driven along roads in <a title="Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>. The video end with the Logo of Sunshine
                                      Empire being shown. No specific details were given by the 17
                                      merchants on how they attained or achieved their car, their roles
                                      or position in Sunshine Empire were also not given. The video has a
                                      total view of 5783 as of February 2009. It is notable that for
                                      those appearing in the video, that the first person practically all
                                      of the recipients professed their gratitude to, was James Phang
                                      with only a few exceptions. The method of addressing him as "Lao
                                      Da" were existent in the days of James' earlier MLM incarnation

              <div class="node-byline">BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN<br></div>
              <p>Â </p>
              <div class="node-datestamp">Wednesday, February 18, 2009</div>
              <p><br> MORE than 6,000 Bruneians, who had invested millions of dollars in
              Sunshine Empire, a Singapore-based company, face uncertain future as
              the company has been recently charged with running a Ponzi-like scheme.<br><br>The
              company's CEO James Phang Wah, 49, and President James Hoo Choon Cheat,
              29, were charged by Singapore authorities with nearly 20 charges
              including running a fraudulent business and criminal breach of trust as
              reported by the Straits Times in Singapore, three days ago.<br><br><img title="Sunshine Empire Scam" src="http://www.bt.com.bn/en/files/images/photos/2009-02-18/sunshine.jpg" border="0" alt="Sunshine Empire Scam" align="right">The
              individuals, who were interviewed by The Brunei Times prefer to remain
              anonymous for security reasons, were also considered as "merchants" for
              the country, in-charge of being the centre for the exchange of the
              "e-points", the term the company used for the monthly "dividends" paid
              out electronically based on US dollars, and cash collection from new
              investors.<br><br>However, the individuals said they were lured into
              the business by its extravagant offers and were victims themselves due
              to the legal representation the company posed during its marketing
              campaigns and extravagant offerings. Some even said that their lives
              have been ruined financially and they have lost all credibility in the
              eyes of the public, who labelled them as "cheats". <br><br>Harun, a
              previous "merchant", said that the president of the company, James Hoo,
              used to visit Brunei Darussalam frequently during the early stages for
              marketing. The company through its investors had also set up an
              establishment here which closed down early last year when Sunshine
              Empire stopped its payments, last year. <br><br>As the establishment
              attracted more investors, the tasks of marketing were handed to
              executives from Malaysia and locals, he said, adding that the all
              expenses paid training courses abroad dubbed 'Leadership courses' were
              held in Genting Highlands, Malaysia and Jakarta.<br><br>Cash incentives
              amounting to hundreds of thousands of US dollars and luxury vehicles
              were also given to "extraordinary" achievers, he said which drove them
              to market company's products aggressively. <br><br>Kamal, who gave up
              his position as a teacher, was also offered an executive role plus
              commission on profits from the company. "All I had to do is spend
              around $12,000 to buy 'GP's' or merchant status and I was earning
              almost $3,000- 6,000 a month in dividends, excluding the amount I
              earned through the exchange rates and commission on my group's
              earnings, which I was entitled to due to my leadership status," he
              said. He said he lost it all when he re-invested into another company
              in Hong Kong. <br><br>The dividends, both said, were given through
              personal online accounts and were either wired to their respective bank
              accounts or had to be sold to new "investors" which led to a form of
              trade involving unregulated foreign exchange rates.<br><br>Due to the
              benchmark with the US Dollar, the latter mode of withdrawal was said to
              be the most profitable and the most common way to get fast income as
              the foreign exchange rate could be fixed higher than finance
              institutions and cash was used.<br><br>Hjh K, a government official who
              had just retired, had almost exhausted her entire life savings by
              investing in the company. "I invested about $60,000 when I attended
              their leadership course. I know some other individuals who invested
              thrice that amount. The company had a lot of projects which I later
              found out did not exist. I will never see that money again," she said. <br><br>To
              guard public against such schemes, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) is
              stepping up awareness programmes against Ponzi-like, illegal or
              fraudulent schemes and to curb such activities. The ministry has also
              urged that public members could contact it should they need
              clarification on companies offering investment products. (JNB1)<br><br>The Brunei Times</p>
