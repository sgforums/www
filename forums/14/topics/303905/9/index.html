              <p>The photocopying section in Copyright Law states that you cannot copy a piece of  copyrighted work unless if it is for your own research and personal use, and even then, only a 'reasonable amount' (about 10% of the copyrighted work) can be photocopied.</p>
              <p>So you're saying that the CAD letter can be considered to be a work of art that is entitled to copyright protection? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Unless if CAD had specifically stated that the letter is not to be reproduced in any form, sorry, your 'photocopying law' explanation doesn't hold much water. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Actually, I agree that verification should come directly from CAD, not from some piece of paper.</p>
              <p>It's just like if someone shows up from your door claiming to be from a govt agency and shows you his ID card. You are supposed to take his ID card and call back to that agency to verify that the person is who he claims he is, as well as verify that his stated purpose is accurate.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's reasonable for any company to post up a the notice that their accounts are frozen.</p>
              <p>On the flip side, although I understand that CAD has the ability to freeze a company's accounts, I think they would only do so in the most extreme cases. Freezing a company's accounts is basically a death sentence for a company - it can not longer function. It seems very unfair to punish a company in that way just because it's being investigated.</p>

              <p>if so, what SE has on their hand is dubious. Its appalling such thing would just be merely shown over counter.</p>
              <p>Freezing accounts is a death knell for any company, but I believe CAD would only do it if there is a strong case for it. CAD themselves know the implications of any of their action. It was stated in the ST article few years ago that CAD investigations can last a few months at the minimum, and the case is not discussed with the media or public as they know the negative impact produced by such discussions. Thats why I believe CAD is not rash in this matter.</p>
              <p>I am just curious as to this notice of freezing accounts and the way it is handled. If verification should come from CAD, why is SE showing just a piece of paper over the counter?  Since SE is the one giving such notice, and witholding cash from their members, its their responsiblity to prove what they said. So far, as we all have noticed, such news only come from SE. Its superbly unbelievable.</p>

              <p><br>This investigations involved multi-millions or even billion of dollars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It only started in Nov and now it's just past 3.5 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Members of Public put in that kind of money into a non-existent Taiwan project, and a internet-based shopping mall that closed down and changed to another.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Millions of dollars were supposedly paid to SE merchants through these 2 ventures. Empire Property Venture does not pay even a single cent to SE Merchant. (On the opposite, SE Merchants put in money!!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the a plausible probablity is the Merchants are paid through the recruitment of new Merchants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IN fact, run through the entire <a href="http://www.sunshine-empire.com/singaporev3/eng/news.asp">News Section</a> of SE, it will mostly talk about sales and re-entry of new and own Merchants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And on its International President, google his names and you will find he has bought and invested in his own capacity, many companies with millions of dollars. 1 example is to study carefully <a href="http://gem.ednews.hk/listedco/listconews/gem/20080204/GLN20080204055.pdf">this document</a>. Read the number of companies and $$ put in by Mr James. Just remember that EMCOM International is totally not related to Empire Communications (EMCOM) that we know, and has absolutely nothing to do with SE Merchants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the <a href="http://www.empirepropertyventure.com/">http://www.empirepropertyventure.com/</a>, under the Company Profile, 2 names were mentioned:- 1st is a  <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Empire Properties Venture Sdn. Bhd</span>, which is listed as "DORMANT" with last audited statements dating year 2003 showing a loss, and the 2nd is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Empire Property Venture International Sdn. Bhd</span>, formed only in Jan 2007, and has ZERO  information to its finance sheet. (That means no business activity)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A 3rd company surfaces in connection with their Malaysia projects, which is <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Empire Worldwide</strong> Sdn Bhd</span>, (source <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/9/15/nation/18895403&amp;sec=nation">here</a>). This 3rd company is formed in July 2006, is listed as a 'TRADING" company and has no business information from that time. So many similairly named companies in one venture ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Interestingly, the experiences and involvement of its 'PRINCIPALS" have been used as its own....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"The principals of Empire Properties have over 10 years of combined experience in the development industry and have been involved in the development many successful projects such as Bandar Alam Perdana, Selangor."</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SE Merchants like to post in their blogs that 'WE' (meaning SE) have bought this, or that, buy over this and that.... but don't they know that they are just merchants on a e-commerce platform to sell their goods and products?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Jackie Hoo has publicly said these so-call affiliated companies are unrelated. That is actually a BIG REVELATION because of the huge amount of money people put in, and expecting to get back every month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a great veil placed over many eyes. Many SE Leaders are too caught up in the easy money game as well.. so much that to 'reach the Top', get the car funds, etc overrides all other thoughts. Even the thought that "Hey, we are being investigated by the Police" didn't sink in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The SE Merchant signup in the paper form shows SE Singapore. The online version shows SE Malaysia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So it is not an easy issue for CAD. This is much much more complicated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We can only wait impatiently.</p>

              <p>This is pure speculation, and of course, I've never seen the letter from CAD, so don't hold me to any of this.</p>
              <p>Assuming that CAD did put some restrictions on the account, I suspect what CAD did was to prohibit the transfer of large sums of money overseas. I think that's fairly standard practice. You don't want to allow the company to take the money and run. However, they can still access the accounts to pay for operating expenses. Eg. Their office lease, electricity bill, salaries, etc.</p>
              <p>Of course, to SE, that probably effectively makes the account frozen.</p>

              <p>Wanna know whether SE accounts under freeze?</p>
              <p>One of the ways is to personally go down to toa payoh and conduct an 'observation' when you are free...</p>
              <p>Before 14 November 2007, usually everyday there were three things which happened:</p>
              <p>1) at the HDB hub level 1, the Mos burger, mcdonald (around evening timing) you will be able to see many of those SE merchants doing presentations to the clients.</p>
              <p>2) In the office usually, almost all the seats would be taken up by those aunties and uncles going through presentation with the members.</p>
              <p>3) The traffic in the office would be quite crowded, you could even see many of the rooms with plasma TV, some managers doing a 'mass presentation' to at least 5 people.</p>
              <p>All these happended before the so called "freezing period".</p>
              <p>Now if you go down and see yourself, you should 'aga aga' know whether it is true that their accounts being frozen.  Preferred timing would be after 6pm.</p>
              <p>From what I heard, now instead of $700USD monthly returns has dropped drastically to only $200USD for their GP plan. (not enought information)</p>
              <p>Is SE funds running dry? I dunno</p>
              <p>And so far I have asked a question to some members from SE, but none provide a good reason/answer.  Where is 'Empire Worldwide"?  According to their website under affliation, its claim to be one of the subsidaries dealing with insurance.  The only answer they can give me is, "no news yet", which already for so long still no news?  Firstly is there even an existence, no website, no news, no facilites, no advertisement for this Empire Worldwide, if they really sell insurance, by now they should have been registered under the Act in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>CAD: The investigation against Sunshine Empire Pte Ltd is still in progress. Information on the outcome of the investigation would be provided on CAD website in due course. </p>
              <p>4 Feb 2008</p>
              <p>Well personally I think cad is saying something like "just be patient, update will be given", just in a professional manner, Lol they are also quite under pressure course SE is a hot matters. hahaha.. </p>

              <p>For those of you who do not have the honor of knowing this guy, let me congratulate you on your luck.</p>
              <p>He is one of the most irritating people I have ever met in my life. When I hear him laugh, I feel like killing myself so I won't be able to hear the sound. When he smiles, I don't know whether to smile back or to kick a football between the giant gap between his front teeth.</p>
              <p>But, I digress.</p>
              <p>Maybe its another unverifyable source, but basically from day 1 I have been spreading the same warning about SE. I'm glad Finally someone can verify what I said is true abour SE abandoning Singapore and the loophole they are now using to still recruit more people.</p>
              <p>I'm sure CAD will complete their investigation soon and the truth will be brought to light. I'm sure this Ignious' remarks about Singapore govt will work out against him.</p>
              <p>What a foolish kid.</p>

              <p>Brains got his point, cad investigation does not matter once SE itself make the first move to macau.</p>
              <p>See, now they blame it on the government, those SEs are behaving like those  terrorists claiming rights against the government for their beliefs, in the finance world. because of $$$$$, they become rebels.</p>
              <p>In the first place, their arrogance already claimed that MAs got nothing to do with them and they were so bold in planting their foot in Singapore without following the regulations, Ma jiam they have already conquered singapore.  So now they have to pay for their arrogance and they're going to do it again to other countries. </p>
              <p>The same problem SE has is always 'on the government sector' in other countries as well, so now you know how rebellious they are.</p>
              <p>I hope those goon dus overseas will realise their money being corned.</p>
              <p>The golden principle still prevails: '''' There is no short cut to success! '''' , those contravence to this principle eventually got eaten up by their own greed and lust.</p>
