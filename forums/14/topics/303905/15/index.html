              <p>It's been a loooooooong time since I've posted, previously I was "shapeshifter".</p>
              <p>Anyway, I read somewhere along this thread about the march28 court review wrt to SE? Anyone got anything on that?</p>
              <p>My concern is that, if SE is allowed somewhat to continue to change its name (again, to another dumb sounding one) and therein continue its operations in Singapore, what does this mean about the investigations? Could someone please ask CAD because it's sending the clear indication to current members and bystanders that everything is alright now - uplines can go tell all the auntie jennys that accounts will be unfrozen, name is changed because nothing is found against them etc etc.</p>
              <p>True, I read and I've personally seen people dropping out of school just to devote their time to this. It gives all uplines more guts to say that people would readily throw education away because of the "so easy to make money why need to study" rhetoric. This is very disturbing.</p>
              <p>Also, I was amused when that Aunt Jenny is like begging people to hope the best for her: "All we need now is hope... hoping that nothing happens to them and we can get back our monies like what was before" when no, the bulk of us weren't swayed by greed and lack of a critical mind to question exactly how SE works. No one owes you anything to "talk less" woman.</p>
              <p>Someone should just go in, tape the rubbish they're spewing in their meetings, and send to CAD. I believe in justice. I don't believe in pity.</p>

              <p>And why would CAD be surprised that SE can continue pay SOME (definitely not all of its members) of its members. If this is the case perhaps CAD has failed to comprehend exactly the business model of SE, and its multitude of overseas finances that it is pooling around to keep its operations and empty promises alive.</p>
              <p>Look at this poor chap from Brunei. No investigations there whatsoever, so why is he not getting the money? Where is the money? <a href="http://brunei-sunshine-empire.blogspot.com/">http://brunei-sunshine-empire.blogspot.com/</a> Seems he was so excited by his initial reward.</p>
              <p>It's a social responsibility to help CAD.</p>

              <p>SE planning to fully refund back capital to SE agents (those making loss) within the next 6 months. They are beefing up all brain washing techniques used by Hitler, Osama, Saddam and gang to entice/seduce/cheat these agents into re-investing into their new wonder land EmMax which will be HQ in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Its even MORE OBVIOUS now that their accounts ARE NOT FREEZED and its also even MORE bloody OBVIOUS that the reason why they are not able to pay out is because there's less people signing up and its even GOD DAMN OBVIOUS now that their so called online shopping empire and all their fantasy projects generate income only enough to feed the dogs and cats in the park nearest to your home AND NOT ENOUGH to pay every single ignorant agents OUT there.</p>
              <p>EmMax's possibly of getting a Casino is ONLY POSSIBLE if James Phang knows OR can manipulate Stanley Ho (google his name if you dont know). License for a Casino in Macau is monopolized by the underworld, meaning even if you have cash also no use. This is everyone's knowledge.</p>

              <p>They said want to build underwater hotel in Sabah? What happened?</p>
              <p>Then said will make 90% of Taichung wireless. What happened?</p>
              <p>They prided giving many times of capital back as payout. What happened?</p>
              <p>They can shift buildings from one part of KL to the other, change designs midway. Why?</p>
              <p>They shift entire buildings around Malacca resort project, even after it's been sold. Why?</p>
              <p>Even the promo video shows the wrong site for the project. Why?</p>
              <p>Only selling to SE members. Such a small pool of customers, and yet claiming projects are nearly sold out. You sure?</p>
              <p>Why never advertise in Wall Street Journal since it's such a "revolutionary business idea"? The whole world would love to hear about it. Who knows THE Warren Buffett might also invest?</p>
              <p>Why expand so rapidly? Have you got any basic business sense? No solid foundation want to expand so big?</p>
              <p>No experience in property and yet building so many huge projects all at once. Where do you get the capital?</p>
              <p>Wireless infrastructure, need permit. Need lots of money. Have you got what it takes? Still claim you're doing wireless there when it's been exposed as nonexistant.</p>

              <p>Anyway, James Pang is still around. It makes no sense for him to run away. SE is still open. You can go take a look if you want to. SE has been acquitted of "scamming" people; just waiting for MAS to unfreeze their accounts.</p>

              <p>so with the Em-Max company, the SE will forget about all the other so called projects undertaken with SE? That's a lot of money and resources gone (which no company can really tahan to throw away) if they abandon the projects.... So what's EM-Max business about?  Add a casino licence (from where hah?, how to get, why so sudden) and then the rest exactly same things as SE? Then why should anyone invest in this new company? It is clear bull to steer away from the legalities of the business if its just to make SE a shell and thus "need" a new company to carry on business.. SE change name like change underwear. Don't know which other company does that? Don't know which other big, intellectual, international consortium does that? Ha Ha.</p>
              <p>Then the JP still the new International President with the JH the CEO? Don't you know that when a company fails, the head of the company takes the most blame, the CEO is usually axed and a more competent one takes over? If not, repeat cycle is almost certain and company failure is almost guaranteed. This is indeed bad news for company and "investors". CEO heads NTI, NTI fails, CEO heads SE, SE fails, I think it is quite dumb to have the same CEO again. (Or maybe, the supporters will say that he deserve another chance, that who doesn't fail, that he is brave to stand up against adversity again blah blah blah.... I don't buy it and in the real world, people don't buy it).</p>
              <p>Also in the real world, when consultants (in this case, the International President is being announced as "advisor" and not anyway related owner of company) fail, companies also fire the consultants for doing a bad consulting job. So by right, SE should fire its consultants and advisors, don't you think? Ha Ha... it would be funny to see that come through.....</p>
              <p>Oh well, can we keep this thread alive so that the nw Em-Max thread has a reference point for their new Em-Max members or "investors"? Ha ha.</p>
              <p>I just keep "Ha Ha" but I am not happy at all. SInce I begun to voice my thoughts regarding SE, it has always been about the ignorance of the elders who poured in their retirement monies into this scheme. I hope they manage to get some capital back but I doubt everyone will get as the probably already hide everything away to set up many more schemes like Em-Max and more projects like don't know what wireless, what underwater, what amusement park, what condo, whatever.... Bear in mind that even if these projects are fake, they still need money to project the right look. Hire web designers, content writers, designers, contractors, rent equipment, invest in important people like ministers maybe, entertainment expenses etc etc...  everything needs money. And you know where that money comes from.</p>

              <p>He uses his charisma like Adolf Hitler. By priding himself, using strong self glamorising words, and people to support him, he slowly builds up a fan base. Then he started to use pity trick.. say "how badly he fell and stood up"... blah blah blah... he uses this trick over and over again.. it just goes round in circles.</p>
