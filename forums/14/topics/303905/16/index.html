              <p>He uses his charisma like Adolf Hitler. By priding himself,
              using strong self glamorising words, and people to support him, he
              slowly builds up a fan base. Then he started to use pity trick..
              say "how badly he fell and stood up"... blah blah blah... he uses
              this trick over and over again.. it just goes round in circles.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It's just a bit simmilar to what i meant..</p>
              <p>Below might be helpful to those guys who don't know his tricks (it's a short discription- want proof (newspapers included) to cross-reference with what i mention, PM me individually)</p>
              <p>1- Pushes the blame to the contractor saying not his fault</p>
              <p>2- Saying that the 'investors' have seen the project already, but the fact is, he is showing investors what's not his property to begain with. (em com good example)</p>
              <p>3- After showing of a real property which belongs to his partner rather than his, he rides on the belief and trust of his new-found 'investors' than throw in a few more projects, which thus need not bring them to the site and able to get them to throw the capital/cash into his pockets..as the trust (of greediness) is already being built through clever usage of words, masking of true details etc.</p>
              <p>4- Showing fake/misleading documents are their strong points..unless you know how to verify the relervent documents, with 99.99% of the 'investors' and 'distributors' don't know - that's how the transaction is closed using a lot of young adults who knows nothing and getting of older citizens who are outdated and lost touch with the IT industry thus able to get what they want.</p>
              <p>5- When the project is near to failing, he will slowly find means to first reduce the amount of payment to their investors, giving only slightly less of the original amount to the investors (only investors whom he thinks can help him gather more cash than will he gives out the 'dividends'</p>
              <p>6- For investors whom he thinks only is for money and will not pass the news, he will conduct a seminar to tell alll the useless investors (of no use to him already) that the site has already being taken down, and the govt have stepped in thus he can't pay back the dividends as all are stucks (frozen)</p>
              <p>7- If the situation continue to worsen as time pass, he will than give new updates of the company's projects development saying lost of revenue etc to futher deduce the amount of money paid to 'investors' as dividends thus pocketing huge amount of money himself</p>
              <p>8- Similarly at the same time, he will think of memo and write out notification and warn 'distributors' about irresponsible 'investors/distributors' which caused the company to have negative press coverage thus finding excuses to stop their account and pocketing the remaining balance due for payment to the 'investors' as dividends.</p>
              <p>9- When he sense something wrong/un-stable already, he will than think of new tricks to trick the current pool of 'investors/distributors' who still aren't aware of the situation into believing of the new project.</p>
              <p>Actually he already got plans to back-up for every single project that he creates, within a few months of commencement of new project, another project comes into the picture to invisiblely transfer the funds to another project while the govt checks on the current project, the funds are already removed thus he's found not guilty.</p>
              <p>10- He likes to use relationship and jokes to pull the crowd of 'investors/distributors' closer to him so that the bond is built for he to make use through continuous seminars and talks and showing of videos and giving of classes to physco the people going through all these stuffs without them knowing anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NOTE: ppl who wants to help their friends to get out of the current project..can ask me for help, but i'll only be able to help those who are still concious, and not those already being washed into believing that they are living in la la land..</p>

              <p><strong>SUNSHINE EMPIRE SINGAPORE</strong> CLOSING DOWN AND CHANGING NAME TO EMMAX AFTER INVESTIGATED BY CAD</p>
              <p><strong>SUNSHINE EMPIRE MALAYSIA</strong> RAIDED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS<br><br><strong>Evil can never out do Justice.</strong><br><br><strong>A favourite question</strong> that SE agents like to pose to 'Unbeliever' like me is : "WHY would our father James Phang be here with all his family if he has intentions to scam us?"</p>
              <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Singapore is the only safe enough country for him and his family to settle down after all his 'wonderful deeds' done in Malaysia and Indonesia in the 90s. Dont believe? Just check with those uplines of yours that's really close to him - ask them what does James Phang do before NOP?</p>

              <p>To those who still in dream with James's dream...  (magic world of kingdom...)  let me ask a few questions here,</p>
              <ol>
              <li>in the eye of laws, talks or 'black and white', which is important?</li>
              <li>moving to an online company from base in a country, is it safe?</li>
              <li>who can you look for, in the case of company "gone in the air"?</li>
              <li>what is the history about the past of James? since NOP... (NOP - selling places for 'dead', magic kingdom, 'china dream', sunshine, and now - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">EM-MAX.COM</span></span>.  What next?</li>
              <li>currently, CAD (singapore) follow by indonesia, korea, etc... now with bank negara malaysia (these illegal activities are offences under subsection 25(1) Bank and financial institutions act 1989 (BAFIA), subsection 4(1) of Anti-<span style="color: #ff0000;">Money Laundering</span> and Anti-<span style="color: #ff0000;">Terrorism Financing</span> act 2001 (AMLA) respectively.) What will be next?</li>
              <li>for the form that they asking (maybe forcing) the members to sign at current. is it a form of transfer or resignation/termination on sunshine?  the form for em-max, is it a member or merchantship application?</li>
              <li>is there any mention of refunds or amount mention in the form? isn't it so rush to get ppl signing at the moment (since the case is till ongoing)?<br></li>
              <li>is this "once the company accepts the resignation/self-terminations of merchantship, .... to the said merchantship <span style="color: #ff0000;">shall be forfeited</span>." stated in the form for sunshine?</li>
              <li>is this "... reserves the right to accept or reject any application form for any reason <span style="color: #ff0000;">at its discretion</span>....." stated in form for emmax?</li>
              <li>do you think gov of each country are really free to do all this?  isn't them protecting their ppl from been hurt badly?</li>
              <li>Ever mention in st.time (singapore), members are advise to wait and dun do anything till the outcome release by CAD, isn't it?</li>
              <li>Are we joining their project of tech, or others?</li>
              <li>Isn't their role to inform us about any news or whatever at point of time?  Have they done it?</li>
              <li>After joining, why are we been ask to be here and there, just like 'toy', isn't it?  or to some, been a 'toy' is fun?<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>For those who still in dream: Please go through my questions and listen to your heart and not others.  What and where is the real logic (law) or life, in here or we facing?</p>
              <p>In the eye of laws, you can have someone telling you stories over days or years, and when you sign a paper of your agreement within min, law will only take in the paper.  This is the real world.</p>

              <p>News has it that all those who bought GPs and SPs ahve received notification that their EmCall subscription will be cancelled. HAHA.</p>
              <p>So as Em-max website has put it, EmCall seems to be really going under its wing and Sunshine left to just slowly rot. What I'm wondering though, if Sunshine agents can so easily change to Em-max within Singapore's premises, does that mean they are allowed by the authorities to continue their operations here, in just a different name??</p>
              <p>I hope not. I don't intend to pray that people get back their money. I think it's time that those who have been laughing at non-members for being stupid or not opportunistic enough get burned no end. I don't have any obligation to hope the best for these creeps.</p>

              (MLM) firm Sunshine Empire are crying foul after their monthly cash
              rebates were discontinued.<br> <br> Many are also now worried about losing their principal sums worth millions of dollars.<br> <strong><br> Several participants have told The Straits Times that they have been
              offered an option by their 'upline' - the person who recruited them to
              Sunshine - to cancel their accounts in Singapore and transfer them to a
              Hong Kong company called EmMax.<br> </strong><br> They have been told that once the Hong Kong business is built up, their rebates will start flowing again.<br> <br> The Straits Times reported in November that the Commercial Affairs
              Department (CAD) was investigating Sunshine, as its activities appeared
              more like those of a pure investment scheme, for which it was not
              licensed.<br> <br> The firm invites people to become 'merchants' of online goods, ranging
              from health supplements to electronics. Concerns centre on the fact
              that participants can potentially pocket big monthly 'rebates', which
              are not guaranteed, without ever buying or selling these goods.<br> <br> The rebates are based on the participants' cash outlay, as well as Sunshine's global turnover.<br> <br> Six Sunshine participants were applying for refunds when The Straits
              Times visited the company's headquarters in Toa Payoh yesterday.<br> <br> One, who declined to be named, said he placed $12,500 in a gold plan in
              August. He received two monthly rebates of about $700 each, but these
              stopped once the CAD began its investigation.<br> <br> Another participant, who also sought anonymity, said she was 'very
              worried' about losing her savings of $35,000, which she placed in four
              gold plans from November to early this year. Her rebates have ceased in
              recent months.<br> <br> 'If Sunshine is declared bankrupt, I will not get my money back,' she said. 'Can the authorities give direction on what to do?'<br> <br> She will not transfer her accounts to Hong Kong, as she is unsure if the move is legal because of the ongoing investigation.<br> <strong><br> Sunshine adviser and spokesman James Phang denied any knowledge of the
              alleged Hong Kong option when he spoke to The Straits Times recently.<br> <br> 'I'm under investigation, so I'm not at liberty to reveal anything,' he said.</strong><br> <br> 'To my knowledge, there were no meetings at Sunshine (about the Hong
              Kong option). People can come in and out. They can join any company. I
              have no control over the members. They are independent people.'<br> <br> Mr Phang did confirm that Sunshine had stopped giving rebates in the past few months.<br> <br> It was earlier reported that Mr Phang was linked to a failed investment
              scheme that resulted in 1,000 Singaporeans losing about $2 million.<br> <br> The Consumers Association of Singapore's executive director, Mr Seah
              Seng Choon, cautioned participants against transferring their money to
              Hong Kong, as it would put their investment outside Singapore's
              jurisdiction.<br> <br> 'Recovering money from a foreign entity is always difficult if the
              company is unable to continue its operation here as a result of the
              current investigation,' he said.<br> <br> Mr Seah advised consumers unprepared to stomach further risks to ask Sunshine for refunds - advice he also gave in November. <strong>He urged consumers to report to the police any new development or changes made by Sunshine.</strong><br> <br> Sunshine was placed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's investor
              alert list in September. This means it is not allowed to conduct
              regulated activities.<br> <br> It is reported to have attracted 20,000 clients since it set up in Singapore in July last year.<br> <br> The police declined to comment yesterday, as its investigation was still ongoing.<br> <br> <a href="mailto:lorna@sph.com.sg">lorna@sph.com.sg</a></span></p>

              <p>So now no more SE supporter come in forum liao? all shitting bricks and sucking thumbs at home?</p>
              <p>Long time ago warn all the people already but no one believe. Thanks to Straits Times for following up on this news.</p>
              <p>Thanks for CAD patience in investigating this case, giving james phang and gang more and more rope to slowly hang themselves.</p>
              <p>Jackie hoo, or jackies downlines, I ask you again. Is it worth it to go to jail for JAMES PHANG? Isn't it better to cooperate with the authorities and stop spreading the poison? Jackie should testify and against james phang, the real person behind these scams because even jackie hoo is just a pawn to be used by him and when the time is right like now, to be discarded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wake up! the company is under YOUR name. YOU will be the one suffering while James Phang is shedding crocodile tears for you outside. If you lucky he will continue spreading the scams and praise you for being a hero and blame the authorities. If you unlucky he will go around blaming YOU for the failure of SE and badmouthing you while you ARE IN PRISON.</p>
