              <p>Casino is in Macau as told. Anyway there are some loyal Sunshine fans out there that is still crazy enough to buy up EPs from other investors.</p>

              <p>Common unofficial conspiracy theory/opinion...</p>
              <p>The reason why your <strong>SG GP</strong> shows <strong>Zero CRP</strong> is because SE
              needs to maintain the CRP quota at 600-700+ e-points to maintain
              consumer/brand loyalty and confidence for SE as a <em>legalised loop-hole 'money game'</em>. Since SE sales in SG drop drastically since the smear campaign began in Oct 2007, it was mathematically impossible to maintain the <strong>BRM verbally promised monthly e-points of 700-800+ e-point (S$1100-1300)</strong> as <strong>SG SEM contribute to 60% of total sales.</strong></p>
              <p>If it were calculated based on <strong>10% global turnover</strong> as agreed in the <strong>International Merchant Agreement Form (IMAF), </strong>CRP
              for other countries will be adversely/deceased affected due to the media
              harrassents launched by the government bodies such as MediaCorp and SPH
              in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This is my explanation of why CRP for this month paid on 15th Mar 08 is so high; and it seems even CAD was surprised.</p>

              <p>what next??!! [/quote]</p>
              <p>Hi Honey.cute55.</p>
              <p>Please don't hearsay, ok? To what i read, you sound excited of what going to happen. Why are you exciting anyway?</p>
              <p>If you want accurate information, please go to the customer officer, alright?</p>
              <p><br>Who say Sunshine Empire is going to close down? They only going to change name.</p>
              <p>Yes, the new company name is Em-Max.</p>
              <p>Who say that the merchant can't get their money back? When Em-Max is open or before its open, the Merchant have to go back to their upperline for details of how to cash out.</p>
              <p>Last time, SE giving back profit by 10% and no one believe it, so, they changing the profit by 5%.<br>There had been many misunderstanding and miscommuncation on SE.</p>
              <p>If you guys are understanding people and/or receiving updates, you should know where the money go to and forth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those people who push responsibility to others has a greed in their heart.<br>I don't blame them. Humans are greedy and sin anyway.</p>
              <p>If this people scare losses during investment, they shouldn't have invest in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>They should open their heart &amp; mind, and hardworking.</p>
              <p>They shouldn't be lazy. I know that many people like this sentence</p>
              <p>"Let Your Money Work For You". Yes, but they should do some work also,</p>
              <p>before putting any money in it.</p>
              <p><br>These people should know that they can't accept a person word, saying</p>
              <p>"Oh. This Company sure rise" "This Company very popular and you sure earn money". So, they have to do research. Take time and see the company growth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Abductboy, I read some fo your posts. May i know, are you Abductboy in API? And please, if you are not him, dont damage his image, ok?</p>
              <p>I know Abductboy is a good temper &amp; open-minded guy. And i don't want because of you, the public had negative thinking of him.</p>
              <p>We could take SE for example, there's people out there, copy Jame name, sunshine empire name, and SE services.</p>
              <p>And then, many victim fall in it. Many people had bad impression on SE.</p>
              <p>Now that the CAD done some investigation in SE, and people keep having negative thinking and scare this and that. Scare of what? they should know what will happen if they invest int he 1st plae? (Anyway, who say that CAD investigate in SE means SE going to fall? Who say de? Please go do research.)</p>
              <p><br>Is the misunderstanding clear? Anyone still don't understand, please own out.</p>
              <p><br>I go sleep now.</p>

              <p>What have you corrected?</p>
              <p>Professionalism includes addressing issues point by point. What have you addressed, to add to what have you corrected? Sorry dude, but your sentences are incoherent and its bothersome to correct nearly 5 years of poorly typed posts from NTI or SE agents.</p>
              <p>We also do not need points that do not add value, such as, doing homework before joining in an MLM company. How does this address the issues SE is facing? You mean SE agents do not do their homework? Ok, fine by me.</p>
              <p>Ok, people who think MLM is a scam, listen to too much hearsay? How and why?</p>
              <p>Then you jump to 'silent the mind and think'. Huh? KSM? Why the blame on people who has fear about company shutting down? Why cant it be that SE has not been able to prove its investment source, leading to questions over its schemes. Therefore, why put on hearsay when you cant prove what you say?</p>
              <p>Do research yes, we done a lot, no SE agents has answered them, so no point asking us to do research. Like I said, no added value. Answer all issues and questions since 2003 and we can talk about doing research.</p>
              <p>There are forumers who travelled all the way to KL, read Taiwanese websites, surf Malaysia forums and tell you none of what SE has planned have been verified.</p>
              <p>On top of it, it changes its name. Everytime got trouble, change name. Sheesh</p>

              <p>Could someone answer me what happened to Emcom Taichung? Vanished? Or fake?</p>
              <p>How about why keep changing the design for Melaka's resort, even the video shows the wrong site. Or shifting entire buildings? Or how bout the underwater hotel? Where does SE get all the capital to build all these projects all at one go? Does SE/EPV have the experience in property development? Why doesn't SE advertise their grand financial plans in Wall Street Journal? Target it to the whole world instead of through agents. Who knows maybe Gates and Buffett would invest. Why keep on changing name? Something to hide?</p>
