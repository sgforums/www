            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Phaze:</div><div class="quote_body">Okay let me get this straight.<br><br>You call it a sales gimmick. But what you are really saying is that you are going to pay people to buy your cola. You will pay people 20K, over a period of time, to buy 15K of your cola.<br><br>A normal company usually makes money on the margin on their products. So for example, if it costs me 5K to make cola that can sell for 15K, I have 10K margin, which is my profit.<br><br>Now I may offer discounts to give customers an incentive to buy more. So perhaps if they are willing to buy 15K of product. I give them a 1K rebate/discount. If they buy 20K of product, I give a 2K rebate/discount. I basically exchange a lower margin for a higher volume of business. And it only makes sense to reduce the price if the increase in volume more than makes up for the reduction in price.<br><br>But it all boils down to a simple thing - I still need a margin to make a profit.<br><br>Now when I pay someone 20K over time to buy 15K of my cola, I'm making a loss of 5K. The more people buy from me, the more money I lose.<br><br>There are some business models like this. For example, the console gaming industry. The console itself (except for Nintendo) is a loss leader. The console is sold at a loss. However, they hope to make their money back on software sales. That's why a console is a locked down platform. Since the console maker has a monopoly on software releases on their console, they can charge a higher margin on software that justifies the initial loss.<br><br>Profits from one business can also be used to fund another portion of the business. The PS3 line is currently losing money but the company is being sustained by the movie and consumer electronics business. However, this is done with the anticipation that once the PS3 is established, PS3 licensing fees will earn back the money invested.<br><br>The reason why people think SE is a scam is perhaps because of the way it's sold. First of all, SE is not really selling anything. If you promise to pay someone to buy your product, is that really selling? In other words, your cost of sales, your cost of acquiring the customer is higher than the amount you earn from the customer. Also, are people fully aware of the risks involved when they buy? I'm assuming the product sold is e-points.<br><br>It appears troubling that the only cashflow coming in appears to be from new people buying GPs. There also seems to be too many projects going on for all of them to be funded properly.<br><br>Oh well, I would write more except that I have a dinner appointment. Toodles.</div></blockquote>Yup i understand your POV.<br><br>back to the example<br>why i would give back 5k more over time, is because my cola no branding at the moment, and this are the people that put their trust in me even though i have no credibility.<br><br>in this way its more like rewarding the pioneer buyers.<br><br>Normally new concepts take time to digest into society, thats probably why there are groups who condamn sunshine.<br><br></div>

And furthermore, so meaning i buy in lots of "cola" if the branding don't work out i am stuck. Now, the practise like that is unfair to merchants. The money supposedly we put in the money and you guys invest in resort project and whatever projects you guys claim, contradicting. Pardon me, but from the way i see it is that once you guys have sold enough "cola" you will then stop because you guys wouldn't be bothereds if the "cola" works and the money you will invest in the resort or whatsoever that you guys decide to build, so what will happen to stockist of your "cola"s? Thats selfish, irresponsible and thats a scam. Because legally you guys got the funds from the sales of "cola" encourage stock ups and then once funding has reached the sufficent level, thats the end of the "cola" story and basically no one will complain as you guys will say "the "cola" story has become history, we now must look at the property investments".<br>Now, in this instance there is no security to buyers or stockist or investors whatever you name it at all. Business model is really doubtful if its as such.<br>Hope i never offend anyone, apologies if i did. I am only a noob looking at this issue on a layman grounds.</div>

XYZ guarantees 50% returns, capped at 500%, say over the next year or so, payable every month. So first month I'll get $1.50... etc etc... The XYZ Corp gives me 100mins talktime with Redstone Telecoms, and some e-shopping points with XYZ.com online shop.<br><br>Would you be puzzled where does this XYZ corp generate such income?<br><br>The cola example doesn't apply, unless you say you get monetary returns (or rebates whatever you call it) from the shop auntie, that is more than the cost of your initial product. So where does the auntie generate such high income? After all, she's just selling cola right?<br><br>From what I understand, when you buy a GP, you would get free talktime and Emall points, as well as monetary payout am I correct? And if i remember correctly, the monetary payout would be a certain percentage (10% of global turnover) each month, capped at another certain percentage?<br><br>Where does SE generate this income before properties start selling? Thru selling GPs?<br><br>Am I wrong to say it's pumping $ made from selling GPs to those of older membership holders?</div>
