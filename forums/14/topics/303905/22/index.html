              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is an oil nightmare</span></strong> <span><br><br><span>Investors may lose $65 millionfrom alleged pyramid scheme </span><br><br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Friday August 29, 2008<br><br>ESTHER FUNG </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>INVESTING in oil and gas seems to be the in thing these days, but a group of South-east Asian investors risk losing about US$46 million ($65 million) after investing in scheme offered by a United States firm which is alleged to have engaged in fraud. <br><br>Over 2,000 investors from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have fallen victim to this alleged US pyramid scheme, said OilPods Singapore, which claims it innocently marketed the scheme here. The bulk of the investors come from Singapore. <br><br>The investors bought working interests in oil and gas leases offered by a US company called Powder River Petroleum International and were expecting to receive high yields from its operations. <br><br>But earlier this month, an initial US official receivers’ report showed Powder River had misled OilPods and others by making monthly payments to investors using fresh funds received from new investors — not profits generated from oil and gas as expected. <br><br>OilPods, which marketed the leases in Singapore, is suing the Oklahoma firm for investments made in the last four years. The petition, lodged in the US, alleges that Powder River’s “‘programme’ ... is nothing more than an illegal pyramid scheme utterly dependent on an ever increasing number of new investors to pay existing ones,” and that “the defendants have employed schemes, artifices and practices of business which have operated as a fraud and deceit”. <br><br>OilPods told Today that it did not lodge a police report in Singapore because it had been advised by the authorities here that there were jurisdictional issues that would be better addressed is in the US. <br><br>Powder River is currently under investigation by the Oklahoma Department of Securities and the receiver’s report dated Aug 7 claimed that the firm’s chief executive Brian Fox had acted in a fraudulent manner: “During 2007, a total of US$4.4 million in interest payments were made to those investors, of which US$3.3 million came from funds received from subsequent investors, not profits generated by the company from oil and gas production.” <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Such investment practices are called Ponzi schemes — a term used last year to describe the alleged operations of the controversial multi-level marketing firm Sunshine Empire here. The firm is under police investigation and is on the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s investor watchlist. Ponzi are dependent on an ever-increasing flow of new money from investors in order to keep going.</span> <br><br>OilPods chief executive Mark Chang alleges in his firm’s petition that the Powder River made false and misleading statements about its securities in oil and gas leases since 2003, which convinced the Singapore firm to market these securities to investors here. When asked what it is doing to assure investors, OilPods said, “The investors had entered into contract with Powder River directly to purchase working interest from Powder River. OilPods is in no position to assure investors of Powder River’s obligation to (them).” <br><br>Mr Thong Chee Kun, a lawyer from Rajah and Tann not involved in the case, said, “Such cases of alleged fraud of an overseas firm (either directly or through an agent) is not unheard of, but this is one of the larger scale ones.”</p>

              <p>Flashback:</p>
              <p>During the Sunshine Empire 1st Anniversary Celebration (the
                                      final and only one) held in Genting Highlands in 2007, James Phang
                                      and Jackie Hoo was being held up in detention and assisting in
                                      investigation by the Commercials Affairs Department [CAD] of
                                      Singapore. Their passports were held by the police and could not
                                      escape.</p>
              <p>David Phang (brother of James Phang and accomplice) announced in
                                      the Sunshine Empire Concert (held in "Arena of Stars", Genting
                                      Highlands) that he was busy in Singapore as his mother was sick and
                                      resting in hospotal.</p>
              <p><strong>This is a lie, publicity stunt and
                                      cover-up.</strong></p>
              <p>The instructions from Jackie Hoo to all BRMs such as Lee Yong
                                      Chew (Fake Name used to scam people = Ken Lee), Rick, Yuan Jie
                                      (David), Mei Qi, Alex Au etc, was to safeguard this information of
                                      James Phang being locked up by the police.</p>
              <p>Top priority was to ensure confidence of GP investors in the
                                      Taipei and TaiChung Wireless project (now both proven to be
                                      non-existent) and not to upset the Sunshine Empire Agents outside
                                      of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The secondary priority was to shift attention of CAD, MAS
                                      (Monetary Authority of Singapore) to investigate other MLM
                                      companies such as EnYouth, Long Far and CosLab. Jackie's rationale
                                      was EnYouth was most similar to NTI; LongFar and Coslab's products
                                      and marketing plans was most similar to Sunshine Empire's
                                      unauthorised and unregulated investment schemes (Gold Prime, Silver
                                      Prime, Bronze Prime, EmPin). Agents were told to call CAD,
                                      MediaCorp to report the alleged crimes of these companies.</p>
              <p>This was also the time that the internationl GP or EmPin was
                                      formulated to save Sunshine Empire Singapore. (Later on, EmPin's
                                      pay out proved to be worst than any other GP, SP or BP. Now EmPin
                                      is a defunct product and investors are still waiting for a
                                      refund)</p>
              <p>One month later, James Phang's mother really died. Agents,
                                      Managers, Downlines were all expected to attend the wake and
                                      funeral to prove their loyalty to James Phang and
                                      <strong>attendance was taken</strong>. It is a EGA tradition to
                                      make even a wake/funeral to be a business related function. Small
                                      division meeting were even held during the wake to boost sales in
                                      order to compensate James Phang's lost.</p>
              <p>Any NOP, NTI, Sunshine Empire, EmMax people is welcomed to add on to what I have exposed to the entire world on the internet.</p>
              <p><em>"A world of possibilities, on a streamlined network."</em></p>
              <p>Tagline of Sunshine Empire, historically Singapore's most audacious scam ever.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #999999;"><em><strong>I feel stupid, I feel guilty<br></strong>NO LONGER THERE?: Sunshine Empire (above, seen in a file picture) used to occupy a unit at the HDB Hub. In its place is a company called Niu Lifestyle (below).</em></span></p>

              <p>Undergrad who may have lost $66,000 to company says:<br><strong>I feel stupid, I feel guilty</strong> <br>By Hedy Khoo</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SHE put $66,000 of her family's money into what she thought would give her quick and lucrative returns. </p>
              <p>But a year on, the 20-year-old undergraduate could end up losing most of it because she has no idea what has happened to the controversial company in which she had invested - Sunshine Empire.</p>
              <p>A check by The New Paper found that the company, which used to occupy a seventh-storey unit at the HDB Hub in Toa Payoh, is no longer there.</p>
              <p>In its place is another company called Niu Lifestyle, which was registered on 20 Mar this year.</p>
              <p>However, the corporate websites of Sunshine Empire, which is under investigation by the authorities, are still online, although details of its supposed property ventures have since been taken down.</p>
              <p>The undergraduate, who wanted to be known only as Pamela, does not have the faintest clue how to recover the $66,000 she put into the multi-level marketing company.</p>
              <p>Lured by the promise of cash rebates of up to $1,000 a month, Pamela bought a total of six packages called Gold Prime under the Sunshine Empire product line.</p>
              <p>She paid $11,000 for each package, using money she borrowed from her parents.</p>
              <p>She said: 'I don't know if I will ever see the money again. I was naive and foolish.</p>
              <p>'I thought that was a smart way to earn money.'</p>
              <p>She said her father was hospitalised some time in the middle of last year and she was in need of money. 'My friend told me about Sunshine Empire, and how I should make my money work for me,' she recalled, and started buying through her friend.</p>
              <p><strong>'At first, I thought it was too good to be true, but for the first two months, I got cash rebates of $4,000,' she said.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Convinced that the scheme worked, she borrowed another $44,000 from her parents to buy more packages.</strong></p>
              <p>She even persuaded two more of her friends to buy packages with her, as by selling the packages, she could earn 'bonus points', which could supposedly be converted into cash.</p>
              <p>'I really thought it was easy money, and it wasn't wrong because I wasn't prostituting myself or cheating people.</p>
              <p>'We went for motivational talks at the company, which sold us not only the packages promising good rebates, but also the idea of being able to change our lives and live our dreams.'</p>
              <p>But in October and November last year, media reports were published about the Sunshine Empire's unsupported claims of grandiose investments in water theme parks in Malaysia and a wireless broadband project in Taiwan.</p>
              <p>'My parents were worried and started to warn me and told me to take my money out, but I was stubborn and refused to heed their advice,' she said, her voice tinged with regret.</p>
              <p>'My friends in Sunshine Empire said that any media publicity is good publicity and it only showed that our company was famous. I believed them.'</p>
              <p>Only in November, when it was reported that the company was under investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD), did Pamela start to panic.</p>
              <p>She called her 'upline' (the person who recruited her) asking to withdraw her cash, but was told that all accounts were frozen and there was no cash available.</p>
              <p><strong>Hounded by friends </strong></p>
              <p>Then, she was hounded by her two friends whom she had recruited.</p>
              <p>'I feel very bad that I got them into the same situation as myself,' she said.</p>
              <p>Then in March, she was told by her 'upline' that a new company called Niu Lifestyle had been set up at the former office of Sunshine Empire.</p>
              <p>'I asked what was this company about, and I was told it was fengshui-related, but to find out more, I had to meet her there at the 'office',' she said.</p>
              <p>'If it is a totally different company, why did my Sunshine Empire's upline tell me to meet at the same office, even when it is called Niu Lifestyle now?' she asked.</p>
              <p>'I was sceptical by then, and it seemed that it was just a change in name.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">'When I asked about Sunshine Empire, I was only told my money was stuck, but I could transfer my account to another new company called Em Max.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Her 'upline' told her Em Max was a new start-up in Hong Kong</span>.</p>
              <p>'By then, I didn't believe anything I was told anymore. I was furious but I was desperate. So I made the account transfer. I don't think I will see my money again, but I am just trying anyway,' she said.</p>
              <p>'I feel very stupid, and I felt I was brainwashed. The money I borrowed from my parents was hard-earned, and I feel guilty and that I let them down.</p>
              <p>'My relationship with my parents have become strained because of this.</p>
              <p>'There is no such thing as easy money,' she said ruefully.</p>
              <p>When approached, the Monetary Association of Singapore declined to comment. It had put Sunshine Empire on its investor alert list on its website last year.</p>
              <p>When contacted, the police said Sunshine Empire was still under investigation.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Consumers Association of Singapore's executive director, Mr Seah Seng Choon, had earlier cautioned participants against transferring their money to Hong Kong, as it would put their investment outside Singapore's jurisdiction.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">--------------------------</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,179194,00.html">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,179194,00.html</a>?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Firms Not Related.</strong></span> (again!)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">THE company now occupying the office that used to house the Empire Group appeared to use the same chandelier, furniture with gold trimmings, and reception counter as its predecessor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the signboards at the entrance and behind the reception counter said 'Niu Lifestyle' instead of 'Empire Group Alliance'. The lobby was filled with shelves and display cases of jewellery, fengshui items and health products.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But the directory at the lift lobby on the first floor of the HDB Hub still listed the Empire Group Alliance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">When approached, the woman at the reception counter said the items on display were for sale. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But to buy them, one must make an appointment with a 'consultant' for advice on which ones to buy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">On the counter was a timetable of talks for the week; some were conducted by 'Empire Guild Speakers'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">When asked how one could attend the talks, she would only say that some were free while others had a $50 entrance fee. When pressed for more information on the talks, she repeated that we had to sign up with the 'introducer' before we could attend, and that some of the talks were part of a course over six weeks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">When asked if Niu Lifestyle was part of Sunshine Empire, she said no. She said it was a new company selling health products and fengshui items.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Asked about Em Max, the receptionist said Em Max was a different company based in Hong Kong, and was not related to Niu Lifestyle.</span></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A search on Niu Lifestyle showed that its registered office was at 62, Upper Cross Street #02-01.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A visit to this address showed no physical presence of Niu Lifestyle there. The mailbox downstairs and the signboard at the locked-up unit said 'Yuan Zhong Siu Services Pte Ltd'. Yuan Zhong Siu Services also occupied a first-storey unit, selling fengshui items.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">When asked if Niu Lifestyle was located at the second-storey unit, a staff member said no, and that it was at HDB Hub.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">When The New Paper called Niu Lifestyle and asked if it was related to Sunshine Empire, the person who answered said no. Asked where Sunshine Empire was, she said it was at the same office, but we had to call a different number. She then gave a number similar to the one listed on the Sunshine Empire website. When we called, it went to a faxline.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The New Paper visited the Niu Lifestyle office again and asked if we could speak to someone in a position of authority, but the same receptionist said they were all busy and did not want to be interviewed.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A LawNet search on Sunshine Empire showed that the limited exempt private company still has a 'live' status and that its registered office was 490, Lor 6 Toa Payoh, #07-10 HDB Hub, which is now occupied by Niu Lifestyle.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>-------------------------------------</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How She Invested</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>MAY 2007:</strong> Pamela hands $22,000 to her 'upline' to buy two Gold Prime packages under her upline's account. Each package costs $11,000.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>JUN 2007:</strong> She receives $4,000 in cash as rebate for the packages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>JUL - SEP 2007:</strong> She joins Sunshine Empire and opens her own account. Buys another four packages for $44,000. She receives more rebates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>OCT 2007:</strong> MAS places Sunshine Empire on investor alert list. The New Paper runs reports questioning Sunshine Empire's claims of building water theme parks in Malaysia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>NOV 2007:</strong> Sunshine Empire is investigated by CAD. Pamela told by upline that Sunshine Empire's accounts frozen, cash cannot be withdrawn.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>JAN - MAR 2008:</strong> Pamela told that she could transfer her Sunshine Empire account into a new Hong Kong company called Em Max. She opens new account with Em Max online. But cash withdrawal still not possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>PRESENT:</strong> CAD investigations into Sunshine Empire ongoing.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;">2. All transaction are made either by cash or cheque and they all are paid to Sunshine Empire payment counters face to face. If this is a scam, then why bother setup such payment counters and offices ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ffffff; font-family: Arial;">3. Sunshine Empire always bring and show to its members the status of the projects or companies it buys.

Most of Sunshine Empire members are rich people. There are many individuals who bought hundreds of Gold Partner accounts. <strong>Don't forget if these people are rich they are also powerful, how difficult is it for them to report to Singapore authorities if the company run away ? And if Singapore government is in action, then nobody can run away.</strong></span></p>
