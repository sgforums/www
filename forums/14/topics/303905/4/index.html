Therefore a higher ROI is needed to lure in the big fish ~<br><br>in that case, unless SE ROI is back to 1k/month else is not worth it anymore right?<br><br>Since previous payout is 1.4k amount.....where within 10months+, you will recover and started to rip profits.....sweet 7.2k <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Now....from 1.4k drop until 200+, 12000/200 = 60 months<br><br>5 year to take back what your invested not "profits".....the profits only start after you get back your 12k. *Unless 4 years  call-back service is a form of interest*<br><br>which means..it will take SE another few years to pay back whatever they promised you ~<br><br>Must as well place your money in Hoong Leong, OCBC or Citibank....or even a FD within this 5 years you will get more $$$ than SE. You will still get back your basic amount just how much ROI nia.<br><br>Unless you have faith SE is gonna last through first 5 years while they holding your 12k and then till the 6th year onward....then you will get 1.4k per/year....which is consider a very high ROI.<br><br>do JP have a coy that lasted so long before? 6 years old coy?<br><br>Ever wonder why some SLS shops change name after 1 year and yet same people same location? Bcoz they wanted to void all the guarantee they promised before hand.<br><br>There are cases of people who invested in NTI (Pre-SE)were not given back their refund, but bring over to SE and converted as Emall Points.<br><br>So your 12k might be JP another new company Emall Point, No cash out.....but exchange of goods only.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Times Home &gt; Latest News &gt; Singapore<br>Jan 22, 2008<br><br><strong>Online cheating scams kept in check </strong><br><br>ONLINE cheating scams have been kept in check in the last three years - thanks to Singapore's robust legal system, close cooperation between the police and financial institutions, and public education.<br><br><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20080122/sg-wong.jpg"><span style="color: orange;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mr Wong urged the public to remain vigilant in tackling the online scourge. -- PHOTO: ST FILE</span></span><br><br>Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said the number of online cheating cases over the past three years has remained about the same: 61 cases in 2005, 61 in 2006 and 57 in 2007.<br><br>In his written response to a question from Sembawang GRC MP Ellen Lee Geck Hoon on Monday, he said the most common trick from scammers is putting a false advertisement of a product or service on the Internet to induce victims to place orders online and make electronic payment.<br><br>The victim only realises that he has been cheated when the goods fail to arrive. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Other online cheating scams involve fraudulent High Yield Investment Programs (HYIP)</strong></span>, credit card frauds, lottery scams and advance fee scams.<br><br>Mr Wong said the number of cases solved in 2005, 2006 and 2007 was 29, 28 and 12 respectively, or about 40 per cent of the reported cases.<br><br>The number of culprits arrested over the three was 22, 9 and 15 respectively.<br><br>On the three key thrusts to combat online cheating, the minister said firstly, the police works closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, financial institutions, and foreign law enforcement agencies including Interpol to share fraud-related intelligence and best practices.<br><br>A framework is in place for local financial institutions to detect, monitor and report suspicious transactions.<br><br>Under Section 39 of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes Act (CDSA), it is mandatory for a person to make a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) if he has reason to suspect that any property is connected to criminal conduct, and if such suspicion arose in the course of his trade, profession, business or employment.<br><br>The second thrust is public education. Police actively engages industry stakeholders, including the media, financial institutions and remittance companies, online merchants and grassroots organisations to apprise them of common online scam scenarios and educate them on crime prevention methods. Police also puts out crime prevention advice on common scams through the media, using SMS messages and through websites of the Commercial Affairs Department (<a href="http://www.cad.gov.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cad.gov.sg</a>) and Moneysense websites (<a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.moneysense.gov.sg</a>).<br><br>Crimewatch has also alerted Singaporeans not to be fooled by these scams, said Mr Wong.<br><br>Thirdly, Singapore has put in place a robust legal framework to punish online scammers and deter other like-minded persons.<br><br>Online scams constitute cheating offences and are punishable under the Penal Code with imprisonment terms of up to three or seven years.<br><br>An individual who knowingly facilitates online scams by allowing syndicates to use his bank account to receive proceeds of criminal conduct is also guilty of an offence under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes Act (CDSA).<br><br>Mr Wong urged the public to remain vigilant in tackling the online scourge.<br><br>'They should not let their desire for quick gain get the better of them. Please do not fall prey to online cheating scams as their promises of riches or easy money are illusory,' he said.<br><br>' The public should also not allow their bank accounts or personal details to be used by online scammers. Any attempt by such scammers to elicit money or to use your bank accounts should be reported to the police.'<br><br>Related links to this thread:-<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/check_our_list/Consumer_Portal_IAL.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/check_our_list/Consumer_Portal_IAL.html</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/mic/2007/071113_sunshine_empire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spf.gov.sg/mic/2007/071113_sunshine_empire.htm</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.cad.gov.sg/topNav/new/pre/Sunshine+Empire+Pte+Ltd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cad.gov.sg/topNav/new/pre/Sunshine+Empire+Pte+Ltd.htm</a></div>

But honestly i need to work and i cannot afford the time. The downlines won't want to do such things also because they don't even care. Its true that i want to learn about MLM but Sunshine Empire was everything but MLM let alone Network. So i believe there are some better ones out there. I really just want to visit them and see and maybe if i am convinced by the business model i might join them to see if i stand a chance, else i might just walk pass an opportunity without realizing it.</div>

The money supposedly we put in the money and you guys invest in resort project and whatever projects you guys claim, contradicting. Pardon me, but from the way i see it is that once you guys have sold enough "cola" you will then stop because you guys wouldn't be bothereds if the "cola" works and the money you will invest in the resort or whatsoever that you guys decide to build, so what will happen to stockist of your "cola"s? Thats selfish, irresponsible and thats a scam. Because legally you guys got the funds from the sales of "cola" encourage stock ups and then once funding has reached the sufficent level, thats the end of the "cola" story and basically no one will complain as you guys will say "the "cola" story has become history, we now must look at the property investments".<br>Now, in this instance there is no security to buyers or stockist or investors whatever you name it at all.
