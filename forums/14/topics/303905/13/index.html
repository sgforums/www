              <p>Haha... this is hilarious.</p>
              <p>So Sunshine Empire is now an investment company? I thought they insisted that they aren't.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it all boils down to where does the money for payouts come from. If money from new 'investors' is used to pay off existing 'investors', it's a pyramid scheme. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>And if you would "silent your mind and think" you would realise that "most people who lose money or scare their money lose or scare
                                      the company shut down," are the people who have the most incentive to put up a false front and act like nothing is wrong until they can execute their exit strategy.</p>

People will join the scheme because it pays money and no one will actually bother that it's under investigation or whatever. People only want returns and will  not care how the returns are generated or whether can such returns sustain long term etc. All are in for the ride only..... That's why no one actually cares when we ask the most important question of how their returns are generated and question the viability of the supposed rebates on use system etc. People bring people, people bring money. All the James in the world are getting richer only.</p></div>

              <p>Hi Laurence82,, don't mine my rough attitude. i just can't
              stand of seeing people getting wrong information. i trying to
              correct it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you say professional as in what way?</p>
              <p>I know that i'm not talking professionally. i trying to tell
              whatever i know here.</p>
              <p>To let you know, i just signed up last night because of this
              topic. *sigh*</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hi the_fallen, joining MLM company is not a joke :) ok?
              Investing in a company is risky. You have to do all kinds of
              homework.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you're interested in knowing this new company, Em-Max, please
              call the Sunshine Empire Customer Service Counter for details.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would wish to quote to all people out there who is reading
              this topic right now.</p>
              <p>If you think MLM is a scam, it's because you hear too much of
              hearsay. And also lack of homework.</p>
              <p>If you could silent your mind and think.  You might notice
              that most people who lose money or scare their money lose or scare
              the company shut down, those people might split all kind of
              nonsense.</p>
              <p>Don't believe, do some human research =) And ask yourself, are
              you like them?</p>
              <p>Ok. Thats all for tonight. Anything else, please feel free to
              post.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Don't worry.</p>
              <p>If you can get means and ways to get me into the company to know more deatils.</p>
              <p>I'll only say thank you.</p>
              <p>Other than that, thanks for your concern, but I believe when it comes to such stuffs, perhaps I think I know better. Just wanna get updates, and know more.</p>
              <p>Any kind souls that could help me out?</p>
              <p>FYI: I don't call service hotline since their response will be useless to me. What i need is a distributor who will bring me into there and tell me whatever stuffs and information about this 'new' Em-Max</p>

              <p>Say someone pretends to fall down the stairs and drags everyone with him, he stands up but everyone is badly injured how leh? This is not the first time Phang's business fell again and again and again, each time more and more people lost more and more. First NOP, the NTI, Magic Kingdom, now SE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm really interested to know where does SE gets all its money to build so many infrastructure projects everywhere? Sale of GPs? Part of this sales would go to ppl who had bougth GPs earlier on, the rest pumped into the projects? So many development projects, could cost few hundred millions, and whats more SE/EPV has ZERO experience in building properties. Don't you realise it's an astronomically huge risk?</p>
              <p>Phang reminds me of hitler... using his charisma in the wrong way to drum up interest, and a following of supporters. One huge push to expand the empire, then one day all will collapse back to zero.</p>
              <p>Oh, I predict if his projects fail again, next time he'll say "I
              JAMES PHANG WAH fell so many times, lost millions and still I stood
              up"... It's not about "courage" or dreams... it's about reality. Let's
              say he took $10M from people and the project didn't even start, and he
              has no track record of successful sustainable ventures, would you
              admire him?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>And he's using this as an X factor instead of something which bleamishes his image, he uses this almost like a pity point, like a turning point. There's nothing wrong with standing up from failures. Standing up from failures and being able to prove oneself realistically are two different things. Ok, lets take Emcom/call and Emall ashis first successful projects, to a certain level of success. What happened to the rest, like Magic Kingdom, NOP, NTI?</p>

              <p>Then you will nicely blame hearsay when its you yourself who have been damaging EM's reputation.</p>
              <p>Yeap, agree with you EM people dont do homework. Now is the state of things and SE forced to change name. hahahaha</p>

              <p>Nope, dont avoid the question. It got nothing to do with meditation. If I silent my mind and think, I wouldnt even join SE or Em-Max, due to my clear thoughts and reasoning.</p>

              <p>Yet again, why link to hearsay when you cant prove what you say. What it got to do with reading newspapers? You are putting one and one to generate three.</p>
              <p>Agents dont come this forum? Then pray, who are you? Or have you been reading?</p>
              <p>Asking us what is NTI? You are ignorant, and if you want proof, you can start reading this forum NTI pages, where people has post proof SE changed its name from NTI. If you wish to avoid and say you are lazy to read, fine by me.</p>
              <p>You say maybe, and attribute it to feng shui? Seems you are clueless and willing to grab straws while you are drowning. NTI wasnt doing well at that time, and none of the agents came back to boast about their lingerie business or the 288 bucks binary system.</p>
              <p>Similary, SE now faces crisis with CAD, and it change its name again. Tell me, what happened to the Taichung project, KL and Malacca project? Do you not know nobody came back to boast that they have earn, or that they cant prove that these projects were real?</p>

              <p>It seems Sohee dude is clueless about the company's past. i think changing name is a good tactic, because some people are stupid enough not knowing anything about taxation and ACRA or Registry of Business</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Yesss, its pure facts... google James Phang, NTI, NOP, Magic Kingdom - you will see what this human with inspiration speeches and strong words of courage is about. He's definately worth your admiration - put it this way - he has escaped prison more times than Mas Selamat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should go remind James Phang to be more human and be more respectful to other's hard earned savings and not conning tons of unaware victims to help fulfill his fantasy empires. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His STINKING Reputations on Google/yahoo wasn't created from air. The only people that admire him are those that are EASILY amused and impressed by his speeches - another words people with lower social popularity whom most probably cant find a better job out in the real world that commands any respect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, the bold words were just meant to attention it to you. There's no shouting elements in them.. hope i didnt break any emotional configuration in you :)</p>

              <p>james phang is just a weak willed person who would not choose to pursue his dreams... put it in this way</p>
              <p>you guys frm SE or EM-max think he is very strong willed right? why? because he created different companies several times in order to fund for his glamorous livestyle and creat his dream city.. right?</p>
              <p>u think that after being bankrubt , closing down his company made him undaunted causing him to be a successful person with perseverance right??</p>
              <p>if he is really a person with perseverance and responsibility, he would not let SE close down.. he would not let any of his past companies close down at all. he would actually be there , help the company tide the storm and get on with life. but he did not.. every single one of his companies which have folded... at the last min.,. he would always go to anotehr country , go missing.. forever that way right?</p>

              <p>Imagine this.</p>
              <p>Phang starts first company, boasts about it, scam, attracts people. Then closes it down or change name. He'll give an excuse, say economy not good or people say bad things about it. Then at his "new" company, he'll say how tough it took to build his company up, how it fell, how "badly hes affected".. how he "been thru tough times to rebuilt"... how he "fell but stood up. Then, he continues his dirty business tactics, and when the system cannot be sustained, he'll change name again... and the process repeats again and again.... closing down company or changing name, then saying how pity his journey was, blah blah blah.</p>
