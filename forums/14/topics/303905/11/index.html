              <p>so meaning that those small files who bought 1 or 2 GPs are the ones feeling threated as second handed or should i say unfair treatment?</p>
              <p>It does make sense that those who join SE since 2006 are the ones going to be benefited continously.  They are the core merchants that can bring the business forward am i right?  so ultimately those poor investors who joined lately may or may not feel being cheated ya?</p>
              <p>Even if all those projects would succeed, right now they already lose credibility of those "small files", just to save those who stayed with them till now.  afterall so many people got hurt financially, do you think that will benefit them really?  because in the eyes of those got cheated, JP would still be a bad record infront of their sight. </p>
              <p>Is Mafia illegal? yes they are, but are they rich and successful in their influence and organization? absolutely.  And those who follow their leader, though they are rich, however they're continously being de-valued by society and blind by moral hazzards.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, let those people who still stand for SE continue in their doings, because afterall everyone hold the responsibilities in their own life.  If you are going to keep spending your energy to discredit or charge them, in the end all your life will be wasted, you could have better off spending your time in establishing your own life. So don't spend your energy on people whom you can no longer be advised</p>

              <p>Brain: despite all our postings plus media coverage, there's still idiots buying in. why? cos there's tons of pple who doesnt read the web/newspaper to know what's going on.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I don't think the topic about SE has brough a major concern to the public, everyday there are different news consolidated in the paper, and besides this, there are thousands of topic in sgforum, so this forum is not effective.  It's just mainly for chit-chat session nia.</p>
              <p>I would say that people would believe their friends more than the public comments, especially if you mentioned that those people with more than 50Gps, they can just show off their pay cheques to their friends and 'seeing is believing' what right?  If they want to invest let them invest loh, if in the event they can't get paid because they're "small files", those merchants are the ones going to get haunt for taking their life savings</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Why would Singapore economy be impacted? its too small to mean anything.. no one will lose their job cos of SE, tax will not go up/down cos of SE, consumer spending and export growth that account for most of our GDP figure will not be affected, property prices will not be affected, ... nah.. SE is never about Singapore economy.. its always about rats, cockroaches, smelly drains, decayed cheese and sewage pipes.</p>

              <p>For those SE members who are thinking of opening up accounts down in Hong Kong etc.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.. use your stupid brains.... if anything were to happen to your money down in Hong Kong, its either u have to fly to Hong Kong to file a law suit or u can kiss it good bye.</p>
              <p>Its just eventual that SE has to move again to another country where the country's legal obligations are lower.. if you have any common sense still... would u really want to park your money into a company that only choose country's with breakable laws?!</p>

              <p>If someone were to steal from you, u would go to the police. But when SE cheats u, u sound really helpless..why? Cos SE wants u to believe u are part of their illegal group.. BUT THE FACT is YOU ARE NOT, YOU ARE A VICTIM. So go to the police/CAD now and report your case. CAD didnt publish on their website that they welcome SE members for investigation so that they can have reunion dinner with you... they are here to ensure something is done for you and many out there! SO pick up your phone and call!.</p>

              <p>The irony of things is that when SE pays out 700+ epoints last year.. it WAS a SCAM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The emall business couldnot have generated that kind of profits and turnover to have multi-million dollars payout monthly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that payout has reduced to ZERO or near ZERO, this in fact, maybe the actual situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current version of emall, or emwealth, may have many products, but many are in HK, and mny items are non-essential items, meaning that you wouldn't usually buy them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SE Merchants, what you are getting now is the true value of the CRP. If there is poor sales, then of cos there is no rebates or bonus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SE now just have to maintain the emall system, and it will not be infringing any laws.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the SE Merchants that willingly gave many thousands of dollars to set up shop in their emall, or pay thousands of dollars for a callback system that was originally set up to help save money (the irony of it).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You want the rebates, then now is the time to really be a merchant. Start selling things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stop selling Merchantship plans, with nothing but a pen and paper and no finanical records and piped up dreams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if you do have the records, they are useless. SE is a network marketer. Those so-call investments are not related to SE Merchants at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if there are investments, they are not within the Empire Group Alliance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All monies are now being invested in faraway countries. Out of reach of any Singapore authorities or SE Merchants, all linked to a Comnpany known as EMCOM International (yahoo search : 8220 EMCOM).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A great veil may have been lifted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SE Merchants may be left high, dry and broke on a 'ebay'-like ecommerce platform.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which ironically, is what SE merchants paid for in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you feel you have been cheated, then heed the advice of many here to seek help, perhaps from CASE or CAD. But a joint complaint may be best.</p>
