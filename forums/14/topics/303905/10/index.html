              <p>For those people who might really think that SE downfall is because "Singapore Government doesn't want poeple to be rich". </p>
              <p>Let those bunch of childish FOOLs know that singapore government is MORE THAN HAPPY to see more people becoming rich. WHY? </p>
              <p>The rich people usually pay a higher taxs and with those tax, the government will use it to expand Singapore for more economy growth.  So how would esplanage, suntec city, F1 race, and IR project be possible without people paying their income tax? </p>
              <p>And what if the government expenditure is lower than the amount of tax collected?  They will use it for surplus to fund the needy people, like bursaries, workfare bonus and other stuff like lending it to other countries.  That's why Singapore is a rich nation!</p>
              <p>I really agree with Zwei that this person called "Mr Yong" is a Kid!  By blaming the government just shows that he is a terrorist leader leading his people into crookery.</p>

              <p>Large majority of SE members still believe in the business and will still swear by it. Why? Cos there's a segmentation of member group now. Those that buy 10 GPs and above still get paid as normal compared to those that buy lesser - understandably to be paid only about 20-50% of the normal pay out. </p>
              <p>Yes 10 GPs is 100k and Yes this group is surprisingly quite big too and they are now situating themselves well in hong kong planting their 'seeds'. They are also the majority buyers of the property that SE built in malaysia.</p>
              <p>There's lots of willing rich suckers in Hong Kong very willing to join SE. The Hong Kongers are definately more adventuerous to the Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Anyway we should be happy that at least SE will be out of Singapore. As for pple in Hong Kong, its too far for us to bother.</p>

              <p>I think James Phang and Jackie Hoo should go to JAIL, no question about that. After all the harm they have done. Some of the kids at the company I heard actually GAVE up their university education to follow these two jokers. Jackie Hoo claims he also did the same last time, I suspect he was probably EXPELLED from NUS.</p>
              <p>Brains, I don't really agree that HK is too far for us to bother about. After all, Richard Yong also got caught there after he tried to run and get his wife to launder his money from NKF. If those people continue to believe James Phang's lies and continue to spread his poison it will give people a negative image about Singaporeans going to do business there, I think. It's not enough that SE will be out of Singapore, SE must be destroyed permanantly and the leaders discredited so that such things will not happen again.</p>

              <p>The JP so called their international president doesn't own the EGA,  people already don't know what they are up to, and seriously SE afterall is not transparent enough, its too fishy.</p>

              <p>I don't think it's that tough, after all, now their faces are known to the public. As for money and power in other countries, unless they can run to somewhere where no one has ever heard of them, (maybe nigeria, since they are already running a scam) I don't think they will gather a lot of support, because many people will turn on them once this current project fails.</p>
              <p>Got one hokkien saying "Qiu To Lao Gao Sua" means when the tree falls the monkeys scatter. This time SE fail, all the people involved not only lose family and friends trust, lose personal credibility, it will take a long time to recover again. I think after all these recent cases in Singapore and the surrounding countries, not many people will be left who want to believe in the fantasies that the SE leaders are fond of spinning.</p>

              <p>Maybe you want to focus on those forum more positive about SE?</p>
              <p>On an unbias tone, just like ManU and Liverpool, definitely there will be people who support one and disregard the other.  This is life, if everyone is negative about SE, then but now it should have gone a 'close shop'.</p>
              <p>Only those people under payroll in the authorities will have the power to make changes in the outcome of SE.</p>
              <p>Personally I feel that SE is promoting a 'shortcut to riches' which it don't really works,  just look at those official message by the authorities everywhere, a company may have negative reports, but for this SE, it is just too much of bad reports than the good ones.  Its a good thing to be rich, but the way to go about it is more important.</p>
              <p>Christopher, only if you are strongly convince that SE is going to be your permanent career path then please go ahead.</p>
              <p>Those cilents has their final decision whether to invest in SE, but I feel that the merchants shouldn't use the word 'guarantee' 1 year pay back for the CRP, because they are not professional fund managers and the question is, WHAT exactly are they selling?  do they know where the money goes to?  If it is for those projects, why are there so much false evidences taken out from the press and media?</p>
              <p>And how bad it is for a company from 700 USD returns dropped to 200 USD, is like going through a 'major recession' in an 'economic boom' period.</p>
              <p>I personally dunno where the fund goes to, maybe you should ask Zwei, i think he more experience there.</p>
              <p>I would regard SE as a high risk investment thingy, but not to be called a 'career'. </p>

              <p>We don't say smack down anything. Just show us the company's financial statements instead of spinning wild fantasies and asking people to invest can already.  If NTI or SE focussed on the products they were selling, and worked out a credible plan for their downlines to be compensated, and take the slow but sure route of reaching out to their market instead of trying to take shortcut through everything, you would not be facing this kind of problem. NTI was actually a good xompany in the beginning. The people who started it in that small office in Shenton Way and the beginning downlines all went through a lot in terms of training, development and a genuine desire to better themselves and form a good company to be proud of. Maybe not spectacular, but slow and steady wins the race. But now everything in this company has been perverted by the same person who started it. James Phang.</p>
              <p>The Company has been perverted by greed.Everything this man taught in his lessons and everything in his life he has gone through has been for nothing because of greed.If James Phang listened to his own lessons and focussed on a core business and a core product I would be following him to this day. But because of greed, because of wanting to take shortcut, because he cannot focus and concentrate on one business, he is now doomed to FAIL.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr James is buying in and setting up overseas companies (not in Singapore) with huge sums of money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The EMCOM International is renamed from China Photar Electronics. China Potar was acquired by EMCOM Limited.Both are registered in Caymans Island. Nothing to do with Empire Communications in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is their new EMCOM website: <a href="http://www.emcominternational.com/">http://www.emcominternational.com/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr James IS FULLILING his dreams... He has all the money now... <em>What if he has enough and his overseas companies are starting to pay off..?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sunshine Empire merchants, you have paid thousand of dollars to set up an online shop, paid thousands for a 4 year call-back plan. Multiply the thousands into hundred thousands if you have mutliple GPs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our Govt cannot stop you if you want to buy $10,000 worth of call-back plan per year and pay even pay upfront, not withstanding you use up only $10-$20 per month or not at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Govt cannot tell a man whether to join Safra Club for $20 or the Singapore island Country Club for $100,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So SE Merchants... exactly are you really doing alot of buying and selling online??? If not... how do you really expect $$thousands of rebates per month???!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if there are monthly rebates, they are based on a <a href="http://www.betterwhois.com/bwhois.cgi?domain=emwealth.com">online shopping mall</a> registered by a 20-something Malaysian boy called <span style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://profiles.friendster.com/2783577">Michael Ooi wei keat</a>.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A website that can close down anytime.</span> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The money may be good when it comes.. easy when it comes...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the system is uncontrolled and unregulated...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your payout is not based on some formula that can be calculated or predicted. It is more likely based on a "Please Sir.... I want some more..." (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/olivertwist/ntf_more.html">Oliver Twist</a>)</p>

              <p>Why only you who noticed people in there changed for the better? Or rather, why so few of you?</p>
              <p>The thing about misleading downlines itself is misleading the public. The company's structure and fundamentals have been challenged by the public and questioned by the CAD that its no longer a simple case of few black sheeps.</p>
              <p>I am sorry, but this thing about 'few black sheeps' no longer apply to SE, and has long become an excuse or poor attempt to cover the shady schemes.</p>

              <p>To stop these small flies from buying, its not possible. Look at what's going on in Singapore - despite all our postings plus media coverage, there's still idiots buying in. why? cos there's tons of pple who doesnt read the web/newspaper to know what's going on. These pple are still in tons of thousands - each one buy 1 GP, more than enough liao.</p>
              <p>These money he took will eventually be pumped into a legitimate business with core business and product. And i assure you by then, everything that he does will be super law abinding. But meanwhile.... he will need to go for the killing.</p>
              <p>CAD is taking forever cos the business model of SE is legitimate technically. why? They have a product to give to for the money pple puts in. But in practice, of course we know its not that simple. All their investments/projects nonsense has already been brushed aside by Jackie Ho and I am sure their accounting books will reflect that as well since in the first place all these crap projects dont exist/ no big magnitude.</p>
              <p>SO........... this will just drag on and yes James Phang is just going to get richer. what you guys wish to see - ' James Phang being discredited', 'James Phang bankrupt, put behind bars' etc.. will not happen.

              <p>Well, there's an old saying that goes "you can't cheat an honest man" so I guess ultimately, people involved get just what they deserve.</p>
              <p>I find it difficult to imagine though how his legitimate businesses can succeed though. His payout rates are too high and his time horizon is too short. It take years for most companies to become profitable.</p>
              <p>Also, the SE "strategy" of going into every industry simultaneously does not make sense at all. There is no focus. He might as well just invest the money into an index fund.</p>

              <p>so meaning that those small files who bought 1 or 2 GPs are the ones feeling threated as second handed or should i say unfair treatment?</p>
              <p>It does make sense that those who join SE since 2006 are the ones going to be benefited continously.  They are the core merchants that can bring the business forward am i right?  so ultimately those poor investors who joined lately may or may not feel being cheated ya?</p>
              <p>Even if all those projects would succeed, right now they already lose credibility of those "small files", just to save those who stayed with them till now.  afterall so many people got hurt financially, do you think that will benefit them really?  because in the eyes of those got cheated, JP would still be a bad record infront of their sight. </p>
              <p>Is Mafia illegal? yes they are, but are they rich and successful in their influence and organization? absolutely.  And those who follow their leader, though they are rich, however they're continously being de-valued by society and blind by moral hazzards.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, let those people who still stand for SE continue in their doings, because afterall everyone hold the responsibilities in their own life.  If you are going to keep spending your energy to discredit or charge them, in the end all your life will be wasted, you could have better off spending your time in establishing your own life. So don't spend your energy on people whom you can no longer be advised</p>
