            <div class='col-md body'>sales still being done, albeit discretly. but it depends on if u are a 'branch merchant' or 'online merchant'. the latter is probably a new counter measure shld SE SG closes (worst case scenario) so the only exchange method is thru the BRM. the online merchant strategy, i have to admit, does resemble Swiss Cash. And yes, Albert Lee was the founder of Swiss Cash, ex-disciple of JP, and former IT consultant of NTI.<br><br>JH after his release in his last court hearing on nov 19, 2007... btw, no charges, out on bail. suggests to all brm to tell their team to sow discord among rival companies, in particular, Long Far Int'l and Coslb. reason being they copied SE's CRP marketing strat. method suggested is to post as members of public and call the media to sabotage and adversely affect their reputation.<br><br>Comments.<br>i share wat i know, i do not believe in restriction of info to the public by jp. jh and the brms. i mean, nothing is ever on the official website. blogs? jia yuan's guy, sued for his 'hardwork' (dec 19, 2007). SE lawyers/prosecutors are demanding S$250,000 in damages. it is a 'fear us + scapegoat + example to all" strat, very common in party politics.<br><br>how u interpret my post is to yr own discretion. everyone needs a disclaimer nowadays in our democratic nation. talk about graciousness. Go Worker's Party!</div>
