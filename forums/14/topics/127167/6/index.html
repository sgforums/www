            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MLM Victim:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br><br>Beware of a new coy called CosLab. They are cheaters as well. The top guys (Steve &amp; Kelvin) are from NOP as well. Even the management level are from NOP. THEY ARE OUT TO CHEAT PEOPLE AGAIN.<br><br>You might be wrong! Do u know that last time NOP help Coslab Boss ( Dr Le) to sell his products (Pure Skin) too?<br><br></div></blockquote>with this article, i don't really know which side to believe. Cause I've seen people praising about their products. This issue is really arguementative. When some has cancer, even at the same stage when they start treatment, doctors can give them the same predicition on the out come of treatment. But end stage with different life style, different back ground, the two patient can have very different out come after treatment.<br><br>when it has to do with our body be it skin weight, there is always a possibility that things might not work out for you when it work out excellent for your friends. Like i say one's food may be the other's poison.<br><br>Things read on forum, people tend to incline towards bad comments because it seemed that there is always nothing to lose to believe its bad. But when you choose to follow the positive comments and you failed, you will end up blaming yourself.<br><br>With a learning culture in mind, everyone's growing up. Nothing beats learning from hard lessons yourself, instead of listening to other's hard lesson. when you Fail move on with that lesson in mind and stuff.<br><br>In case of MLM, i think its really up to each and everyone to think for themselves when they are in situations. There is success stories and failure as per any other business in the world. Every one looks up to bill gates for his success. Every one read his stories of success. How many of the readers know how many software company actually failed? Did this people who failed also read up on bill gates and aspire to be them?<br><br>Many claim they are victims of MLM. True they put in money, they don't see returns. I too failed when I was in bel air. Money and time spent cannot be refunded to me. And i came to realise it when i look back, when i join them did i believe in their strategy of making money easily? Or did i believe in myself? I believe in their strategy and not myself. I was rejected for a good 10 times and i merely gave up just like that. What would have happened if i believe in myself? I would have tried and tried and tried. My approach would have been different too. MLM is all about sharing nothing about hard selling. But we see lots of people hardselling in MLM products. Why? They want to earn money fast. Or rather they wanted to Re coup fast. And the fastest way is to have many people to be in the program as fast as possible. But is it long lasting? For my case, the need to recoup, busted the workable. And it took me long to realise the lesson and move on and I no longer joins MLM. I guess to really start my business, I need to work alot on what i want in life and really scrutinising what is going to work to achieve what i want.<br><br>One's belief can be their strongest force and at the same time their cause of success of failure. Muslim Extremist is an example on power of belief that causes themselves to be in their own world. They can die for their beliefs. Doctors with no borders a strong believer of helping the world out with illness they faces. They gave up money for what they beliefs in life.</div>

I have come across coslab and initially felt that this forum is interesting and also did some research on this company. I follow this thread from first page, until this page. I got something to say by then.<br><br>[b]How do you define a loser and a winner?</strong><br><br>A <strong>Winner</strong> know what he want and go for it all the way even if he fail once or even more. A <strong>winner</strong> will not wait for things to happen but he makes the thing happen. He will be aware of what is happening in the surrounding but he will no get invole in other ppl affair. A <strong>winner</strong> is always the pathfinder for succeed<br><br>A <strong>loser</strong> know not what he want for his whole entire life. A <strong>Loser</strong> lives in other ppl shadow. He will be picking on other ppl topic to tok about as he dun have a story of his own self. He will penalise on everything that he is uncomfort about and dun bother to find out more ending up telling ppl about what his opinion which may be incorrect. He is always the red eyed person where he will no be "song" with other ppl that is better then him.<br><br>So MLM Victim, i hope you mature enough to read this.<br><br>btw , i must clarify that i am standing as a netural party of saying all this as i think steve chew wedding is nothing related to you .<br>aren't you old enough to know that a lot of rich ppl also wear and live in simpler way?<br><br>i read the whole thread and relise that you from another MLM company. If i am join MLM, i will also not join you as great ppl dun behave like you.<br><br>one last comment. MLM Victim, you are very rude thru out all the thread.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Ah... finally found the post where my nick originated from, so simidaichi, hope this will solve ur problem with my nick<br></div>

For your info, i joined Coslab for around 3 weeks and recently been promoted to manager. Can't tell u how much i earn cuz i haven get my 1st pay cheque, but if u wan to know i can get back to u.<br><br>Want to know how u boost my confident? U know those fake, un-license beggers in Singapore? Going around begging people to believe that they are poor, U sounded like one of them.. or maybe worst than them.. Have u ever heard of the different between the 5% and the 95%? U are juz one in the billions of 95% babies, crying out for help to the world.. u will never work for urself and u always need the 5% adults to spoon-feed u, but u will still complain that the food taste bad.. but give u the chance, u still won't cook ur own food, cuz u can't, u won't and u will only make a mess in the kitchen. For me, Coslab is my first step towards my goals; for u, its a place that let u realise earning $2k/mth is better than $10k/mth cuz u know that u are never someone who can fulfill ur dreams.<br><br>I'm sure that i'm right about these.. down deep in the bottom of ur heart u are very jealous of these people - Steve Chew, Kelvin Ho, Eddie Tang... , u wonder why they can do it but u can't and never will, u gave urself 101 excuses for urself that they are scammers but never give urself a chance to be like them.. And most important of all, u are a very very self-fish person.. it's ok that u never give urself a chance to improve ur life-style, but u take away the chance of providing a better life for ur parent, (future) husband/wife and children, and the worst of all, u want every people in the world to be like u.. u are very very very sad... u should change nick to MLM SADDIST.<br><br>To all people who have doubt about Coslab, NEVER listen to people like MLM Victim cuz they are not u. They can't eat/feel/listen (blar blar blar) for u and most important of all is they can never THINK for u. I'm not promoting for Coslab, but i'm telling people out there that if someone approach u with a mlm business plan, don't reject him stright in the face... sit down and have a look at the plan, think about it.. whether anot the plan suit u is up to u to decide, not the agent, if u are not interested, no matter how hard-selling he is, if u don't want to do it, he can't do anything to u.. but if u think that the plan is workable for u, don't let the chance of changing ur life and the lives of people around u slip away from ur hand without trying... even if u should fail, u can still answer to urself; but what if u 'accidently' succeeded? Chew on it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>People are always the product of their mind, if u think u can, u can; if u think u can't, u can't and never will. For personally think this phase is very true for all lines - Business don't fail, people do.</div></blockquote>So how? my dear MLM winner? Still in Coslab earning BIG MONEY?<br><br>Heard that coslab now no more already. Izzit true?<br>Steve Chew and the top guys had all left, izzit true?<br>Hahaha...
