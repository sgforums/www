            <div class='col-md body'>5gDevil, there are some truth in your post, but some incomplete ones as well. Allow me to make some additions to it before it invites the virtual taxi-uncles to come in and make a stab at your posts.<br><br>It's a good observation to note that animals and human beings are distinctive in one way that human beings get to analyse, choose and decide.  Actually, animals too have brains that think (logically?), analyse and then decide.  Human beings are just more sophisticated in our thought processes. Of course, it helps that we also have the means to execute our decisions. The word to note here, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOPHISTICATION</span>. Those without this, is like a caveman in modern times. 'Nuff said.<br><br>MLM, like money, is neither good nor evil. For those who have a lack of money, will say that money is the root of all evil. Incredible, when that same dollar bill can be used to buy food for the poor but at the same time, purchase a lighter for arson. It all depends on the person, really. For the MLM-er with wrong intentions, like d-advocate, who thinks that MLM is a get-rich-quick system and i quote "i will not buy the products at all. i am only interested in the money opportunity to recruit.", only a disappointing result awaits him. It's just like using a sports bike on a mountain terrain. Can it go? Sure. But for how long, one wonders......<br><br>MLM is indeed about sharing, but it is also about selling, training, networking, and most of all, learning. Learning about yourself, learning about others. Learning FROM yourself (through trials and tribulations, past experiences) and learning FROM others.<br><br>Making money is a by-product of understanding the above points and fusing it into oneself. If you get a couple of points right, you make a couple of bucks. If you're lucky, you can perhaps make a couple of bucks for quite some time. But if one is able to grasp the true spirit and mechanics of THE CONCEPT of MLM, that it is ultimately just another method of moving a product only that YOU are also involved in the moving, one can make a lot of money as a by-product of that understanding. A pity many do not stay in MLM long enough to experience and understand this.<br><br>Oh, and it's quite impossible for staple items i.e. rice to be solely distributed through MLM, though i will not exclude the possibility that it may partially distributed by a MLM company with a large enough member base to justify the method of distribution.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DekiruKoto,<br><br>I'm not too sure if  the quote you quoted exists. If it does, it must have been from a pre-Martin Luther King book like Tom Sawyer or something about slavery, or fiction. Let me offer you another quote from Nobel Prize winner Albert Camus:<br><br>"Life is a sum of all your choices."<br><br>Sure, people in Africa did not choose to be hungry, just like how those in war-torn countries did not choose to be born there. They just were.<br><br>Without igniting a full-scaled debate on how Albert Camus is still valid in those circumstances, i divert back our attention to us back here in sunny Singapore.<br><br>Bear with me as i make a few assumptions:<br><br>1. We are lucky. Damn lucky, to be born Singaporeans, at this time, right here right now. Take a minute to give thanks to your maker.<br><br>2. We have a choice. Here. Now. In Singapore. Not Sarajevo, not Somalia. Singapore.<br>Everything you have, you were, you are. It's all made up of choices made in the past. And we HAVE the freedom to make those choices.<br><br>3. "A person who has nothing has no rights to choose how to live his life." Possible, but not here, not now, not in Singapore. Here, you have something, if not everything. Education, a roof over your head, internet (for you to read, write, learn and more), food, hospital care, peace, no natural calamities, NTUC, public transport, public toilets, Orchard Road, the list goes on. Therefore, an invalid statement in this context.<br><br>NO ONE is FORCED to do anything. In certain religious texts, we are even luckier than angels, because we have something called FREE WILL. And no, it's got nothing to do with whales.<br><br>FREE WILL is no more evident than in our youth in present day Singapore, and it's almost painful to see that we are blind to recognise that. How convenient it is to say that we are stuck in a bad relationship "because we've been together for 5 years now". I say, if you're not happy, WALK! How about, "i have a sh1tty job". I say, it's better than being unemployed, but if you're not happy, WALK! What's this thing about blaming the whole world for one's misfortune (which is actually a fortune for others lesser than oneself), and not taking time out to look in the mirror?<br><br>I can't think of a more suited, less judgemental &amp; fair environment than MLM for anyone to have a shot at success! Where else can an average joe leverage on other people's strengths to supplement his own shortcomings? Stock-market? The corporate world? Or perhaps the betting outlets? Where else can sincerity, humility and hard work be rewarded fairly? Show me, and i will join you.<br><br>Sure there are many other ways of earning money, quick money, but everything is in equilibrium. You only get what you give. What goes around comes around. If not immediate, you can be damn sure it will come back in another form later, multi-folds.<br><br>It's time to stop putting the blame on one's un-success on society, the environment, or the guy next to you. Take time out to look at the mirror, and judge the man INSIDE.</div>

If not, what has his what-so-ever decisions gotta do with you?<br><br>2) Are you madly in love with all those lowly intellectual people (as you claimed) who followed Mr. Eddie Tang? If not, than again, what has their decisions to follow a wise leader (whom you also loved) gotta do with you?<br><br>I'll juz give you the benefit of the doubt that you do loved those people and they love you too... Hence you do not wish to see them making any wrong decisions... Thus you step out to voice our opnions on this board...<br><br>I'm sorry i misunderstood your good intentions...<br><br>However, if one person makes a so-called wrong decision, he might be wrong... But, if majority of the people makes the same so-called wrong decision, then maybe the so-called right decision is wrong instead...<br><br>"You can fool some of the people all the time,<br>You can fool all the people some of the time,<br>But can you fool all the people all the time?"<br><br>If MLM is really something so evil... Do you really think there will be more &amp; more people getting into this industry?<br><br>I came accross this website a few days ago. It is actually the official website for a movie call "Pay It Forward". In the site, a simple illustration was used, and guess what... It looks exactly like how MLM functions...<br><br><a href="http://payitforward.warnerbros.com/Pay_It_Forward/" rel="nofollow">http://payitforward.warnerbros.com/Pay_It_Forward/</a><br><br>Tell me, which industry allows you to help your dearest friends earn money while you are also making money? Would you rather be a millionair who can earn a million every year, or someone who just makes 100K every year but has the ability to help a few others making the same 100K together with himself?<br><br>Sharing gives more bliss compared to owning...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MLM is a personal psychological comfort and reassurance.<br>Honestly, i also joined coslab.. and it was someone close to me who 'pulled' me in. Anyway, a few months later, to be exact 2 months, longfar came along. I din go over. For a good number of reasons. Joined for 2 reasons:<br><br>1) if the money i invested was to help my 'upline' get more confident. So be it. He was never confident anyway.<br><br>2) I just needed a reality check. So now i know.<br><br>It's nothing to do with confident. Cos it's something i don't lack. But look around u... MLM is almost like religion. It's how you look at it. Faith is somethin not everyone has. But hope is.<br><br>Come on. This whole world is one big MLM corporation. If you take econs, you'll know. To make money is to pump in money into the economy. But i'm not saying that it's justifiable to buy products you don't need. Anyway, it always take some falling down to stand up again.<br><br>Money is an issue here. It always is. Of cos, that money meant alot to me. But then, it's just like gambling. Who can u blame that you took the risk?<br><br>This is a very sad sad page. And it reflects very badly on singaporeans: that most people when they fall, can't stand.<br><br>Too bad.</div>
