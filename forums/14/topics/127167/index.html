            <div class='col-md body'>let me share with u guys about my story...<br>its all started when my friend brought me to the so call coslab HQ..<br>than the KELVIN began to say how he is so successful in coslab<br>after leaving cid..<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Let me share with u something about this so-call successful KELVIN HO. He was successful in NOP after CID, not Coslab. He failed in NOP and he went out and set up a small and typical comic shop in AMK with my friend (YS). But the worst thing is this chap had no more money and he started the business using his sister's $$$ and my friend (YS)'s $$$. After some hard time with that silly shop, he went back to search for MLM (thats why u see him in Coslab now) and just throw that pathetic shop to my poor friend (YS) to handle. And i heard that he had declared bankruptcy already, but is it true or not, i dunno. B'coz i have no solid proof to say he is bankrupt. Even he is not bankrupt, he is broke and thats confirm. Btw, the Lexus that he is driving recently is not his! hahaha! that car belong to the Coslab's Boss's nephew's good friend who went oversea and ask him to take care of his car. But that lunatic kept on telling people that the Lexus is HIS.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>the person who bring you there will sit down there quietly and let the powerful speaker to talk to you.. they will say how successful they are and pressure you to sign the agreement form.... when they fail to call you to pen your signature, they will call a more powerful speaker to talk to you..<br><br>the catch is that they try not to let u leave and have some logical thinking. they<br>will try to talk about it again and agin to make you join them.. as for my case,<br>3 speaker talk to me including the KELVIN also speak to me but they also<br>can't get me to pen my signature..<br><br>my advice is that what they say to you, you just dun bother and say u wanna<br>go home and think through it.. they will say sacastic stuff like you are a grown<br>up now and should make decision your self stc... but just dun bother because<br>they are trying to make you join them..<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>That is what they learnt from NOP. Most of the guys there were from NOP. Like Steve Chew, Kelvin Ho, Edwin Chew, Sam, Eddie Tang, Alfred, Kevin Leu, jeff and etc... They are all CHEATERS! They like to use force or pressure selling and even sacastic remarks!<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>just ^^^&amp; care them and go.. they can't stop you..<br><br>just remember when u join mlm, u will have fewer and fewer friends because they are afraid of you..<br><br>the friend who introduce this to me say that when i join him, we will succeed together and if i chose not to join than we will remains as friend..<br><br>let me tell you something, whenever he saw me talking to people, he will have the thought that i spoke to other people about the mlm stuff...<br><br>one last advise...<br><br>WHEN YOUR FRIEND AS YOU TO GO SPA OR GOT GOOD THINGS TO INTRODUCE..<br>BEWARE ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THE COSLAB PEOPLE TAUGHT THEM TO<br>KISS ( KEEP IT SHORT &amp; SIMPLE ) .. ASK FOR MORE INFO BEFORE GOING OUT WITH THEM ESPECIALLY IN SMALL GROUP.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>yes!!! that the way my friend ask me, "WHEN YOUR FRIEND AS YOU TO GO SPA OR GOT GOOD THINGS TO INTRODUCE.." really sick! Please take note that there is no such things as REFUND in Coslab, thay will not allow you to do so and they will tell you all sorts of excuses to entertain you. BEWARE!!! Please dont put in yr $$$ like what i did, there is no return for yr $$$!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...juz to share my side of story,<br>was brought to COSLAB by a friend oso last wk, same ting presentation blah blah blah... but wen i dun wan they nv push me at all! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  they say they juz share as their management do not encourage hard selling to tarnish their 20 over yrs reputation. I was quite surprised oso... wah lau! all MLM always push wan leh.... so i guess everyplace has its own group of black sheeps, maybe the guy dat present to u still using his NOP ways... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> hahaha... u unlucky<br>Personally, i did check on their website &amp; ask my sis about COSLAB as she's a customer of COSLAB bt panjang for quite some time.. she said their facial heat treatment for freckles is gd &amp; a lot cheaper dan skin centre.<br>So i guess COSLAB is actually not a bad company, it juz so sad dat they decide to use MLM which ppl are skeptical abt &amp; hving the bad sheeps inside...<br>To summarise, MLM or networking is juz a marketing strategy. If u wana run, run from the UN-NEEDED products their recommending to u, not by the word MLM.<br>Networkers pls sell ur product/service to someone who realie needs it, if it works, the person will naturally recommend ppl to u, from there u get a happy networker under u. But if u sell to someone of no interest or no use, of coz he will be pissed wen u hard sell to him!<br>As for those dat hving skin problems or tinking of slimming, u might wana gv COSLAB a try as from my sis, their price r quite affordable compared to other advertised beauty salons &amp; somemore they r by respectable doctors. For those dat do not need, pls dun even waste ur time &amp; $$..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's does not necessarily mean that they are still partners now, nor does it mean they still have substiantial stakes in the company.<br><br>Secondly, it's said co-founder of Cycle and Carriage's family. It's merely 'co-founder's family'. This does not necessarily mean that the family which founded C&amp;C is still involved in the operations and decision-making process of Cycle and Carriage, and hence it's incorrect to say that Cycle and Carriage is their partner.<br><br>Even if the family indeed still runs C&amp;C and has partnered Coslab, it may still be only their family's private investment matter, and has nothing to do with C&amp;C at all. This is further substantiated by the fact that they did not state that the other co-founder is also a partner of Coslab.<br><br>Cycle and Carriage is a publicly-listed company.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by teekh:</div><div class="quote_body">Directly from the webbie:<br><br>"This is the key reason why United Overseas Bank Group and Chua family of Malaysia ( co-founder of Cycle &amp; Carriage Group ) decided to join us as equity partners forming Coslab International Holdings."<br><br>Firstly, it only said they joined as partners forming Coslab, which means they joined in at the time when Coslab was formed. It's does not necessarily mean that they are still partners now, nor does it mean they still have substiantial stakes in the company.<br><br>Secondly, it's said co-founder's family of Cycle and Carriage. It's merely 'co-founder's family'. This does not necessarily mean that the family which founded C&amp;C is still involved in the operations and decision-making process of Cycle and Carriage, and hence it's incorrect to say that Cycle and Carriage is their partner.<br><br>Even if the family indeed still runs C&amp;C and has partnered Coslab, it may still be only their family's private investment matter, and has nothing to do with C&amp;C at all. This is further substantiated by the fact that they did not state that the other co-founder is also a partner of Coslab.<br><br>Cycle and Carriage is a publicly-listed company. It's not as if the family can wish to use C&amp;C money anyhow as they like.</div></blockquote>Which you mention maybe true, as I have trouble getting an answer from them. If this is true, it should not be a problem in getting a direct answer from them.</div>

It, however, does not say whether both of the above still have stakes in the company now.</div>
