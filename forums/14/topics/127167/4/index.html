            <div class='col-md body'>Hey PinkyPink, if you are reading this, do check up DSAS website and verify if Coslab is a member of DSAS. If they are, i believe they have a cool-off period and a full-refund policy which they are obliged to give. But through some experience, i have to inform you that refunding from Coslab can be quite a tedious affair. It really depends a lot on the person that reccomended you this treatment. You might be asking depending on what? Well, morals and self-consciousness i guess?<br><br>But then again, if you haven't tried their treatment, maybe you want to give it a shot? Some people i know said it's not too bad. But others have nothing but complaints about it. One even had to go to a dermatologist for an allergy reaction that Coslab so doggedly refuse to acknowledge. Every company have its bad apples. All it takes is one dishonest lab technician to swap an ingredient in SKII, and the product line is tarnished. Same goes for a MLM distributor. What i saw happened to a friend can also happen elsewhere in other MLM companies. That is why i stand by the fact that Coslab could have provided satisfactory service to some but lacking to others.<br><br>Laurence, please correct me if i'm wrong. I believe when a distributor decides to get involved with a MLM company, he will probably put in a certain amount of money, probably in the thousands. Some companies, like Nuskin do waive off the registration charges of $60. This charge does not go into the MLM company as most people believe. I'm sure you know that the government is actually the one that ensures the administration of this charge. What i'm saying is, the companies probably absorb this cost as they would have made a profit from the goods or services transacted. But you did bring up a very good point. If the refund is 100%, then wouldn't the companies, such as Nuskin make a loss? That's something i haven't thought of, I'll go find out more....Thanks for the feedback man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I have a BIG news for u guys!!!<br><br>Few weeks ago, my friend from Coslab (ex-agent) attended their 1st guy, Steve Chew's wedding on 15/09/05.<br><br>You know what? The wedding is held at FURAMA (Waterfront), Hahahahaha...<br><br>You guys must be wondering y i laugh...<br><br>Its because that time when i joined them, they showed me Steve Chew's cheque and it stated more than $30,000. And they told me its his monthly minimum income.<br><br>Now, the question is, if a guy is earning that amount monthly, why his wedding is not held in Fulleton, but in Furama? why is he still driving C-Class instead of S-Class?<br><br>I really pity those guys who still believing Steve Chew and Kelvin Ho...<br>THEY ARE LYING!!!</div>

If yourself can't sell the product, how do you expect your downline to do the same? And if nobody consume the product where does the money come from?</div>
