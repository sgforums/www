The wedding is held at FURAMA (Waterfront), Hahahahaha...<br><br>You guys must be wondering y i laugh...<br><br>Its because that time when i joined them, they showed me Steve Chew's cheque and it stated more than $30,000. And they told me its his monthly minimum income.<br><br>Now, the question is, if a guy is earning that amount monthly, why his wedding is not held in Fulleton, but in Furama? why is he still driving C-Class instead of S-Class?<br><br>I really pity those guys who still believing Steve Chew and Kelvin Ho...<br>THEY ARE LYING!!!</div></blockquote>Hi all, i am new to this forum.

I think that this exponential growth also means that there must be exponential number of downlines to support your success.... Too many sacrifices don't u think?....

            <div class='col-md body'>hi.. whether its good or worst depends on individual perspective. Its similar to the situation where some desires to be an employee or employee for the rest of their life; some strives for riches, some prefer to be simple. The society is forcing the change. I guess its the same as in working field, is U give good guidance to your staff, they be as successful and rich as U too.. however, the gist of MLM that is lacking is good leaders cos since MLM has no min qualifications, experience and skills of participation, to nuture a batch of good leaders out of it is virtually impossible. For those that can sruvive in the MLM are those that trained by good leaders and they also possess the power to excel. Imagine you are working with the CEO \everyday vs the cleaner - for each path, how far you get?<br><br>Further, pardon me from adding - too many relatively immature and senseless people lurking around makes this system even vulnerable for negative peception.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kuayteowman:</div><div class="quote_body">MLM model is really good for all?......
