            <div class='col-md body'>Travel through history, its clear how these factors have caused kingdom, countries and empire fell. Greed for money, Hunger for power, Overwhelmed with revenge, or smitten with Woman. NO doubts endless years of war will be fight and so many innocent mankinds are suffer under these rulers.<br><br>So what do you think of war? Majority have never came across war conditions but we hated it.<br>War causes death, separation and pain that for years that people cannot forget. ItÂ’s through education, media and interaction with people that we aware of the cruelty and misery involved in war, thus we avoided at all cost.<br><br>In modern world, innocent people are still caught under such political situation. Cunning Leaders that crafty to manipulate others in seek of oneÂ’s richness, power and vengeance. It can happen at any countries politician, any industry or business, which includes Multi-Level Marketing. There are also competent leaders that are selfless, compassionate, motivator and simply great contributors. So you see, the type of leader that you are with will either harm or protect you. In times of dire straits, you ll be able to differential them. However, for some special situation, leaders are often Â“mis-useÂ” by the real mastermind.<br><br>There are so many companies, so many people, so many choices; so how to choose? For whichever choice we made today, we pay a price. I choose to post this thought in the forum, I pay the price of the time spent in thinking and drafting. ItÂ’s a matter of how much of a price to pay?<br><br>If you follow a leader that is smitten with Power, Money and woman, look through the history books for some guidance Â– I m sure you find a few characters. Best bet Â– run through the similarities of their outcome. Usually those leader gain their power through the expense of others - backstabbing, plan traps etc<br><br>Whereas a leader worth our time to digest, I m sure you ll find a few too especially those being harmed by the vice leader as above. They have their glory days and they sure do have a team of faithful followers that believe in them until generations later, people still remember and respect them. However, because of their good reputation, they are often splashed with rumors.<br><br>Think about this Mrs Bubbly<br><br>Do you know why people go into MLM? ItÂ’s for financial freedom and to own a business at a minimal capital investment.<br><br>I reiterate the above pointers as you claimed that you been Â“working FOR them for five years and get yourself into debtsÂ” Have you realized that our little diebirdstand is at least smarter than you?<br><br>On a ubiquitous statement made over the forum, I find your claims disheartening and becoming too personal.<br><br>Quoted Â“I was once very close to them....all I can say is that, they won't last for too long... dun be stupid enough to believe that they get that kinda of income every month.... The truth is NOT..... Rubbish!Â”<br><br>I cant believe a person can bear grudges for so many years that you can actually hunt them down while they go from place to place? Does that also mean that you will follow and hurl comments at them even when they work in other companies that are not MLM? Then I guess you should have earn enough money during the past 5 years in order to be so free to do so.<br><br>Apologies for those that feel offensive<br>Some may suspect I m very defensive<br>For it depends on the angle that you are viewing<br><br>Action speaks louder than words<br>True leaders show result<br>Â“Cry WolfÂ” leaders show malicious results<br><br></div>

Just like the MLM Coslab. </div></blockquote>Yes time will tell, successful or not, it's the individual's own experience at the end of the day. Better to have tried and failed than to forever hide behind a 15" monitor and discouraging everyone with uncalled unbased slander.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">You guys no need to argue so much liao. </div></blockquote>Who's arguing? It's a matured discussion without any name-calling. You're the only primate doing the screeching. Try getting out of the house once in a while &amp; get some air. It works wonders.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">It had already proven that steve and his gangs cannot make it liao.</div></blockquote>Proven? Using which formula? By which research company? You know them well enough? Oh, perhaps you can consider another nick: MLM_Judge, but i think BBSMA is more suitable. Bitter, Bald, Single &amp; Middle Aged. (Damn, i tried to avoid being personal. I apologise. I'm sure if it's not true, it shouldn't bother anyone, right?)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">If not, MLM Coslab will not fail by them. </div></blockquote>Last i heard, Coslab's MLM is still operating. Perhaps you are talking about another company.....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to update you guys soooo..... LATE.

Before selling my the PDMYB, he explained why the whole group of people from Coslab went over to Long Far.<br><br>These are the reasons:<br><br>1) At first, is only Eddie Tang who wanted to leave Coslab because he wanted to pursue his studies.<br><br>2) Eddie Tang had no more worries on all his Coslab "brothers" because he said that they were all "auto-pilot", that means they were earning BIG BUCKS.<br><br>3) The moment the top management from Long Far knew about this, they approached him to set up a new MLM company to sell PDMYB and offered him (Eddie Tang - 49%, Long Far - 51%)<br><br>4) This is the stunning part. In order to ask him to stay in Coslab MLM, the Coslab's boss counter-offer him with, i) <strong>A FREE Ferarri to drive</strong>, ii) <strong>An attractive annual income of $500,000-$700,000</strong>, iii) <strong>A small amount of shares in traditional Coslab Business</strong> and iv) <strong>to become his God-Son.</strong> WHAT A GOOD OFFER!!!<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Eddie Tang chose to accept Long Far's offer than Coslab's</span>.</strong><br><br>Any comments?</div>

Although the power of it is so. Unlike insurance or property, MLM offers you to <strong>build your own sales team</strong> and manage them instead of selling alone. At the end of the day, products still must be sold. If not, where do you expect the money to come from. <strong>MLM does not equal to pyramid selling.</strong><br><br>2) MLM is just a marketing tool. Through <strong>words of mouth</strong>, the publicity of a product is spread widely into the market, thus allowing the manufacturer to penetrate the market while cutting down on steep advertisements and promotions cost. The manufacturing company in turn brings down her profit margin and shares a cut of her profits with her independent distributors. Thus through mass and volume, the manufacturing company also gets a fair share of the rewards.<br><br>3) MLM is definately not a get rich quick scheeme. The ultimate aim of every networker is to source for a group of loyal consumers and creating a <strong>residual income</strong> from his/her faithful consumers' repeat sales.<br><br>From a book.<br><br>Three things to take note while chosing a MLM company:-<br><br>1) Is the system duplicatable? And is there a posiblility for the product to have recurring sales?<br><br>2) If not for the business opportunity, will you buy the product?<br><br>3) If not for the business opportunity, will you buy the product at this price?<br><br>Hope this has helped you in making a decision. When I was first introduce to this industry, I was telling myself, I'm not sure if I'll regret joining MLM, but I'm sure I'll regret if I didn't.<br><br>Everything else is fake, Just Do It... There is only one thing on earth that you can get without doing anything at all... and thats proverty...<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>MLM_Victim PS: Since you have been yawning so much, why don't you just go to bed early tonight, you still need to wake up early for work tomorrow. And you don't wanna be late do you? You boss is gonna be all over you if you are late for work...<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Lastly, for those who are still sitting on the fence, please it is your own life. You are only answerable to yourselves and your loved ones. Make the right choices. <strong>Making The Right Decisions Is More Important Than Putting In The Right Amount Of Effort!!!</strong> If you listen too much to losers, you might become one. By then you might have to change you Forum nick to "MLM_Vitcim's_Victim" Because of him/her, you lost a chance in a lifetime to improve your lives...</div>

The common things the agents say, bring out the hard truth, the sad truth infact... something not very well awared by the average Joe.<br><br>And for those who knows whats going around in the economy, they simply refuse to do anything to change how it is going to affect them... They rather choose to hide behind some computer screens and ensuring that all their peers remains poor like them... Personally, I call them the "Dream Eaters"<br><br>The main difference between man and animal is that we think logically, we analyse opportunity, we plan our moves... If you seriously think MLM is bad, maybe you should think twice the next time you wanna introduce your friend a good movie you watched recently or a nice yet inexpensive cafe you visited recently... Indirectly, by sharing your experience about a movie or a visit to a cafe, you are doing MLM...<br><br>MLM is simply sharing.<br><br>Just imagine one day, when all staples including rice distributes through MLM... Will you still see it as something bad?</div>
