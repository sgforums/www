            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I joined Coslab about 3 months ago.  To be frank, my uplines Bryan and Fion painted the best picture to me. I thought I was going to be super rich in a few months time. They promise me that if I follow their foot steps and do what they tell me to, I will succeed. But after a capital investment of $1,300 and now that the new company, Long Far has started. I only manage to make back about $400 from Coslab. I am still losing about $900. Anyway, I think I will do this little write-up and add some fire to the oil.<br><br>I belong to a group of youngsters under their network. But what makes me really disappointed was this particular incident. Fion was talking to a Beauty Consultant and she blurred out, Â“Aiyah, these downlines all idiots one lah, you ask them buy what they also buy.Â”(In Mandarin)  Little did she knows, I just got out of the toilet and was behind her when she call me and all her downlines  IDIOTS!!! But I didnÂ’t spread these to my other friends as I believe it would cause dispute within the group.<br><br>Anyway, about a week plus ago, I was brought down to Long Far together with some others. And the same thing happen, all the promises sounded so familiarÂ….follow us, work together with usÂ….this company will make more $$$$....we are going regionalÂ…HeyÂ…this sounds like Coslab, just much better. But once bitten twice shy, I wasnÂ’t going to jump into this thing without doing some groundwork.<br><br>To be frank, I was a bit tempted. After all, they say this product Pai Du Mei Yuan Bao (PDMYB) sells like hot cakes at pharmacies and WatsonÂ’s. It will be like Coke or Marlboro doing MLM. Sounds tempting doesnÂ’t it??? And that Long Far will be the only company selling the product soon. I did my research and guess what??? I visited 7 different WatsonÂ’s outlets. Spoke with about 12 sales staff there about the PDMYB and the response I got was, PDMYB doesnÂ’t move very well. 1 particular sales staff even ask me to try another brand which was cheaper and more effective as she had tried it herself. Maybe I should get Eddie to switch to this other brand. Therefore itÂ’s no surprise that this product will be taken off the shelves and sold by Long Far only. You trust me on this, these ex-coslab people can sell ice to Eskimos. PDMYB will definitely have a better sales volume with the ex-coslab people than at WatsonÂ’s.<br><br>How on earth can PDMYB be compared to Coke and Marlboro when not many people buy it when placed on the shelves??? Bryan and Fion are like people at the top, they probably have the whole network done up already. But what about people like me at the bottom??? I think Steve is going to be the only one who will be driving the Maserati or maybe Eddie will dig some money out of his own company and sponsor a few more Maserati just to prove me wrong. Another thing, what do I want to do with PDMYB??? I just donÂ’t think this product appeals to me or maybe just not yet.<br><br>I know the top people like Eddie, Steve, Kevin and Bryan will condemn my little write-up.  They will say things likeÂ….Tree Big Gather WindÂ…..unsuccessful person say unsuccessful stuff.  But if anyone out there have doubts, please go to any WatsonÂ’s. Spend a few hours there and see if anyone picks up PDMYB. I was at the Bugis Junction outlet from about 6pm to 7.30pm and not a single person bought that stuff. That is peak hour, plenty of human traffic, but the product didnÂ’t even sell 1 during the one and a half hour. So, how can PDMYB be compared to Coke??? Or Marlboro???<br><br>I guess itÂ’s a good thing I did my little research, if not I will believe everything they sayÂ….again.  Anyway, whatever promises they gave at Coslab, they have broken it.  I donÂ’t see why I have to risk another few hundred dollars to believe them again.  Maybe under Eddie leadership, the people who join Long Far will make money. But what happens if Eddie decide to go study again??? Or what happens if 2-3 years later, Bryan decided he wants to start a new company, am I suppose to change to a new company again??? Even I think highly of Eddie, everyone makes him sounds like god. So for those at Long Far, do take a bullet for him if necessary. And remember to take a bite out of his every meal in case someone from Coslab wants to poison him.<br><br>I hope those who seriously think of staying at Long Far, do go to WatsonÂ’s to check out how well PDMYB sells. I mean Long Far will have other products, but if the main product donÂ’t sell as well as they make it out to be, I have little faith with the rest of the products. It will be stupid to buy all the products and store them at home. I am sure you guys will be familiar with the tons of anti-oxidant we have stored under our bed.<br><br>NOP sold PDMYB before it close, then this product is taken to the retails shop. Now itÂ’s back to MLM again. If itÂ’s such a premium product, will it changes from hand to hand?  I still have a lot of doubts about Long Far. Since Coslab has already close down, I think I will go back to working for my money.<br><br>To all my friends at Long Far, do take my advice and go check out the sales of PDMYB at Watson yourself. Do not listen to whatever your uplines say, they will probably tell you they have checked it out themselves and the sales is good.  See with your own eyes, go down to a WatsonÂ’s near you and just ask the sales staff.<br><br>And lastly, FionÂ….you are a b-t-h. My friends and I contributed to your income at Coslab and you called us IDIOTS. Hope you take PDMYB and lau sai for 10 hours straight. Just be glad I never tell them what I heard.<br></div>

It's not as easy with stories about MLM.<br><br>The word "exploitation" hasn't been correctly applied since the 19th Century, used to describe slavery.

The bottom line is they should all have been passed by the HSA and no amount of praising or slandering can or should be taken too seriously.<br><br>Nti has had its fair share of "victims", it's still around. Coslab has been restructured, but it's opening up new branches as we speak. Long Far is a publicly listed company in HK and it has chosen to relauch its products perhaps due to a new marketing strategy. Will they survive and bloom or crash and burn? I say, let the market decide, not me, nor any "victims" in this forum.<br><br>In the meantime, enjoy the humour that this forum has to provide.....<br></div>

MLM will not last long...</div></blockquote>Oh Great!!! So please tell me, what will last long? Maybe the following will last long? or maybe NOT!!!<br><br>_____________________________________________________________<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solution 1</span><br><br>Sign On. Be a regular in the forces. Enjoy 10 years of wealth, only to find that you are NOT offered the pp2.<br><br><strong>Cost Involved</strong>: $0<br><br><strong>Rewards</strong>: Headstart in salary. Annual bonus, performance bonus, and many more perks.<br><br><strong>Freedom</strong>: Plenty after 10 years, you'll be so free coz you can no longer find a job @ 30+ years old with no working experience. As for freedom before the 10 years expires, I guessed nobody likes serving NS... try doing it for 10 years.<br><br><strong>At the end of the day</strong>: Thanks for your service, you are NOT offered PP2! Your services rendered shall be remembered by the country.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solution 2)</span><br><br>Go study, get a good degree and climb the corporate ladder.<br><br><strong>Cost Involved</strong>: (Estimated based on local University)<br>SGD$ 20,000  + (Opportunity Cost)<br><br>Opportunity Cost = If you don't get a degree, you might make lets say SGD$20,000 a year? So if your course of study takes 3 years; Opportunity Cost = SGD$ 60,000<br><br><strong>Hence, Cost of Study is SGD$ 80,000.00 (Estimated)</strong><br><br><strong>Rewards</strong>: A starting salary of lets say SGD$2,500 or rather SGD$30,000 a year (Trust me, if you are a fresh grad and you get this kinda salary, you should visit a temple tomolo and thank the gods)<br><br>Real Rewards: Ok, so lets say if you didn't get the degree, you probably would have gotten an increment as you have got 3 years of working experience. So, lets juz say that a NON-DEGREE holder after 3 years makes SGD$25,000 a year.  Thus a DEGREE only makes SGD$30,000 would mean that having that degree, it gives him SGD$5,000 extra every year.<br><br>So now lets see... How many YEARS does he need, to recover his cost of study, which was estimated @ SGD$80,000? Answer is <strong>16 YEARS</strong>. If you are 22 now, 3 years of studies would make you 25, by the time you BREAKEVEN the cost of your studies, you are already 41 years old!!!<br><br><strong>Freedom</strong>: If you are currently working, do you find yourself with the following:<br><br>i) Forcing yourselves to wake up early every morning<br><br>ii) Craw to the bathroom and take a shower<br><br>iii) Drag yourselves to work...<br><br>If all the above 3 happens to you, imagine this kinda lifestyle at least for the next 30 years.... Now thats the kinda freedom you'll get!!!<br><br><strong>At the end of the day</strong>: Congratulations!!! Normal people get retrenched @ age of 40!!! You have juz managed to BREAKEVEN the cost of your studies and you lose your job.<br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>Aftermath of these 2 options: When the above mentioned happens, think about whats gonna happen to:-<br><br>1) Your lovely wife<br>2) Your Adorable kids<br>3) Your aged parents<br>4) Your favourite car<br>5) Your dream house<br><br>You will probably end up:-<br><br>1) As a Taxi Driver who grumbles and complains about our government to all his passengers.<br><br>2) Commiting suside.

Annual bonus, performance bonus, and many more perks.<br><br><strong>Freedom</strong>: Plenty after 10 years, you'll be so free coz you can no longer find a job @ 30+ years old with no working experience. As for freedom before the 10 years expires, I guessed nobody likes serving NS... try doing it for 10 years.<br><br><strong>At the end of the day</strong>: Thanks for your service, you are NOT offered PP2!

So if your course of study takes 3 years; Opportunity Cost = SGD$ 60,000<br><br><strong>Hence, Cost of Study is SGD$ 80,000.00 (Estimated)</strong><br><br><strong>Rewards</strong>: A starting salary of lets say SGD$2,500 or rather SGD$30,000 a year (Trust me, if you are a fresh grad and you get this kinda salary, you should visit a temple tomolo and thank the gods)<br><br>Real Rewards: Ok, so lets say if you didn't get the degree, you probably would have gotten an increment as you have got 3 years of working experience. So, lets juz say that a NON-DEGREE holder after 3 years makes SGD$25,000 a year.  Thus a DEGREE only makes SGD$30,000 would mean that having that degree, it gives him SGD$5,000 extra every year.<br><br>So now lets see... How many YEARS does he need, to recover his cost of study, which was estimated @ SGD$80,000? Answer is <strong>16 YEARS</strong>. If you are 22 now, 3 years of studies would make you 25, by the time you BREAKEVEN the cost of your studies, you are already 41 years old!!!<br><br><strong>Freedom</strong>: If you are currently working, do you find yourself with the following:<br><br>i) Forcing yourselves to wake up early every morning<br><br>ii) Craw to the bathroom and take a shower<br><br>iii) Drag yourselves to work...<br><br>If all the above 3 happens to you, imagine this kinda lifestyle at least for the next 30 years....

I don't agree with you using the word CHEAT... Every networker signs the application form on their free will. No hoax was involved. If you had purchased a 4D ticket yesterday and your number did not appear as a winning number, would Singapore Pools allow you to refund the ticket?<br><br>If you were to start a cafe today, will you put a banner outside your cafe with big letterings saying "ALL FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF "MLM VICTIM" PLEASE DO NOT COME, I DO NOT WANT TO EARN YOUR MONEY!!!"? We are doing a business, it is the consumers' freewill to buy or not to buy.<br><br>I do not understand why you hate Steve and the rest so much, what have they done to you? If you were one who attempted to follow them and failed. Why are you only posting hurtfull comments here? Why don't you confront them straight in the face? I personally know many people who failed to make money in this industry, but they don't have to cheeks to confront any of the people you mentioned, reason being, they know from the bottom of their heart, they didn't put in enough effort.<br><br>Every individual wish to make the amount of money they make, but how many are willing to go through the amount of hardship they undertook? Nothing comes easy, especially in this country. If they are really conmans like you say, why aren't they arrested by the police?<br><br>Bill Gates once said if he had knew this powerful marketing strategy (Network Marketing) in the early 90s, he wouldn't have dumped millions of dollars into advertising...<br><br>Why was China only accepted into UN when they legalise Network Marketing?<br><br>If network marketing is really so evil as you describe, why is NTUC fairprice giving cash vouchers to existing NTUC-Link Members when they introduce non-menbers to join? And why is POSB EveryDay card offering Cash Rebates for using their card as a mode of payment?<br><br>To conclude, the whole world is slowly moving towards this evil thingy you say. This is a fact be it you like it or not. 5% of the world's population will gain wealth from it. Either you join the 5% and enjoy a 95% of the rest of the population as your targeted market, or you sit in the 95% class and watch the 5% getting rich.</div>

Angry with the world, but more so for his own "foolishness" for allowing himself to think MLM is something like a person who has caused him to be the "failure" that he is today... and will go on putting the blame on MLM for his sorrow state now and in future. Another fitting nick would be Kopitiam_Uncle. If the internet is not available for me for my quick fix of entertainment, i would pay 70 cents and sit briefly at kopitiams (usually frequented by middle-aged uncles) and listen to them rant about the government, the rising fuel prices &amp; compare how much Progress money they got. Except that they are talking among themselves and not airing their foolishness in public i.e. internet.<br><br>MLM_Victim was a "victim" a year ago, is a "victim" today, and will continue to be be a "victim" in the years to come. Perhaps, if he garners enough support from fellow "victims", he can champion a non-profit support group for other "MLM_Victims" and rally the government to ban all MLM companies and on the way, might as well just start banning every other business, trades, that do not serve his/their cause. Hey, we should just go back to the kampong era where everyone can just barter trade and rear pheasants &amp; plant coconuts. No money, no greed, no MLM, no "victims".<br><br>But i'm sure MLM_Victim means no harm, just as much as he doesn't realise the embarrassment he's caused to himself by posting intellectually-challenged questions. Readers can see right through that he's just clouded by a over-cooked grief he experienced years ago. Bad experiences are quite traumatic, i tell you. Just ask Michael Jackson.<br><br>A quick reply to the questions posted:<br><br><blockquote>PDMYB is a product that last time NOP was selling, and now Watson is selling.<br>If really can sell like hot cakes, why they need you?</blockquote>Because they are adopting the MLM approach, which requires people, word-of-mouth to move its products. Duh.....<br><br><blockquote>If really can sell like hot cakes, why NOP fail to do so?</blockquote>Because NOP was more interested in selling columbarium &amp; Indonesian Club Membership, which eventually wound up the company due to financial issues.<br>Back to MLM basics, personal care products &amp; home/family care products make up more than 60% of direct sales companies' sales. (source: <a href="http://www.dsa.org/pubs/numbers/#PRODUCT" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsa.org/pubs/numbers/#PRODUCT</a>) Notice that it doesn't mention anything about columbarium or club memberships? Trying to reinvent the wheel (unsuccessfully) caused NOP's demise, not PDMYB.<br><br><blockquote>If really can sell like hot cakes, why Watson fail to do so?</blockquote>Watson's carries more than a thousand products. Does that mean that every single product it carries is a hotcake? Watson's is only a retail organization responsible only for putting up products on its shelves. Marketing campaigns, promotions, are entirely up to the suppliers. If the suppliers do not deem allocating a high marketing budget to boost the awareness of a certain product, then that's their business. It doesn't fly off the shelves? It's certainly not because it's no good.<br>Again, another shallow insight, revealing a lack of understanding of how the retail market operates.<br><br><blockquote>Please dont tell me that NOP cannot make it, cos if you tell me that, that's mean Steve Chew, Eddie Tang and the gang SUX, cos they were those people who were selling PDMYB at that time.</blockquote>Firstly, there's no logic in this statement. Whether a company can make it or not is not dependent on whether its agents "SUX" or not. Like how my damaged motorola does not mean motorola or Singtel should be investigated by the FBI for fraudulently selling faulty sets to customers. No logic.<br>NOP did not consist of ONLY those few names above. Sure they sold PDMYB then as representative agents of NOP. The demise of NOP was not due to them or PDMYB. Read para 6 again.<br><br>In summary, the content (and grammar) of a post can certainly tell a person's credibility, maturity, intellect, iq, amongst many other things.<br><br>Like what Mark Twain said,<br><span style="color: red;"></span>"It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt".</div>

But mlm is also a business that is based on trust. I trusted my friend, that's why I join Coslab. I trusted the uplines' promises, that's why I approached my friends to ask them to join. Now that everything is in a chaos, it has indirectly affected the trust my friends have in me. Imagine those people I approached whom never join me at coslab. They will be saying....See, told you so...cannot do one.<br><br>Yes, I do have the urge to join the new company because I see so many people there. But at the same time, is money more important than my credibility??? PDMYB may be a good product, Long Far may be the next up and coming mlm company. But the presentation given to me just sounds too good to be true. I have no doubts that under the leadership of all the top people, Long Far will really go long and far. I have no doubt that PDMYB works. But my doubt came when they tell me this product sells on it's own. If it is so, how come after 22 years since my mum gave birth to me then  I heard of this product thru Long Far.<br><br>I only took less than 2 hours of my time to do a simple research. I don't think that is hard working. If 2 hours can save me from making the same mistake again, why not?<br></div>

If you had, it should take you roughly 20secs to find out that LongFar was established only in 1998, not 2 decades ago. That would make you, let's see, 14 years old. It arrived in Singapore only in 2000 or so, if i'm correct.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not about PDMYB, it about those top guys!<br><br>I was once the downline of these top guys and they too ever showed me their big fat paycheck (that they earned in the begining) and somehow I got to believe that we can make it as big as them. After workin FOR them for five years......... I got into more debts than earning that promised income... imagine that my house is stocked up with those unsold PDMYB...in the end, i threw them all away...<br><br>I was once very close to them....all I can say is that, they won't last for too long... dun be stupid enough to believe that they get that kinda of income every month.... The truth is NOT..... Rubbish! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>
