            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>I have to clarify I'm not in Coslab or have anyone related to it.... MLM is a good business model provided a stable company and good products to support it.  I dun deny there are bad companies out there, but most of the time, just because you fail at the business and then claim that its a scam..... ask yourself, 1) if you dun wanna buy something, can anybody force you?<br>2) if you joined cos you're tempted by the opportunity, did you really put in effort for it??? (you know it yourself)<br>3) pls get all your stupid facts right before commenting.... you dun wanna get sued for this.....<br>4) i presume you guys failed in the business to be so bitter..... Remember this.... "Business dun fail... People Do!!!!!!" so wake up... take a look at yourself before blaming everyone and everything other than YOURSELF!!!!<br><br>Dun be so naive..... if many others can make good money out of it, ask yourself why you FAILED...... b'cos you didn't take it seriously and expected fantastic results to fall from the sky..... Crazy.... even by working outside, you wait long long for durians to fall oki????</div>

If you failed, take it like a man and dun go around saying ppl scam you.<br><br>In the business world, I dun blame ppl if I get scammed, only myself to blame for being stupid to be taken in..... although not to say mlm is a scam<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me share with u something about this so-call successful KELVIN HO. He was successful in NOP after CID, not Coslab. He failed in NOP and he went out and set up a small and typical comic shop in AMK with my friend (YS). But the worst thing is this chap had no more money and he started the business using his sister's $$$ and my friend (YS)'s $$$. After some hard time with that silly shop, he went back to search for MLM (thats why u see him in Coslab now) and just throw that pathetic shop to my poor friend (YS) to handle. And i heard that he had declared bankruptcy already, but is it true or not, i dunno. B'coz i have no solid proof to say he is bankrupt. Even he is not bankrupt, he is broke and thats confirm. Btw, the Lexus that he is driving recently is not his! hahaha! that car belong to the Coslab's Boss's nephew's good friend who went oversea and ask him to take care of his car. But that lunatic kept on telling people that the Lexus is HIS.<br><br>Most of the guys there were from NOP. Like Steve Chew, Kelvin Ho, Edwin Chew, Sam, Eddie Tang, Alfred, Kevin Leu, jeff and etc... They are all CHEATERS! They like to use force or pressure selling and even sacastic remarks!<br><br>my friend ask me, "WHEN YOUR FRIEND AS YOU TO GO SPA OR GOT GOOD THINGS TO INTRODUCE.." really sick! Please take note that there is no such things as REFUND in Coslab, thay will not allow you to do so and they will tell you all sorts of excuses to entertain you. BEWARE!!! Please dont put in yr $$$ like what i did, there is no return for yr $$$!<br><br>My friend (joined NOP before) and i was introduced by my campmate. my campmate told me that he was bringing us to a spa. but end up in a MLM company. there is this guy called kevin (also from NOP too) presented the whole things to us. after everything, both of us said we want to consider but they became more and more pressuring (typical MLM tactics). in the end, both of us sign-up. before sign-up, they promised everything and anything! after we sign-up, nobody bothers! we felt cheated. I have no doubts about their products. is the way they do! its like NOP! that kelvin is a bankrupt poor man! how can a bankrupt man be a top guys of a MLM company? that steve is a hypocrite. heard from my friend, both of them are those directors in NOP.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all,<br><br>No matter what industries you are in- 80 to 90% of the people will not make it to where they want to go. Example:-<br><br>1) Employee - only 5 to 10 % of the employee will climb to the top of the corporate ladder. 20% of them whom worked really hard will not reach it at all. The remaining percentage of the employees are there just to make salary and not really committed to their work.<br><br>2) Business - The statisitc in all develope countries have shown that on average 95% of businesses failed in their first attempt (within 3 years, they wind up the business).  5% who succeeded in the businesses are mostly people whom have failed before.  What can we learn from here? You think about it.<br><br>3) mlm/ insurance/ property - on average 80 to 98% of the people will failed.  Personally, I have friends who failed in insurance and property.  They told me that it is not an easy industry to be in.  I can't give any comment to them as I am not in the industries myself.  But I have to admit that I have attended real esate agent seminar and the company's speaker (CEO himself)  did a great job by motivating the people thru making good money and have nice house, holiday etc.  People who heard that may joined as property agent but only a small % will make it. The rest will give up sooner or later or just work as a part time agent. So no matter what you choose to do (mlm, insurance, property, etc) it will be the same.<br><br>No one can guarantee you or me that we will 100% succeed.  The fate lies with us.  Do not make it a habit to blame others or the industries if failed.  Do not bad mouth as it will not look good on you.  I may not know what Coslab is doing but I believe there will deem to have blacksheeps.  Blacksheeps are everywhere.  Think about it, have you steal anything form your company? It can be just a pen, paper clip, surfing the net while working, etc? Have you taken something that does not belong to you?  Have you ever tell a lied in your life?  If you have, than you were once a blacksheep. I admitted that I have done that before and I am not proud of it.  I have to first admit, change and improve.<br><br>If by badmouthing people and industries can change things, than by all means go ahead.  If not, it will be better if we can think of constructive ways to improve the situation rather than writing and badmouthing for 100 years.<br><br>Last but not least, never badmouth using company's name and especially people names.  If ever you knew someone is badmouthing you, am sure you will like to solve the problem by talking to that person.  If you really hate someone or unhappy with someone, go to him direct and it will serve a purpose. If you don't want to solve the problem with the other party, and just want to spread rumour (whether is true or false), than you serve no purpose at all.  I suggest you to talk to those people whom you are not please with.  Other methods used will be = badmouthing with no guts.  Trust me, anyone who bad mouth other will not have the guts to release their real name and have no guts to meet up. Reason is that they know thier name will be used next for badmouthing in the forum.<br><br>Solve problems by thinking of a solution is better than creating problems out of a a single problem.<br><br>Have a good life.<br><br>Regards<br>Kevin Foo<br>halftime90@yahoo.com<br><br></div>

With many scams around, the distinction between MLM and pyramids blurr in the eyes of consumers. Plus, its not one company vs another company. Its one company's distributors on a mass scale vs another company's distributors on the mass scale. It not an interest harped by a company management and the employees, Its an interest sought by the number of agents being recruited. With all these, how not to have bad mouth and all that.<br><br>Besides, if anyone have to remain professional, first thing is to ignore what they see as badmouth. Its very hard to know the truth, so might as well clarify on core fundamentals, like products and mkting plan. These are some of the things a company can clear itself on.<br><br>In anyway, if ever the singapore gahmen or people wish to tighten the regulations on mlm or even ban it altogether, its very safe to say its the fault of the industry movers, like the dsas for eg, on many grounds.<br><br></div>
