              <p>A long time friend of mine recently sms me to seek permission if she can 'borrow' my hse add. She told me that she was joining amway. As her parents are the conservative type, they won't allow her to join. Thus, using my mailbox as her letters medium.</p>
              <p>As I had been scammed in VE before, I advised her that mlm is all the same. Furthermore, amway is the 'father' of all mlm and has been around for so long. How is she going to climb up the ladder. And I told her of my experience in VE.</p>
              <p>All all she could say was, "Amway has a different system than VE and it really works.". Another brainwashed fellow.</p>

They have hundreds of thousands of members world wide and Singapore is the 96th stop in its globalization path... i.e. if your friend want to join, your friend is at the extreme bottom right now... and since its already well established, its harder to find new members...</p>

              <p>How come its super duper tough? Did you try it before?</p>
              <p>Anyway, nobody said that the business is easy.. it requires lots of effort.. but that's also what makes it worthwhile and stable. The only thing is that there is no risk, since there is no large investment of capital, so since there is nothing to lose, it cannot be a scam. Of coz if dun do anything or do not put in effort.. will take longer time... its only fair..</p>
              <p>And oh, the 90-day money-back guarantee for the products and the 1-year money back guarantee for the starter kit is not an empty promise, it's written down in black and white by the company.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Oh pls, of course there's no large investments. However, how about transport cost? How about membership fees? The money required to pay for the products that you must buy per month? She's still a student mind you and $50 is not easy to come by for a student.</p>
              <p>The time wasted there? More effort you say? When I was in VE, my upline worked her shit off. However, one of the other distributors were more cunning and manipulative and earn more than her.</p>
              <p>So what if it's written black and white? It's easy to use delaying tactics and in the end, cannot 're-fund'.</p>
              <p>Can't really explain much. I can gurantee you, 1 year down the road, you would wake up the idea of making it big in est. co. esp when it's an old one.</p>

              <p>I think firstly, there's no requirement to buy products every month.</p>
              <p>Also, the products are mainly daily products that we all use every day, so we will still buy it somehow whether from here or the supermarket, so its just simply redirect purchases rather than forking out to buy extra unnecessary products.</p>
              <p>Cunning and being manipulative will not work for the long term, maybe short term, but sooner, everybody will see the person's true colours and the business will collapse.. that's why to build a long-term one is simply to have integrity, care for others and willing to put in the effort to build and work.</p>
              <p>The delaying tactic will also only be done by cunning and manipulative people as described above.</p>
              <p>No matter which company, as long as it is a reputable one, it depends on one's individual effort.</p>
