              <p>Â </p>
              <p>For the benefit of those who don't know what we are discussing, Amway is an company that sell good quality consummer product and they also operate by selling their product through their distributor who registered with them.Their info :<br><br>Amway Singapore<br>Weblink : http://www.amway2u.com/mall_main.jsp?ctry=11&amp;locale=en_US<br><br>They usually held their talk at CA Success Associates, 112 Middle Rd #06-04 Midland House Singapore 188970</p>
              <p>Do take notice, unless you are "very interested" to become their distributor, I would not advise you to attend their talk, because from what I heard from my friend, they will usually tried to "held" you back "until" you pay their registered fee of maybe $60 or they would asked you to give them your IC, photocopy and fill in the application form before you can go.(Don't say I don't warn you!) To be frank there are some advantage and disadvantage of their business:unless you have a very good network of friends to sell their product, otherwise you have to bring in your friend to these "talk" and if they join, Amway will pay you 4% of "referal fee"(One way to earn $$$).Another Amway's attractive is that even when you have "passed away", they will still pay "4%" of their profit/peanut to your family members,(not sure if this is true?) from what I heard.Also another of their "brain-washing" methods is that they will have a team of "professional people" to help you in this business and when you learn from them, you become "professional" as well.They also offered travel plan for leisure and different branch "exchange" purpose. <br>Â  <br>The disadvantage is from what we know , MLM is usually the top management that is the big winner, also I have heard story that those distributors are the one that ended up being their "customer" and keep stock of goods in their home instead of selling and make profit !(From what I heard only, those people who have this similar experience is welcome to share in this forum).In fact they will tell you some funny reason that they choose not to sell their product in supermarket because they won't earned much this way, only through distributor system "Communicate" is the power of selling and when you spread the "Wonder" of Amway product would then we sells and earn ?(which obviously not the real and lousy reason, if "talking" is so powerfully, then all the advertisment firm will go bankrupt and we can only know that is a good fast food resturant called Macdonald by our friends!)</p>
