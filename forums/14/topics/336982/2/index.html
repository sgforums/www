              <p>I think firstly, there's no requirement to buy products every month.</p>
              <p>Also, the products are mainly daily products that we all use every day, so we will still buy it somehow whether from here or the supermarket, so its just simply redirect purchases rather than forking out to buy extra unnecessary products.</p>
              <p>Cunning and being manipulative will not work for the long term, maybe short term, but sooner, everybody will see the person's true colours and the business will collapse.. that's why to build a long-term one is simply to have integrity, care for others and willing to put in the effort to build and work.</p>
              <p>The delaying tactic will also only be done by cunning and manipulative people as described above.</p>

              <p><br>Nope. The 'original' plan is for the pioneers to easily get promoted. More of the confidence booster for the downlines. Those incentives and % of profits came from a source which is own or downline sales. Lets say the new co. made it difficult to promote people, then no one would be confident that the new co. is good. and if the co. remain the same plan, then there would be majority of the agents to of the same ranks. Which we fail to see in mlm. The few on top and the rest in the bottom.</p>
