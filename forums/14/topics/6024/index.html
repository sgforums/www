            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Comments<br>A while back, I was browsing these newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of CASH within weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00 plus stamps! So I thought, "Yeah, right, this must be a scam!" But like most of us I was curious and kept reading. It said that if you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and addresses listed in the article, you could make thousands in a very short period of time. You then place your own name and address at the bottom of the list at #6, and post the article to at least 300 newsgroups. (There are about 32,000 of them out there and that's quite a large market pool). No catch, that was it. Even though the investment was a measly $6, I had three questions that needed to be answered before I could get involved in this sort of thing.<br><br>1. IS THIS REALLY LEGAL? I called a lawyer first. The lawyer was a little sceptical that I would actually make any CASH but he said it WAS LEGAL if I wanted to try it. I told him it sounded a lot like a chain letter but the details of the system (SEE BELOW) actually made it a legitimate legal business.<br><br>2. IS IT OK WITH THE POST OFFICE OR IS IT MAIL FRAUD? I called them: 1-800-725-2161 and they confirmed THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! (See 18, sections 1302 NS 1341 of Postal Lottery Laws). This clarifies the program of collecting names and addresses for a mailing list.<br><br>3. IS IT RIGHT? Well, everyone who sends me a buck has a good chance of getting A LOT of CASH ... a much better chance than buying a lottery ticket!!!<br><br>So, having these questions answered, I invested EXACTLY $7.92 ... six $1.00 bills and six 32 cent postage stamps ... and boy am I glad I did!!! Within 7 days, I started getting CASH in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon and didn't give it another thought. But the CASH continued coming in. In my first week I made between $20 to $30. By the end of the second week I had made a total of $1,000.00. In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and it was still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over $42,000 and it's still coming in ..... It's certainly worth $6.00 and 6 stamps !!!<br><br>Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more CASH than you thought possible by doing something so easy!<br><br>Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the CASH come in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)<br><br>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and there is virtually no risk - it really works!!!! If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions. You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the CASH made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list.<br><br>Here are the 4 easy steps to success: STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:<br><br>#1) J. Osborne 2010 Elmhurst Ave. Montreal, Quebec, h4b 1y3 CANADA<br><br>#2) C. Leggett PO Box 771 Sterling, Ak 99672<br><br>#3) NIck V. 57 HAYNES RD West Hartford, CT 06117<br><br>#4) Praveen Kalla, 1818 Irish Way, South Bend, IN-46637<br><br>#5) Hichem Souahi, 204 Gillespie, Sherbrooke, Quebec, J1H 4X3 CANADA<br><br>#6) Fakhzan Firdaus, 19 Jalan 18/41A, 40200 Shah Alam, Selangor, MALAYSIA<br><br>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list.<br><br>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to the original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least 300 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 32,000 groups) All you need is 300, but remember, the more you post, the more CASH you make! This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Sec. 18 1302 NS &amp; 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need CASH, you can use it again, and again.<br><br>PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by them carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. If you are a person of integrity, the program will continue and the CASH that so many others have received will come your way. NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of CASH in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the first six people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business!<br><br>---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS<br><br>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this letter, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory.<br><br>Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into the notepad so that you can add your name to the list.<br><br>Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back to.<br><br>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.)<br><br>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup!<br><br>**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE CASH YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 300**<br><br>That's it! You will begin receiving CASH from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.**<br><br>Now the WHY part: Out of 300 postings, say I receive only 7 replies (a very low example). So then I made $7.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the 7 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 300 postings, each with my name at #5 and only 7 persons respond to each of the 7 original 7, that is another $49.00 for me, now those 49 each make 300 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and I get 7 replies each, I will bring in an additional $343.00! Now, those 343 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 300 with my name at #3 and only receive 7 replies each, I will make an additional $2401.00! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 2401 persons post a MINIMUM 300 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 7 replies, that just made me $16,807.00!!! Those 16807 persons will all deliver this message to 300 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if 7 persons per 300 Newsgroups react I will receive $117,649.00! With an original investment of only $6.00! And some stamps. AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday? JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the CASH? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try?<br><br>Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet.<br><br>Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work.<br><br>** By the way, if you try to deceive people by posting the messages with your name in the list and not sending the CASH to the rest of the people already on the list, you will NOT get as much. Someone I talked to knew someone who did that and he only made about $150.00, and that's after seven or eight weeks! Then he sent the 6 $1.00 bills, people added him to their lists, and in 4-5 weeks he had over $10k. This is the fairest and most honest way I have ever seen to share the wealth of the world without costing anything but our time!!! You also may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future CASH. Make sure you print this article out RIGHT NOW! Also, try to keep a list of everyone that sends you CASH and always keep an eye on the newsgroups to make sure everyone is playing fairly. Remember, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. You don't need to cheat the basic idea to make CASH!! GOOD LUCK to all and please play fairly and reap the huge rewards from this, which is tons of extra CASH.<br><br>Please remember to declare your extra income. Thanks once again...<br><br>"People have asked me if this is really legal. Well, it is! You are using the Internet to advertise your business. What is that business? You are creating a mailing list of people who are interested in home based computer and online business and methods of generating income at home. Remember, people send you a small fee to be added to your mailing list. It is legal. what will you do with your list of thousands of names? That's up to you." So, build your mailing list, keep good accounts, declare the income and pay your taxes. By doing this you prove your business intentions. Keep an eye on the newsgroups and when the cash has stopped coming (that means your name is no longer on the list), you just take the latest posting at the newsgroups, send another $6.00 to the names stated on the list, make your corrections (put your name at #6) and start posting again.<br><br>NOTES: *1. In some countries, the export of the country's exchange is illegal. But you can get the license to do this from the post office, explaining the above statements (that you have an online business, etc. You may have to pay an extra tax, but that's OK, the amount of the incoming CASH is HUGE! And as I said, a few countries have that restriction . *2. You may want to buy mailing and e-mail lists for future CASH. (Or Database or Spreadsheet software.) *3. If you're really not sure or still think this can't be for real, please print a copy of this article and give it to someone who really needs the CASH, and see what happens. *4. You will start getting responses within 1-2 weeks, it depends.<br><br>***ALSO REMEMBER*** SEND YOUR $1 OUT TO EVERYONE ON THE LIST, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT FROM THE U.S.. BY DOING SO, YOU'RE EXPANDING YOUR BUSINESS TO THE ENTIRE WORLD AND SECURING YOURSELF AN EVEN LARGER INCOME.<br><br>WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? $$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!$$$!!!<br><br>GOOD LUCK!!!<br><br></div>
