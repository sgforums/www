            <div class='col-md body'>Good MLMs? Probably FLP is the only that looks decent up till now those I seen. More product oriented. But still the idea of luring people into the trade with prospects of fast bucks always bring in the wrong type of people. Nothing wrong with MLM, just the people.<br><br>I had a close shave with Amway recently. But it was a very bad experience.<br><br>One day out of the blue someone called me introducing himself as a friend of my friend who's also into engineering line and asked whether am I open to business opportunities in the engineering sector. Of course I told him yes. He told me he's currently doing a business project with some professionals in the engineering line so he'd like to find partners also in this line.<br><br>I was thinking since it's in the same line even if we cannot become partners, we can become friends, who knows what opportunities may come up in future. Or he could be able to sell something for my company that we want.<br><br>Then he asked to meet me to pass me a disc which presents the idea of the their project. I met him outside during my break time and an innocent looking young man passed me a disc entitled Pablo &amp; Bruno. I looked at the disc and thought what has engineering got to do with cartoons. But perhaps it's some teaching related projects.<br><br>I took the disc back to office and briefly skim through the disc but found that  the discs was full of cartoons and some piping stuffs. So I called him directly and asked him straight what is it. But he refused to reveal and insisted on meeting on Friday before revealing more about this project.<br><br>Bear in mind that the idea he insistantly portrays is an engineering project.<br><br>Then after I knock off, I went home and went through the entire disc. I was taken aback. This is truely a MLM disc! My wife also told me it's an Amway disc. I was so pissed. The reason why I got so pissed was not because it's Amway. But because he had to create such a big lie to con me out!<br><br>I have totally nothing against MLM though I don't really approve the ethics coursing through the veins of most of the current MLM reps. But if he has to lie to con someone out. Then how truthful is this person when he goes into detailed presentations.<br><br>Anyway I called him the same night and told him nicely that I went through the whole disc and I'd appreciate that he be honest to me. Dishonesty is an immediate short cut to call off any business deals. I also revealed that I know it's Amway and I'm not interested in MLM. Even if it were to be a normal supplier for my current course of work, I'd rather buy things I need/want from someone with integrity and honesty but with higher prices. The moment I know the supplier is lying for unreasonable selfish gains, I'd not hesitate to cancel my PO/WO and black list that guy.</div>
