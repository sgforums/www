            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you that lots of pple out there think tat MLM business is not appropriate and viable, usually says tat it is a pyramid scheme. But in actual fact how many out there really fully understand wat it means by MLM/Network Marketing? Sad to say tat traditional type business has saturated the mind of many pple out there in the marketplace. Anything not of the old tradition normally create doubts. Agree?<br><br>See below my ans to ur qns<br><br>1. What are the factors that make an MLM good?<br>Marketing plan and products. Marketing plan will tell you how much you can    earn from ur effort. Products tat is marketable now and in the future are important to every business.<br><br>2.  As long as I can make money, should I care how I make it? or what products I promote?<br>(I too, like most people, like to make a quick buck. Even if I do not want the products, someone else might right? eg, slimming pills, facials. )<br>Before you can be an effective distributor, you ought to know ur products in and out. If u can't convince urself then how r u able to convince others.<br><br>3. Most MLMs pay more for recruiting than retailing. Why is it? And is that bad practice?<br>MLM company, like Amway and Avon started by doing direct sales. But soon distributors realized tat by purely selling, they can't earn much and it is very time and energy consuming. So they embarked on building networks, meaning recruiting downlines. I won't say getting paid from recruiting, but commision due from the stocks that new recruit has to purchase upon signing up.<br><br>4. I earn my friends' money by recruiting them.<br>But they are buying the chance to resell the distributorship and make money from their friends. And so on.<br>So everybody gets rich together as long as people believe and keep joining.<br>Win-win situation right?<br>What do you think?<br>I don't think tat is the right motivation to involve in MLM/Network Marketing. Don't forget u will be the lead for ur direct downlines and u have to keep them going otherwise the whole network will just stop and gone bust. So how many direct downlines can u handle at one time. There should reach a pt tat u juz concentrate helping ur direct downlines to recruit their own downlines. Ur ultimate goal in MLM should be tat residual income generated by the pple in ur entire network.<br><br>5. Do all MLMs ask for initial investments and monthly maintenance? Is this a justified expense for having your own "business"? Or is this the way money is earned money from downlines?<br>It depends on the Marketing Plan.<br><br>6. Who is supporting the MLMs? The consumers or the distributors?<br>Both. There r pple who only want to use but not joining. Distributors most of time r oso users of their own products.<br><br>7. It is said that only the top few guys who pioneer the MLM will earn.<br>So is it ok as long as I am the first few to join?<br>(eg, the new MLM Long far that started few weeks ago)<br>It is the person who presevere tat will rise up to the top. MLM/Network Marketing is not easy business, it is not like some who said it is a get-rich-quick scheme. Requires a lot of patience and effort.<br><br>8. What do you think of  Long Far?<br>If Long Far is started by ex-Coslab agents. And Coslab was started by ex-NOP agents. Then they must have a lot of MLM expertise and experience right?<br>No idea.<br><br>9. Which MLMs do you know that limits the number of distributors in an area?<br>No idea too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for putting things into pespective!<br><br>my friends who are trying to get me to join their downlines tells me that recruiting is the whole point of the business. think we all got too carried away with the payment plan.<br><br>i thought that its ok if i do not like the product as long as someone else needs it. for example, doctors do not eat all the medication they sell in the clinic.<br><br>I see the point now, that if i do not like the products, how can i convince others to use it?<br><br>now i should find an MLM that carries a product that i personally believe in and will keep using. then, i will not feel like i am promoting some inferior stuffs just to make money. or worst, just earn money from recruiting.<br><br>does anyone know where i can get a list of MLMs in Singapore, and the products they market?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nobody other than the police in consultation with the Attorney General can decide whether a scheme is indeed a fraud. It is unfair to MLMs to label them as frauds in general but certainly, recruiting MLMs which have little or no product movement is definitely fraud. A MLM that does not show the minimum, maximum, mean, median and average income of its distributors violate MLM law. It all boils down to a case by case basis and that website is a good indicator to help you decide if the particular MLM you are interested in is potentially a fraud.
