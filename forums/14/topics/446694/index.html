              <p>The List of Questions i can't seems to find an answer to.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Am I that scary that nobody posts in my threads these days?<br> <br> </li>
              <li>Aren't newbies searching for answers to doing MLM, so why is that since I eliminated skeptism, the replies ceased?<br> <br> </li>
              <li>Am i not helping in terms of providing Facts and genuine answers 
              to questions from the floor..so why would forum users wants to learn 
              from other users and not me..when point out mistakes just so everybody can learn and improve for the better.<br> <br> </li>
              <li>Do people here actually prefer to learn how to make themselves 
              poorer by learning the wrong things than push the blame to others?<br> <br> </li>
              <li>There are still users with questions, but they just refuse to post in my thread..WHY?<br> <br> </li>
              <li>If i reply in other people's MLM thread, soon after, the thread 
              goes silent..so am I a sniper/killer when it comes to elimination 
              response..<br> <br> </li>
              <li>I thought everybody here started learning MLM to make $_$ isn't 
              it, so why when I want to share and help the loss, many refuses to reach
               out their hands (by asking me) and prefer to ask inexperienced 
              individuals who will instead provide harmful answers that works against 
              them?<br> <br> </li>
              <li>I know i Directly caused much Active MLM Thread users to flock to 
              other forums, thus the silence..but aren't I helpful, or is it that with
               me posting facts, so why aren't people keen to learn? - So what went 
              wrong??</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I know nobody will reply to this..since after so 
              long, I notice it's change from a trend to a Fact then to become a 
              History..when me around, this MLM thread is going into History with 
              decreasing New Threads unlike those Active days where it was considered 
              the top 5 Sgforums threads to talk to..</p>
              <p>I just don't get it..Everybody is working towards making MORE MONEY..</p>

              <p>1. You are not scary.</p>
              <p>2. Because they probably have not reach your level, or they've already understood what you mean. Or it could be because they themselves need more research on MLM. You and I know quite a lot in this areas thus able to provide valuable advices. I also notice people stopped replying threads in MLM after we've given them advice. I am also curious about the reason. MLM is not only selling, it's also about network making. They lack of this.</p>
              <p>3. We are all sharing useful information and experiences that we have. Some reply to clarify certain concepts, some post to seek more information, some gotten information already and stop replying without a gratitude of thanks.</p>
              <p>4. They read your advice, and ponders a bit, and went to look for more self reading materials. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>5. Could be turned off by the first 30 post, wait 5min.</p>
              <p>6. MLM is a unique field by itself for the unique special person with the right attitude. The problem does not lies in you. The problem lies in the user who have not yet appreciated your comments.</p>
              <p>7. MLM forum here is not consider the more popular ones. People come to look for short term solutions. The user himself may be someone who is struggling and unable to digest your advice at the current moment.  </p>
              <p>8. Queries in MLM forums are usually product/company specific. In short, they related MLMer as sales person. They have no other interest beside sellings their product or to enquire basic level of understanding on these product or sales techniques. On the contrary, serious MLMer know the difference between sales and MLM, is highly driven personel, and is able to appreciate valuable advice better. These group of people not only keen in MLM but also seek greater understanding of the model and techniques, sales model and skills presented in model.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, I'm into MLM topics too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> Guess you found a forumer who gotta similar frequency.</p>

              <p>The critical fact that 99.9% of individuals who's interested in Network Marketing failed because none of their uplines even taught them about the importantance of Network Marketing, and all are just plainly focusing on Sales , Recruitment, and Bulk Sales.</p>
              <p>It was only from my Painful Experience of falling down in my 1st MLM company which those old forum users will know..that I relearn the whole thing of MLM with change in perspective..</p>
              <p>From recruiting intention to learning business model, strengths and weakness..plus identifying if a business is workable in the long run for each individual based on their interest and level of commitment.</p>
              <p>Now I'm into learn business models, approaches of any businesses, be it sales, network marketing, online etc..</p>
              <p>Moving on, I like to help, but it seems like nobody is willing to even ask..</p>
              <p>How I got to my current level is only possible via exploring different companies, business, asking the right questions, observations, communicating &amp; learning from each other (thus my long term efforts is answering questions)..most importantly, reflecting on my actions and fine-tunning my behaviors and habits.</p>
              <p>To me, answering questions helps me learn faster..without any newbie mlm agents/people asking questions, there's only limited growth in knowledge, experience and wisdom..</p>
              <p>Reading up threads helps only in Theory, but not in real life..thus i explore and meet people..something that not even a handful of individuals would like to..</p>
              <p>At least I'm glad that my thread for this isn't dead silence.</p>
              <p>Finding a fellow user who's on similar frequency is good, but requires more from the others to keep the motion going, else 2 person talking about network marketing is not as interested and engaging as compared to chatting with people of different frequencies that helps spark the learning process.</p>

              <p>thanks..</p>
              <p>the reason i'm stil into Network Marketing..isn't because I'm doing it..but rather, i still view it as a place where I can learn from..in terms of handling clients, difficult clients, trouble-makers and getting to meet new people..which is fun..</p>
              <p>I've since moved on..for they can't give me rooms to learn anymore..unless i have an invitiation to learn in management level..currently learning how to do business online..not actually learning stage, but implementing it, and starting to offer consultancy..i'll leave it till here..to remain relevant to MLM topic.</p>
              <p>I actually had this interesting experience..when a Foreign MLM company came to Singapore previously, I send an email over with my list of experiences, their 2nd in command co-founder/silver president replied..</p>
              <p>Saying they will decline my Management request but offer me a 001 direct sponsor under their management instead to lead asia..which I rejected..due to no room for learning.. I still keep a copy of that email with me in my Inbox..but that's the past..</p>
              <p>Although I'm not interested in being a distributor, i'm keen to teach and share my experiences..which is why i'm here..all these while..</p>
              <p>Most importantly, it is still Free..then comes the question..why isn't there any newbies who's keen to real the real stuff?</p>

              <p>just look at the Straits Time and pray another foreign company MLM will start business in Singapore soon lor..</p>
              <p>than maybe your chance will come..</p>
              <p>but based on my experience..they will contact people whom they know in the respective country prior to even finding/renting an office..</p>
              <p>as for me finding that company on newspaper..it was luck..that's all i could say..</p>
              <p>as for being 001 in Asia..that's not the issue..the key issue in determining if an opportunity is right for me based on what I currently know of business in terms of Network Marketing..what i see is low sales, as Singaporean/Asian lifestyle doesn't fit into the products they are offering...so i can say 90% will fail..</p>
              <p>i also tested their online and offline support when they are still recruiting..but it didn't meet my expectations..of a MNC level company.</p>
              <p>for your level, based on the questions you've asked to date..you still need to stick to the basic and learn the proper selling sales first..</p>
              <p>this can be learn from any mlm company..just join of one..and start learning..</p>
              <p>nobody would appreciate the 1st company they join in terms of MLM context..as they are still learning and didn't have experience in terms of doing it..so even if you join the best company that's your 1st..you also will think the other company is better..</p>
              <p>which is why you need to start anywhere first..</p>

              <p>Networking is very important. The more people you know, it's easier for you to get recommendation and help when the time comes. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> Of course you must be very good at maintaining relationship with the people. I would say people skills is very important. No matter what jobs we're holding now (e.g. me tutor), most of my jobs came from people's recommendation. I would still keep contacts and try to link up with them as and when.</p>
              <p>People skills is like how you treat other people your colleagues /work partners. Treat them well and they will return the favour. Remember their birthday, send them greeting cards etc. It'll all help to keep that contact. Treating customers/clients like your friends, it's one of the very good way to start networking. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>i do agree with this..</p>
              <p>especially as an adult..having the right contacts make a lot of difference..</p>
              <p>1 single contact can provide you with lots of good deals..while the other 1 can have lots of experience..</p>
              <p>it's all about connection and establishing the trust..you just need to be inside their radar if some good deals pops up, and they put you as their 1st point of contact to share the news with.</p>

              <p>something that I was previously guitly off too..</p>
              <p>When being cheated of their savings from MLM companies..i went from Pro-mlm to Anti-mlm, but only for 1 year + than saw the light at the end of the tunnel..</p>
              <p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
              <p>1. What goes through each and every one of your mind?</p>
              <p>2. How long did you take to walk out of the horrible, nasty experience?</p>
              <p>3. Are you still closed/neutral/open towards future network marketing opportunities?</p>
