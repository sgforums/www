            <div class='col-md body'>As a company, it has failed many parties, mainly its agents who have contributed time, money and effort to its cause, believing they have made useful contributions. How many young and impressionable agents quit their studies to do NTI full time but are now secretly regretting their decisions?

I really wonder at the quality of the instructors giving the training and who accredits the quality of the courses. A training course and certificate is useless if it does not have the proper accredition. A certificate from NTI cannot even be used outside NTI in the MLM industry. So what is the value of the training you receive there? How can a company provide such a chaotic match of products and services I cannot understand.

Before one project is complete they rush into another. Losing perspective is a dangerous way to lead a company. Failing to deliver on promises and failing to pay distributors on time is also bad. Failing to deliver products to customers on time is even worse.<br><br>How did a small company with big dreams degenerate into the cancer it is today? Is there still hope for this company?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe NTI is past that stage of suing people because they know that once they sue a forumer, all the deep pockets and strong connections the forum people have will descend on their sorry asses. Threatening action without a cause is criminal intimidation.<br><br>Anyway is it possible for you to share your full story from the time you were brought in to the time when you decided to leave, realising something was wrong with the company?<br><br>The "education" thing popped up recently as a defence against claims and charges against them that they are a pyramid scheme not selling any products. It is terribly hard to prove they are NOT selling education as they hold their talks and so on. It just that people who aren't very smart get conned thinking they will learn something from other people. Its a self-sustaining industry by itself:<br><br>Mr. X joins the course. Mr. X graduates from the course. Mr. X asks others to join the course. Mr. X gives a speech at the course. Mr. X's student's get others and so on. They give meaningless pieces of paper to people and they actually preach that people should quit their accredited degrees just to join the company for the sake of "education". Its sad that they are still allowed to spread their lies and con more people.</div>

What we r stating is all true, they cant do anything one lah! They everytime use this method to threaten those young kids.<br><br>Moreover, they have no money to do that. They already had problem with their financial maintaining the company. That JP will not sue you too, coz he already got a bad reputation in the market. As for that Jackie hoo, i think he is having big head paying his car loans, no money. And Desmond, worse, cant even clear his credit cards debts. Haiz....<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, any court case by NTI will be very bad for their publicity. If they sue anybody for calling them cheats or liars and so on, the burden of proof falls on the person they are suing to prove they are cheats and liars. Hence if you can (and most probably will) prove that they are cheats and liars, you can not only throw out the case but file a claim for legal costs and so on. Not to mention the great number of people here who are all too willing to turn the media spotlight on them, like in the NKF case.<br><br>I feel that NTI has failed because they never really wanted to become something in the first place. They have a silly "e-commerce" place that moves very little products and ridiculous costs, some "educational" system that teaches nothing, awarding silly certs, some shady products that can be purchased at a cheaper price elsewhere and a collection of dodgy people sitting in the management.<br><br>If they had been more transparent, worked out a better system of MLM and actually started doing ethical selling, they wouldn't be the target of so much ire from ex-distributors, consumers and other concerned people in the first place. You don't see people slamming the tons of other MLMs here but the fact that NTI features so strongly here must send a strong signal to those people that, hey, they are doing something that isn't right. And I believe that the people high up the food chain do know what they are doing is not right but don't share this information to those people down the line.</div>

I didn't participate but I was a "victim" some how... my neice joined them ...  I advise against it ... now my sister avoiding me ....  I hate it if I have to say, " I told you so"..</div>

As for the EPI, its the same problem. That alan mok lost a lot of money in that company. And in the end, their "LAO DA" JP didnt even help him out and just let the EPI closed down. Presently, that alan mok left JP and opened his own MLM company called PGI.<br><br>b) Presently, their strategy is to concentrate on their so-called "ENTREPRENEUR EDUCATION" to CON their ignorant youngsters.<br><br>Haiz......</div>
