              <p>You try to sell your stupid SE products there you make them LAUGH sia. All ten years or older products. What healthcare, supplements, underwear, fengshui, crystals, all that crap.</p>
              <p>Any other proper company also have products TEN TIMES better than what SE is trying to sell there. soooo bloody stupid.</p>
              <p>Hong Kongers all well heeled, well dressed, opinionated people, like the paris of Asia you know. You think they will be attracted by SE's fly-invested old crap, even with a 'new' packaging?</p>
              <p>You try to sell them points? by now all rolling on the floor ROFLMAO liao. Give cash, all wants products and services upfront. WHO THE HELL WANTS worthless points? SE selling point is total bullshit la. EM-MAX selling point is total bullshit also. It's like a TIMESHARE company like that.</p>
              <p>Jetstar promo I can fly to Hong Kong for less than $50 excluding tax. so why the hell would I pay 6600 USD to exchange for stupid points to exchange with some stupid travel agency for some overpriced packages or a overpriced ticket?</p>

              <p>Ok, now I officially launch Redstone Points. Put $100 with me, get 100 RedPt. Use it to buy stuff from my online shop. Then I'll give u $3 a month for 4 years. But 2 years later I say ppl are saying bad things about my company, no business, close down. I run away say Africa got huge biz potential. Then took all the money and ran away. You had accumulated 500 Redstone Points. What can you do with them?</p>
