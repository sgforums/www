            <div class='col-md body'>Google Versus Kanosis.<br>The Race For The Next Phase Of The Internet.<br><br>Author: John Douramacos<br><br>What is the greatest need for todayÂ’s internet web surfer? Security!<br>This is the area of internet services that is most likely to produce the<br>next super giant of the internet world.<br><br>According to the SAN FRANCISCO March 8, 2006 AP story By MICHAEL<br>LIEDTKE AP Business Writer. Google was quick to try to cover up an<br>inadvertent leak about a project that it is working on called Gdrive. In<br>this leaked internal memo, you can hear the echoes of the competition<br>to the Â“CoilÂ” by Kanosis, which is scheduled for a full launch on May 1,<br>of this year.<br><br>The service that will be provided by the Â“CoilÂ” of Kanosis and Â“most likelyÂ”<br>by the Gdrive of Google will make it possible for the subscriber to keep all<br>of his or her data at a Â“virtual lock boxÂ” so that they can be access from<br>any internet connection by the user. It does not take a lot of imagination<br>to figure out why Google and possibly other internet giants would want to<br>be secretive about their work on developing such a service. They appear<br>to have been caught with Â“their pants downÂ” by a total newcomer on the<br>internet scene. To admit that they are working on a project for such a new<br>service would be equal to lending enormous credibility to the notion that<br>such a service is worth being explored by the internet user. Unfortunately<br>for them they are the latecomers to this party. Kanosis officials claim that<br>their nearest competitor is two years from completing a viable software<br>platform to compete with their Â“CoilÂ”.<br><br>The question that one should now be asking is this. How can a Google or<br>any other present giant of the internet fall so far behind to a total<br>newcomer? And this in a marketing niche that should have been so<br>obvious to everybody, especially those who are in control of most of the<br>activities of the internet? The answer is simple and is as old as man doing<br>business. Somebody has a brilliant idea. He sees some obvious need and<br>he moves to develop the product that will fill it. Soon he dominates the<br>marketplace and grows to a huge operation. Big success always contains<br>within itself the seed of becoming outdated. The big corporation has too<br>many bosses, it becomes inflexible and unresponsive to the needs of its<br>own customers. The new kid on the block sees the same needs but being<br>small and agile he can move in new and innovative ways. He now becomes<br>the giant as his products fill the new need, only to repeat the same process<br>all over again. It is up to us as perceptive individuals to discern these<br>cycles of corporate development and hopefully profit from them by<br>positioning ourselves on the side of a winner. Is Kanosis a winner? My bet<br>would be yes. Even though they are still at pre launch and subscription is<br>available by private invitation only, their Alexa rating is already in the<br>20,000 range. This leak by google only serves to strengthen my<br>impression that the smart money is on Kanosis.<br><br>This article is free for republishing<br><br>Article Source: http://www.articlealley.com<br></div>

COIL Internet Operating System Developments<br><br>Coil Internet Operating System, integrates in one application all the Â‘must haveÂ’ functions of the most popular desktop software. The currently available version of Coil provides an application where you can plan, organise, prioritize, communicate and share information within the Kanosis community in a secure environment.<br><br>Since the start of the pre-registration phase Kanosis has been working on both technical and functional upgrades to Coil.<br><br>The Kanosis development and technical departments have been working together to improve the systemÂ’s architecture. Users will notice a significant improvement in performance in the newly released version of Coil. We are now also able to confirm that included with each Kanosis Coil membership is 2 GB of storage space of that you can use for securing your important personal files.<br><br>In addition to many Â‘behind the scenesÂ’ improvements, there has also been an extensive revamp of the user interface. Our aim was to further simplify the Coil workflow by ensuring the most efficient use of screen space and to add in more functions without creating a busy, cluttered feel. To do this we have integrated the message center, simplified the Desktops, To Do List and Calendar and made better use of the panels for previewing and working. The final result is a fully integrated workspace with more functions, available in a user interface that looks much cleaner and a lot more sleek.<br><br>Though a lot of improvements have been made, two key functions will be of particular interest to people developing their network of contacts within the community.<br><br>The first is the Message Center, which as mentioned previously, has been fully integrated into the core Coil functions. Now you can switch between the planning and organizational tools and the Message Center in just one mouse click. The Message Center provides access to all your messages including emails, multimedia, instant messaging (IM), and mapped external accounts in an expandable tree. You can scroll through lists of messages automatically sorted by type, project or contact.<br><br>The second is Coil Sparc our instant messaging software that you can use to chat with other Kanosians. Coil Sparc provides all the standard chat and chat room functions as well as Soundboards.<br><br>Other functions that are currently in development include Coil for Businesses and Coil Meetings, as well as VOIP and the ability to chat through your very own avatar.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Umberto</div>
