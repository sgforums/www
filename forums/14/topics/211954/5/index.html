            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly this whole episode regarding NTI's foray into the wireless technology needs to be framed into perspective. Some potential questions/problems needs to be addressed before any logical/sane person decides to invest on the premise that this project is viable / sustainable / real.<br><br>1) Has any studies been done and any preliminary market survey been done to ascertain to a acceptable level that the project would be profitable? Are there prior models for such a project and what are the potential risks given taiwan's political climate?<br><br>2) How much money needs to be raised for the project? Is there a cap on the amount the company intends to raise? How will this money raised be used to fun the project? What is the breakdown of the costs of funding?<br><br>3) How will the profits/losses be shared amongst the investors? Is there a cap to the number of investors? Will more investors dilute the share of potential profits? How are these profits accounted and what percentage is taxable and how will the money derived be accredited to the investor? How will the money earned be taxable for the individual investor? Is there any conflict of interest for the company?<br><br>Thus far we have been trying to confirm the legitimacy of the project. However even if it was real, the questions I have just raised has not been answered or answered satisfactorily. In short, unless they are able to answer these questions and provide documentation to prove their answers, I'd advise people to STEER CLEAR of NTI.<br><br>Remember, know your rights, ask the correct questions and do proper research yourself.

There is no useful information there at all, merely a bunch of self congratulatory nonsense. Its just like telling the whole world how great, how powerful you are, but other than that its all an empty shell. There's nothing of any value there or anything quantifiable.
