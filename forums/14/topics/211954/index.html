            <div class='col-md body'>Lots of bullshit going around everywhere these days. U r right to be cautious and I tink that's very prudent of you. Particularly, don't let their success stories fool you. This is a pretty powerful tool to pull wool over your eyes. Sure, there are pple who become very successful but for every one of those success stories, they won't tell you the great number of pple who have fallen. Mebbe out of 10 million failures, there is one success story. They'll focus and glorify on just that 1 and not tell you about the 99,999,999 failures, some of whom might have even gone bankrupt and driven to suicide, blah, blah and more blah..........<br><br>It's okay to just listen but if they ask you to pay more than $50 or to commit to something, your alarm bells must be sounding..... If they keep pestering you, just warm them that you can always call the police as this can be tantamount to harrassment..........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Sorry, but i am not interested in this. I have just found a job/ studying for my exams/ etc.....and would Not have time for this, find someone else instead.<br><br>2). Sorry, but i am not interested in this way of earning money as its Not my personality to .....(e.g. socialise with people, etc) and i prefer a more conventional way of living and work.

            <div class='col-md body'>To answer ur question, NTI-paris is indeed the former name of niutrend international. It is the same company as the management is still intact. Their international president is Mr. James Phang. Hence, feel free to draw info on the company from the forum.<br>I was in the same situation one month ago. My advice to you is to be firm in your stand. Do not join the company merely to help your friend pass his course. It is not just a matter of money but also personal committment, lifestyle adjustment and undertaking additonal responsibilities and expectations.<br>If you are unprepared to make such sacrifices or your time schedule/future plan does not allow it, then seek your friend understanding and reject them, saying you appreciate their intentions.just give it thorough consideration.<br>As for trying to change your friend opinion, i would say the best is to leave them along for now. NTI is apparently under restructuring and is coming up with some wireless project. Give NTI till the end of october and we should have official info from IDA who is the bid winner.Time will yell whether NTI is credible or not.<br></div>
