            <div class='col-md body'>oh btw, here are some questions that people shuld ask themselves and to think about before joining a MLM company:<br><br>For Students:<br><strong>Q:do you think you have a lot of time and is it worth it to sarcrifice your comfort zone (consisting of your outings with friends, relatives, personal time, enjoyment, resting, maybe even CCAs or some other commitments you may have)? </strong><br><br>Ans:from your point of view, maybe, but once you join, you will find that there are certain things that were not told to you at all. there are going to be quite a lot of meetings (depending on which group you join, as each group have their own way of doing things) and not forgetting the pressure you are getting from your uplines who keep pushing you to make phone calls and other things. hence, i presume (from personal experience = facts) that about nearly 50% of your time is taken up. if you wish to stay clear from them and dont wish to go to the company every day, disobeying their orders to come down for meetings, maybe about 5-10% of your time.<br><br>if you are smart enough, you can just join now and wait till your studies are over, come back and see how things are doing. just dont create a bad name for yourself like scolding ppl for lying to you. best to do some research on the company. its the best medicine to helping you solve your doubts and queries. and if they talk to you about not going or reading the Sgforums, which is here obviously, ask yourself, forum contain facts, truths, lies, assumptions, good and bad comments, etc. so, GO READ AND MAKE SENSE by yourself. if you ask them, they are obviously on the company's side. go ask your friends, family, teachers, etc. MLM is a very COMMON word. so you shouldnt have a problem finding somebody who knows a thing or 2 about it.<br><strong><br>Q:do you think its safe to join?</strong><br><br>Ans:well, its a private limited company and anyone even a child, as long as he/she has evidence against the company, can sue against the company. you may want to double check with Commercial Affairs Department..CAD. its just one of the safety precautions to ensure your safety of joining a company. but even if the company go busted, the members arent affected....thats what i heard. if you want to be HIGHLY SAFE, go study the Business Law. thats the only way. but if you successfully study the whole dman THICK BOOK, you can already become a Lawyer.<br><br><strong>Q:is the money worth investing?</strong><br><br>Ans<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">nce you give them your money, you will MOST LIKELY (99%) wont be getting back your cash. next consider how easy to get back your money...by earning? its not like a bank where you invest and you receive interest. i heard from one of my colleagues from NTI, he bought a Gold account, about 2 years ago, which will give him some % of the company's money to him every 3 months. HIAZZZZZZ....well, no more such thing. unless the president wants to start that kind of Plan again. but if it is, do your calculations first. when money is concern, calculations is a MUST!!!<br><br><strong>Q:how is the company making money?</strong><br><br>Ans: go find out more, you will understand better. its not so simple to elaborate or summarise it into words. in all business, be it mama shop or those at orchard road, business always earn money from people. some dont even have products but offer services like cleaning cars ( that isnt a product) at petrol kiosk. think about it, Business is really Business and NTI is just doing some forms of it. think back to ancient times like how people start to do Trading. then comes the revolution of Money. money is basically being traded for services and products. its just another "product" being traded off. its hard to explain, but if you get what i mean, then you know what i am trying to say. money comes in as because, maybe some ppl feel that there should be a way to calculate how valuable is that something. otherwise, in the Past, you can just make up stories and really promote your stuff ( even pens) to be price at $1000++ instead of just $1. but thats like how many years ago, more than 2000 years ago.<br><strong><br>Q: during school days, do you REALLY have time? what about the workload and burden you are caring before. is it heavier now and you are unable to cope with it?</strong><br><br>Ans: think about it. you are going to sarcrifice A LOT OF THINGS as its like starting a real business. your business is your responsibility. how well your business do depends on your efforts and time spent on it. quick results happens to people who knows how to get it, but most of the time its because they are smart or lucky, not because they spend TONS OF TIME, otherwise, it wont be a quick result. although when you go there to listen to them talk, you may feel like it isnt a serious business and its just really a simple one and you can back out anytime you want. WRONG!!! the reason why you feel this way is because of the environment they have created in you. im not referring to physical environment. im talking more about the feeling they create in you , to feel that its fun, its easy, its stress-free, own-time own target. but seriously, think about how Business works. its all in your mind. dont let people do the thinking for you. you are the one who makes the last decision, no matter what.<br><br><strong>Q: is it easy to get people to join?</strong><br><br>Ans: some say yes, some say no. that's just luck. but most importantly, on skills. its not easy, im serious. your network(the people you are going to bring in, including friends) determines the difficulty of your Business. because the main focus is on them. next is all up to you, how skillful or powerful are you to tackle them? do you have what it takes? you can try, but im warning you, if you wish to try...DONT START AN ACCOUNT YET. i know some of those idiotic interviewers will DO THEIR BEST to influence you to start an account. then all their bullshitting crap like " opportunity now/here (they cut the word "nowhere" into 2 words" now here") "  and say some stuff like " once you go home, no more liao and i will give this opportunity to somebody else and you wont get it".<br><br>***CLEARING THROAT....ERM...IN ACTUAL FACT, you can join anytime you want and it will still make them ....VERY HAPPY. to them, it doesnt make a difference of when you join. its just whether you join or dont join.before i start explaining, you have to understand their business structure and how it works. i know now thay have a lot of Plans, bonus and this and that. to put it simply, if you join now, you just get more returns(money or rewards) than having to join later...BUT, that depends on your efforts on making your own business (account) to have more downlines ( more ppl join you, under your name).  so, whether you join now or later, the results are still dependent on your EFFORTS and TIME.<br><br><strong>Q: conflicts, problems,etc???</strong><br><br>Ans: bound to have. politics is basically conflicts of 2 or more people with different opinions and they both think they are in the right and the other side is wrong. so they start to make trouble for one another, get ppl involve to support their view, etc ,etc ,etc. so, if you wish to avoid them, DO AVOID THEM. at least, you are making your stay there more worthwhile. otherwise your money spent is basically to attend to people's problems. well, i understand some of you just want to help, because you have already treated them as your friends, so you feel that you should help them. WRONG!!!. im not trying to discourage you that you shouldnt help them. BUT, in the Working world, that is how things are done. just do your stuff and focus on nothing else but yourself. dont forget, NTI takes in ANYONE as long as the person is 18 years old.  gangsters, bad attitudes assholes, backstabbers, bullshitting cocks, all also accept as long as they join and they keep on wearing their bloody fake happy masks to hide/cover their true intentions. so, you wont be expecting a lot of good souls in there. and not all of them all mature. so you can expect to face all kinds of s.h.i.t.<br><br>Q: your dreams, interests, will it be affected?<br><br>ans: well, it happens to some people, as they are being over-influenced until their beliefs and interests and dreams are destroyed. depends on your integrity and how strong you are about yourself. normally i would say, no, it doesnt or shouldnt affect. because you can choose to do this business or take it seriously. you can even heck care although you may have just started an account, but that will be a lost and hence, that becomes a pressure and an extra workload for you, as you dont like to feel you have make a lose.<br><br>Advice to students:<br><br>DONT START AN ACCOUNT YET. always do your homework and research. know more. if you WISH to start an account, never start big. i know some bloody smart asre there will say" START BIG TO MAKE BIG MONEY!!" go to hell!!! ask yourself, has there been any company in this world that straight away start an outlet in every country , which consist of more than 100 countries? HELL NO. nobody would ever dare dream of doing that.....EVER!!! business always start small and if the owner thinks that this kind of busines he/she is doing can be very successful, they start to expand slowly, taking a step at a time, keeping track of their results and performance, and hence, with that results, they conclude whether they should continue to expand or stop at where they are. so, accoding to NTI, the smallest and cheapest account is the Bronze Account. cost about around $500.<br><br>so once you have that account, stick with it for about 6 months. ONLY BY THEN, you will truly understand the true nature of this business. but of course, it depends on how willing you are to go and research and ask people and gather more information. if you just start an account , and dont even do nothing about it and heck care the company for 6 months, you will learn nothing. its a Learning Journey and once again, you need Effort and Time. but its worth it. TRUST ME. because, once you understand the true nature of how everything works, you will either BACK OUT or continue doing with more accounts. imagine starting BIG like investing $7k,<br><br>(NO KIDDING, ITS A LOT OF MONEY TO A STUDENT, but they keep saying it isnt a big figure in terms of business, like ...The....i dont know??? a project from some corporate company can sum up to how many billions. and having to lose a million is peanuts to them. but seriously speaking. try looking from a different point of view. you have been saving it for how long? with that amount of money, $7k can easily buy all your small desires, even PS3. so just THINK.)<br><br>and in the end, after a few months or a period of time, you understand the nature of this business and you want to back out. when you came for the interview or along the way as time passed by, you heard some friends saying you can back out. when you approach your leader, he will tell this and that and you ...CANT have your money back. company eat liao. so always start small. its a gamble or risk to take to start big without knowing exactly what you are doing. its like, i start a simple shop that sells fruits, computer stuff and jewellary, all in one simple small shop. but ask yourself, what exactly are you doing? so, hence, always best to play SAFE.  START SMALL!!!<br><br>if you can try to fight your way through with a deposit, go ahead. make up stories and bluff your way through like you have tons of financial issues and cant afford to start an account. so you pay a small deposit each time. like $50 every 2 weeks? thats like granting you a grace period 4 months to at least know how things are done in the business. so ..........BE SMART. you are doing things for the sake of yourself and........... the company....is for the company.<br><br>Your Life is in your own hands. you decide, you choose. the 1st thoughts arent always right. reflect and think again and again, as many times as you like. there was once i watch Samurai X like 7 times, i learnt different things each time. because, i look out for different things each time i watch and hence, i learn. why should i bother looking at the same thing over and over? unless i really like it, i dont mind.<br><br>in the company, they like to say things like " gurantee plus chop!"....when they say "chop", got 2 meanings:<br><br>1) you DIE because they CHOP your head<br>2) a circle with the word "gurantee".<br><br>i dont have much advise for adults. because, i myself, i am a student.<br><br>If you wish to add on, i will greatly appreaciate it for the help of those who arent hunted down yet.</div>

She ask me to go down and listen to her 'advisor' which will tell me about NTI and so on.<br><br>That day when I sat down and listen to her 'advisor', something tell me that this is this not a very good idea. They talk about emcom, sushine empire, e-banking, earn points to go for talks for free, and etc.<br><br>When Im asking question like, 'Prove to me that this is not another MLM scam.' my friend or her 'advisor' will reply things like, 'do you think we will rent a place this big and have so many people here just to cheat you $300-$800?'<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>for the 2hours listening, the more they say the more I doubt about this. but in the end, because of my friend, i sign and pay $20 because I say I didnt have enough money to pay the full amount. [And I didnt plan to pay the full amount anyway..I just treat that the $20 was for movie]<br><br>anyway, my friends started to call me to go to NTI and ask me to bring friends down too. But I told her that I cant call my friends down to something that I didnt trust at all. She also ask me to bring my parents down so that when they agree me to this NTI project they will pay full amount, so that she can pass her entrepreneur course.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>I started to feel afraid for her, and tell her to give me the website of <a href="http://www.niutrendinternational.com" rel="nofollow">NTI</a> and their <a href="http://www.emcom.net.tw" rel="nofollow">emcom</a> project and the ally for NTI, <a href="http://www.sunshineempire.biz" rel="nofollow">sushine empire</a>.<br><br>Now my friends are tell me to join NTI fully if not I will regret it, and they say they dont want to become rich in the future and only me are far from being rich. I tell them that I will think about it carefully, and I have already make up my mind about not trusting this.<br><br>But I wanted to make sure that all this NTI that was talk about here and the NTI that their in so that I can show they some prove.

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno about what all of you think. But I dun see the reasons to why it's not workable (technology wise) if one is paying USD 20(i.e. about S$35++) for your monthly phone and internet billing. But considering the fact the this technology is truely wireless (meaning no underground cables needs to be laid.)  and the fact that singapore telecommunication companies are still relying on cables, No wonder the IDA shortlisted bluengine. Coz imagine the amount of unemployments if this technology were to come into s'pore.</div>
