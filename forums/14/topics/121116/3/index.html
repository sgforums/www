An MLM company that seek continual sales through expanding customers base, not just distributors network. Your statement is quite flawed, and I am sure its just your own personal feelings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Another very important difference is that in the traditional business, it stands and speaks for you, gives you all sorts of benefits and welfare, employs top lawyers and protects you when anything goes wrong, in MLM, you sign the form before you join the company where you clear the MLM company of all charges and release it of all responsibilities should anything go wrong...make you "independent".<br><br>You want the MLM company to get a lawyer to protect you? Wait long long...</blockquote>Wrong again. Customers sue the company and manufacturer if there are products problem, So far, has any agent in SIngapore been sued for selling faulty products? In cases of misrepresentation, any non MLM company would protect their employees? Think again. While the laws of agencies protect any contract in case of misrepresentation, the next minute you would find the employee will be booted out of the company for poor performance.

            <div class='col-md body'>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Quote:<br><br>Non MLM company that dont seek growth and expansion? An MLM company that seek continual sales through expanding customers base, not just distributors network. Your statement is quite flawed, and I am sure its just your own personal feelings.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In non MLM, the phases of running a business can be different, some need to sell off part of their business to scale down, some need to hold off expansion, some need to await restructuring, etc. In MLM, the key direction is almost always expanding all the time. It is not just personal feelings it is just simple real business strategies.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Quote:<br>Wrong again. Customers sue the company and manufacturer if there are products problem, So far, has any agent in SIngapore been sued for selling faulty products? In cases of misrepresentation, any non MLM company would protect their employees? Think again. While the laws of agencies protect any contract in case of misrepresentation, the next minute you would find the employee will be booted out of the company for poor performance. Sad, but true.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Correct, get booted out is another thing. That is due to poor performance and other incompetencies. But since you work for the company, the company is legally obliged to protect you and give you various benefits. Whether it happens in real life or not is not the purpose of the discussion here. But you tend to find that companies that care for the employees and salespersons, tend to have more loyalty from the people.<br><br>In MLM, when customers sue the MLM company. The MLM pushes the responsibility away to the distributer because it is independent and all those clauses. For example, in the urgency to get a sale, the MLMer tells a customer that a facial product will remove all pimples on all skin types within 3 days, and yet after one week the pimple increases. The MLM company will say they don't know what the MLMer says to the customer, and washes its hands. Guess who the customer has to look for?<br><br>This is the same as some MLMer who promises new recruits that they will be millionaires in a short time, maybe 3 years or less. By then, if you don't get it, if you sue, you think the MLM company will help that MLMer? Other issues can be wrongful claims, use of lawyers letter to show that they are legitimate, etc, etc...<br><br>The key point is, as an MLMer, if you are sued, will the MLM company protect you?<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>My quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>In traditional business, the management and direct supervisors can limit and control what the sales people do and say, the internal business results is mostly stable and controlable, problems can be managed, sales results can be tested and forcast, etc... a steady brand and quality is slowly built over the years.<br><br>In MLM structure, the MLM company has got no say over what the distributors or salespeople do in reality.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Your Quote:<br><br>Its obvious from this point you have never attend any training or hardly observe and match training and sales presentation.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>How many of these trainings have you attended yourself?<br><br>You might want to read the last sentence of mine again before you assume too much. In reality, in reality do every MLMer behave the same way? The companies can try to make people behave like robots but it is different when it comes to practice.<br><br>The MLM company might motivate you and "brainwash" you into full control, then until someone wakes up and realise it is a lot of manipulation. So in reality, which is scarier, to be brainwashed into following exactly what they want you to do or to wake up and realise you have been manipulated?<br><br>You have that choice.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Quote:<br>So far, big companies like Amway and Nuskin have not shown this problems.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Really? So they are fully controllable? No dropouts to replace? In this case, since both are MLM companies, both this companies should by now be the largest companies in the world and the whole world would have signed up with them by now.<br><br>It is also quite rare to be able to do MLM well. Both might be the exception than the norm. For every one MLM company that works, there are thousands that does not survive and goes out of business.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>My quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Thats why you keep hearing of MLM companies opening and closing now and then, opening up branches then closing down the old ones, move from places to places, gets suddenly popular now in this month and then in next month gets cursed like nothing by the public and ex-distributors. This is a truth for an MLM company. (Check out this whole MLM forum for example...)<br><br>The longer the MLM company has been around, the more the complains and mistrust of the people. When the name is new, people don't trust it well. When the MLM is an old one, people will have somehow heard of increasing disatisfactions and complains with that MLM company.

We can also say that trafficking drugs is illegal and has death penalty, then why are there still others who keep doing it?<br><br>The point is that no matter what anyone says, MLM type of making money is here to stay, one MLM will die, then someone will start another new one. (sounds familiar?)<br><br>For F and B or kopitiam business, the problems they face are different because of the differences in the business models they chose. For example, Food Junction, Kopitam, theirs is slowly build through consolidating the food stalls and marketing over the long number of years, building prominence in the customers' eyes.<br><br>However in MLM companies, the set of problems are different.
