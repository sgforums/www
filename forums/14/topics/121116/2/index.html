            <div class='col-md body'>I have to disagree.<br><br>The insurance has the same beginnings as MLM 20 years ago, where everyone has the same biasness towards insurance as they are towards MLM today.<br><br>There were many insurance scams, and the industry wasnt well regulated then.<br><br>The insurance of today owes its reputation to its 20 years of development in the regulations towards insurance products only.<br><br>However, these does not cover the present system of cold callings, recruiting, commission structure, large number of young inexperienced agents, fundamentals of weak securities or other financial products sold.<br><br>Neither have they cover the responsibility of agents, just as color ghost has admitted, the onus was pushed towards fund managers or customers. The insurance companies have interest in selling these financial products based on the reason that they earned from it, rather than an unbiased assessment of these stocks and funds, compared to neutral financial consultants out there in the market.<br><br>I just happened to attend one seminar lately in my school, where we were advised to look at insurance products cum financial products sold by insurance companies and other agents carefully.<br><br>Recent financial products pushings that failed, include companies like AIG and DBS. You can continue to invest, but its at your own risks.<br><br>My advice is, dont stop and generalise any ideas abt MLM or insurance. Be very objective and assess carefully any MLM or insurance company you join. And this being a public forum, please dont make people laugh at your own biasness or perception towards any business idea.<br><br>End.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Financial products are useful as long as they dont collapse. MLM products are useful as long as people dont find out that they are dud. MLM products are supposedly more expensive because people think that MLM bosses want to rip off people. Then insurance boss dont want to earn profit as well? Thats explain the recent trend to copy MLM by having more levels of commission structures, hence the multi level that exist in current insurance companies, where insurance sellers progress from single direct seller to having include the structure of team and managers earning from his team members. You have not count hidden costs in buying financial products, such as interests, fees to companies, commission due to teams managers and sellers, and other fine prints.<br><br><blockquote><br>u also look at insurance about investments aspect onli.  and agents are people who sell u a service (of financial planning) NOT da managing of funds.  there is no training in that for agents and if any agent can guarantee u any performance u shouldnt even be talking to him.</blockquote>Just flip through any basic investing books, no need any advanced university professor's written book, and it will tell you to steer clear of financial planners and advisors who have interest in the securities they are offerring. They earn from it, so why the hell shouldnt they be recommending it. The main points are that we are not just looking soley at the performance of any financial advisors, but whether he has an interest in the product he sells. At the end of the day, the financial planner get a nice fat cheque at the end of the month, while the customer may live in fear of capital losses the moment his securities mature.<br><br>and as for any stuff u mentioned...(theres almost black sheep in any field) but u single that out as a trend for insurance.  also bias wat.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> [/b][/quote]<br><br>That is the crux of the matter, every company practise it, a few has shown to collapse, and we have no idea whether there will be the domino effect.

I dont aim people. Others who have been here with me for one year knows I randomly pick a topic and comment, apart from the nti topic. If you wish to say I am generalising the insurance industry, fine by me, coz i only repeat stuff I gathered from people in the industry, the finance people, as well as books.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I dont insist you leave the insurance industry right away, however, i only cautioned to everyone reading this topic to be careful in assessing any products they are buying. Financial products are hell lot more complex in workings than any products sold in retail stores or direct selling companies.<br><br>You lucky you have got only me. You have not met the people I met, who work in finance industry for decades and know exactly whats going on. To make things simpler, if I want to know the fundamental flaws in your financial products, I can just hop to the next company or bank and inquire about it. Competition makes everyone gathers intelligence on his next rival.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

C'mmon you don understand, don act as if u r an expert here. Have you work more than 7 years? Have you have your own business before? Have you done sales and marketing? How much do you understand MLM?<br><br></div>
