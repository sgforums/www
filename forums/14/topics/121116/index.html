(i sincerely believe in insurance btw...and although i dont go change ppl mind but u can ask me again i still tell u da same.. i belive in insuranc e and i believe everyone needs it. how much and where they obtain is their responsibility, not mind.  i'm only offering them a service.)<br><br>vii) dun get me wrong...i think mlm can earn big money too...but it goes against my principals, so i wun do it.<br><br>viii) weak funds or strong funds is not da agents' duty...go screw da fund managers ok?  they pick wrong stock and fund not growing not agent fault.  not all funds are crap..some are good too... by right da agent should be able to advice u on it...but if they cant then they might not be up to ur expectation lor.... ur da consumer..u can choose who to buy from right?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>ix)also, to me insurance agent is not about pushing u funds.  human greed in da first place to only look at "money growing schemes"....if ppl wanna overlook about getting INSURED...life insurance/medical insurance etc....then wat leh?  they didnt change selling insurance product to financial product...they are allow to sell funds to complete da package as a financial advisor...u dun think its toopid they say they financial advisors but all they can offer u is insurance plans meh?  if they talk about protecting ur asset they jolly well must know how to grow ur asset.<br><br>day in day out i still sell normal insurance product...dat u seemed to scorned.  i also buy for myself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i) theres no multilevel....thers only at most da director, da manger and da agent..capping at three layers..and da director's commission does not equate the agent...so it wont have dis very ridiculous LONG CHAIN down da road like MLM.  and mlm is anywan who can pay a membership is eligible to join.  u dun need to come up a single cent to join insurance..(da difference is..if u cant sell then u better leave.)</blockquote>I am afraid there is a mistake here. MLMs, as opposed to pyramids do not have limitless or even long chain of commission structure. Any such structure would identify the company as a pyramid. Even then, any company, regardless of products they are selling, that has more than one level of commission structure, will have the same problem - aggressive recruitment and pushing of products. Besides, an MLM member who paid a single lump sum of membership fees, do not lose more than any customers paying, in long term for financial products continually collects premium.<br><br><blockquote>ii) agents who cannot perform will be pushed to leave.  unlike mlm...u pay membership fee who will ask u to go?  that will encourage many many people floating around giving them money.  see da flawed logic?  agents who cant sell (thank you veri much hor...) they just hire new agents to replace that spot.  it is overcrowding with insurance agents lately...becos too many young ppl (same idealism as mlm are joining...some cannot talk also inside..hehehe) are crowding the market...but half of them cannot last 3 months. :p mlm is different..u pay money liao wun u try ur best leh?  and finally...agents may get fringe benefits for introducing new agents to da company...but they dun actually take commission for it...that makes primary level agent less aggressive to recruit ppl...they just want u to buy their insurance products.</blockquote>Two things here. By applying your logic to this 'membership fees', it is also not feasible to pay for financial products that are fundamentally weak. Money will be poured into securities that are not performing. Another thing is that this very point of yours actually will hurt the insurance industry. By highlighting this high rate of staff turnover, you potentially deter prospective agents from joining. Another worrying sign is that staff turnover is a cost to companies. How will people allow companies to handle their funds, if they could not manage this cost of turnover. Not wanting to go deeper into this point, staff turnover is a problem for both industries, where people leave due to poor performance or low motivation. Again, a black mark on public image.<br><br><blockquote>iv)product pushers or not...that is just a style of working.  u got come across some restaurant...da staff stand outside ask u try their new dish?  dats aggressive selling too wat?  product pushing? sure...how about those free sampling later talk until u paiseh must buy a packet becos u makan da free sampling?  product pushing als owat?  why insurance agent cannot product push?  if da consumer dun like he dun have to buy...but if da consumer kena push..he buy.  its da consumers responsibility for buying wat.</blockquote>Again, this point strengthen my views just now. Its like saying, its allright to push poor performing products, but the onus is on the customers to judge for themselves the right products to buy? How will the companies ever gain the trust of the public if it cannot project business ethnics and shows it have ethical business practices? Again, this sounds like some shady MLM companies practices as well.<br><br><blockquote>v) agents do go thru rigorous financial planning training..and sit thru hell lots of exams..and year in year out still sitting for exams to stay qualified BUT whether they are giving quality advice or product pushing depends on individual.  its da consumer to judge whether they wan some product pusher to sell them or some professional financial planner to sell them.  some ppl are product pusher...some ppl do quality business...just like any other field wat.  u simply say insurance = push ppl things nobody wan?</blockquote>I am afraid so. While its true that financial planners stil need to perform even after rigorous training, again, why lower oneself by saying other companies do it, so we must do it? Another point for people to leverage on, to attack the ethics of the insurance industry.<br><br><blockquote>vi) da reason why i dun believe in mlm is da commission structure is worrying...there is no stop to da never ending down chain..and dat da core of selling mlm business is not da product but selling recruitment.  which is not my opinion of being ETHICAL.  (i sincerely believe in insurance btw...and although i dont go change ppl mind but u can ask me again i still tell u da same.. i belive in insuranc e and i believe everyone needs it. how much and where they obtain is their responsibility, not mind.  i'm only offering them a service.)<br>vii) dun get me wrong...i think mlm can earn big money too...but it goes against my principals, so i wun do it.  </blockquote>Well i just said MLM isnt a pyramid, but then, MLM centres on recruitment then product selling? I am afraid this is not true. Any company, that allows for recruitment and team or network based earnings concurently, pave the way for the company agents to centre on recruitment as well, regardless of the type of companies. Thats why with the recent changes to insurance companies system, we see more aggressive recruitment by agents, especially Prudential.<br><br><blockquote>viii) weak funds or strong funds is not da agents' duty...go screw da fund managers ok?  they pick wrong stock and fund not growing not agent fault.  not all funds are crap..some are good too... by right da agent should be able to advice u on it...but if they cant then they might not be up to ur expectation lor.... ur da consumer..u can choose who to buy from right?</blockquote>Goodness, this point totally strengthen my views that financial advisors seriosuly do not know what the heck they are selling. Hence the label financial products sellers. First step is that companies management choose whose funds they want to earn commissions from selling. Then the agents are instructed to sell it. Do you see my flow of reasoning? The motivation for pushing the product is now clearly for the commissions, regardless of the financial fundamentals, and the onus now is pushed to customers and fund managers.<br><br>No offence, color ghost, but your post actually shows that there is no difference between selling MLM or financial products. To make it worse, your post also show as if agents arent ethical or responsible for their advices.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>MLMs, as opposed to pyramids do not have limitless or even long chain of commission structure.</blockquote>thanks for clearing dis up.  i based it on one company that have several hierachies and after they collect enuf recruits they get promoted.  really who buys the products?  its promoting based on how many recruitment no?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><blockquote>Besides, an MLM member who paid a single lump sum of membership fees, do not lose more than any customers paying, in long term for financial products continually collects premium. </blockquote>that, my friend, is an equally flawed logic no?  ur judging on the basis that financial products is a lost of money....but get back to the point...when you pick up a plan..what is hte bloody purpose?  i have studied as objectively as i can with financial products..be it endowment or some form of participating polciies.. at one point im argueing about the entire silliness until i realised one thing....you dont lose money, because u essentially paid for what it is that ur paying for.  the product can only be bad if its unsuitable to your financial needs.<br><blockquote>Two things here.

Its like saying, its allright to push poor performing products, but the onus is on the customers to judge for themselves the right products to buy?</blockquote>im saying the act of product pushing as a style... i did not asy they are pushing crap into your face...if the consumer takes crap he has to bear that kind of responsiblity.  serious.  its not ethical on the advisors part...but what can i say?  the fact is..that happens.  im not painting a fairytale anyway.  it is the truth.  there will be people doing it...but there are plenty that does a good job too.  and product pushing, i must highlight..is not a special skill of insurance agent.  any industry will have this way of dealing with business.  so why bother highlighting the penalty on just us?<br><blockquote>I am afraid so.

(im sure many will still buy them)<br><blockquote>Goodness, this point totally strengthen my views that financial advisors seriosuly do not know what the heck they are selling. Hence the label financial products sellers.</blockquote>like i say again... we dont pick da stocks.  we cannot control the performance...and in any case..PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO PROMISE OF PERFORMANCE IN THE FUTURE...it may do well before so the agent recommends but apparently it iddnt do well in future...then it becomes agent fault?  u cant blame him...NOBODY CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE ...or the oopposite....it may not do well now but it may do well in future.... we are selling a service...that is to uncover ur financial needs, and what u need to buy...to solve or at least reduce ur financial concerns.....products to me are just a secondary thing to manage ur financial portfolio.  what we are selling are all good and nice..but if an agent who failed to become ethical simply sell you what that can get him the most commission...that is his misconduct..and the cliehnt's personal judgemetn.  (and it happens too...) on the other hand...we can still earn a handsome fee doing the right way.<br><blockquote>Do you see my flow of reasoning?
