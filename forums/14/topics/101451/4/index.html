That doenst mean healthwise cant use it. anyway i do agree with you that the good products shouldnt be dealing with branson. Cos i also have my own opinion of him too. To know more about this product before you really comment, i think it is more fair to find out more about the product. I know alot about asahi and also japan life and many other MLM companies selling magnetic mattress...even NOP which i believe you have heard of it too. i read a lot about magnetic mattress too. cos i am that sort before i do anything i will find out a lot of information before i use it. In fact, i walk one BIG round of all network marketing companies already till today.<br><br>no matter what u said, the truth is the mattress did do my family and myself good. so i don care about what branson is doing, i only know the product is good.<br><br>it will  be a pity if the product does help other but cos of branson in term of personal disappointment or point of view and stop people from benefit from it.<br><br>BE MATURE please.<br><br>i don know how long you are in the market, but i am not as FRESH or BLUR as you think too. i also did my homework.<br><br>i am just speaking the fact. anyway you have the option not to believe me.<br>i don mind.<br><br></div>
