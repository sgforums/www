            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, seldom ppl go full time until they acheive an income equvilaent to the salary they are earning now. So the $36k is not in the topic. If people dun do MLM they might just spend the time watching more tv.. etc, what about opportunity cost here? Furthermore, it's not only about the money u earn, it's abt the experience you learn, that is if u join an ethical company with good values and not those out to cheat other ppl... Just my 2 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all congrats to you, cos you really have achieved in your MLM business. There are many reason for your success and the apparent "failure" of others. By going full time, i guessed you really have put in more effort and time becos that's ur main rice bowl, so the results more or less is obvious, you badly need to succeed, to earn a living. If you have something to fall back on -- "a 9-5 job", probably you somehow will slack off a bit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Just wondering why a successful networker marketer like you have time for these forum discussion, even in the wee hours, what do you stand to gain by discussing so actively here? Why aren't you concentratting your effort in expanding ur business? Just curious to know..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

The general outline is quite simple, that is to do the 3 S. There are also 8 steps that I follow to to start doing the business etc. However, the most impt before starting on any business is yourself.<br><br>Only when one can truly understand why he/she really wants to do the business can one go about doing the above. If not, one will give up easily.

            <div class='col-md body'>I really doubt this Amway business can earn you big bucks.  Its distributor to consumer business model after all.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I think there is some misunderstanding regarding MLMs...a good MLM does not allow us to make quick bucks..it takes some time to truly build a stable business..and it is not easy...neither does a good MLM brainwash pple...we are all intelligent pple..we have our own minds to think...we can decide whether we want the business or not...good companies only let us know of the business opportunity..and it is always up to us to analyse and to decide for ourselves..we in fact shld not succumb to any brainwash etc if any are out there....As for dreams..whether they are true or false..nobody knows..but I feel that when there is a will, there is a way...dreams are there to motivate us..give us strength etc...without dreams..our lives will be monotonous and we will be just living day by day...which is nothing wrong..but its alwiz gd to have something out there that you desire or would like to have... Dreams motivate us to work harder in whatever we do and to give it our best. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For your relative..I feel that this is slightly not the correct way of doing the business..a true Amway business is to be able to share any product..whether the low or high end ones...to customers based on their needs and wants..and actually our water treatment is not expensive...it can be proven <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> We do not have air filters in Singapore now..maybe next time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Finally, a lot of us wants quick and fast money..I do agree..but I believe that having a strong business..and although slow but lasting one is much better..it may take a few years..but a few years of hard work is nothing compared to what we will get if we truly commit ourselves to perform the business in a true ethical manner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mumof2:</div><div class="quote_body">I really doubt this Amway business can earn you big bucks.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nobody can tell or gurantee you that you will be successful in anything you do.  Amway business is basically an opportunity for anyone who is willing to work hard, persevere and have a desire to succeed.<br><br>If anyone knows how to make a quick buck without any risk, you might want to share with all of us.<br><br>No risk no gain.  We will only get want to work for and not hope we will get want we want by just sitting around doing nothing.<br><br>In almost 11 years of worklife, these things do not happen in the workplace.  Everyone is trying to make use of others in order to get promotion, backstabbing, "angkat" and etc.<br><br>I have join Amway business for about 9 months.  The environment is always very positive.  There is no such thing as people wants you to fail in this business.  Everyone will try encourging each other.  If you don't believe me, it will be my pleasure to bring you down to our centre so that you can see for yourself.<br></div>
