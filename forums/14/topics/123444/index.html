It has operations in many countries.  So this will be a company that is not fly-by-night.  A fly-by-night company is a newly set up company, that closes down after a few years of operations.<br><br>As for me, I won't go for Amway.  I look for a company that is more focus.  Amway's product is too broad, from skin care to health to even detergents.<br>I am not saying that it is bad.  But I am a person who wants to have a specific market to target on, eg weight management market, beauty or something else.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>me from amway.<br><br>ok though you dun want good points, but i can give some good points which they never tell you.<br><br>1). my upline never rush me, i can be passive for 1 year, then active again blah blah....cuz it is MY business.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>2). They are many goods, which makes it easier to sell, and all come with the catalogue and scientific catalogue, you can read all about it before tell people about it. cuz some may not want to buy expensive cosmetics, health products, so they also have very cheap stuffs, like festive goodies, chocolates, pens, toothbrush, tea bags, etc...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>3). only a one-time fee of $60+ issit? cant remember ahaha.. for the business package, subsequent yearly subscription is only $30+ for every year.<br>and again, no coersing, if you dun wanna continue after a year, just stop. also if 1st year you decide to quit, you can have a FULL refund provided all the business kit is intact, just return to them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ohh..just remembered some bad points from Amway..<br><br>1). Amway last time is connected with quixstar or something like tat, go do a google search on Amway or quixtar, (cant remember the name) got many bad news like last time they actually never give the diamond enough money, so actually the magazine put they get so much money blah blah is actually lesser.<br><br>but now think its ok liao.<br><br>2). When your upline always pester you go weekend seminar, quick pestering. but again be firm if you cannot go. anyway, when there, they will always ask you buy this tape or cd or buy that book or ticket, end up may waste alot of money. So UNLESS you see a need to buy, THEN you buy. Anyway, its a good chance and opening your door to working life. that is, if you dun wanna buy, just maintain your stand and graciously decline.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what i have research and studied, i found amway to be a very honest and fair business model, even from the character of their founders. Though the marketing plan don't let you earn fast money but i believe you need to work hard in order to succeed in anything, that's only fair. They have confidence in their products till they offer satisfaction money back guarantee, and with a good pool of scientists and researchers working full time, better products are bound to be produced continously.<br><br>I haven yet heard about any true and bad things about Amway. So if anyone has anything to share, pls feel free, i will be most glad to hear it out. I guess all the motivational cds and books are to create a postitive environment, becos that's the only to succeed, in anything and areas in life. With a good training and management, even if we don't succeed in the business, there are bound to be useful things to learn from it, at a low cost.<br><br>The company has a solid background so i feel they are here to stay. Considering that they are debt free, i feel the company can last. Thus the promise of passing on the income to the next generation really holds and it's a major point in what i consider.<br><br>I await more replies and feedbacks from fellow friends out there, enlighten me if i am wrong or miss out anything, cheers.<br><br>MLM is a honest business, work hard and you deserve what you earn. Just work at it with a right attitude of sharing an opportunity and i think most people will respect this job. Have Pride in it! CheerS! Wish all success in your business!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But why? That's precisely the reason i want started this thread, i want to know what's bad about Amway, but till now, nobody's coming out with anything. Why say too much time and too much money to spare? I thought there is no need to maintain any sales in Amway, you can don't spend a cent first if you don't have the money? Interesting comment, but hope can back it up with some facts....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> [/quote]</div>

If yes, why will the management aims to keep on expanding when they know the fact that expanding too fast will means they are not going to last?<br><br>Secondly, do you think 30 years in a country is way too long for any newcomers to actually succeed? Think again, Amway has been in Malaysia for instance 30 years, yet, every month on the magazine you can see a lot of ppl becoming DD, diamond, how does that explains?<br><br>It actually means those people who have the right mentality and determination can succeed, those are the people who think positively, not those who think that the market is already saturated. Furthermore it's still relatively new in Singapore, 3 years exactly.<br><br>Point 2) I don't exactly get what you mean by 21 legs to succeed, there are various levels you can aim and work towards, it's just how big you want this business to work at, at least that's what you aim. There are some people who do not have a lot frontline sponsors but they have a strong newtork, earning considerable amt also. Success doesn't not come easy, this i think all will have to agree, regardless of companies. If it is so easy, the whole world will be at it. Traditional Business also does not guarantee success, yet many plunge in with hope that they can succeed. Attitude shapes a man, no matter what company you are at, if you have a gd attitude, you will bound to benefit, just in varying degree of success.<br><br>Point 3) I also don't get what you mean as overseas sponsoring is not seamless. Yes, there are bound to be some aspects which makes things a little harder but i feel the overseas sponsoring scheme is really fair, with foster sponsor as such. If your network has a good system, i don't see any huge problem in overseas sponsoring though.<br><br>Point 4) Yeah i would say ppl at least aim for a DD in this career. More and more ppl are succeeding in singapore every month as we can see, if you are determined and dun give up easily, i don't think the target can be that difficult, maybe 3 years or even 5 years you still can make it. It's all in the determination. To all fellow friends out in MLM, regardless what compaines, we have the desire to succeed that's why we ar ein this business, so let's just be determined and success will be ours one day.<br><br>Point 5) True there are some legal battles around the world but i can safely say that few of it are reagarding the acts of the companies. There are couple of "evil" distributors trying to come out with something funny themselves and it's not totally represenative of the company. There are bound to be some black sheep distributors ard, so.... beware...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> haha<br><br>Point 6) Diversified products has its own advantages. If diversification causes product quality to deteriorate, then this would be sucidal. However, judging from the amt of research scientists in Amway, considerable effort can be seen trying to innovate and improve which is upmost importance in this industry now. Amway's product i would say not ALL are super outstanding, but all products have relatively high standards, judging from it's SATISFACTION money back guanrantee. Moreover, Amway sorts of build in a way of "changing your normal household brand to Amway" and teaching others to do the same. Amway products are expensive, but they are economical. What does that mean? it means the price of a certain thing might be high, but i can be used longer than normal products. It's the easiness of sharing the "changing product brand" thing that makes Amway easier to do, a lot of products are essential items.<br><br>Point 7) I think the joining fee is $68 to be exact. However, it can be refunded fully within a year if you decide not to continue working on this business. TO be able to stay &gt; 1 year means you are quite serious, so i think it's more or less termed as free too. $68 isn't really that much, i think all would have to agree. Monthly maintenance not neccessary, it seems you are not risking that much after all, isn't it?<br><br>Point <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Training and system is important, very. It determines how well you can make use of the system to your advantages. No matter if you really make it big or not, theses trainings bound to improve you as a person, and they don;t come at a price. It's the mentality of the leaders that is important i perceive. Even with a good company, with the leaders' thinking not ethical, everything can turn bad.<br><br>I always view these things with an open mind, i would readliy listen to what ever plans i do not know of and access it myself, because i really think by listenign to other plans you wun lose anything, in fact you might gain!<br><br>I believe we should not try give too much a negative environment here, we all hope frends other that can succeed, because we all have a desire too. My view is that the ppl talking here aren't those who are successful, because those ppl wun have time to engage in these things, they are busily improving their businness, isn't it? We shld be be influenced by negative thinking. If we often mix wiht ppl who are negative and din succeed, we most likely will follow suit. Business is a bussiness, some succeed, some don't. We shld not see other's failure as an obstacle, but others success as an encouragement.<br><br>Enough said, and i do welcome feedbacks from ppl other there. I wish everyone in the MLM business success. Remember, staying positive is impt, be determined and not let obstacles bring you down. See you all at the top!</div>

If yes, why will the management aims to keep on expanding when they know the fact that expanding too fast will means they are not going to last?<br><br>Secondly, do you think 30 years in a country is way too long for any newcomers to actually succeed? Think again, Amway has been in Malaysia for instance 30 years, yet, every month on the magazine you can see a lot of ppl becoming DD, diamond, how does that explains?<br><br>It actually means those people who have the right mentality and determination can succeed, those are the people who think positively, not those who think that the market is already saturated. Furthermore it's still relatively new in Singapore, 3 years exactly.<br><br>Point 2) I don't exactly get what you mean by 21 legs to succeed, there are various levels you can aim and work towards, it's just how big you want this business to work at, at least that's what you aim. There are some people who do not have a lot frontline sponsors but they have a strong newtork, earning considerable amt also. Success doesn't not come easy, this i think all will have to agree, regardless of companies. If it is so easy, the whole world will be at it. Traditional Business also does not guarantee success, yet many plunge in with hope that they can succeed. Attitude shapes a man, no matter what company you are at, if you have a gd attitude, you will bound to benefit, just in varying degree of success.<br><br>Point 3) I also don't get what you mean as overseas sponsoring is not seamless. Yes, there are bound to be some aspects which makes things a little harder but i feel the overseas sponsoring scheme is really fair, with foster sponsor as such. If your network has a good system, i don't see any huge problem in overseas sponsoring though.<br><br>Point 4) Yeah i would say ppl at least aim for a DD in this career. More and more ppl are succeeding in singapore every month as we can see, if you are determined and dun give up easily, i don't think the target can be that difficult, maybe 3 years or even 5 years you still can make it. It's all in the determination.

Amway still talking about 0.25 or 0.5% ? come on.....<br><br>to the marine guy, if u hv already join, then u shd not start this thread...i think that is one of those evil distributors in amway....there is noway for such people to succeed.<br><br>good luck to those amway distributors ! u will need lots of it.<br><br></div>
