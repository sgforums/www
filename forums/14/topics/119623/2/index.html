            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tableC:</div><div class="quote_body">hai..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>let me share with u guys about my story...<br>its all started when my friend brought me to the so call coslab HQ..<br>than the KELVIN began to say how he is so successful in coslab<br>after leaving cid..</div></blockquote>Let me share with u something about this so-call successful KELVIN HO. He was successful in <strong>NOP</strong> after CID, not <strong>Coslab</strong>. He <strong>failed</strong> in NOP and he went out and set up a small and typical comic shop in AMK with my friend (YS). But the worst thing is this chap had no more money and he started the business using his sister's $$$ and my friend (YS)'s $$$. After some hard time with that silly shop, he went back to search for MLM (thats why u see him in Coslab now) and just throw that pathetic shop to my poor friend (YS) to handle. And i heard that he had declared bankruptcy already, but is it true or not, i dunno. B'coz i have no solid proof to say he is bankrupt. Even he is not bankrupt, he is broke and thats confirm. Btw, the Lexus that he is driving recently is not his! hahaha! that car belong to the Coslab's Boss's nephew's good friend who went oversea and ask him to take care of his car. But that lunatic kept on telling people that the Lexus is HIS.<br><br><blockquote><strong>the person who bring you there will sit down there quietly and let the powerful speaker to talk to you.. they will say how successful they are and pressure you to sign the agreement form.... when they fail to call you to pen your signature, they will call a more powerful speaker to talk to you..<br><br>the catch is that they try not to let u leave and have some logical thinking. they<br>will try to talk about it again and agin to make you join them.. as for my case,<br>3 speaker talk to me including the KELVIN also speak to me but they also<br>can't get me to pen my signature..<br><br>my advice is that what they say to you, you just dun bother and say u wanna<br>go home and think through it.. they will say sacastic stuff like you are a grown<br>up now and should make decision your self stc... but just dun bother because<br>they are trying to make you join them..</strong></blockquote>That is what they learnt from NOP. Most of the guys there were from NOP. Like Steve Chew, Kelvin Ho, Edwin Chew, Sam, Eddie Tang, Alfred, Kevin Leu, jeff and etc... They are all CHEATERS! They like to use force or pressure selling and even sacastic remarks!<br><br><blockquote><strong>just fuck care them and go.. they can't stop you..<br><br>just remember when u join mlm, u will have fewer and fewer friends because they are afraid of you..<br><br>the friend who introduce this to me say that when i join him, we will succeed together and if i chose not to join than we will remains as friend..<br><br>let me tell you something, whenever he saw me talking to people, he will have the thought that i spoke to other  people about the mlm stuff...<br><br>one last advise...<br><br>WHEN YOUR FRIEND AS YOU TO GO SPA OR GOT GOOD THINGS TO INTRODUCE..<br>BEWARE ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THE COSLAB PEOPLE TAUGHT THEM TO<br>KISS ( KEEP IT SHORT &amp; SIMPLE ) .. ASK FOR MORE INFO BEFORE GOING OUT WITH THEM ESPECIALLY IN SMALL GROUP.<br><br></strong></blockquote>yes!!! that the way my friend ask me, <strong>"WHEN YOUR FRIEND AS YOU TO GO SPA OR GOT GOOD THINGS TO INTRODUCE.."</strong> really sick! Please take note that there is no such things as REFUND in Coslab, thay will not allow you to do so and they will tell you all sorts of excuses to entertain you. BEWARE!!! Please dont put in yr $$$ like what i did, there is no return for yr $$$!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Long time since i never vist this forum. Still alot of gossip whether is true or fake. Don't think high society or successful people have time to gossip around. Haha. I love coming in to this forum as able to see alot of comments that people not happy, grumble or being both director and actors here. How true all this can be? Think mature enough people will understand. Why let your fingers do the talking, do direct approach to them! Slap them hard on the face and demand for an explaination. If it's true! No point telling stories or invent new stories.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
