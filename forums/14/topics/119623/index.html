            <div class='col-md body'>MLM is not unworkable, but it is however, extremely unconventional and it takes a lot of wisdom and hard work to suceed in it, hardly a get quick rich plan.<br><br>To say that this or that coy is a scam is pretty much sour grapes, because in the end it's up to us to really sort out the wheat from the chaff and to end up in the right outfit.<br><br>Also, your connections are everything, if you are in a 'scam' company (that is, a company in which your investment is not really protected)  but have solid connections, you can end up making, but if your connections are poor, you will end up a victim, not because they are trying to scam you, as a system, but because the guy who brought you in is #$%ed up and is more concerned about using you then working with you.<br><br>After all, it hardly helps the company to reap a tiny profit from scamming you and others when it is far more profitable to actually keep you in the game getting more people for them. Not to mention bad rep usually kills them off really fast, something they would want to avoid. Need to go in with eyes and ears wide open, because MLM is like the internet, there are good and bad guys out there, but it hardly means the system is in itself a scam or not, it's just a system where we carry out our actions.<br><br>The advantages of MLM however, are obvious, as in you are actually rewarded for the hard work you put in as opposed to putting in tons of effort for a tiny raise in a normal job and the investment to start with this is far less then conventional investments. In the end, it's up to you to decide if this is the ball game you want to play, I am not totally confident in the system but I see that it can be done, and it's far from impossible.

            <div class='col-md body'>An excerpt from 'The Intelligent Investor'(written by Benjamin Graham; 2003 print version) page 275, "Commentary on Chapter 10" by Jason Zweig.<br><br>"WORDS OF WARNING:<br><br>The need for due deligence  does't stop......Melanie Senter Lubin, securities commisioner for the State of Maryland, suggests being on guard for words and phrases that can spell trouble. If your adviser keeps saying them - or twisting your arm to do anything that makes you uncomfortable - 'then get in touch with the authorities', warns Lubin. Here's the kind of lingo that should set off warning bells:<br><br>'offshore'<br>'exclusive'<br>'the opportunity of a lifetime'<br>'you should focus on performance, not fees'<br>'prime bank'<br>'This baby's gonna move'<br>'Don't you want to be rich?'<br>'guaranteed'<br>'can't lose'<br>'You need to hurry'<br>'The upside is huge'<br>'It's a sure thing'<br>'There's no downside'<br>'our proprietary computer model'<br>'I'm putting my mother in it'<br>'The smart money is buying it'<br>'Trust me'<br>'options strategy'<br>'monthly returns'<br>'commodities trading'<br>'It's a no-brainer'<br>'active asset-allocation strategy'<br>'You can't afford not to own it'<br>'We can cap your downside'<br>'We can beat the market'<br>'You'll be sorry if you don't'<br>'No one else knows how to to this' "<br><br>Please not that the above was actually advice for people investing in mutual funds/unit trusts. However, I still find the majority of the above words to watch out for very relavent. Ultimately, you must make and be responsible for your own decision. Whatever others tell you, it is vital to 'eat the meat but spit out the bones'. Be more concerned with concrete facts and logical analysis rather than all the sweet-talks. If you want to commit your precious $$$ into an MLM, make sure you really understand what's all bout it and the coy involved first. Never commit significant amounts of your money into something you don't understand or feel uncomfortable with. Hope it helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And yes, I was very unimpressed with NTI, because that bastard dare to expect me as an NSF to put in over $1000 of my precious $$$, after just 1 hour plus of sweet talk, while I still didnt understand a hell of what is about in the biz, other than his efforts trying to impress you with his biz 'knowledge' - which was shit, and all MLM related ie 'matrix', 'uni-level', stair-step breakaway', binary, blah blah blah like he really know a lot like that, preaching 'you can make $$$', 'you can own the things you always want to have', 'have you read Rich Dad Poor Dad?' (I've read it, yet I consider this an insult, because the book is too SIMPLE yet at times misleading. Nobody with decent business credentials will ask you this stupid question)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hai..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>let me share with u guys about my story...<br>its all started when my friend brought me to the so call coslab HQ..<br>than the KELVIN began to say how he is so successful in coslab<br>after leaving cid..<br><br>the person who bring you there will sit down there quietly and let the powerful speaker to talk to you.. they will say how successful they are and pressure you to sign the agreement form.... when they fail to call you to pen your signature, they will call a more powerful speaker to talk to you..<br><br>the catch is that they try not to let u leave and have some logical thinking. they<br>will try to talk about it again and agin to make you join them.. as for my case,<br>3 speaker talk to me including the KELVIN also speak to me but they also<br>can't get me to pen my signature..<br><br>my advice is that what they say to you, you just dun bother and say u wanna<br>go home and think through it.. they will say sacastic stuff like you are a grown<br>up now and should make decision your self stc... but just dun bother because<br>they are trying to make you join them..<br><br>just fuck care them and go.. they can't stop you..<br><br>just remember when u join mlm, u will have fewer and fewer friends because they are afraid of you..<br><br>the friend who introduce this to me say that when i join him, we will succeed together and if i chose not to join than we will remains as friend..<br><br>let me tell you something, whenever he saw me talking to people, he will have the thought that i spoke to other  people about the mlm stuff...<br><br>one last advise...<br><br>WHEN YOUR FRIEND AS YOU TO GO SPA OR GOT GOOD THINGS TO INTRODUCE..<br>BEWARE ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THE COSLAB PEOPLE TAUGHT THEM TO<br>KISS ( KEEP IT SHORT &amp; SIMPLE ) .. ASK FOR MORE INFO BEFORE GOING OUT WITH THEM ESPECIALLY IN SMALL GROUP.<br><br></div>
