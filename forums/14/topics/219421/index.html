            <div class='col-md body'>I would just like to share the visit experience when i went down to this company.<br><br>They are just beside Belair, their neighbours.<br><br>This company is a US based company, doing Binary Plan.<br><br>Their plan is bad, really bad. (If you compare their plan with Synergy, Synergy's binary plan is a lot of times better than theirs)<br><br>The way they find clients are ridiculous!! Giving out flyers near other mlm companies, trying to pull other mlmers into this company.<br><br>Only those ppl who don't really understand what is REAL MLM, than will be taken into the words that they say.<br><br>They even say like you come in to the company, they will give you 10 downlines straight, and the compensation plan is so bad that it can't be discribe with words.<br><br>How they earn money is for every 6-3 pair, than you earn, you recruit a person, straight away you already earn, but only US$10.<br><br>The people there are good in spying of other companies, but all without the correct MLM knowledge, their knowledge are rather shallow.<br><br>The product that I drank, from my friend who purchased it, after drinking, made us coughing.<br><br>I just drank a 2 mouth full only, than keep coughing for 2 days already and is still coghing currently.<br><br>Age group wise, all old people, no mixture of adults, fail to attract the talented age group in.<br><br>Office is acceptable but their training room is very small, has only 1 product, their website is <a href="http://www.myvemma.com" rel="nofollow">www.myvemma.com</a><br><br>Their way of finding international market is like too un-professional and i certainly don't want to comment.<br><br>Their products only have 2.<br>1 is a book, other mlm companies also can buy one, the other is 2 different mangosteen juice which a lot of new mlm usa based companies are also selling.<br><br>Their nearest MRT station is at Boon Keng.<br><br>Their method of doing is like 24hrs, 7days a week full-time always there for you. Only crazy people willl conduct a business in such ways. Do big business conduct business in late midngiht, all sleeping already, who will be so fo*lish to go conduct appts in every single place.<br><br>These company's people are all belongs to the 'Sour Grapes' family.<br>See other companies have cars achievers, than say all rent back one la, see how long they can hold on to the rent, just wait and see after 6 months lor.<br><br>All don't use their logic and think one.<br><br>Who would be so silly to go rent a posh car just to close a prospect when they just join with captial less than a grand?<br><br>Maybe just a few hundreds also have. The cost of renting a posh car even exceed the amount of commission they earn by recruiting people.<br><br>People in this company just don't use their brains to think.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY AND THE FLYERS THAT THEY ARE DISTRIBUTING ALONG THE STREETS!!</strong></span><br><br>Lastly, they like to Show-Off say that they can get the top ppl from other companies to join them in Vemma. When i hear it, i wanted to burst into laghter but held it down, to remain my composure.<br><br>Hope my post can help many people who are trying to prevent knocking their heads into unneccesary walls by visiting bad companies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>Let's not forget where Vemma comes from:<br><br>" Vemma's Parent Company<br>VemmaÂ™ is a brand-new, ground-floor opportunity from the creators of New VisionÂ®, a 10-year-old international leader in health and wellness with over $1 billion in total retail sales.<br><br>New Vision has built a solid and dependable company with a great reputation in the networking industry. It operates out of its brand-new 24,000 square-foot Home Office located in Scottsdale, Arizona. The company also operates a state-of-the-art, 25,000-square-foot distribution center and uses a liquid manufacturing facility in Tempe, Arizona. And in an industry that sees a failure rate for start-up companies of over 90% in the first year and over 98% within five years, New Vision is celebrating its tenth year of profitable success. Even more impressive in this industry, New Vision has paid out almost $400 million to its members, without ever being late on delivering royalty checks or promises. "<br><br>Moreover, like here in Europe, Vemma's license can be bought buy successful entrepreneurs who manage their license locally, providing translation, back offices, and full support for members, not independently but conjointly with the head quarters in Arizona. It avoids all the disavantages of a centralised administration.<br>The formula is working tremendously efficiently. I have seen a few hickup at start, but they have quickly smoothen. What else could you wish ?<br><br>Mat<br><br></div>
