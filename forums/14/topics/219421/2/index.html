            <div class='col-md body'>there is different groups in the same company as we know, and as far as i knew, the flyers approach is from another group which mainly speaks in chinese.(which i agree its totally wrong) there's an other group(english speaking) in the company called "1 mind1mission" which teaches in duplications and leveraging by guru Randy Gage. they focus on the system instead of the product as we knew, if the product is good, it'll sell by itself. and do u think its easy to get into the PDRÂ®? try putting your name in the book of guinness book of records.  and so far the system had proven works as partners had been promoted to silver in less than a month! this is so far the best<br>complan as many had mentioned. if u had doubt,  make your way down to the office and  i'll CONVINCE u. there are alot of mlm junkies who tot they knew everything and starts to bad-mouth others. pls look into the depth and bad-mouthing will not makes u wealthy! and for your info, x@ngo and vemma is a totally different company and i do not wanna bad-mouth on any other companies as we are all in the same industry.  what we are all are looking for is a good company with good complan which will take us to financial freedom in the quickest time possible. if there's a complan far more better than vemma's, i'll join you.</div>

[prejudice and Ignorant]<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large">point 1</span></span> - sensei is not professional, thus it's not related in anyway.<br>- western doctors or chinese doctors; which is good, i don't want to discuss more; Reason = Simple - Subjective.<br><br>But 1 thing is for sure. Drugs will not cure the eliments of the diseases totally.<br>what i mean by cure FULLY means, the drugs that are prescribed by doctors does not have side effects. Which is impossible, unless doctors are prescribing supplements.<br><br>Western Drugs can only temporary cure the illness or diseases, long term consumption of medicine/western drugs will make the body immue to the drug or it not dependent/over-dependent on the drugs to eliminate germs.<br><br>Why I say so - Drugs, prescribed by Western Doctors to patients, the drugs are the same, they take everybody/everyperson with the same body, they don't have CUSTOMIZED remedies to help cure/help the body to recover.<br><br>However, the chinese doctors, however will take time to determine our individual body type whether it's heaty/cold body type etc..than they will determine if which herbs' combination will suit the body.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large">point 2</span></span> - i shall not comment on your companies' one and only product, but i shall say that at least Xango's Boss did apologize to the media for over-claiming that their product Xangosteen is that good as said by the net-workers.<br><br>than can i ask you, do you go to doctor and say - hey doctor, i'm sick with flu, than he/she gives you flu medicine.<br><br>the 2nd time you go back, you've down with fever and you go back to the same doctor and say - hey doctor, i'm sick with fever than he/she gives you panadol.<br><br>will you expect the doctor to give you flu medicine when you have fever?<br>cannot be what.<br><br>so don't come claiming say that Mangosteen Juice can cure MOST OF THE ILLNESSES and help to improve the overall-well being of the body.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large">point 3</span></span> - acupuncture orginiated from the east? lol - it boils down to History. Thus it's subjective again.<br><br>Ignorant  'maybe/perhaps' if that's the impression that i'm giving you, if you want to check the origins of medicine, kindly go check with historians, there are many versions.<br><br>Go read 1421 if you know what I mean. It's too subjective. thus with that, i will not comment more.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large">point 4</span></span> - Western and Chinese medicine history, which one is better, depends on individual basis and preference.<br><br>but my stand is firm - i personally prefer Chinese in the long run for health purposes, but of course, i do visit western doctors, but NOT that frequent.<br><br>Just to touch a bit more on the Chinese/Western Medicine. Both works alright, but the side-effects, everybody knows, so it's up to the individual to find out exactly what side-effects the drugs will have. Chinese medicine, if there's any side-effects, do let me know, so that i can learn more.<br><br>okay, seriously speaking, i don't like to debate on such matters. If you notice that this is AFTER-ALL a FORUM, purpose is to share information on what each individual knows, so it Goes WITHOUT SAYING, it's subjective in every SINGLE THREAD in this forum regardless of what other popular forums we post in Sgforums.<br><br>Am i really ignorant and prejudice?<br>Do i don't know about what you know?<br>Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.<br>I'm not here to debate like i've said.<br>It's childish to actually debate on Which Medicine be it from Chinese/Western is good.<br><br>What do you gain from it?<br>I gain nothing, by debating, do you gain anything from winning?<br>no you don't. So grow up.<br><br>Of course, i do understand from your point of view, Vemma is afterall the mlm company which you're working in currently, so NATURALLY you will feel obliged to DEFEND the company as it's something which you Strongly Believe in.<br><br>But if you were to think logically, can a product be suitable for all people with different needs? (refer to point 2)<br><br>if you're really interested to know more on better opportunities, we can talk and discuss. Of course i will intro my company to you, but until you're ready to open up and listen rather than close up, i will just speak and perhaps share with you on only general mlm topics or other topics if you like.<br><br>anybody who's interested to know more are most welcomed to let me know</div>
