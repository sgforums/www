              <p>I'm not from VE, but I feel I have to say this... It really
              astounding how you try to justify not working because you are
              working for the leader's profits...</p>
              <p>Now, I would like to pose this question, name me one Single
              company in Singapore, other than charity organisations, where you
              work not for your boss' profits?</p>
              <p>Every single company in Singapore, infact the whole world, you
              work for you boss' profits... The Mc Donald staff earn less than
              $2000 per month while the big boss earns billions of dollars per
              month...</p>
              <p>Which company you work for? whatever it is, you should also quit
              you job... you work hard to meet deadline while your CEO shake leg
              at his office...</p>
              <p>Its not the agents who need to wake up, its you who need to wake
              up... you say they should stop working because they're making the
              boss rich... but these agents who didn't quit realize that with
              hardwork and good results, they WILL be the boss...</p>

              <p>Then she moved on to introducing the prices of the products....and this one take the straw....</p>
              <p>After comparing putting one's money into an unit trust fund or something like that for 20 years and getting no guarantee for your returns (trying to use current issues to sway the decision) or putting a few dollars in to invest in the VE products...she asked</p>
