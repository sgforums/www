That is true. Nobody said CBD was a bad area. In my earlier posts, I mentioned the company took due consideration into the location. It seems opinions of customers and agaents were taken into account and ascessibility wise, our current location was much convinient. After 2 months shift, agents n customers alike seem to have no complaints compared with the CBD expensive entry routes and parking spaces.<br><br>Really, I find it funny that you seem to be making a personal grudge againts my company as if the location of the company will cause so many agents and customers to leave venture era and competitors see it as a downfall of my company. Understanding u r from a company ***** which location-wise seems to be way off "centralised" as you call it, I don't see any adverse effects that will ruin your company am I right to say that? So if pinpointing a company's location is a big decision to criticise, remember one thing, although location can be a great asset to a company, especially MLM companies, it takes time to open new branches n HQ. As the business grows, Im sure many MLM companies would become like Great Eastern n AIA whereby their offices are spread with the demand of the market.<br><br>So, I did not twist any use of words cause I did not claim in my forum here tt CBD was bad, in fact, it is a great location for venturing businesses but due to target traffics considerations, businesses experts will tell you that our current location will do great. and of course many other reasons I am disclosed to tell. I hope none of your comments are personal.

[Don't put words into my mouth] (do you know privacy - I didn't even mention anything regarding my company in the forums, so why do you have to mention it - that's so un-professional of you despite your high mlm knowledge)<br><br>[sorry for being harsh, although you do have professional and more than sufficient MLM &amp; Business Knowledge, but you lack in Basic Manners and courtesy - it's a basic rule of thumb to respect one another's privacy despite the difference in companies.] My Statement is based on the couple of MLM companies that I've being to, and just so happens that you happen to say different Versions as well. (But than again, everyone learns from mistakes, even i am also learning, thus it's normal to make mistakes, but better not repeat the same mistake - correct me if i'm wrong.)<br><br>But i must admit, <strong>you're good in your own way</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but don't let your knowledge be in your way of improving for the better.</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the_fallen:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">+1<br><br>a bit too bias to protecting VE already..</span><br><br>+ the resons on moving to other place..<br><br>if i didn't remember wrongly, corwin, when we last met, you said something like doing business, it's best to have business that's located in the central..<br><br>now it has moved, than you come up with a lot of 'reasons' to answer to the people posting here.<br><br>somehow, it's a repeat of history..just like what i learnt from my research work..it tallies with what i observed..</div></blockquote>I didn't have a personal grudes against your company.<br>why would i?<br>if i have, than i would have already gone to the N** thread to post and black-name my ex-company already, but ask yourself, and you can go check it out.

No doubt about it. You make appeals based on how attractive your products are or how good is your marketing plan.<br><br>To defend it like you would a cause, like anti-abortion, stop short of a publicity disaster. MLM industry is unique in a way because there is really no such really thing as MLMers and non-MLMers. You need to convert non-MLMers to your business and the last thing any businessman would do is to flame the public.<br><br>You are basically proving those who are against MLM right.<br><br></div></blockquote>I agree with this post.<br><br>I think that everyone are networkers. Might it be students, adults, or even kids. Let me ask this question. When you were younger, did you boast to your friends about anything before? Did it ever cross your mind that you are already networking then? Did you ever had friends who end up buying the same bag or clothes as you just because you convinced them that it is nice? Did you ever managed to ask your friends out to go shopping or do anything to u when they didnt wan to at first? Can i say that this is networking?<br><br>Im now working v closely with many businessmen. U realise that they like to go play golf, drink coffee, and even hightea partying. you think they reali go there juz to enjoy ah??? when u ask the actual reason, they will tell u...'this is the best time to noe XXX boss. He will help me in my business.' or "he is very impt to me. he can help me expand my business." Isnt this wat MLM people are doing oso? so can I say that everyone is a networker????<br><br>UNLESS U SAY U <strong>ONLI</strong> NOE HOW TO STAY AT HOME AND PLAY COMPUTER. I believe no one dunno how to leave home and face the public. if u do step out of house, one way or another, U ARE A NETWORKER.</div>

Wow, I din check this thread for mths, and realised that I haf replies to my posts, and even a sidekick called MightyIceBoy! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Are all MLMers trained in the same way? I'm approached by Enyouth today, and whambam! It's like deja vu, tinking back the unfortunate 2-3 hrs I spent at Venture Era. They speak exactly the SAME, promising the exact SAME prospects of 5 FIG PAYCHECK, BMW and ANY FREAKING CAR U LIKE!<br><br>I agree it's the ppl who spoils MLM image in SG, but wif such a business plan of recruiting more ppl, selling more products, I doubt it's hard for them to chg their recruitment/sales approach, which we hate in the first place.<br><br>So as fer ur comment abt meeting 1 or 2 such ppl, sry to tell u, but I met at least 10 over peeps alrdy, talking abt the same shieta abt their company, how gd it is, how successful u'll be.<br><br>It's true tt some ppl make it successful in MLM but it's a very small percentage. Cos' as everyday passes, ppl get more aware of such a thing as MLM, and those who're willing to buy, or dumb enough to buy, would have alrdy bought the products, that probably placed those happy asses of the current 'managers' in their warm and rich seats, while the new trainees would be trying so hard to sell the products to the alrdy aware public, forcing them to use hard and sell tactics, be it recruitment or sales, making them the instant bane of their social circles. It's a vicious cycle, really.<br><br>As for false job promises, either via newspaper or phonecall, is VE still using the same ol' tactic of promising innocent job-seekers of an admin job, customer svc call centre job? I tink someone trained in law muz really put a stop to this. Do MLM, I dun mind la, it's a form of business afterall, but pls be more honest.<br></div>

Why are the prices of the goods so steep? Of cos' to line their pockets to buy their 'stupid BMW by 26 yrs old'.<br><br>I shan't comment so much abt the business plan, touchy issues abt profits and gains, cos' I'm not very well trained in business too. If u noticed the trends of all my posts, it's to tackle the issue of MLM in SG abusing human relations.<br><br>I only had 1 prb with VE, that is they gave me false hopes of a regular job. And how the heck they got my number? I did ask my recruiter, and she didn't do a good job explaining that to me. So, how should I find my answer then? Go right to the top manager and demand an explanation?<br><br>Besides, no matter how f-up the company is in our eyes, it's impolite to ask them abt such touchy issues abt their product prices, isn't it? Furthermore, with a throng of MLM talking kiddos in suits and ties bombarding u without giving u rest, esp. if u're ALONE against 10 of them, do u tink u'll be able to tink rationally at tt pt of time? Or u'll juz be tinking of running away at the 1st opportunity? Of cos' the latter, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I believe most peeps here wanna share their experiences, and to read abt other ppl's experiences as well to see if there's any similarities. We're not the least interested abt their business plan or product prices or wadever sh!t cos' we're alrdy convinced not to haf any part of VE anymore in our lives. If u wan to noe more, u can go to their office urself. We're not trying to convince anyone. We're juz voicing out our opinions.

If VE got official website i mebbe join VE liao.</strong><br><br>I totally agreed. a 6 year NM company is without an offical website? is there something to hide? i was introduced to Venture Era by a friend who told me that there is a business opportunity and be able to do businesss. and next i met up with him and head down to this old building of MDIS down in changi road. when i first heard of it, i was so kind of "wow" with the products. like say the water calstar or whatever it is called. has 6 more better function than the normal tap water or filter water we had in our home??? and sure there is demostration about it. saying all the positive points about it and there is no negative about it.<br><br>Next was the business plan they called it. from a MA(P) to MA, you need sell something like cause $1900+? just to reach that? and commission of 5%?? and for MA to reach ME ? a $9000 of total sales? and further? you have to eat your consicence and bow your heads to your friends/relatives when trying to sell to them, talking to them endlessly about the products and all that. just trying to sell to them? and earn their money? when your up-line is earning what you sold? i felt its unfair as in which do your up-line can earn when you found the customer by yourself? sure i don like the idea of getting 'eaten' up. its not good for anyone. my friends, about 3 or 4? got calls about short-listed for an interview in a office. and they told me it is Venture Era. it was like a scam, that people of VE had to use underhand means to get recuits to work for them. and they are earning through their friends' money. and the Car-Archiever(CA) thing. it is just a movitating thing for the people of VE. the products there are not cheap. cheapest is about $200 if i remember correctly. why will people of VE need do trick people to get down for recuitment or selling off their products? like my friend who told me, he is using his own savings for his promotion to another rank. This is self-investment! you would have to ask your family or relative or yourself to invest for yourself! and the Business Manager(BM) will psycho you, telling you don give up and all that. its more on your mental mind set. like how one of the BM talked to me. and calculated how much i would earn. and the SGBM ( Senior Group Business Manager) earning $15k per mth? but how does he earn it? tricking people using underhand means? had a quarrel with his family because of telling them to invest on him? who knows? he said he used 1 year for that SGBM. but alot of things had happened, you will lose your friends' trust. you will lose your relatives and friends' point of view about you. your intergity? your pride? where are they? is it because of money your are doing such thing????? money can be good, it can be evil too! it depends on how you earn it! don trying to trick your friends and relatives! ESPECIALLY they wan the first Sales Appointment(SA) with your family. they first will target your parents and told them to fork out the money for your MA position. there's alot of story about VE. all i had said its true. you may have all the money in the world. but you will lose your friends' trust and their point of view about how they think about you.<br><br>For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs<br><br>Think twice my friends out there!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SBGM ( SENIOR BUSINESS GROUP MANAGER ) i mean. i really hope my friends out there. its always better to get a good job. VE people look down on diploma holders because they think they are earning more than the dip holders. most youths now thought that VE is a 'shortcut' to get rich. but during the experience in VE. you will lose your friends' and family trust, i mean it. VE people says it is naturally rejections out there. its a form of psychoing you! WAKE UP! please wake up! they are earning money through you! because without you, they are not earning money! VE is targeting alot of youngsters who are looking for part-time jobs. and we don even know how they got our numbers. looks like they have their 'dark' ways of doing that. and also WHERE IS THEIR WEBSITE! there are alot of things they are hiding from us that are not disclosed. and all the brain-wash, i'm sick of it. seriously. any Ve people or whoever, any comment just shoot at me.</div>
