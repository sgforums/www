              <p>So why so defensive? Like I said, couldnt you leverage my points

              <p>I am not really interested in you defending VE, thats

              <p>Wrong. It has been proven, like the examples before, that
              quality was never a factor in these firms, yet they have grown big,
              they fooled the public, like yourself with the word 'quality'. Yet
              they go bust or survives as hobbling elephants.</p>

              <p>I have verified them. But there's no need for me to convince you or anyone here coz that's not my concern. It's not like I don't know how hostile and fruitless forum discussions can end up. So I am sticking to a neutral stand instead of going against the majority here. I won't stand to gain anything if I had tried to bring up evidence.</p>
              <p>Size is definitely a good indicator of quality. Like I've said, your example was vague and is not a good representation of the population.</p>
              <p>Another simple analogy.</p>

              <p>Which is why i am questioning you. How I know you are not fooled
              by fake certificates, ambiguous and bombastic uses of terms,
              irrelevant but yet supportive points?</p>
              <p>I am expecting you, to use little grey matter, and verify these
              points. Its already ridiculous that you said these are verified and
              checked by PSB, knowing well PSB or other organisations would not
              place themselves in a position to support alternative therapies
              100%. Even conventional drugs already has problems passing HSA
              tests.</p>
              <p>You also contradicted yourself by saying these are shown to be
              of quality, not effective. Means I know these magnets are of 100
              gauss but is useless in any treatments or preventive therapies?</p>
              <p>Get your facts right before even presenting them.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Of course I am well aware of such scam firms using pseudo-scientific terms. You can be skeptical, but that doesn't mean that I have to follow suit. But to doubt every single certs would be no different from me questioning the authencity of your birth cert. It's simply unnecessary. Even in the event that it is really fake, I have no one to blame, not even myself.</p>
              <p>PSB does not place themselves in positions to support alternative therapies 100%. Definitely! But can't they prove that the products are of genuine quality and safe? Of course they can!</p>
              <p>I like your point about the contradiction between quality and effectiveness. I asked that question too. Basically, even for medicines, there's no 100% effectiveness because of the variables in different human bodies. No one will ever claim to be 100% sure of anything simply because they are afraid of getting into trouble. Isn't it common to see condom ads saying that they are 99% safe. And also Detol which claims that it kills 99% of germs. It's the same thing. Magnetic therapy is not a 100% effective treatment, but still, it is effective.</p>

              <p>Precisely! By naming a few left handers, you can't prove that everyone in the world are left handers. Neither can you name a few companies that are big but without quality and then claim that you are proving that size of companies are not indicator of their quality! That's exactly what "bullshitting by a forumer" is!</p>
              <p>I'm here to gather opinions. Whether it aids you in your understanding of the company or not is of no concern to me. I have my rights to choose not to discuss.

              <p>In the current new age economy, there are a lot of facilities that can allow a facade of grandness. To assume that a "big" company has quality products simply by outlook alone is like saying Miss Singapore must be very pretty without asking her to remove her make up.</p>
              <p>I would advise looking at the books when you judge the company. Though even that can be deceiving some times.</p>
              <p>Even by looking at the account books, from the viewpoint of a marketing person, I can only say they have a great marketing team. I can't judge the quality of the products based on figures alone. When you talk about quality, you must always be able to compare apple to apple. There must be another product you can compare to and say that this product is of a higher quality over the other. But you cannot claim that it is of a good quality because "good" by itself is subjective. The same goes for effectiveness. If there is no other point of comparison, 1% effectiveness would be effective. But would that really be effective?</p>

              <p>Yes of course I have myself to blame if I had not bothered to find out anything before making any decisions. I had spent almost a week asking them questions about their credibility, products and business ethics. Basically what that has been brought up in this forum, I have brought it to their attention as well. I am very convinced by them. They showed me certs, articles and books on magnetic therapies. I've stated the book in one of my previous posts. If after all these, it turns out to be a scam. I won't blame myself really. I'll just blame my luck and I'll also be very impressed by the extend that they have went to cheat everyone in the world.</p>
              <p>I know the effectiveness of the products. It varies with each person. I'm not proving anything like I've said. Take it or leave it, I'm not here to convince you about their products.</p>

              companies that are big but without quality and then claim that you
              are proving that size of companies are not indicator of their
              quality! That's exactly what "bullshitting by a forumer" is!</p>
              <p>I'm here to gather opinions. Whether it aids you in your
              understanding of the company or not is of no concern to me. I have
              my rights to choose not to discuss. You can say that I am avoiding
              because I really am. If that loses all my credibility, go ahead and
              warn everyone about me!</p>

              <p>Nope. Dun twist my words. You were trying to say if VE products are not good, otherwise it wouldnt reach its size. I said size is not an indication of quality. Because you are the very person who said so. MEaning you tried to apply this theory to all companies. Thats why I said it cant be. Therefore, instead of twisting, you should have prove why would it be an good indicator for VE. Yet you did not prove anything that supports VE.</p>
              <p>Basically it means you cannot prove whatever you just said for the last few pages. and like you admited, you are avoiding. Period. We will stop it at that.You have no credibility and whatever people said, in your ears, its just anti MLM message.</p>

              <p>In the current new age economy, there are a lot of facilities
              that can allow a facade of grandness. To assume that a "big"
              company is has quality products simply by outlook alone is like
              saying Miss Singapore must be very pretty without asking her to
              remove her make up.</p>
              <p>I would advise looking at the books when you judge the company.
              Though even that can be deceiving some times.</p>
              <p>Even by looking at the account books, from the viewpoint of a
              marketing person, I can only say they have a great marketing team.
              I can't judge the quality of the products based on figures alone.
              When you talk about quality, you must always be able to compare
              apple to apple. There must be another product you can compare to
              and say that this product is of a higher quality over the other.
              But you cannot claim that it is of a good quality because "good" by
              itself is subjective. The same goes for effectiveness. If there is
              no other point of comparison, 1% effectiveness would be
              effective. But would that really be effective?</p>

              <p>Yes of course I have myself to blame if I had not bothered to
              find out anything before making any decisions. I had spent almost a
              week asking them questions about their credibility, products and
              business ethics. Basically what that has been brought up in this
              forum, I have brought it to their attention as well. I am very
              convinced by them. They showed me certs, articles and books on
              magnetic therapies. I've stated the book in one of my previous
              posts. If after all these, it turns out to be a scam. I won't blame
              myself really. I'll just blame my luck and I'll also be very
              impressed by the extend that they have went to cheat everyone in
              the world.</p>
              <p>I know the effectiveness of the products. It varies with each

              <p>Apologies, but it seems that you have not made the slightest
              effort. You were defensive and refuses to answer my points about
              your verification methods. Again, you have such resources, but you
              squander it away. You are one of those who not only did not make
              any research, but rather, refuse to make research.</p>

              <p>I have made enough effort to find out about the company. I just don't see any point to doubt them further even after they have flashed their evidence. I researched on their products. Shut up and stop pretending to know that I don't do my research. You are not me.</p>

              <p>So you contradicted yourself. There is no proof size is a definitive indication of quality, since it cant be proven. Also, you have not proven how size is related to quality and to VE</p>
