              <p>Of course what you said is true... But the theory of yours too has an impact on other business models...  Lets say all the employees of the company quits, then the co. cannot function thus no profit... Geez, thanks for that logical thinking that everybody knows...</p>
              <p>If the top management of the company quits, those at the lower level will too cease to function properly due to the lack of leadership entity...</p>
              <p> In VE, its not the downlines that carry the top management, its the management, the leaders that carry the heavy burdens of having downlines... Know the difference...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>True, but other companies work based on salary. A basic monthly take home pay. Even if many people quit, the others will still receive their pay, unless of cos the company decides to cut their pay. however in MLM concept, you income depends solely on your downlines. When one guy quits, you lose a part of your potential income.</p>

              <p>As I have stated before, in VE, the leaders are at the bottom carrying all his downline instead of the other way round... That s what true leadership is... The person have to groom the downline as a reliable entreprenuer, manager and such... And the person too, have to make sure that their downlines dont go astay...</p>
              <p>Its actually the same thing... Even if an employee of the co, quit, the co. too lose a potential profit from him/her... In mlm, a person salary does depend on his downlines, similarly a company profit depends on his sales team etc...</p>

              <p>I believe that respect is earned, not made. Will people respect u for who u are, not for what u have? In a realist world, yes, everything is about money.

              <p> </p>
              <p>All MLMs should change their tactics. As in life, not everyone will get what they want. Not everyone will achieve that "5 figure pay" some MLMs rave about. Not all will achieve that. Only a minority will. You might want to feedback to your uplines about this. In sales public image is very impt. No underhand, unethical tactics, no half lies.</p>

              <p>As you have said in your 2nd point, SOME agents not all... These unethical agents dont make it very far and then they quit and again, blaim it on the co. ...</p>
              <p>The last point, I have to disagree... i believe that everyone has a chance in accomplishing something great in VE... Those who cant are the quitters...</p>

              <p>Ok, wat i believe is not all people who join VE can be successful in VE. If u r the so thick skinned type, then maybe u can be the successful bunch of them like Mr Dewey, Mr Steven and alot more of them..... </p>
              <p>When I joined VE, i thought i can be successful too... But saying is always easier than done. If u r willing to work the extra mile, making appoinments even at 4am, by all means go ahead.... A person in VE told me, in VE u can earn 20K in less than 6  mths... But that person has never achieve it til now... And still working til late hrs...</p>
              <p>For me i'm thankful wif my current job. The money tat i earn including my bonus, i'm enable to save and reach closer to that amount in 12 mths. It might be a slower process but i achieved it.... But not the VE agent who told me earlier. Every person knows their own capabilities... If u think VE is your stepping stone towards success then go ahead, join the company... Be prepared for the obstacles ahead of u... For those who dun, no worries.. There's still plenty of opportunities out there...</p>

              <p>Ok, wat i believe is not all people who join VE can be
              successful in VE. If u r the so thick skinned type, then maybe
              u can be the successful bunch of them like Mr Dewey, Mr Steven and
              alot more of them..... </p>
              <p>When I joined VE, i thought i can be successful too... But
              saying is always easier than done. If u r willing to work the extra
              mile, making appoinments even at 4am, by all means go ahead.... A
              person in VE told me, in VE u can earn 20K in less than 6
               mths... But that person has never achieve it til now... And
              still working til late hrs...</p>
              <p>For me i'm thankful wif my current job. The money tat i earn
              including my bonus, i'm enable to save and reach closer to that
              amount in 12 mths. It might be a slower process but i achieved
              it.... But not the VE agent who told me earlier. Every person knows
              their own capabilities... If u think VE is your stepping stone
              towards success then go ahead, join the company... Be prepared for
              the obstacles ahead of u... For those who dun, no worries.. There's
              still plenty of opportunities out there...</p>

              <p>yes. however the problem is that the agents themselves promise their downlines that they would definetely be successful as long as they work hard, which is very untrue..</p>

              <p>Success isn't all about money.</p>
              <p>Respect is not what you have but what you do. Money? Respect? Its not how much money you have, its what you do with it which gains you true respect.</p>
              <p>You're "rich", and spend all the money on cars, drinking, showing off, taking photos of yourself with notes of money? Respect? PUI. It's utterly shameless and useless. Donate money to charity, help the poor, stay humble? Now that's how one should act. See Gates and Buffett. They're very humble and low profile individuals.</p>
              <p>Success = money? In the end of the day, you have a wallet full of money. But when ppl asks what had you achieved what are you going to say? "I've achieved $XXXX in sales?", "I've got XXX rank"?. Why are you in MLM in the first place. Are you truly interested in sales? Or is it purely for the money? Life in blind pursuit of money normally won't end up bringing true happiness.</p>
              <p>What's most important in life is to pursue your true dream. Lets say there's no such thing in the world as money. What job will you do? Answer that and you've found yourself your true calling.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not everyone can pursue their true dream. Even you are not doing mlm, you still need to feed yourself and your family and cope with the standard of living. I know of people who are interested in something but end up taking a different course in poly or uni because they will prefer something that can help them get a substainable income in the future. Money is still a important part in selecting your career path. That's in our mind but sometime we don't acknowledge it. Take for example, if one day poly graduate earn more than uni graduate, do you think there are still people going to uni?</div>

              <p>What was your initial intention in selling the products to those person that you know? Was it to benefit the person, so that they will be in good health? If given a chance, would you let them have the product at a cheaper price (or rather as cheap as possible)? Or would you still think that i should be given "referral fee" for introducing such product to you. To put it simply, do u agree that what you earn is actually from the person pocket? Of course, it's too grey an area to say that it's wrong. I won't say that it's wrong. You are in control of the price now. You can choose to lower the price, even to the extent whereby you don earn anything (or best still, to get the product over the net), so that the person will have the "maximum" benefit (or rather the person will have less to lose). Would you do so?</p>
              <p>No doubt, mlm is a great way of earning money. But i'm certain that you're aware that where your money come from. Money don't just appear... It comes from somebody pocket, and that somebody may have worked extremely hard for it. Take a look around you when you go into a shopping or food centre the next time round. (Maybe those who are cleaning the tables, i admit i'm stating the extreme case). If you say that you would lower the price to those you know very well, your families and relatives, i believe your downlines would also want to do so. Because they have feelings for their family members... Would u cut your commission for them? Or u would choose to sell them at the price...</p>
              <p>If the above two are to occur, where will your "salary" comes from? So... what's your choice? And maybe knowing that, we can then discuss about the respect and other stuffs.</p>
              <p>P.S If given a choice, i believe all of us would agree that cashiers (salaried workers without commission) working in NTUC will want to lower the price of the goods, but they do not have the power to do so.</p>
