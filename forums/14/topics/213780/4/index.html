            <div class='col-md body'>I'm with TIBS on this one. I'm a living testimony of the 'admin/office job' misleading scam. Besides that, I did mentioned during my 2 hr stay in VE, I noticed at least 10 other poly grads who are under the impression that they're applying for an admin job, which could only mean their recruiters tell them the same misleading piece of info that I received.<br><br>And further besides that, the blog references and other living testimonies in this forums account for at least double digit count as well. Obviously something is wrong here. I mean... those 16 yr old young uns fresh from O Lvls wouldn't possibly know how to talk like a professional recruit agent, quoting all the humbalaba science terms (biomedical etc etc), then tell the EXACT SAME job offer.<br><br>Obviously there's someone more manipulative and cunning behind the scenes. Maybe it isn't u, corwin, but it could be someone higher, the 'seniors' that lead the training lectures, who taught them this. Which u probably would be in the dark anyway unless u're some big shot in the company.<br><br>As for the profit margin, I'm in no way to judge since I dun do business. But to a consumer's pt of view, it's really damn steep. If I knew u guys would be making such profit, I wouldn't buy it even if it's damn gd. So I guess only loved ones trying to support u MLMers and less well-informed ppl would buy ur products. But since everything that involves profits would be shaded in grey... *shrugs*</div>

Quite a good location because it's near to MRT station and there are loads of buses plying there.<br><br>2) At first I thought it feels like warehouse area to me, but apparently it doesnt after looking at the map. Because warehouses should be in industrial estate areas.<br><br>3) It's not wrong to move location. It's more important the convenience you bring to customers who'll come down to your office to pick up stuff. Isnt the CBD area a nice area for everyone? Why the move?<br><br>Why so critical? Obviously you have not studied business before. Location is an essential criteria. It matters that customers find it convenient to visit your premises and it's not critical. What the, and you're a businessman.<br><br>4) Most definitely. At least I wont see as many male 'executives' kiaokah at lau pa sat and think the whole place is theirs.<br><br>And corwin_2k, it's not good looking down on people by laughing at us. It gives me a even more horrible impression of you people.<br><br>==<br><br>If you guys can tell me the Pros of being in Venture Era. Why not tell me the Cons too. Dont tell me Venture Era is so godly enough you guys dont have anything bad to say about VE. Hahahahaha.</div>

Do they sell buses through multi-level marketing? I dont think so.<br><br>Of course, people wont bother because they are driving CARS. What has buses got to do with them?<br><br>Secondly. Some MLMers are also not educated on BUSINESS as well and they talk their way through COCK as though they really know SO MUCH about business. One of the bus enthusiasts from our community is also in the multi-level marketing business as well, <strong>TIB1062Y</strong>. What do you want to derive from here?<br><br>Thirdly. Of course, why would money-minded people bother about other things around us? All you need to worry is how much you'll earn from your sales etc. If you people think you guys really care about our people's health. It's more of causing more heart attacks by telling them that your products are sold at such high prices. $1600++?</div>

VE is started by previously top SDMs from astral mag some years back. They then had major disagreements with astral mag boss raymond lim, and hence brought their whole group out and started VE. Now, they're just neighbours with their rival's old office. Nothing wrong, but talk about irony. Maybe when you bluff people down, you can use the same old coffee shop that astral mag people used to use. That coffee shop's vege rice is not bad, if they had not shifted.<br><br>Anyway, shifting to a more ulu place just means it's harder for your people to prospect people.<br><br>Distributor "Hi.

I heard that, they have a very very old BMW as a company car to use. When I went down sometime back, they are saying that they are using that as an incentive. Sounds like an idea too but too bad its an old car. But would that just means that they are also having other cars for their senior to drive?</div>

Secondly, take a look at the defination of "centralised". Tt word does not mean center of Singapore. tt means..toa payoh. but "centralised" has lots of meaning in the business terms.<br><br>The thing is i am not pinpointing the scrutiny of the word "centralised" (well, you did) but all I am saying is, it is definately not a good idea to open a network marketing office and retail counter at let's say tuas...or changi airport. I hope your "research" goes further then the scrunity of words cause, at CBD or eunos, it looks like VE is getting bigger number of distributors and bigger sales turnover, so don't be too happy tt they can go bankrupt tmrw yea?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And in repliance to the cars....gosh, little did i know the "heard tt VE pple's...."

I'll give you a heads up to ure critics, there is always dog pooh every morning at the side road of our office. Man, tts the end of Venture Era.

I am a roach magnet. Man...tts really the end of Venture Era. You see, I never took a bath in 70 days tts why....so Venture Era has one smelly dude walkin around the office....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>okok..enough joking, well abt the cars.. (do I have to reply to everything)....yes, it is a simple reasoning of registration of car with license. You cannot register your car without license. ok? and about old BMWs, let me just ask, did you see new ones? or were you blind to new ones. Of course if u knew BMW models, 2004 n 5 models are launched during those years n obviously they belong to the 03 n 04 car achievers. N believe me when i say they can change their cars but even I wouldnt cause if you ever bought a BMW or a car for tt matter, you would be pretty careful when u would sell ure car, for monetary reasons. Now, the next person who would ask why Venture Era pple do not change their underwears or why they don't register under another person's name, let me just answer u now....it's their problem.<br><br>peace to all tt i haf offended but really, talk to me abt concrete business stuff, it will make sense, come up with a hypothesis w/o using ure heads first, really shows ure lack of aptitude.</div>

Secondly, take a look at the defination of "centralised". Tt word does not mean center of Singapore. tt means..toa payoh. but "centralised" has lots of meaning in the business terms.<br><br>The thing is i am not pinpointing the scrutiny of the word "centralised" (well, you did) but all I am saying is, it is definately not a good idea to open a network marketing office and retail counter at let's say tuas...or changi airport. I hope your "research" goes further then the scrunity of words cause, at CBD or eunos, it looks like VE is getting bigger number of distributors and bigger sales turnover, so don't be too happy tt they can go bankrupt tmrw yea?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  </div></blockquote>nice usage of Word.<br><br>smart networkers look into details as well. to play around with Words is to lead the readers to the place that the writer wants.<br><br>you said to me in your old office that it's easily accessible if it's in the central of Singapore. and at that moment, you said with pride. but come to think of it, it doesn't tally with what you're saying.<br><br>nice usage of words, but example wise, it will only be sufficient to trick or lead people who are slightly at basic level of understanding.<br><br>in your example, it's not a strong example.<br>Toa Payoh, in map wise, considering exact arces size of Singapore, maybe it is central of Singapore.<br><br>But central area of singapore in general terms have different meaning depending on the nature.<br><br>if let's say i'm talking about Business Wise, of course it will only be wise to go Raffles Place since all the major establishments are set up over there.<br><br>but if i'm talking about residential side, than Toa Payoh is the place, as it's packed with people no doubt that's 1st point.<br><br>2nd point - it's connected to the neighboring areas  and are easily accessilbe to other parts of Singapore.<br><br>now if i were to talk in terms of Shopping - the centralized location will be Orchard and Somerset. Reason - simple, prime shopping centres located there, lots of shopping centres, thus it's the central of shopping area.<br><br>depending on the nature that you're looking at, than it'll be a different story.<br><br>since you're dealing with MLM, of course being in Central is good, as for other places, i decline to comment so as not to tarnish any mlm companies' reputation and also to safeguard my professionalism.<br><br>basically when you mention Changi or Tuas; that goes without saying, it's at the edge of Singapore thus nobody would go there. from LOGIC - it goes without saying, it will not attract a lot of people to go there if not for the nice food ) changi<br><br>Since your nature of Business is MLM, having said that, it involves people to travel from all different parts of Singapore to the current VE location. Thus it will only be LOGICAL to find a place to be in the central which is easily accessible to other people/agents/prospects/clients are well.<br><br>i'll continue next time. too sleepy as of this time. get back later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>well, ure point being?<br><br>Like I told u, it is important to have a centralised location. That is true. Nobody said CBD was a bad area. In my earlier posts, I mentioned the company took due consideration into the location. It seems opinions of customers and agaents were taken into account and ascessibility wise, our current location was much convinient. After 2 months shift, agents n customers alike seem to have no complaints compared with the CBD expensive entry routes and parking spaces.<br><br>Really, I find it funny that you seem to be making a personal grudge againts my company as if the location of the company will cause so many agents and customers to leave venture era and competitors see it as a downfall of my company. Understanding u r from a company LFI which location-wise seems to be way off "centralised" as you call it, I don't see any adverse effects that will ruin your company am I right to say that? So if pinpointing a company's location is a big decision to criticise, remember one thing, although location can be a great asset to a company, especially MLM companies, it takes time to open new branches n HQ. As the business grows, Im sure many MLM companies would become like Great Eastern n AIA whereby their offices are spread with the demand of the market.<br><br>So, I did not twist any use of words cause I did not claim in my forum here tt CBD was bad, in fact, it is a great location for venturing businesses but due to target traffics considerations, businesses experts will tell you that our current location will do great. and of course many other reasons I am disclosed to tell. I hope none of your comments are personal. And correct me if I am wrong that u are still in LFI.<br><br>Corwin</div>
