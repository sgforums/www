              <p>Do you or anyone get any benefits from winning? Or like lionnoisy, does he gain anything from posting all the things on Oz?</p>
              <p>So what if he's wrong. So what if he misinterprets. At the end of the day, it benefits no one, except him if you managed to point out that he's wrong after spending time to scour the net for info. He learns, and he absorbs new info.</p>

              <p>Personally, I dont't want to sue you... Why not we go out and have some coffee 1st, I know a great place that brew great tasting coffee...

              <p>About your thread about choosing to quit or not to quit, The thing is, doing traditional business is very tough nowadays... I am not saying that you should not quit your science course, but what is the point pursueing a business dip and degree instead? It is very risky to maintain traditional business... What if you FAIL? I can intro you to a better business system that carries little risks... You don't even need capital, just time commitment would do...</p>
              <p>How about this, why not I give you my friendster, and you can add me 1st... And we'll exchange info and have a little chat then?</p>

              <p>I have given you many opprtunities in this forum to apologise... Not just that, I've tried to save you from your sure to be doomed business... Don't ask me how, you know that traditional business is risky and you need capital... Where are you going to get it?</p>
              <p>I don't know you, you don't know me, but I feel that we can be good friends... You were like me a few years ago... Ambitious and all, but then, I found a great way that is low risks and can bring you far...</p>
              <p>I told you NOT to expose my info on the forum... I may have to consult my lawyer about this too... Don't worry that letter will come!!!</p>
