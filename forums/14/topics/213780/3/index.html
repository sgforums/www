Why does MLMs survive while the rest of the businesses suffer during the declination period(e.g SARS) is becos the staff are trained to be motivated to fight on.

That is why it is a job market questionairre, to access are you worthy enough to be a businessman and such. Then we can LEAD you to develop tt. duh.

NOT PICKING OUT STRANGERS FROM THE STREETS)<br>but i am offended by the word , sweet talking mouth... it's true that some of us like to use sweet talkings or twisting words to get people but then it isnt all of us .. so using that words on us is a bit too much..<br><br><blockquote>I still believe Venture Era is one of the better MLM but herein lies the problem, the girl who called promised me positions such as 'temporary admin worker, customer service'.

Then how come from blogs and everywhere around the internet, I keep seeing phrases like ENTREPRENEURS, BUSINESSMEN etc. Now tell me and clarify this again.<br><br>What exactly are you guys? Dont boast yourselves BIG when you guys are not. And I dont mean you, but your fellow VE distributors.<br><br>--<br><br>Secondly.<br><br>Are you sure you are not limited to anything? Then why do I hear that you guys have to achieve this quota by _(date)_ in order to get yourselves promoted? In a way you are still limited to something.<br><br>One of me friend is in this company and he said that he wants to achieve a car, blazer, PDA phone by Year 2008. I'm going to see how he do it with his hobbies lying around him and claiming around that his hobbies are excuses and obstacles to his success. Get a life you guys.<br><br>Your products may be good. But how about those people inside? Just because they are genuine in treating you downlines well doesnt mean they dont do it for a reason.</div>

Muz get me involved again after I 'retired' for sometime. Dun talk abt civilized when u can't even get ur spelling right. But I get ur pt, after sometime trying to decipher ur post.<br><br>U say that I generalized all u MLMers right? But coincidentally, the day when I went VE, almost 4-5 other newbies were under the impression that they're applying for a 8-5 admin job. So qiao meh? As I told enquiries before, the next time I hear my friends getting a phone call from VE promising admin job, I'll freaking hamtam that guy. No questions asked.<br><br>And u didn't get my main point. My main point was, my recruiter misled me into thinking that I would have an admin job. I've heard abt MLM b4 and I dun like it cos' I saw a friend became degenerate cos' of this industry. The problem is not whether I like or dun like MLM, the problem is I'm freaking fooled into thinking that it's a normal office company dealing with administration. If I knew it was MLM from Day 1, I wouldn't even bother stepping into the office.<br><br>In a sense, I can be considered a victim cos' I'VE BEEN LIED TO. But I'm not expecting anyone to pity me. Afterall, all I lost was 2 hrs of my time. What I'm doing is to create public awareness and also to knock some sense into those VEers to do their business with more ethics. So pls read properly first before replying or else I'm going to do another generalization on u MLMers... That only dumb and stupid ppl do MLM cos' they can't do anything else... I dun want to be so bad, k? Ciao!</div>

effects take my<br>family and relatives for instand...all feels immeadiate effects except for<br>some of my uncle and aunties...so overall the number of combines<br>families of both my parents side acummalate to 39 people..<br>out of 39..12 does not feel immediate effects..but felt the effect<br>after prolonged usage..so what i'm trying to say is that not every one<br>will feel the effects..(i'm using the travel size mattress as i'm typing cause<br>my back hurts too much..i sprained it at the gym)..<br><br>secondly..about how VE works...<br>to be honest with you guys...i think most of the people there<br>are too engrossed in their dream that they perform badly in their line..<br>its not wrong to have dreams..everyone has dreams..but remember that<br>towards a dream there are two routes to take..one is positive and the other<br>are the opposite..many VE people have taken the wrong route..all they care<br>is acheveing their dreams that they recruit people more to help them<br>in sales...but they never really help..instead  pressurized them<br>into doing sales...this is wrong...you guys never thought of their feelings..<br>that is why many left VE...help them..understand them..give solutions to their problems..not just work..personal problems too..you're the upline..you have to be respectable,caring..not being crazy on being promoted..heck i don't even care if i was'nt promoted...i rather not be promoted then see my downlines struggling with no one to help them..my manager place two queen mattress under me to help me promote(to increase my quota)..that is why i respect him...now how much are you willing to do something like that..no i'm not asking you to be a hero or something...just a little will do..guide them not brag to to them how you acheive that position..and to the the downlines of VE<br>if your uplines ask you to do something..like for exp. calling people down to meet them and they give you a phone technique or what so ever...and you can't seem to get anyone to come down...stop doing what you are doing right now..if it doesn't work means it will never work..don't always follow blindly...what..don't tell me that you belive in the slogan..'every rejection will bring you closer to acception'..what..wait for 100 people to reject you then you get one positive one...think about this..ther are many more ways you got to learn to become a true mlm person...and sadly the managers too are not ready why...they promoted too fast to learn the real way of doing buisness..i got a downline who was ill...he asked me he will go back to the office in two days...but  i said no...i told him to take two week or more days off..i don't care what my manager says or scolds..heck i rejected thier calls most off the time..i'm not going to let my downline going to the office sickly..what if somethings crops up and his condition became worse..whose going to answer..have a heart...don't think about yourself only..your downlines are not slaves...and a real mlm company is all about being slave free from the government and others..think about it...<br><br>VE products are unique and it works(i've been cure of insomia..and about time too!!)...<br>its not a scam...but you guys don't do the job the proper way thus blacklisting the company name...managers and uplines are pressurizing the downlines are now common in VE..stop doing so...one day your downlines are bound to quit...and remeber when they quit..they will have a negative thought on VE..and tell their friends about this company..how not to join this so on and so fourth..now i can see that the negative comments posted here all have connection with VE...through their families,friends or even themselves..this shows how badly you perform...a real mlm person would never let this happens...change and you will find yourself not just acheiving your dreams but becomes a better person... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"

for me to be a better mlm worker...thanks you guys..may god bless all off you.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">

(correct me if i'm wrong, since i'm referencing with what i've learnt years back)<br><br>Our body needs to be in a balanced mood, anything more or less will result in some effects or symptoms.<br><br>The Earth (which is the ground) gives me Negative ions<br>magnetic therapy - while many companies claim there's a lot of benefits for using magnetic therapy, i am puzzled by HOW MUCH of usage does a person really needs to have per day?<br><br>Balancing mood - (Example) It's being known as a fact that for every Kcal of calories that our body in-take, we will accumulate until a certain amount that it becomes a certain weight which adds onto the body weight. So we have to exercise accordingly to the amount of calories in-take that we take in extra (by which is surplus of what is left after deducting metabolism rate)<br><br>So if we were to need magnetic therapy (no doubt) but are we really getting the right amount? As we face a lot of Positive Ions' Infulence daily [from Computers to TVs to HPs, to PDAs, to Laptops and many electrical appliances, all we have are positive ions, which can be absorbed by our body, but cannot be passed off so it's being kept in our body. Thus we need Negative Ions  to keep our body in a balanced mood. - this brings me to another question - do the magnetic therpay series of products really have positive effects on us?<br><br>If we have a lot of positive ions, than we ought to have negative ions (which is why It's Advisable for people to exercise in nature (subjective - just exercise in gym &amp; nature to compare and see which one feels better - i feel recharged although i'm tired after exercising in nature (due to fresh air and nearer to the soil, source of negative ions and maybe netural ions), but not gym; quite a bit of difference)<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Question No 1</strong></span> - How much/How long do we need to use the product on a daily basis to get our body to be in a balanced mood?<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Question No 2</strong></span> - Are the magnetic products giving the positive or negative ions to keep our body in a balanced mood ; which is better for our body?<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Question No 3</strong></span> - Some company are only giving 1 side of the magnetic ions - either North or South, whereas one company offers a balanced side [alternate] magnets of different poles N &amp; S respectively.<br><br>Should the magnetic therapy products only provide 1 direction be it either North or South or should it provide a balanced one which is 2 direction like having both North and South?<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclaimer:</span></strong> the questions that i post as per above are only some queries that i have after going to different companies which offers magnetic therapy.<br><br>as for the information on Negative, Positive &amp; Netural Ions which i watched from Documentary Years Ago, maybe it might be my mistake that i rememeber wrongly or anything, but it makes logical sense to strike a balance. Thus I'm only asking the questions just to clear my doubts and not to pin-point any company/companies down.<br><br>agents from various different companies may want to consider and think about the real effectiveness of the products.<br><br>Lastly I wished that you guys (regardless of what company - as long as in mlm than counted already) really understand the products and the related information so as to clear the doubts of consumers thus only than will we as mlm agents of various different companies able to sercure a market share, since we are dealing with different categories of products so there's no clash in market which is a healthy competition, growth and to be responsible agents of various different comapnies.<br><br>Happy New Year.<br>Huat Ar<br>Lol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe they love the walking distance to Changi Village for u-know-what? Opsx :X Anyway, an acquaintance of mine juz got pulled into MLM. Yet another friend gone. He's usually quiet, and the times we spent together, we usually dun exchange much conversation, except for pleasantries and the occassional concern abt each other's lives.<br><br>We lost touch abt 3 mths back, then out of the blue, he msged me again. At that point, I thought he's a man who cares abt each and every small friendship afterall. Yet, the 2nd msg went like this "Would u like to invest 100 to 1000 dollars in my company?". Then I knew he got pulled into MLM. I replied and my suspicions were proven true. How easy it is to tell MLMers apart from norm business nowadays.<br><br>What shocked me was his insistence to prove MLM is legit and profit making.

Coming out from a teenager..<br>Ooo, dammit!! goosebumps..<br>I had a friend who wanted to borrow 15k from me to join Belair while i was serving NS..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Well, he was into adulthood and yet was "brainwashed". i suppose thats not the right word, greed is more appropriate in this context.. Age may play a part, but whether to join or not to, ultimately depends on the person's own perception. There are suckers of all ages out there right?<br><br>Anyway, MLM is a legit scheme but not all MLM companies are legit..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True true... Suckers come from every age group... But most of the 'victims' come from the age grp 16-18, fresh out of sch, looking for job, more or less haven't had a reality check at such a young age, and impressionable. It's indeed weird to hear teenagers talk abt high-end philopsophies when 3 mths back when u knew them before they got into MLM, their speeches were still littered with Hokkien profanities...<br><br>Another group of ppl MLM companies target is army personnel, NSF and regulars alike. In this case, it's more of greed that overcome their logical thinking. Being at least 18-20 yrs of age, they should have at least some analytical instincts to discern. Guess that the testimonials of 'successful MLMers being managers at a young age of early 20s and earning a sports car' got to their head.<br><br>The human nature is universally same and never changing, that is, never satisfied with what we have at present, we always seek more. For ppl sucked into MLM, they juz have that abit more ambition and desire to do so. It's a vicious cycle, so here I'm juz imploring MLMers to lead the young newbies properly. Keep that ambition alive but dun let it turn into greed or allow the MLM business erode ur principles and morals.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess nothing can change the mindset of some of u guys here. Well, thanks 4 ure discussions, for those really willing to discuss more about business and making money professionally in the network marketing world. and thnx for all those that understood my response to VE's defense.<br><br>Well yea, nice office at changi road, comfortable and well-contented. Hope the expansion can help me and my distributors see growth in facilities for their businesses.<br><br>Location, great as well, well unless everything that VE do is critical to some of you, which your opinions are mostly free of charge and not like you are someone imnportant to listen too anyway, so your comments definately provacative, but not interested.<br><br>I wish all in good faith for building wealth and prosperity in Network Marketing industry and happy new year. Yep, Ill be closing my account due to the fact I only intended to defend my company that have made me contribute to my family's financial being and given me more freedom and understanding about sales and business and of course, the importance of health, BUT however, I cannot stop many out there whom without even money in their pockets or a little matured brain in them provoke and make stupid baseless comments for the fun of it. I donno, jealousy or childishness, maybe both but I wish everyone reading my earlier posts understand where I am coming from.<br><br>Being in a local company is all about pride of doing something that you cancultivate from your homeland and out of Singapore. I hope Venture Era do venture out of Singapore one day and I wish all local networkers the best, even networkers from international companies. Persevere, and work hard.<br><br>For all the "kids" out there. Hope this message is provocative enough for you to reply and brand yourself as one. I was hoping to have intelligent response from adults but looks like there were many young punks trying to behave like they are already multi0millionaires, idiotic ones. Sorry for the language, my bad. Happy New Year, ill close this account soon enough!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, Corwin. If you want people to shut up about this. PLEASE, tell your fellow distributors NOT TO LIE.<br><br>IS IT REALLY THAT DIFFICULT TO TELL THEM THEY ARE GOING TO BE <strong>MARKETING AGENTS ON PROBATION?</strong><br><br>REALLY. VENTURE ERA DISTRIBUTORS, STOP LYING TO YOUR FRIENDS THAT THEY ARE SOME.. ADMIN/OFFICE JOB LAH.<br><br>IT'S SALES, MARKETING OKAY?<br><br>HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY ISNT IT?<br><br>Is it really that scary to tell people anything about Venture Era?<br><br>Talking about defending the company. You people dont even BOTHER to explain anything about this stupid question from me. It's not the first time I've asked this question.<br><br>And oh. 190 Changi road was formerly Management Institute of Singapore's HQ.. Seems that Venture Era brought over the building from the school..<br><br><blockquote>Oh, yesterday, went out with _____, to went for this interview introduced by Liana. I thought it was <strong>some office/admin stuff</strong>, so I thought, "why not?", give it a shot.<br><br>Upon reaching our destination, I saw the company's name. Venture Era.<br><br>***DISCLAIMER***<br><br>If you're a Venture Era's employee, press alt+F4 NOW! Any consequences/feelings/actions felt or done after reading my post is strictly NONE OF MY BUSINESS!<br><br>To cut it short, its a MLM company (Multi-level Marketing).<br><br>You have a awesome and fairly cheap to produce product.<br>You buy alot.<br>You sell at a very high price, you earn.<br>You get friends 1 and 2 to join, provide free trainings and all, but a percentage of what they earn goes to you.<br>You ask friends 1 and 2 to get more friends, 1 gets 3 and 4, 2 gets 5 and 6, so a percentage of what 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 earns goes back to 1 and 2.

(perhaps a small fraction)</strong><br><br>AND, most of the time, the stuffs they sell cost more than a grand. And they would say the products (most of the time, health products), are beneficial, and you should introduce to family and friends FIRST about it. Basically, its like, they ask you to "cheat" your family and friends FIRST before others.<br><br>You sell the product to your dad, which, lets say, cost S$1500. You would recieve roughly S$50 as commission. Your "Boss" earns about 1k I guess?<br><br>It is legal lah, but.. that's not the, in my opinion, right way to do business lah. Just can't take it.<br><br>And ah, you NEVER know whether Venture Era can really be trusted.<br><br>MLM is the legal one, but Pyramid scheme is the illegal one.<br>MLM<br>Pyramid scheme<br><br>Read the above articles if interested.<br><br>Btw, I quote this from wiki,<br><br>The key identifiers of a pyramid scheme are:<br><br>A highly excited sales pitch (sometimes including props and/or promos).<br>Little to no information offered about the company unless an investor purchases the products and becomes a participant.<br>Vaguely phrased promises of limitless income potential.<br>No product, or a product being sold at a price ridiculously in excess of its real market value. As with the company, the product is vaguely described.<br>An income stream that chiefly depends on the commissions earned by enrolling new members or the purchase by members of products for their own use rather than sales to customers who are not participants in the scheme.<br>A tendency for only the early investors/joiners to make any real income.<br>Assurances that it is perfectly legal to participate.<br>Is it me, or do I see Venture Era doing MOST of this? Geez.<br><br>Ok, the MLM topic STOPS HERE. No tags on this topic is recommended.</blockquote>Seriously, it's not the right way in me opinion anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Honestly, I do understand the wrong marketing methods other distributors do in Venture Era but the thing is neither me nor the company teaches any of them. Every MLM company have their share of independent distributors whom chose to independently do things or say things that are wrong and dangerous creating a mass widespread of negativity just like you know telling pple its an admin job. Think abt this, no matter how much the company train and tell pple to say that this is "sales and marketing" how many distributors would have the tendency to trick their friends into admin/office job?<br><br>I tried explaining this earlier that my topic was "defending point of view" of THE COMPANY, not the distributors. I have been in Venture Era a year plus. I have seen Venture Era grow tremendously and creating many youth leaders, happy customers and good entreprenuers. I have also seen many people whom do not understand that honestly is important in business, an if its their own business, it will fail. THe thing is some dist. say or do things wrongly (not all) and the company is branded as bad. Its not only Venture Era's problem, is NM problem as a whole.<br><br>Venture Era has step up its notch to wider range of products, bigger office, getting older distributors (to have a balance in maturity) so that Venture Era wouls grow into the market share. It takes time, but Venture Era is making great progress in effectively marketing out our products.<br><br>So defending my company again, I wish to point out, the company does not tteach nonsese and always teach honestly. I try saying many times, but every now and then, many would see the faults of Venture Era and not the progress of it. The company is also educating and correcting distributors into their techniques of recruitment. There are lesser and lesser dist. going againts the rules nowadays. I am in the business world for 7 years now, nothing beats the concept of network marketing as a platform for business learning. Yes there still would be "kids" in Venture Era doing things againts the teachings of VE due to desperation. VE will outgrow these when it is big and branded one day. Just like big companies out there.<br><br>Hope you get where I am coming from. Anyway, lets for a second think of what if Venture Era dist. are clear and precise in their rec skills, what would you think of VE then? VE will do its best to train their dist. and majority are great showing good progress in the training.<br><br>And especially to TIB4whetver, you obviously are like one of my aunt whom one year later, regretting telling me "MLM all bullshit. pull pple buy product pull people, your up get alot of money, you get peanuts" cause today when she opened her own wholesale business, she understood terrificly what I mean, that the world of business revolves around distribution of profits. With lesser channels, more manipulation of profits. Either you dumbly be a solo-player in your business, or you network with other businesses to maximise leverage and increase profits. NM is direct-selling products and leveraging on business partners' market share.<br><br>Like it or not, it is not wrong thats why its legit. you either cry that it is like that, or you fight you way to the top of the market share. Read my earlier posts, everything is explained there. So understand what VE and NM really is first before you jump into conclusions why NM industry is so tarnished. To me, NM is less tarnished then years b4, each year after I see the rise in NM in the country.<br></div>
