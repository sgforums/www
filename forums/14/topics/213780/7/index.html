            <div class='col-md body'>Alessandro, I think u really need to brush up on ur English by ALOT. I read less than 30% of ur recent posts, and I doubt anyone bothered to read most of it either. Pls learn paraphrasing, and when u quote someone, just quote the main point and not the whole chunk of text. U wanna be an entrepreneur this way?

Becos pple're senstive 2 dis word called MLM."<br><br>STILL, it doesn't give them a right to LIE. Furthermore, VE doesn't rely on friend-to-friend recruitment. They somehow managed to secure a wide extensive network, to conduct phonecall recruitment. If it is so, it's considered a formal act of recruitment, and should be chargeable by law, for misleading potential recruits.<br><br>I dun care whether u deal with MLM, or underworld drugs, or gambling cruise, or whatever sh!t, honesty is still utmost priority. If u blatantly lie right from the start, how can I trust u guys as fellow 'entrepreneurs' or even 'working colleagues'?<br><br>I'm not sure what tactics Amway use, cos' I never kena before. But pls dun use another company to shield ur own company. Pls tackle the issue at hand, rather than trying to evade the topic by mentioning another company. I'd greatly appreciate it.

            <div class='col-md body'>This is just part of MLM's tactic to promote their products. Who don want to sell the products? They have 1000 ways to say things about the world. Am i right to say that? i want to sell you things, of course will boast about how great my product works and the demands in economy. Aiming at all the weak points of the family.<br><br>u're right in some ways.However,it's truth that the product're in demand as<br><br>majority of S'porean are beginning 2 be health-consciense.<br><br>In in the world of sales, no saleperson 'll tell U that their products're bad.<br><br>like doing fact finds. Finding out who in the family have illness and then persuading the family to get the product for their elderly. Am i right to say that? In the end, it is still money you VE/MLM are targeting at.<br><br>doing facts on family background is important.so that they can determine which product should suit them most,right??<br><br>agree that $$$ play a part.Osim n etc are also targeting at money.If u buy<br><br>any health products from osim n etc,they also make profits from it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alessandro, are u a numbskull or what? U're just repeating urself over and over again. CAN U STOP QUOTING UR DUMB OTO/OSIM EXAMPLE!? It's irritating me. And I'm reading lesser and lesser of ur posts each time u post. It's really incoherent and a total mess. Better to relax my brain than go thru ur gibberish.<br><br>I dun care whether or not MLM is a sensitive word to Singaporeans. The fact that VE is conducting official phonecall recruitment, means it has to be totally truthful and legal, or else it could be potentially sued to court. I HOPE U UNDERSTAND THIS POINT ABOUT LAW AND LEGALISM BEFORE U MENTION ONE MORE OF UR GIBBERISH ANALOGIES. And I shan't judge on Amway cos' I wasn't approached by them before, but pls stop quoting them. It's really dumb, and I mean really. Deal with ur own company's policies.<br><br>As to ur issue about VE having professional product consultant, please, I met ur 'managers' and ur 'presenters' before. I was expecting at least a slightly matured manager to speak to me. Can u imagine how insulted when this 'manager' came into the room and acted like some real boss, when he haven't even taste Tekong's soil la.<br><br>Ok la, maybe they aren't the 'professional product consultants' u are talking about. I dun care what titles u give urselves la. If they're so 'professional', why does VE rely on young punks to promote their products, instead of those 'professionals' to conduct a mass talk to promote ur products, as well as a positive image for ur company? Why are they hiding behind the scenes? Too professional to deal with us, is it?<br><br>Friend, it's time to learn the correct definitions of 'manufacturer', 'researcher' and 'distributor'. The 'researcher' came up with ur VE products, then he gives the manufacturing plan to the 'manufacturer', and then the final products go to VE, the 'distributor'. Pls, if VE researches its own products, I would have seen laboratories and factory lines in ur office, instead of a few 'bai swee' office space and alot of well-dressed young punks.<br><br></div>

Look, if u did proper research, yoiu should study neautralization and how it works. Yes there is neatralization being done..but relaxed, the body aint able to detect ionic calcium as alkaline so long as its fluid form. As it passes through your stomach, to your intestines, there will be so little fluid then that the body absorbs alot of ionic calcium into the intestine. Idiot...if stomach acid neuatralise all the alkaline why the hell are we eating fruits n vegatables?! won all the acid neutralise every single vitamins n minerals (wait! dont you know they flow in alkaline fluids? you don? stupid u..) that you wonder...god should haf put the intestine ahead of the stomach!<br><br>lol<br>corwin</div>
