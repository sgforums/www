            <div class='col-md body'>You guys just don't understand the quality of the magnetic mattresses.<br><br>You see, there's actually no real evidence that magnet therapy works (although Alex Chiu claims that his magnetic Immortality Rings allow you to live forever).<br><br>So most magnetic mattresses have actually no health benefits at all.<br><br>This problem was recognized so they had to make a magnetic mattress unlike any other. But how would they do this? There was only one answer.<br><br>Magneto.<br><br>In the 3 X-Men movies, Magneto showed his awesome power over magnetism. Only this power could be used to make the magnets that would be used in the mattresses.<br><br>Only after much negotiation did Magneto agree to help make a mattress for the good of all man and mutantkind.<br><br>This help did not come cheap though. Magneto has a whole Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to finance and manage. A profit sharing agreement was made with Magneto that resulted in a win-win for both Magneto, the customer and the mattress manufacturer.<br><br>True, the mattresses cost 3 times what competing mattresses cost, but it's worth it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alright. neutral point of view<br><br>-&gt; brand. they demean other brands with their NON-PROVEN WORKING items. an example would be diamond water, they say diamond water only filters the waters, and theirs can do this and that without any proof.<br>-&gt; why show off a car which is not fully paid for.. and not in your means to foot it? VE is super smart in a way that they use a car to tie down they employees.<br>-&gt; they insult other brands to make themselves outshine others? wtf? an example is SUN SHINE EMPIRE<br><br>i have heard of everything my self.. this is a neutral view... thirdly. they scam people to their office... can we sue them for wasting our time? if so lets cup money for a lawyer and then sue them together..<br>whatever i am saying is not slander. i HEARD THEM MYSELF</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>btw for the branding problem<br>YOU THINK VE CAN AFFORD THEIR OWN RND TEAM?? IF SO GIVE US PROOF... THIS IS A PIONEERING COMPANY... THEY CANT EVEN HAVE A PROPPER OFFICE WHATS RND?<br>FURTHER MORE.. if there is no rnd team. how can they make their own products?<br>they would usually buy it in mass from other mlms ... and then sell it to you... which is usually the price in the web. no point looking at brand. all of them HAVE ABOUT THE SAME PRICE.<br>people keep trying to say brand brand brand... they are the VE PEOPLE IN DISGUISE OF NORMAL PEOPLE HERE. why look at the brand... u buy fish balls from the market... got see brand 1? all brand price diff? eg... dodo fish balls 10cents each... then "VE GETABLE" another mlm buy from dodo and sells it at 10 dolars each.. saying it can make ur dick stronger.. more sexual stamina.. works like viagra... and can help u live 1 yr longer for each fish ball you eat.... would any sane people believe? this is just an example..</div>

              <p>oklorr... i caome foward and share my exprience..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember entering the trap form The New Paper classifieds... The ad so intresting '$300 in 1 week' i read it and without hesitation i go call. Haiyo at Eunos horr?? NWM lorr -i close 1 eye- since im gonna earn $300 in less than 7 days.</p>
              <p>So we met and all this, 1st 2nd day ok.. I don't like 3rd day.</p>
              <p>"Your phone sure have many contacts right, ok i want u to organise them"</p>
              <p>OOOOooo... y must they need my contacts for? My relatives mostly are lower than Middle income..  Then the calling start and everyone got their sweet excuse which make me bored. The next day onwards......................... i did not come!! haha..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i can say that i am impressed with their product, i wondered y most of u hate the way they sell.. U go create ur own company lorr and sell cheap2 10cent fishball rather than $10 at VE GETABLE -example from one of the reply -.. Then after opening ur company, drive a car Better than Maserati Gransport lorr!! think u guys so rich is it? -VE boss car if he have not change-.... Everyone has their tactic to survive and earn. U can't expect everyone to follow Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Richard Branson-my favourite- tactics of making money right. If many were to follow Bill Gates  there will be thousands of computer maker today and hundreds of os to choose from. Same applies to the others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore everyone has to make a living it is weather they got their audiance and result or not. Singapore is also increasing need of medical facilities as ageing population, quality and standard of life are increasing and they also contribute to Singapore economic.</p>

              <p>But i can say that i am impressed with their product, i wondered
              y most of u hate the way they sell.. U go create ur own company
              lorr and sell cheap2 10cent fishball rather than $10 at VE GETABLE
              -example from one of the reply -.. Then after opening ur company,
              drive a car Better than Maserati Gransport lorr!! think u guys so
              rich is it? -VE boss car if he have not change-.... Everyone
              has their tactic to survive and earn. U can't expect everyone to
              follow Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Richard Branson-my favourite-
              tactics of making money right. If many were to follow
              Bill Gates  there will be thousands of computer maker
              today and hundreds of os to choose from. Same applies to the
              others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore everyone has to make a living it is weather they got
              their audiance and result or not. Singapore is also increasing need
              of medical facilities as ageing population, quality and standard of
              life are increasing and they also contribute to Singapore
              economic.</p>

              <p>Just out of curiosity, what impressed you about their products?</p>
              <p>And I don't quite understand what you mean when you say "everyone has their tactic to survive and earn" and "everyone has to make a living it is weather they got their audience and result or not".  Are you saying that ethics don't matter as long as you get the results you want? The end justifies the means?</p>

              <p><strong>He did not say that ethnics dont matter</strong>, dont put words into his mouth. i think you are twisting the whole story.</p>
              <p>if you are questioning about ethnics, i think you should question on<strong> individual</strong> ethnics rather than on the company or industry level because there are many distributors running their network marketing business with sincerity and ethncis. you cannot be using one person or few to comment on the whole company or industry, it does not <strong>justify</strong>.</p>
              <p>secondly, when he is refering on the tactics, i think he is talking more on sales and marketing approach. we must understand that there are professional in sales and marketing, there are newbies too. their approachs are different and if we just bite on some newbies poor sales approach and condemn the whole company or industry, then i think thats very inmature.</p>
              <p>i also experienced poor sales approach, not just network marketing, but also in shopping centre etc. however, that doesnt stop me from buying or until the extend of pulling the whole company or the industry down because of that 1 person.</p>
              <p>of course, there are also very people who are very narrow minded with strong critics and inmature behaviour. Thats their own personalities and i have no comments on them.</p>
              <p>lastly, i think any kind of people can post in internet, so do i kids and young teen who dont know much, but they think they know alot. <strong>Empty vase make the most noise</strong>.. right?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>He did not say that ethnics dont matter</strong>, dont
                  put words into his mouth. i think you are twisting the whole
                  story.</em></span></p>
              <p>I did not understand what he was saying, which is why I asked him to
                  clarify. The impression I got from the two lines that I quoted was that the end justifies the means. I don't see how it was putting words in his mouth. I was quoting. Those were his words not mine.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">if you are questioning about ethnics, i think you should
                  question on <strong>individual</strong> ethnics rather than on the
                  company or industry level because there are many distributors
                  running their network marketing business with sincerity and
                  ethncis. you cannot be using one person or few to comment on
                  the whole company or industry, it does not
                  <strong>justify</strong>.</span></em></p>
              <p>I never said that individual ethics reflects on the company or industry. For example,a dishonest used car salesman does not make the used car industry unethical. However, there was a time when it was true that most used car salesman were dishonest. This is because the industry was structured in a way where dishonesty was rewarded. Used car salesmen were rewarded for making the sale by any means possible. New salesmen were taught the"tricks of the trade" of how to con unsuspecting buyers.</p>
              <p>So I am not saying that I feel MLMs are bad because of the actions of a few bad apples. What I am saying is that MLM concept as practiced by most companies is a fundamentally flawed business model. Because the model is fundamentally flawed, only dishonest people can succeed in (success defined as what was promised when the person was introduced to the MLM) the company. Honest people, once they find out the truth about what they are involved in, tend to leave. Dishonest people, and people who are self-delusional, tend to stay.</p>
              <p>Sure, there is perhaps a mythical MLM company somewhere that conducts business in an ethical manner. However, I believe that because MLM is a flawed model, that company will fail unless at some point, it leaves it's MLM roots behind.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>secondly, when he is refering on the tactics, i think he is
                  talking more on sales and marketing approach. we must understand
                  that there are professional in sales and marketing, there are
                  newbies too. their approachs are different and if we just bite on
                  some newbies poor sales approach and condemn the whole company or
                  industry, then i think thats very inmature.</em></span></p>
              <p>I understood "tactics" as the sales and marketing approach as well. I think it is well documented that we are not talking about some newbies taking an unethical approach here. We are talking about the whole organisation intentionally deceiving new prospects.  I also have personal, first-hand knowledge because I have attended many MLM talks.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>i also experienced poor sales approach, not just network
                  marketing, but also in shopping centre etc. however, that doesnt
                  stop me from buying or until the extend of pulling the whole
                  company or the industry down because of that 1 person.</em></span></p>
              </div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I've already addressed the issue that the actions of one person does not reflect on the company or industry.</p>
              <p>However, I will say that if a company finds that its employee is intentionally misleading people, the employee will likely get fired. Does this happen in MLMs?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>of course, there are also very people who are very narrow minded
                  with strong critics and inmature behaviour. Thats their own
                  personalities and i have no comments on them.</em></span></p>
              <p>One should have an open mind. But never so open that your brains fall out.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">lastly, i think any kind of people can post in internet, so do i

                  right?</span></em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The internet is a great equalizer because anyone can post their opinions - even people who don't know much. However, ideas and opinions stand and fall on how well they are argued and the evidence presented.</p>
              <p>Just because someone is able to elucidate their ideas and opinions does not make the person an "empty vessel".</p>
              <p>In other words, an empty vessel can potentially make a lot of noise, but it is also possible that there are a couple of marbles in there clanking around.</p>

              <p>Eh VE dun create or manufacture their stuff, they are just distributors.</p>
              <p>But I really hate them for trying to recruit young people as young as O level grad, who cant even decide which course to go for, and here we have people trying to distort their future. And I really detest how u play with my feelings about earning big money early so that I can let my father retire early so that he can enjoy life....</p>
