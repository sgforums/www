              <p>FIY, I am the one who said fleeing race... So how is it that i use 'others' words? Kudos to you for being sooo smart for calling me a copycat for that one post... You sooo smart(sarcastic)</p>
              <p>Have you ever sued anyone? I dont think so... SO WHAT MAKES YOU THE EXPERT in court proceedings? Are you a lawyer? Any family members lawyer?</p>
              <p>an yes... I did sell loads of products to many customers incl. my relatives...</p>
              <p>And what if you dare say something? So? Do you really know what's gg on? Of course not... You just someone on the SIDE that knows NOTHING and wants to comment on things you know NOTHING about... Would you know if pagan911 gave me his no. to discuss on the current situation??? You know nothing yet you act as if you know things... haiz</p>

              <p>oh can i sue you for slandering my mum then? fyi my family has a dedicated lawyer whom we pay a fixed ammount to the law firm every month so sueing you could be very simple... but again.. that lawyer only helps us deal in our properties so.. i am not sure and would not want to waste my time to sue you for just your 10k... which might not even be enough for the proceedings</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw.. in my school i have already told my lecturer about this plan and is going to most probably do it during the holidays... why else would i make the find-4-u.blogspot.com for no reason? infact we are not targetting VE only.. we are targetting all the mlms in singapore... which is what i told my lecturer but the main plan is to target VE..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>really? gave u his number? ooh.. you and your false comments again.. i guess he wont be dumb enough to do so..</p>
              <p>you were slammed in your other forum and now.. u want to bring everything here.. many people call u part of the fleeing race and maybe you yourself admit to it.. then because of the lack of creativity and such.. you bring everything here.. and use the exact same words people use on u back on them...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway eagle.. do you even think she would even sue that person? i guess nope.. maybe what she sue is a 15 year old boy..</p>
              <p>I AM NOT STATING THE FACT ABOUT YOU SUEING ANY ONE FOR ANYTHING IN THAT POST&gt;... you are laughing at his english? double standard again i must say... for one reason.. you have just prooved that ve personals are inconsistant with what they say..</p>
              <p>oh well... looking forward for my teacher to choose my plan and implement it.. bb =D</p>

              <p>Just my 2cts worth,</p>
              <p>1)  I believe the MLM business model works, but the general public might not be able to accept it. It also depends on the way how your company projects itself, how they recruit new members.  Having said that, i have friends who succeed in MLM and others who have failed.  Personally, i have been invited to Network marketing/MLM since i was still studying.  Even though i believe in the business model, i just don't feel right gaining from my downline.  That's why when my friends invite me to talks and to their office, i willingly oblige but at the end of the day, its guilt that keeps me from joining in.  Especially when i know there are people who throw in money but have not profitted from it.<br><br>2)  I agree that some black sheeps might cause all the ruckus for VE/SE or whatever it is called BUT the company have to be responsible for who it is recruiting.  You do not just take any <em>ah mao</em> or <em>ah kow</em> happily as long as he buy your product or go to your talk or is he your best friend.  My Amway friend already gave up recruiting me but something he told me let me think back, :"not just askinng you to join this company, if you like you can just try the products.  We do not have advertisement and distributors like Walmart or other companies that's where we cut down costs."  Its that its the only way to compete with Walmart, by keeping the money within the MLM company and using all your own products.</p>
              <p>But when i look at the price... Sorry still a long way from Walmart...  A word of caution if you are trying to join MLM, do take note how/who you approach to recruit or promote your product.  My friend from Amway was a close friend in JC but when he 1st joined, he called all of us(his classmates) .  I felt sad when during our gathering he wasn't here and a friend asked," XXXX is not here?  Did he call you regarding blah blah blah"   and someone replied, " I better not answer his calls."  That was when i hope he was there to see how his sales tatics could affect his relations.</p>
