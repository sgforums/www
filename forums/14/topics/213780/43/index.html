              <p>Oh well, that's just your opinion...</p>
              <p>Anyways, I am not 'other' agents... So dont associate me with them... If they want to preach about being friends bla bla bla... Then its them, not me... I made it clear to my prospects that I am not going to be their good/best friend whatsoever... They are just my business associates... That's all.... If they want to be friends, than it's outside of VE....</p>
              <p>If they quit for their own passion and dreams then so be it... I call them loser... So? Does it change anything? No... So why dwell so much on it?</p>

              <p>You see, that's the outrageous patterns of this world, where people strive to achieve great success, drive luxurious cars, want the best of everything in this fallen world. It's not wrong to be rich and have lots of wealth, but won't it be very idolatry when we put monetary issues our main priority? I mean, do we really need those great success, do we really need to drive those luxurious cars like BMW, Mercedes, SLK, Lexus, etc...?</p>
              <p>I apologize if I strike the nerves of the distributors in VE. But I'm just sharing my side of the story. Yes, in my point of view, I prefer thinking twice before spending, cuz I learn how to prioritize my needs over my 'wants'. In this world, there's no end to earning money, even if one distributor builds his organization so big that his downlines are earning money for him. I mean, so what? Can you bring  all that you've achieved in this world when you're on your death bed? Or should I say, could one bring his achievements into the grave/tomb after he passed on?</p>
              <p>It's good to have challengers like network marketers like you guys. I'm just sharing some pointers, for the benefit and convenience of those who despise the Multi-Level Marketing industry.</p>
              <p>Is there a way to bring back the positive reputation of Multi-Lvl Marketing, such that people who hear of this industry would not be turned off, and having negativity spread to them, turning their back against this industry? Cuz I believe people outside seemed to have a negative view of Multi-Lvl Mkting, basically because their impression is 'pull-people in', 'ask people buy things'. Some even thought that Multi-lvl marketing is pyramid selling, which is, of course, not true, since I was once a distributor in VE, and have learnt the distinction between the two. I'm not siding on anyone here. I'm being a neutral party.</p>

              Then its them, not me... I made it clear to my prospects that I am
              not going to be their good/best friend whatsoever... They are just
              my business associates... That's all.... If they want to be

              <p>If they quit for their own passion and dreams then so be it... I
              call them loser... So? Does it change anything? No... So why dwell

              <p>Ah I get your stand now. I agree at times we must draw the line. I've seen my share of false friendliness at enyouth. Better than falsifying friendships to build trust just to earn money from them.</p>
              <p>Change your attitude. I might suggest. Don't disgrace your company. Every salesperson is an embassador to his/her company. Calling ppl loser will only adversly affect your reputation as someone who's proud and looks down on those who don't "succeed". to the point of calling them loser.  Will this change anything? If you stop calling people such, your reputation would be better. Of cos its your personal choice I cant stop you.</p>

              <p>The agents resort to hard selling and "retaining" people in the office, not letting them go off. It's the agent's fault, and don't blame the media/forum posters/etc for the state VE is in now.</p>
              <p>Lets say the company/organisation is 100% clear, transparent, ethical and honest. No one would say bad about the tactics. BUT if some ppl start tricking others down, use lowly tactics, etc don't say "our reputation is so bad cos some of them say bad things abt us". Ultimately, why do ppl say bad things abt the organisation, because simply, there IS something bad abt the operation procedures. Better rectify it.</p>
