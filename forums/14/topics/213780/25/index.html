              <p>Long time since I've been here... FTR I am still in VE and to elementalangel, I am in the light :p.. VE do not sell water, but the ionic calcium. Chittybang, pls do not judge a certain product by only sitting for a mere few hrs during presentation and not know the whole thing about the product..same goes to you EA ( debate a lot bout this b4 )</p>

              <p>i was inside once. </p>
              <p>i just heavily question the enthics of the company. if u are
              inside... u definately know there are 5 golden bull rules u have to
              follow.</p>
              <p>how many of the BGMs are in a BGR relationship. how does this
              impact the people below. a few examples. bluevo and falcon?
              hehe//</p>
              <p>to Whitesoul_reaper... do u know why house of blue has so little
              active BGMS? do u think u can secure a future in the company? how
              many dollars have u earned from there? and how many ppl are u gonna
              lie to that u earn by the thousands? so what if ur suprerior's are
              driving big cars? i know u feel glad playing a part in the montly
              installments.</p>
              <p>How many car achievers owe the company by tens of
              thousands??</p>
              <p>i wont make such daring statements if i dont have substantial
              evidence..</p>
              <p>most IMPT. whats with the bull shit about " we are a
              corresponding member of CASE. and in our 8 or so years of
              operations. we have never received a complaint"</p>
              <p>if u dare to say that. i will make a trip down to eunos and
              prove u wrong.</p>

              <p>What 5 golden rules?</p>
              <p>All I know is agents are taught to use trickery, hard persuasion and detention to hold you in their office.</p>

              <p>I wont be surprised, some agents have complete lack of ethics. Claims company each them alot... apparently they didn't teach them one very important subject. Business Ethics.</p>
