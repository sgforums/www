              <p>you are missing the point again and also the chronological sequence</p>
              <p>until the trial ends, there is no way the forum owner will 'know' these are defamatory, and therefore is not held liable</p>
              <p>even then, it will only result in court order to remove the defamatory posts</p>
              <p>therefore, pls answer the question, how does forum owner knowingly be held liable for these defamatory remarks?</p>
              <p>my points were never this in the first place</p>
              <p>it were that there will be no lawsuits against sgforums</p>
              <p>MLMers are known to throw up legal terms to coerce people into speaking up against them</p>
              <p>this so called defamation could not be proven, and actuall loss could not be realistically calculated</p>
              <p>therefore you guys have no claims whatsoever</p>

              <p>i think as non mlmers, we must speak up against coercion by mlmers who throw up legal terms as and when they found things going against their direction</p>
              <p>although there have never been such lawsuits due to lack of proof on their part, and the inevitable collapse of the entities, we must pursue those who coerce others into shutting up</p>
              <p>its bad enough many got scammed, its worse when they got scammed and forced into shutting up by mere legal terms</p>

              <p>I'm just a little curious, after reading so much, all 50+ pages of these.</p>
              <p>I mean, why do people from VE(managers, upline) request you to NOT say what you are selling when you are making an appointment?</p>
              <p>They ask you to call to say that i need your feedback, etc. But what you actually want is to sell the product am i not wrong? Why can't we just say like, " Hi, i've just joined a company selling health products and i think if you don't mind, you could perhaps take a look at it?"</p>
              <p>Also regarding the products, i did Yahoo about magnetic therapy and found many negative things about it, how it does not really work. But i'm puzzled, are there that many people who are willing to buy even thought it does not really work? Or is it because the presenters are able to convince in a way that it works? I think we should let the customers try it first, say, a week? And if they really find that it helps them, THEN they buy it. Then most people will say if everyone must try, then it will waste time. But if the product is good, and they WILL buy it, no harm in it right? But in anycase, to those people who say those things don't work at all, how does the company manage to stay in business?</p>
              <p>I'm just a little confused and all. Recruitment for example. Like some others said, why do they like try to shun talking about the company ? Oh, its not easy to talk on the phone, why don't you come down and talk about it? I find it a little weird, i mean, if its good, there should be nothing wrong sharing on the phone right? If they are interested, they would come down, if they are not, then we cannot really do anything right?</p>

              <p>Don't bother trying to use your unethical tactics on me. I got used to it when I was in VE. Pacer, by the way, when I was in VE, you taught me alot of bullshit and gave me empty promises of car and success without trying to do much. So is that not teaching me unorthodontic tactics and even saying that ppl who doesnt join VE are unfortunate bla bla bla?!</p>
              <p>And trying to 'clear' your name. No need for me to taint it. Many people already know who raymond loh is and his 'ways'.</p>

              <p>I understand this point. One tactic is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you just recruit 2 ppl and then you can earn money without doing anything. Can earn ferrari and make 5 figure income while your organisation grow.</span> What BULLSHIT!!!</p>

              <p>       Eagle Bro , i suggest you should watch the Movie : The Secret : Law of Attraction . Seriously in the society of Singapore , if you want to be successful. You really have to think out of the box . Be the minority than the majority , you must always be in front of the trend in Singapore. Now MLM ,NM is legal in Singapore , is just that there are some MLM company are those "Black " but there are some who are operating legally.Now for what i know Venture Era is a Company who obtain ISO9001:2001 which means in product and COMPANY . Now in Singapore , to obtain ISO for Company ( not product ) is actually very hard. They have to gone through alot of processes.</p>
              <p>         Now Venture Era is a company who have reputation , name , good customer service. Thats the point you all cannot deny . You can say that MLM and NM is not good.But the product is innocent right?</p>
              <p>        Think of this again , NTU already have Network Marketing as an optional course. If you think that network marketing is a scam . This indirectly saying that MOE is teaching you how to scam? Isnt It?</p>
              <p>         Next point , "Brainwash" i give u an example , in olympic . Every athletes are train in their best of the best condition and it reach the limit. But why there is people win and lose . Its not about their physical , but is because of their desire towards gold medal and bring the glory to the country. Their desire towards Victory is always very strong . You compared someone who have no desire and have poor mentality thinking with a person who have strong believe and strong desire .You would find alot of difference .</p>
              <p>        If what i said is not true , well take it i am talking to the wall.If its true , then think about what is the most practical thing on the earth =)  ( the answer is obvious )</p>
              <p>       People would saying  ( Wow recruit 2 person and you can earn money and get 5 figure income ) Now what is Network Marketing .... its through network . Come on use your brain and think. Not all people you recruit will fight with you and they find recruit will stay with you.</p>
              <p>        You just need 2 of the person in all Recruited who willing to fight for you is enough. Thats what they mean.They doesnt mean where you just need to find any 2 of them.This is common sense i am sure you would understand.</p>
              <p>        Well i guess i end here if not when i login to see again i would have flooded by people =x</p>

              <p>actually it always sounds good when they say you recruit 2 and the rest is up to the 2 to do the work, however that is for perfect case scenario, no matter what it is always about sponsoring more people because the 2 that you recruit may not work as hard as you, so never believe in a company when they say just get 2 or 3 or 5 or whatever small number and you are set for life, it's not that simple.</p>
