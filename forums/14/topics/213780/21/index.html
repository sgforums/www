              <p>I just joined Venture Era and had been working part time in this company for about one week already.</p>
              <p>I have just been told that i have been promoted to the rank of SE.</p>
              <p>I myself don't find anything bad about this company. Besides, its a good training for me if i were to step out into the world or get a job next time.</p>
              <p>In Venture Era, i learnt alot of communicatioin skills, how to do promotion and presentation skills. Yes, all the learning about the company products and funtions can be "brainwashing" because you need to memorise a lot of things. But i know its for my own good if i were to ever go out into the world to do business.</p>
              <p>When you do Network marketing, for sure you will get alot of people laughing at you and say that you made a wrong choice. But for me, I will never give up and i promised myself one day i will work up to the rank of BGM- "Business group manager" and earn millions of cash to support myself and my future studies. I want to learn to be indepent. And Venture Era is just the right place for me. In this company, people respect me and i respect my managers just like bros and sisters. I am very thankful for the person who brought me into Ve.</p>
              <p>Lastly, to end.... If anyone is working in VE, all the best to all of you. Work hard. Hope i can meet you one day. Don't give up even if your parents, friends or strangers laugh at you guys.</p>
              <p> Take care and GOD BLESS me, you, and Venture Era!!!!!!</p>

              brought me into Ve.</p>
              <p>Lastly, to end.... If anyone is working in VE, all the best to
              all of you. Work hard. Hope i can meet you one day. Don't give up
              even if your parents, friends or strangers laugh at you guys.</p>
              <p> Take care and GOD BLESS me, you, and Venture Era!!!!!!</p>

              <p><br>be it relatives or strangers, everybody can say no if they dont want. as ve distributors, we are very clear into that and we believe in giving our best presentation as we can, so as to give a fair understanding on the products to the prospects.</p>

              <p>in future you would all find out that most agents in VE wont stand a chance presenting to strangers... a bgm in your company told me about this.. i am not sure about a ranks.. but i think my friend is quite high in ranks..</p>

              <p><br>can elaborate more on ur first point?</p>
              <p>ur friend BGM isit?</p>
              <p>The last point, another unethical method which i soo disagree with... My 'mentor' mentioned this too when my uncle dont want to buy the product coz he think that he doesnt need it ( i understand and it was ok that I didnt make that sale with him)... This 'mentor' of mine keep pressurizing me to call, call the uncle till he buy giving reasons that he doesnt know that he needs the product etc... i didnt do as ask becoz i find this method to be unethical...</p>
              <p>But somehow my uncle called me again and give me his friend's no. and thinks that this friend of his have a use for the product... In the end the friend buy... Kudos to me &amp; my uncle =)</p>
              <p>But I dont think that 'sandwiching' relatives is a ethical and effective... say the relative feels pressured and buy, then would u think that they would give us their referrals with how they were treated?</p>
