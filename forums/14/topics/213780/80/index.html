              <p>So far from your posts, I can conclude that you are in it

              <p>Let's just say</p>
              <p>For tuitioning as a part time job, there are quite a number out
              there earning 5 figures. And especially for physics.com.sg, he
              earns &gt;20k monthly, working only 2 hours a day for 4 of the
              weekdays, and 4 hours a day for both weekends.</p>
              <p>So why not be a tutor?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is that a big paycheck?</p>
              <p>Or how about Adam Wong, an internet marketer who proclaimed that
              he is earning USD21k monthly at 25 yrs old by working only 4 hrs a
              day, and endorsed by Adam Khoo</p>

              <p>I assume you are going to uni</p>
              <p>You should perhaps continue with 1 or 2 students during later part of NS to help you refresh your memory constantly while earning some income at the same time</p>
              <p>It will benefit you extremely well when you enter uni in the first semester. That was the semester I went in and did a perfect score with the maximum number of modules I could go in a semester, 1 more than most others, and still had time for 2 more students while still exercising 5 days a week. My NS friends were telling me I was mad, and it would affect my results because 2 years of NS will have made me rusty.</p>

              <p>Ya but we cannot comment when we have never reach their position. Perhaps they have troubles that we never thought of. and Sunshine Empire was a scheme that will fall apart right from the beginning. And i believe that sunshine empire and Venture Era is completely different. At least one is legit (so far) and has products to sell.</p>

              <p>I assume you are going to uni</p>
              <p>You should perhaps continue with 1 or 2 students during later
              part of NS to help you refresh your memory constantly while earning
              some income at the same time</p>
              <p>It will benefit you extremely well when you enter uni in the
              first semester. That was the semester I went in and did a perfect
              score with the maximum number of modules I could go in a semester,
              1 more than most others, and still had time for 2 more students
              while still exercising 5 days a week. My NS friends were telling me
              I was mad, and it would affect my results because 2 years of NS
              will have made me rusty.</p>

              <p>I am also worried that I will grow stupid when i enter NS. So I make it a point to continue reading all the time. <br><br>Another thing is that I plan to take the business course in SMU, so there are hardly subjects that can refresh memory about business course. Or am I wrong? Plus I have other commitments in NS, so continuing teaching my students might make me not have enough time. And what if I got remedial training?</p>

              <p>Ya I know that. But what i do not get is why companies have not go into selling magnetic beds. or the Ecoquest Air technology. Magnetic beds are widespread in Japan as I have mentioned. And if it sucked it wouldnt have been widespread. <br><br>Ecoquest is very famous in USA. But i do not know why other countries we hardly hear of it.</p>
