              <p>In J1, I didn't even score that way. Unlike this person, I set my mind to scoring 4As in J2. I worked hard. Went to the top 10% in school, then find essays and study strategies of students whose results were way better than mine for economics. That was how I improved.</p>
              <p>There were also unethical methods some pple employed, e.g. giving out notes late on purpose so that they could study more than others. So what? I shared my notes and tutorial answers freely. And I still scored.</p>
              <p>So my point to this person was that why bother about how others were unethical? Do it your way, do it your style, do it with conscience and score.</p>

              <p>Anyway back to point.... For me, if it A levels, now I charging 50 per hour...</p>

              <p>RJ is after all, as many people will say, an every man for
              himself kind of place. But not all JCs are like that. So maybe Rj
              did had a lot of politics and backstabbing, but for me my jc we
              didnt have a lot of that.</p>

              <p>I agree, but RJ really is a stressful and competitive environment. Many RJ friends of mine told me that themselves. Need help? Find yourself. Few in Rj will really help you with work or anything like that unless they have an incentive to.</p>
