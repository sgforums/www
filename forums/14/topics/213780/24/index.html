              <p>i dont see any "believe or be damned" as what you claimed.. unless you are thinking we should convince and win all skeptics over? if thats the case, then i think you are quite naive. =)</p>

              <p><br><strong>VE didnt use trickery, i think you make another claims thats not convincing.</strong></p>
              <p>No wonder for network marketers' frustrations.</p>
              <p>the skeptics always says "its a scam! dont cheat the people!".. and when we asked why the skeptics think so,</p>
              <p>they has no response or simply, "its a scam la! it cheat people ma!"</p>
              <p>is that all they can say? no wonder skeptics are viewed as inmature, destructive and simply worthless junk.</p>
              <p><strong>Not only that, in return, they can only make conclusions about MLM without pointing out how and why, when they cant even respond to why they make such claims. How to justify what the skeptics claim?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Bear in mind, skeptics are promoting their idea, if they cant win people over and resort to lambasting people who dont agreed with them, i advised them to be more professional and stop whining like a sore losers.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>while skeptics have their rights, and the best businessmen can have their rights too.</strong></p>
              <p>i have talk to people who have negative views on MLM but after the talks, they are generally positive about it even though they may not join eventually. However, i wont waste my time with skeptics because they already made up their mind on something they believed in, aka brainwashed.</p>

              <p>thats why i think you dont understand about MLM. LOL!!</p>
              <p>1. market is limited to planet earth.</p>
              <p>2. they give hopes. (if you failed your exam, do you blame the teacher, the paper or yourself?) LOL!!</p>
              <p>3. since you use the word certain, then thats nothing to do with the rest. I wont condemn christians if some church operate like cults.</p>
              <p>4. if you dont sell product, then what for you join mlm. LOL !!! dont you understand what is product distribution?? LOL !!</p>
              <p>5. of course no qualification. what qualification is needed to start your own business? LOL !!! i think those auntie that sell prawn noodle have to go back school liao. hahahaha !!</p>
              <p>6. i think study is important. MLM is also a knowledge-based industry that required learning too. i think you assume and twisted the meaning between study and paper qualification.</p>
              <p>6. anyway, what botak you talking about? LOL !! i dont think ve people will think they are damn successful, unless you think so. so i take it as a compliments. LOL !!</p>

              <p><strong>He did not say that ethnics dont matter</strong>, dont put words into his mouth. i think you are twisting the whole story.</p>
              <p>if you are questioning about ethnics, i think you should question on <strong>individual</strong> ethnics rather than on the company or industry level because there are many distributors running their network marketing business with sincerity and ethncis. you cannot be using one person or few to comment on the whole company or industry, it does not <strong>justify</strong>.</p>
              <p>secondly, when he is refering on the tactics, i think he is talking more on sales and marketing approach. we must understand that there are professional in sales and marketing, there are newbies too. their approachs are different and if we just bite on some newbies poor sales approach and condemn the whole company or industry, then i think thats very inmature.</p>
              <p>i also experienced poor sales approach, not just network marketing, but also in shopping centre etc. however, that doesnt stop me from buying or until the extend of pulling the whole company or the industry down because of that 1 person.</p>
              <p>of course, there are also very people who are very narrow minded with strong critics and inmature behaviour. Thats their own personalities and i have no comments on them.</p>
              <p>lastly, i think any kind of people can post in internet, so do i kids and young teen who dont know much, but they think they know alot. <strong>Empty vase make the most noise</strong>.. right?</p>

              <p>i think you dont understand that MLM or corporate, its the same,
                  consumers are people to be won over.</p>
              <p>i dont see any "believe or be damned" as what you claimed..
                  unless you are thinking we should convince and win all skeptics
                  over? if thats the case, then i think you are quite naive. =)</p>

              <p>Oh really, to be won over means pouring out your grouses like this?<br><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Let me quote someone:<br><strong>i replied for him.</strong></p>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><strong>No wonder for network marketers' frustrations.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>the skeptics always says "its a scam! dont cheat the people!"..
                  and when we asked why the skeptics think so,</strong></p>
              <p><strong>they has no response or simply, "its a scam la! it cheat people
                  ma!"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>is that all they can say? no wonder skeptics are viewed as
                  inmature, destructive and simply worthless junk.</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p>Indeed, I have learnt from an MLMer that you must win consumers over by railing against them in a public forum. Wow....</p>
              <p>And since when 'believe or be damned' = must convince and win all skeptics over? Which school of maniacal thoughts did you pop out from?</p>
              <p>Trying your utmost to win skeptics over is a personal achievement to be admired, while damning skeptics whom you cant convince is equivalent of calling unreachable grapes sour.</p>
              <p>You can choose not to convince skeptics, but please do not whine like a sore loser if they reject your offers.</p>
              <p>Thats the whole idea.</p>

              <p>I myself, a member of VE thinks that David is a little
              'brainwashed' . David, when you post your comment on hospital,
              small shops and mlm, scam etc. I dont think you really knew what

              <p>I think that david, you should think on YOUR OWN... Not what
              others in the co. is telling you... I dont follow what the leaders
              are telling me...</p>
              <p>One simple reason, if everyone follows the leaders steps,
              wouldnt all of them be doing well now. Do things differently and
              MAYBE you'll do well. Provided you do it the right way...</p>

              <p>David may seems callous in his remarks, but I believe even the more 'experienced' enquiries have avoided my question on the three unequitable entities. Glad you've noticed how unfair it is to compare apple with oranges.</p>
              <p>Actually, from experience, MLM is more like a disemmination of tried and tested methods, spreading downstream from the leader, with allowance given to downlines to tweak it to match their style and circle of friends.However, what David is, is probably a mirror of his uplines, which again, a bad reflection of the higher ups in VE. Not to mention other stragglers  (except yourself) who pop up once in a while here shooting their bloody mouth off, it can result in even worse impression on VE, given the speed in which info spreads in internet.</p>
