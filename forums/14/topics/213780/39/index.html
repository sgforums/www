              <p>how is it that my relatives are losing out? The product is beneficial for them... Most of the time i sacrifice my commission so that they could have the product for you... And so far all of them gave me good testimonial on the products that they have purchased...</p>
              <p>I only take commission from those whom the refer to me... My relatives have a beneficial item, and i can have better sleep at night... Win-win situation...</p>
              <p>Unlike you, .. Dont benefit relatives with anything, at the same time, burn your parents money...</p>

              <p>Hi WSR,</p>
              <p>What was your initial intention in selling the products to those person that you know? Was it to benefit the person, so that they will be in good health? If given a chance, would you let them have the product at a cheaper price (or rather as cheap as possible)? Or would you still think that i should be given "referral fee" for introducing such product to you. To put it simply, do u agree that what you earn is actually from the person pocket? Of course, it's too grey an area to say that it's wrong. I won't say that it's wrong. You are in control of the price now. You can choose to lower the price, even to the extent whereby you don earn anything (or best still, to get the product over the net), so that the person will have the "maximum" benefit (or rather the person will have less to lose). Would you do so?</p>
              <p>No doubt, mlm is a great way of earning money. But i'm certain that you're aware that where your money come from. Money don't just appear... It comes from somebody pocket, and that somebody may have worked extremely hard for it. Take a look around you when you go into a shopping or food centre the next time round. (Maybe those who are cleaning the tables, i admit i'm stating the extreme case). If you say that you would lower the price to those you know very well, your families and relatives, i believe your downlines would also want to do so. Because they have feelings for their family members... Would u cut your commission for them? Or u would choose to sell them at the price...</p>
              <p>If the above two are to occur, where will your "salary" comes from? So... what's your choice? And maybe knowing that, we can then discuss about the respect and other stuffs.</p>
              <p>P.S If given a choice, i believe all of us would agree that cashiers (salaried workers without commission) working in NTUC will want to lower the price of the goods, but they do not have the power to do so.</p>

              <p><br>Hi one star,</p>
              <p>i am in mlm, so i know where the money comes from... Of course from the consumer... Isnt where money comes from for ALL businesses regrardless of mlm or not...(You post is so long just to ask me 1 point?)</p>
              <p>I dont take in commission from the people I know of. As I have stated in a post above, i profit my commission from their referrals...</p>
              <p>As an mlm entreprenuer, I can only lower my product to a certain price,.. Which is I dont take in my commission... But I dont do this for all my customers...</p>
              <p>P.S. People always want things cheap, if can they want it free... Its the human nature... Dont just mention salaried workers, its everyone... If its sold at $1, ppl will complain for price decrease to 50 cents... If its 50 cents, ppl would want it to be decreased to 10 cents... You get my point?</p>

              <p>Quitting = loser... Regardless of VE or not... Once you quit means you have not given it all you got... In reality, there's only a winner and a loser... There's nothing in between...

              means you have not given it all you got... In reality, there's
              only a winner and a loser... There's nothing in between...
              Winners are those who would rather be 'knocked-up' by competition

              <p>Sales.. So VE is about being a salesman and salesgirl? Ok to be fair and not to sterotype anything .. I joined ard 2001 and my upline and his whole team left together because of one reason... He only help those who got potential buyers in getting the queen sized magnet mattress .. And in turn when there's no sales he will said why aint u doing anything? yada yada .. Well, i do not blame him anyway .. At least i learn something thru this experience..</p>
              <p>Donald trump .. hmm interesting .. Quitting in life yes a loser but hey qutting from something doesnt deem u fail in life and ya assuming aint good in this aspect.</p>
              <p>Well, at that time there was only Ion water, VE's magnet matress and some magnetic thingy and in order for MLM to be successful .. The company must have an unique product of their own and a unique business plan. At least this is wat i learn from Robert Kiyosaki's book.</p>

              <p><br>the thing is, i didn;t see just 1 or 2 VE ppl that uses unethical &amp; manipulative tactics. It's the seniors that teach all theLIES! Everyone below would follow. I didn't listen to the ppl here. I experienced it. And I think the people here too had their own negative experience with VE. Your third point is a typical VE tactic, try to put down something that can be achieved without MLM. And Elementalangel, I hope you do well to prove this B!TCH wrong!</p>
              <p>MLM is one way and many is abusing it! It's NOT the only way!</p>

              <p>Hey WSR..</p>
              <p>U damn sure or not u achieve ur car incentive oredi...?? U joined this yr in <strong>2008</strong> and it just takes u <strong>7 mths</strong> to achieve it...? Who r u trying to kid...? Old timers in VE also took years to achieve tat... Unless u tell me u got ur sugarmummy or ur sugardaddy to pump large amount of money in ur sales... Then maybe possible... But still i feel is impossible... 7 mths to achieve it is totally crap...  </p>
              <p>Cos from wat i know, u haf to be a BM and to achive the car incentives there's 3 cycle u haf to go through and each cycle took u 3 mths... To be a BM, it will take u time also, dun mention abt the car incentives.</p>
              <p>I think ah people like u r a disgrace not only to the company but also to the nation... U wanna defend VE, but i think u've make the name of VE even more disrespectful... WELL DONE!</p>
