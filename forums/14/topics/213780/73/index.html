              <p><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/249282">Hardcoreblizzard</a>, are you sure that you are neutral? It seems that you are very biased towards VE seeing how you defended VE's 'honour'. If you don't care about what others think of you, then what the hell are you doing here for so long argueing and TRYING to CONvince others that VE is good. You keep emphasizing that VE managers CONvinced you more than the forumers here. Then that's your problem. Why are you here trying to CONvince and defend your own judgement. UNLESS you are a newbie of VE who have difficulty in accepting the fact that VE is a company that is dominated by UNETHICAL agents. If there are black sheeps in VE, they would be the good ones. I was in VE once, so I know the unhealthy environment there. How the managers teach you how to trick your friends and relatives from A-Z. The managers are the ones who teach you to Lie and to cheat, not the young, naive teenagers. So go ahead, BELIEVE those lying managers. It's you who will lose in the end. No point trying to defend VE. I'll give you a minimum of 6 months and you will not have the same idealogy that you have now.</p>
