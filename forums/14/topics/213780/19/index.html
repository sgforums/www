              <p>i think elementalangel's idea to buy in bulk and sell it could haf the possibility 2 work...</p>
              <p>But would u sell the products w/o profit? how abt shipment? manpower cost? how abt storage of the products? the market? sell it to whom? if u do not want to sell it to friends n relatives, then how abt the advertisement cost? Does the market want/accept this product?</p>

              <p>alpine was sold to eco quest.... so eco quest is actually alpine</p>
              <p>to white soul reaper... i would sell the products to VE distributors.. those money hungry people would definetely take a bait... =D maybe if i add the shipment and work myself rent a place to store my products which would only cose 20-30 dolars a month....</p>
              <p>and make a profit of 200-300 dolars per unit... it wont even cost up till half of the VE's price</p>

              <p>i think it would depend on which type of VE agent that would take the bait... The 1st type is the one that u mentioned, the money hungry ppl... the 2nd type is the one that's chasing positions... If buy from u how they promote le...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I doubt that the shipment and storage would coz $20-30 only coz u buying in bulk! so it will be quite ex since shipment is by the weight of the products... How abt manpower? u carry urself isit? transportation? bus, mrt, taxi? storage at ur hse is for free la but gt enough space meh since u buy in bulk which is a lot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u do that i believe that u could sell the product at half the price VE is storing since VE have to pay a lot things more, one eg to maintain their headquaters and for their car incentives...</p>

              <p>Oh right. I would agree that perhaps he did not offer a satisfactory answer but again I think this is a matter of perspective. You and I may not consider it a satisfactory answer but to him, it is. In that sense, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>It's like debating religion. The religious person looks at the universe in all it's glory and thinks, "this is the proof of God. Only a perfect, immortal being could have created all of this." The atheist looks at the exact same thing and goes, "this is the proof that there is no God."<br><br>From my perspective, the price or markup does not really matter to me because I feel an item is worth whatever a person is willing to pay for it. I paid $5000 for my laptop. My girlfriend thinks it's too expensive for a laptop. At the same time, she (unfortunately) thinks that a $2000 LV bag is a good deal.<br><br>I do take your point that VE distributors may sell their product at a very high margin. If the network marketing model is a very effective method of selling the product, it may be worth the high cost of sales. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. McDonalds sells a medium coke for $2. I can get a Big Gulp of Coke from 7-11 at $1.60. More drink for less! But sometimes I still buy a coke from McDonalds rather than seeking out a 7-11. Or if I get good service from a particular shop, I may still buy from the shop even though I know I can get a lower price elsewhere.<br><br>I also don't have a problem with him arguing the merits of the products. Like I said before, I personally think it's all bunk and nonsense. But I also think fengshui, fortune telling, TCM, thai amulets, etc. are all mostly bunk and nonsense as well. But that's just my opioning and I excerise my choice no to purchase these kinds of products. But if people feel it's worth their money, I have no objection to people spending their money as they wish.<br><br>In fact, arguing the merits of the product is what he SHOULD do. It's no different from a Toyota salesman saying that Toyota cars are better than other cars. And I really think it's up to the buying to take personal responsibility for his or her buying decision and carefully consider the purchase, esp if it involves large sums of money.<br><br>My main problem with MLMs is the model itself. As you pointed out, there are many layers of distributor uplines - each of which that takes a cut effectively increasing the cost of the product. Those intermediate layers have no value add in the sales process.<br><br>Another problem (which was the point of the link I posted) is that MLMs don't have any concept of channel stuffing or channel conflict. An MLM has no limit to the number of sales people it recruits. In the example posted on ripoffreport, there were 12 people in a 1 mile radius selling the same product.<br><br>The worst problem (and I don't know if this is true of venture Era) is that MLMs often don't sell the product itself, but they use the product as a front for a pyramid scheme. The compensation scheme of MLMs is often designed to be abused. Take Sunshine Empire for example. You are buying epoints or Emcall talktime. But you are not really buying Emcall talktime. You are buying the promised 'rebates'. That changes the game and creates artificial, unsustainable demand for the product.<br><br>So there's no problem if a sales person convinces a customer to buy 5 air purifiers because he needs one in every room. But there is a problem if the person doesn't really want 5 air purifiers, but is buying only because he wants to advance to the next level of the compensation scheme and become a Super Marquis Lord Managing Director.</p>

              effective method of selling the product, it may be worth the high
              cost of sales. There's nothing inherently wrong with that.
              McDonalds sells a medium coke for $2. I can get a Big Gulp of Coke
              from 7-11 at $1.60. More drink for less! But sometimes I still buy
              a coke from McDonalds rather than seeking out a 7-11. Or if I get
              good service from a particular shop, I may still buy from the shop
              even though I know I can get a lower price elsewhere.<br> <br> I also don't have a problem with him arguing the merits of the
              products. Like I said before, I personally think it's all bunk and
              nonsense. But I also think fengshui, fortune telling, TCM, thai
              amulets, etc. are all mostly bunk and nonsense as well. But that's
              just my opioning and I excerise my choice no to purchase these
              kinds of products. But if people feel it's worth their money, I
              have no objection to people spending their money as they wish.<br> <br> In fact, arguing the merits of the product is what he SHOULD do.
              It's no different from a Toyota salesman saying that Toyota cars
              are better than other cars. And I really think it's up to the
              buying to take personal responsibility for his or her buying
              decision and carefully consider the purchase, esp if it involves
              large sums of money.<br> <br> My main problem with MLMs is the model itself. As you pointed out,
              there are many layers of distributor uplines - each of which that
              takes a cut effectively increasing the cost of the product. Those
              intermediate layers have no value add in the sales process.<br> <br> Another problem (which was the point of the link I posted) is that
              MLMs don't have any concept of channel stuffing or channel
              conflict. An MLM has no limit to the number of sales people it
              recruits. In the example posted on ripoffreport, there were 12
              people in a 1 mile radius selling the same product.<br> <br> The worst problem (and I don't know if this is true of venture Era)
              is that MLMs often don't sell the product itself, but they use the
              product as a front for a pyramid scheme. The compensation scheme of
              MLMs is often designed to be abused. Take Sunshine Empire for
              example. You are buying epoints or Emcall talktime. But you are not
              really buying Emcall talktime. You are buying the promised
              'rebates'. That changes the game and creates artificial,
              unsustainable demand for the product.<br> <br> So there's no problem if a sales person convinces a customer to buy
              5 air purifiers because he needs one in every room. But there is a
              problem if the person doesn't really want 5 air purifiers, but is
              buying only because he wants to advance to the next level of the
              compensation scheme and become a Super Marquis Lord Managing
              Director.</p>

              <p>Except that most people are not really interested in selling those products. They are selling products as a means to an end - which is to rise up the ranks, build up downlines and earn passive income so they can retire early, etc.</p>
              <p>Sure, if they buy product from you to resell, they may be able to earn a bigger margin. But then they will need to keep selling and they won't achieve the passive income that they want.</p>
              <p>But if they really want to earn income just by selling product, and are not interested in the passive income aspect, why would they buy from you? What is your value add? Unless you get an exclusivity deal with the manufacturer, why would someone what to deal with you as opposed to going directly to the manufacteror. Unless of course, your value add is something like making sure the product passes regulatory hurdles, or you do something that the sales person is unable to do himself or herself.</p>
