              <p>You like calling others liars... But the true fact is you are just a pathetic kid that doesn't know much... To you everything about VE is fake... Why? Hell, I don't want to know...

              <p>I believe that you are a liar yourself... True fact is everybody lies... If you tell me that  you have never lied, doesn't that make you a liar? You claim that you have never been in VE, and that you dislike the way VE recruits agents... And for such reason, you have a vendatta against VE... Nobody in their right mind would go through such lenghts to tarnish VE's reputation... I am 100% sure that you were in VE once and felt cheated in a way...</p>

              <p>you got my friendster right? ask anyone if they had seen me in ve before =)</p>
              <p>the reason why i had a vendetta against VE is because its is like a 1.5 hrs journey from my house with bus and got "scammed" there 2x.. thats all..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how's the sueing issue going on?</p>
              <p>Actually the reason why i could actually know so much about an mlm is because my dad was one of the highest ranking people in a mlm in msia even before sg allowed mlms and continueing his parent's business.(one of my relative is in an mlm now as one of their employees, thinking about marketting plans to entice their employees)<br>In fact i grew up in an enviroment where many i know make money by designing mlm marketting plans and such..<br><br>i am sure i know more about how an mlm works than you. ( at least in the admin side )<br><br>Everything i said abot the 1:4 cost:price rule is ignored by lower ranking mlmers who have to constantly market their products and bring more people in.<br></p>
              <p>I totally understand how people who love mlm thinks, until now my dad still believes in mlm even though i mock him about that every day...  Even when i was looking for a supplier, he still believes in making his own mlm company.. until i strongly stopped him from ruining the lives of the heartlanders...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yes i am a loser with all talk but no actions at the moment because of the lack of investments... my investor only invested a low sum of money just enough for me to bring in 3 pallets of the product.. why? because his us bank account only has limited cash from his investment returns... however i am sure that little money far exceeds the ammount of money u have earned in VE so far.. i wont reveal my costs.<br><br>I know i will not even be earning in the end even if i sell the entire batch, however i am sure that the people will benefit from it... <br></p>
              <p>I have lied before in my life, however i mean everything i said in this forum except for the sarcastic stuff if you dont sense my sarcasm.<br><br>Thanks anyway for making me so persistant in bringing in the products for this profitless venture...</p>

              <p>Oh pls little timmy, what investmest? can't you just 'borrow' money from your parents or your parents don't have enough as they are at the lazy type of mlmers...</p>
              <p>You refer to those in mlm as employees, and yet you claimed that you know so much about mlm... You claimed that you know the admin side of mlm, yes admin is an employee, so all you know of mlm is as an employee...</p>
              <p>Oh pls, don't thank me for you failure in you 'venture'...However, I would thank you for motivating me to join VE and have found success... .</p>
              <p>Hmmm... 1:4 rule... How would you know about it? It is something that ONE company use as a pricing standard or is it as a whole? Oh well, why are you complaining here? Can you do anything about it? Let's put McDonalds in this thread for a min, does McDonalds sell their products at 1:4 too? I don't think so... More like 1:10... But hey, no one is complaining is there?</p>
              <p>So you had a vendetta against VE because you lost at most 10 hrs? That doesn't make any sense... You lost at most 10 hrs and you have been in this thread almost everyday? Why are you still 'wasting' your time here?</p>
              <p> Again, I motivate you to go for you pointless business venture? Why would someone in this thread that YOU DON'T know motivate you?  Your talk about your own Vendetta against VE doesn't make any sense here...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. It is so pathetic for a son to mock his own father... Usually, ppl would keep it to themselves... But little timmy, you actually mock you own father... What kind of morals do you have? It's really pathetic of you...</p>

              <p>Huzane, knows how to talk big, but when we met face to face, like a timid mouse... There initials of Huzane's name are : NHI </p>
              <p>Come on redstone, traditionally, more $ = success... It's just the modern era that shows that success = achieving your passion... Go and ask your grandparents what success is...</p>
              <p>Let's say one's passion is to be the best gigolo in the world... Would ppl still say that you are successful when you are sodomized by thousands of men?</p>

              <p>My grandparents came from a simple family, and had lead a simple life all their lives. Their own parents immigrated here.

              <p>Then good for you...</p>
              <p>Since you have been dwelling on this issue for so long, let me just simply clear things up for you again... In your case, you believe that following your passion is equal to success... Think again, not everyone has the same ideology as you or your grandparents...</p>
              <p>To me, having more than enough money, taking care of my parents and siblings is a success be it having passion or not... Yes, i call quitters losers... So what? Why is it affecting you so much?</p>
              <p>You and I have different ideologies, i don't give a rats ass about what your ideology is, so don't even try to justify your ideology...</p>
              <p>if your passion to be the best gigolo is equally to success than it's up to you... I am not going to stop you... Coz i don't know you... Let's say if your dad has the gigolo dream, would you permit it?  and be honest...</p>
              <p>I am 23.... How old are you?</p>
