We are talking about MLM companies right?<br><br>Again, do you think the public is ever so reasonable and compassionate? This is why you dont see companies in the red  going to AGMs or Business Times or Financial Times willingly saying 'oh geez, competition is tough, sorry' or 'we could not fully utilise our manpower'. The public, especially the shareholders would take their shares elsewhere. Similarly, for MLM companies, as long as the distributors, no matter how small is the number of black sheeps is, are able to put down the companies' reputation, statements like 'cannot control 100% of distributors' cannot be used as a reason whatsover.<br><br>Its akin to stabbing yourself in the foot. Its telling the whole world the company is incompetent. Its pushing the blame, even if the company is trying to solve the issue. MLM, afterall is a business, not some CSOs or charity groups. There is no reason for the public to give way. If the company cannot do it, its just too bad. People like topicstarter can rail against public biases, defend his company as if it is promoting some righteous cause, but if cannot win over the public, just too bad for the company's pockets.<br><br>As for my achievements, profile etc etc..ever heard of ad hominem argument?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>i fully understand your point but i want to stress that i dont represent the company. i'm stating the facts to let the public aware, thats all. whether the public accept or not, its not my main concern.<br><br>i rather surprised by your replies that it seem you have mistaken my intention?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, call me Corwin.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  not "topicstarter".<br><br>To laurence82,<br><br>Hmm, if "topicstarter"'s starting topic is all about defending my company by blaming the black sheeps, nope, read again carefully. I did not blame the back sheeps, I merely say for an entreprenurial company whereby people are independent, there are always the people whom fall out or abuse the system without thinking of the consequences. I never blamed them for the cause of the company's image or even say that the company never takes measures.<br><br>Point One, if the company never takes measures to quell the "black sheeps", that would be the dumbest thing ever to do cause definately that would lead to the company's death quick.<br><br>Point Two, re-reading my post, I point out several factors THAT NEEDS TO BE DEFENDED, it was never a post to BLAME ALL THE FACTORS TO A TARNISHED IMAGE cause If you read carefully, I did not claim the company's image to be tarnished. Haha, that would defeat the purpose in defending, cause in defending, I am more or less pointing out, what untrue things people are claiming, or passing around, or misjudging about the company based on mere "opinions" (and not expert opinions).<br><br>Point Three, are there people whom are not in the company yet support the reliability of the company? Are there peopl whom are againts the company based on their persectives which I already cleared in "starting topic"? Answer for both, yes there are. The point is, the company tremendous support of people outside (legitimate support, like approval of the company's authencity in terms of products, service and structured compensation plans and education system) shows that the company's image is not tarnished. The company is abused, but never tarnished. My defination of tarnish is majority of the people hates the company and that would result in its closure I suppose. Every company in the world can be abused. What you mean Microsoft was never abused by their people when they started out? Read their history journals. You would be shocked.<br><br>Point Four, you are very wrong about one thing. One case, Xerox coporation was badly hit through product credibility in their first 8 years of operation. And they had to come out a 3 year campaign to voice out their credibility by sidelining their distributors to those that are following the protocols, and those that are not. They made use of legal campaigns, mass media and even events  to just point out that their INDEPENDENT distributors (bot like MLM, but independent distributing companies that will distribute mostly based on their own provate resources) were abusing the protocol. They couldn't break contract with these independent firms because most of the stocks were already given to them. But by raising the public's awarness or "sympathy" (thats what you call it, which I think is greatly absurd because business requires no "sympathy" even a defndant. They require clarity of facts. Symphaty is like saying "hey! pity us, we are already so abused because of the bad guys does not make us still bad!"), Xerox was able to continue progress. The customers were educated about the situation and prepared for choosing Xerox modified (fake) products from the correct ones. And is this the only case that happens? NO! There were many mostly pioneering companies whom had to struggle through these phase of over-doing abusers.<br><br>Putting it on a smaller-scale, VE is definately doing their part in ensuring proper image. Also remeber, "topicstarter" was not sent by VE. He defended his company by his own accord. Meaning you falsely claim that companies such as mine blames the "black sheeps" for being out of control (and I did not say "out of control" like how you meant it to be- read properly) is totally false because the company did not do such things. Tsk tsk, how could you? *kidding.....BUT I, a VOICED OPINION, did!. And I did not "blame"! I merely pointed out things.<br><br>Simply put, re-read "topicstarter's starting post"<br><br>Cheers<br>Corwin_2k<br><br></div>

You could have replied "because my mum treated me like a whimp when I was young" or you could have say "not doing violence does not make you a chicken". The first response is blaming your mother. The second is claiming a fact. Catch it? no? Its ok. In time you would.<br><br>Cheers<br>Corwin_2k<br><br></div></blockquote>Another long thesis, but let me make my answers short and succint<br><br>a) No, the black sheep parts refers to another person's post<br><br>b) I am glad you agree with me on point one<br><br>c) i am not sure which part you have said about tarnished images, either i dont understand what you trying to point out or i have never come across it, but never mind, your point two is nice, about expert opinions, but then its the public opinions that matter<br><br>d) Tarnish, abused..same difference, why? Same consequences, ie, loss of potential income through loss of reputation, whether its by abuse as you called it or through real problems such as poor quality products or loss of customer service.<br><br>d) I can ask you one question. What have would/could you do to match Xerox's success in their publicity campaign? Somehow, seeing the old topics on Venture Era, I think you are fighting a one man show here in sgforums. I am not sure what happened here that would require your attention here, but again, the whole idea of publicity campaign is to reach out. You could talk about cleaning up your company's reputation the way Xerox do, but as long as the public feels confronted and dont buy it, quoting Xerox is of no use.<br><br>e) Again, I am not sure about loss of control, but I thought that reply was to WongCH...? How come some points you answer for him, and which could not have been related to your company?<br><br></div>

Their "all smiles" face, their "hypocritical" nature, their "phone techniques" in conning pple to come down to be "recruited" etc. Well, to answer to this, I put a view at your hand.<br><br>Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft, many pple laughed at him that he was ridiculous in his claim that Microsoft will be a worldwide business one day. Religious people that ever walked earth such as Jesus Christ, Muhammad, Buddha, Krishna were one way or another insulted, claimed by enemies that they used "brainwashing" techniques to convert people, they showed false compassion like "all smiles". Political leaders, organizations, activists etc. all were given the similar taint of people.<br><br>All these people, in the end, one way or another succeeded in spreading their vision and belief round the world wheter creating enemies or not. I am not saying VE is a political group, relicous group, activist or anything, but my point is, "brainwashing" is a misintepreted concept that lives in the blood of humans. "Brainwashing" for the bad such as asking people to commit homocide, commit theft is of course bad. "Brainwashing" for the good such as "lets all smile and welcome anyone with open arms" is definately good. But both can be hypocritical. Now thats were the next argument comes.<br><br></div></blockquote>Corwin, I begin to know why your defence is kinda weak. Just take this para from your first post as an example. If you want to speak about facts, talk about your company, not Bill Gates. Ask you a very simple question. How would actions and success of Bill Gates, religious activists and political leaders would mean Venture Era be the same?<br><br>Countless of times people quote Bill Gates, Robert Kyosaki etc, but fail to impress on people. There is no link, unless you are saying, hey we have implemented Bill Gates' attitude towards people, by getting only passionate and talented people etc etc. The point is there has to be something explicitly something you do which Bill Gates do, and also show why it would work for your company.<br><br>Otherwise, it would be like 'xiao ming got A in his grades, i would also get an A'..which is like a big 'huh?'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by corwin_2k:<br><br>3) No allowance on attachment<br>There was this case posted on the forum. In fact this was actually all solved a long time ago. The company has taken liable action against these history events and has all been resolved. The company was not at wrong. In fact, the students twisted the words of the management because the management did told them before they joined that this company gives no allowance. Only commission base on following the system. Many after seeing business is not a short-term thing, felt Â“cheatedÂ” and as such and started spreading to the school that the company did not pay them. It was all settled when the company took legal action against the students that the students were encouraged to go to other companies if they wanted Â“promised incomeÂ”. All said, any reference to this matter have to just come down to 39 Robinson Road, 10 floor and speak directly to the management to show you the proof of these. I have a point here. There are many KIDS whom join VE also and its very hard for VE to give an education to all these Â“KIDSÂ”. Those that are matured enough, understand the nature of the business. Those that are not, fall out and you can categorize them into 2. Those whom continue believing that business will never be their cup of tea OR those whom are so Â“angryÂ” they try to flame forums and spread to their friends and family that VE is a fraud. CAD has no list of VE is a fraud and VE has appeared in the newspaper Berita Harian once to show its education to youngsters in business.<br><br></blockquote>Ok, i am just taking paras at random, just taking one and pointing out what you could have done better.<br><br>I have heard of that case, but point is, we have not heard back from the kids, so we are just relying on your words here. But then again, it doesnt matter much now.<br><br>One point here highlighted what I said about telling people the company's incompetence. VE recruited, as you said, kids, and it realise it cant educate kids. To be a little brutal here, whose fault? This is where the blaming begins. You got proof that the kids believe the business will never be their cup of tea etc etc? In fact, if your company is able to show its education to Berita Harian, and at the same time it has problem educating kids..something not right.<br><br>Besides, a good businessman, would, instead of blaming the kids, would think of ways to counteract this. I remember reading an article about Qantas blaming the competition when it encountered losses. Competition is always there, so are immature kids. So the question people would be more interested is, how would you solve this problem? What is the point of telling people immature kids are around?<br><br>Ever seen a scene where a patient was telling a nurse off for telling him to come at 3 and delaying till 4? I have seen such, and the nurse 's excuses were that the hospital has too many patients. The patient was not appeased. Think about it, the patient in this case represent the 'public' and the 'customers'. Telling them your problems are not going to appease or convince them, and this kind of scene have played out so many times that it has become a matter of hot debate over at the Speakers Corner forum.<br><br>By the way, the hospital is most likely to be understaffed. Now we probably have the real problem, so then lets think about how to solve it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To laurence82<br><br>Well, guess I read wrong then. Sorry abt that!<br><br>But gd questions I will answer to.<br><br>1) Talking about Xerox's campaig vs. my own one man show. Yep, ya got that right. Nothing compared to mine. In fact why I pointed out Xerox's campaign was to show how a today-successful company can a long time ago be hit with similar crisis, and how measures were taken but using "voicing" methods. Like articles and events as such. Yea that was what I was pointing out. Xerox vs. VE? nope, I think Xerox damages were far greater that called for "campaigns" and Venture Era did not go for that. All said, yea there is one thing that stating abt Xerox wasn't nessacary. True.<br><br>2) Bill Gates story. Why I pointed that out was of course not to compare our success. THat would be a no-brainer. But what I truly meant was, a great company had ONCE started humbly as a pioneering and had ALSO ONCE when through what most pioneering companies in pioneering industries (software industry was new in his time and MLM, even though 60 years old, has not met its exponential growth due to it being a different business model entirely just like when firstfranchising came into the world. Took 172 years for it to swing exponentially) has gone through. So yea, If I pointed out about Venture Era, there would be no basis to show that pioneering companies will never be successful if their situation are as such. So I have to point out the best.<br><br>3) Venture Era did not recruit kids. Venture Era has no rules to say who can they recruit, mature or immatures. Nope, the only rule is above 18. And Venture Era has no ability to recruit, but their agents have. There is a difference being, the agents ARE independent and they choose whom to recruit. They can recruit 10 immature teenagers (I am not discriminating them, all I am saying is, its a worldwide known fact that immature adults have the hardest survival rate and reasonable capacity to use PROPER reasoning, like not venting anger at everyone but themselves, not being accusative, not being demanding...etc. etc.) and still the company can only train them how they train others. Am I saying 18 year olds are problematic? No. There can be 25 year old "kid" (or immature adult I shall say) whom blames the company for not getting his paycheck, when he clearly did not sell anything at all. So the company is not at fault in educating these "kids". The education system is a constant, it all depends on the uplines on how they train these "kids" since they are all different. Can "kids" be changed through the company's education system? Yes of course. Some do, some and some don't. Even the most fantastic education model cannot nurture 100% of immature adults minds. The fact that some do, shows the company's training system is reasonable and good. But those that don't stay long enough to discover themselves or be moulded to grow up through proper education? Now that happens, and that can't be controlled. Its not a blame to "kids". Again, they are facts that can't be denied especially for MLM companies since we have no hiring policy. We can improvise our training system to be so brilliant till every agent is a teenage psychologist, but that is way out of the point am I right to say? Or we could interview new recruits and chose to take them in or not, that would be brutal in the mLM way isn't it?</div>

THat would be a no-brainer. But what I truly meant was, a great company had ONCE started humbly as a pioneering and had ALSO ONCE when through what most pioneering companies in pioneering industries (software industry was new in his time and MLM, even though 60 years old, has not met its exponential growth due to it being a different business model entirely just like when firstfranchising came into the world. Took 172 years for it to swing exponentially) has gone through. So yea, If I pointed out about Venture Era, there would be no basis to show that pioneering companies will never be successful if their situation are as such. So I have to point out the best.<br><br>3) Venture Era did not recruit kids. Venture Era has no rules to say who can they recruit, mature or immatures. Nope, the only rule is above 18. And Venture Era has no ability to recruit, but their agents have. There is a difference being, the agents ARE independent and they choose whom to recruit. They can recruit 10 immature teenagers (I am not discriminating them, all I am saying is, its a worldwide known fact that immature adults have the hardest survival rate and reasonable capacity to use PROPER reasoning, like not venting anger at everyone but themselves, not being accusative, not being demanding...etc. etc.) and still the company can only train them how they train others. Am I saying 18 year olds are problematic? No. There can be 25 year old "kid" (or immature adult I shall say) whom blames the company for not getting his paycheck, when he clearly did not sell anything at all. So the company is not at fault in educating these "kids". The education system is a constant, it all depends on the uplines on how they train these "kids" since they are all different. Can "kids" be changed through the company's education system? Yes of course. Some do, some and some don't. Even the most fantastic education model cannot nurture 100% of immature adults minds. The fact that some do, shows the company's training system is reasonable and good. But those that don't stay long enough to discover themselves or be moulded to grow up through proper education? Now that happens, and that can't be controlled. Its not a blame to "kids". Again, they are facts that can't be denied especially for MLM companies since we have no hiring policy. We can improvise our training system to be so brilliant till every agent is a teenage psychologist, but that is way out of the point am I right to say? Or we could interview new recruits and chose to take them in or not, that would be brutal in the mLM way isn't it? </div></blockquote>I dont think Xerox's campaign includes telling their users that they are incapable of using Xerox machines right? In the same light, I dont think you should be going going around telling people you have a bunch of immature kids who dont understand how your company works. I understand what you getting at, but the method doesnt seems to match that purpose, and I think this is a big issue for you currently. Actually, the part abt the kids is more like blaming, and I cant see any other image that that part might project.<br><br>I am not sure about what you said about Bill Gates, but your orginal post touches on brainwashing and how people like Bill Gates spread their vision and so on...so how does it suddenly relates to exponential growth and pioneering?<br><br>The issue about your third para i have addressed it to WongCH, and its unfortunate that he didnt want to discuss it further. You can read my earlier posts right in this topic to see how i feel about this issue..i must say i am too lazy to retype<br><br></div>

Why the negativity about MLM?<br><br>I really need to support a fellow businessman here in a similar trade...<br><br>1) It IS a business...come on man, Even Robert Kiyosaki thought it was a scam, But now he wrote a book on the Positives of MLM. He claims it is a legit business. I recommend you read, Cashflow quadrant, and Business school...<br><br>2) It is open to all ages...from the young punk with no future, to the old geezer, everyones open to join MLM...You tell me got opportunity to start business for 18 year olds...(kick out those who win prize money to start business) I will follow you...<br><br>3) Whats wrong with saying you want this or that? People who are in MLM succeed because they hold tight to their dreams...I suspect some spiteful people say they see the dark side of this or that just because they want something expensive...I rather think they dont dare to dream...dreams are really...important in the business...Its one of the sources of motivation in doing this business....<br><br>So lay off him man...He has dreams and has no intention of decreasing his expectation of the dream, thats why he joins VE, just as how i joined my own MLM company...<br><br>cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

If they are really that good, why're the recruitment of employees always aimed at young teenagers?<br><br>That's because at a young age, youngsters are generally easier to be psychoed into doing such kinda business because most of them've not seen the world just as yet. Of course, an employee of Venture Era would definitely defend their company, who else wont if they are not loyal freaks to them?<br><br>Multi-Level Marketing is really not a industry good to work in because you [b]make use</strong> of one another inside the industry. Imagine, you being recruited by your upline, work so hard to sell those I-dont-know-if-they-ever-can-be-trusted-products but have half your profits going to your upline and you not getting what you're supposed to get. Then you, recruiting others to do the same, sell the products and have half of their profits credited to you?<br><br>Let me explain why motivations &amp; seminars're involved inside Venture Era. It's only there to project what's being done externally. You need people with high morale to sell the products. You need people with motivation to sell the products, You need people with faith in your products for sales. You need to brainwash people to trust your products.<br><br>Who would want to keep your company in low spirits? People wont've confidence to sell. You'll've no income. I heard that they often emphasise on hardwork and share their experience up the business ladder? Who're you kidding?<br><br>Can anyone account for whether what they've said's true? Who knows you might be boasting your figures &amp; stuff? It's not a scam. But vicious attempts to push for sales.<br><br>==<br><br>One question I would like to ask Venture Era people here.<br><br>I see a common trend inside every account of people who've visited Venture Era to find out what it's like inside.<br><br><strong>Why</strong> is it that after you people promote and demonstrate the products inside that bloody office of you people, the manager <strong>must</strong> appear? To recruit people from their own customers? Pardon me lah, people. Why are you people soooo power-hungry? sooooo money-hungry? soooo authority-hungry? All for the sake of what? Promotion, promotion so that you people'll get MORE commission from you people's sales. I'm sure I'm not wrong about this.<br><br>Conclusion: Multi-Level Marketeers are just a bunch of people who have no life. The higher you get, the more money you get, the more people you make use of to get what you want. Often you people're ambitious to even talk about CARS.<br><br>http://www.venture-eragroup.com.sg.

            <div class='col-md body'>To Cenarious,<br><br>Good question <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, well the answer to that is simple. One must understand the core value of network marketing. Its a method of marketing products/services. Now, recruitment is an intent for opening new markets of consumers. Yes, everyone can be recruited, but not everyone has the means of time, energy or capacity to do it. So if you are saying half the world is recruited, then the whole world already has the products then, tt means the company should be the richest company in the world! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Haha, okok back to the point. The point is, true, firstly, people live and die and born as such, that means there is always waves of people in these people to people business. Secondly, for a company to stick to one product of an ulimited lifespan is insane.

            <div class='col-md body'>to Tib74uu<br><br>Survey=illegal w/o licensing<br>Questionairre=collection of mass data<br>Collection of mass data=motive of collection<br>motiv of collection= to con your money and make sure you be poor for the rest of your life and give your phone number to some mafia so you can lead a miserable life for the rest of your lives. (I was just kidding... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>Every questionairre has their motives. I have answered perfume retail questionairres, HMV qns, football clubs qns etc. And they all have the same motive, to LEAD you to their products of services. Since its legal, and the gov says its ok, it is OK. Nothin to be afraid ok lil' friend. No one is going to rob you. That is why it is a job market questionairre, to access are you worthy enough to be a businessman and such. Then we can LEAD you to develop tt. duh. Of course we wanna recruit you (not you, but anybobdy else I guess) but we can't justgo to people and say "hey! Im in MLM, I got great products! Can I recruit you?!"<br><br>Corwin_2k</div>
