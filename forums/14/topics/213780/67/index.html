              <p>I totally agree with you. I had lots of doubts before my
              sessions with the managers. Especially after reading this forum. I
              asked questions like, "Are you sure this will work?", "What will
              happen if you realize that it's actually harmful to health one
              day?" and "Is it too expensive?"</p>
              <p>I will have to say that I am convinced that their products are
              safe because they really have proofs to show. And the price isn't
              too expensive because it is regulated. There is a price ceiling and
              price floor for each product that they are selling. There is also
              installment packages to make the goods more affordable.</p>
              <p>Indeed if the customers have more knowledge than the salesmen,
              something is seriously wrong and we should all be alert. I was
              worried when I first saw the defenders of VE here. They seem to be
              bullcrapping and were at a loss of words when challenged. But the
              managers at VE were different.</p>

              <p>I'm not an expert in the products that they are selling. But they were able to produce a couple of certificates, articles and medals to support their claim. They really sounded convincing and they know their products very well. If all these are fake, I only have my luck to blame.</p>

              <p>Articles from Straits Times and most magazines/books are not the same as those from scientific journals; they carry zero weight to the scientific community unless they based their source (or made references) to scientific articles from recognized scientific journals.</p>

              <ul>
              <li>The typical magnet used produces insufficient <a title="Magnetic field" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field">magnetic field</a> to have any effect on muscle tissue, bones, blood vessels, or organs.<sup id="cite_ref-Park_Voodoo_0-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_therapy#cite_note-Park_Voodoo-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
              <li>Some manufacturers claim that the magnets help to circulate the blood by interacting with the iron in <a title="Hemoglobin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>, a major component of <a title="Red blood cell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_blood_cell">red blood cells</a>.
              There is no indication that circulatory benefits would result even if
              some blood component were to couple strongly to magnetic fields.</li>
              <li>Others claim that the magnets can restore the body's theorized
              "electromagnetic energy balance", but no such balance is medically
              recognized.</li>
              <li>Even in the many times stronger magnetic fields used in <a title="Magnetic resonance imaging" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a>, none of the claimed effects are observed.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_therapy#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></li>

              <li>Many of the websites that promote the benefits of magnetic therapy

              <p>Actually what you've provided here isn't really credible. Let's ignore that it's Wikipedia for a moment, because there may be some truth in it. So I've checked out the references stated in the Wikipedia and there's a large number of the links that lead to unavailable pages.</p>
              <p>And then, I found this page that is linked from Wikipedia.</p>
              <p>http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/magnet.html</p>
              <p>This person provided quite a good argument to the unproven medical evidence of magnetic therapy. But a number of his references are either not valid or have been removed. He has not been able to prove that magnetic therapy has no health effect also.</p>
              <p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9365349?dopt=Abstract</p>
              <p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12736891</p>
              <p>These are sites that he quoted to explain the insufficient evidence of magnetic therapy. However, if you read carefully, these are actually valid experiments proving the positive effects of magnetic therapy.</p>
              <p>And a large number of his argument were on the crimes of companies which claim to treat cancer, 
                      HIV, AIDS, asthma, arthritis, and rheumatism.</p>
              <p>http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/AG/CA/ehc.html</p>
              <p>http://news.therecord.com/article/300574</p>
              <p>However, to my knowledge, Venture Era has been focusing on prevention instead of treatment.</p>
              <p>Indeed there has been claims that magnetic therapy has no effect on human bodies. But there has been no sufficient evidence yet. As cited by the reference in Wikipedia in (http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/safety/index.cfm?pg=sfty_mr) to prove that "Even in the many times stronger magnetic fields used in <a title="Magnetic resonance imaging" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a>, none of the claimed effects are observed", the website itself has no evidence of what was being claimed by Wikipedia.</p>
              <p>Wikipedia has low credibility, as seen from the random citing of references such as this http://www.magno-pulse.com/restless_legs.php#introduction to explain the effects of magnetic therapy. Firstly, the evidence proved that magnetic therapy has an effect. Secondly, it's a completely different field of study as it's on leg care and not on blood circulation.</p>
              <p>My conclusion, I'm still confused! How can we ever find out if their products have been approved by the authorities in Singapore, or even as they have claimed, by the World Health Organisation?</p>

              <p>Good! I'm starting to like your analysis on the credibility part :D</p>
              <p>Do repeat what you have done and researched on wiki (which is actually what I think as well, I mean on the low credibility of wiki) on whatever product VE has before you decide.</p>
              <p>If you are still confused about what they have to say to you, just post out the articles or books they said, and whatever certs and medals they have for us to take a look together ;)</p>
