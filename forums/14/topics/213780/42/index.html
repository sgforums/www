              <p>Oh please elementalangel, when you are in doubt or clueless about somthing, you call people liars... Dont you think that you should learn how to crawl already? Big babies aint cute you know... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>I did average up to what you said... Dont you think its too much of a coincidence that when you quote 3-4 months, I averaged it to 3.5 months? You should have seen the pattern before accusing people... What a sore loser you are...</p>
              <p>Believe what you want... You are just a NOBODY... It's already good enough for you that I am entertaining you right now... Oh yeah... Still waiting on your 'business plan'... How come to this date, I havent seen your ad at VE bus stop? Suck your parents' money dry?</p>

              <p>How is it like blackmail? By having this mindset, are VE entreprenuers extorting money? If a person wants to leave is because they lose interest, motivation or whatever... No point keeping them at the office, they wont do anything... So what's the point wasting time with them?</p>

              <p>If you think they deserved to be called "losers" I have no comment. Wait til one day you leave VE and people call you loser. I hope you're not calling them so just to retain them inside the company.</p>
              <p>If they tell you that ppl who leave are losers, reflect on your upline's words. What if one of the uplines leave, are they are losers too? No? Those who call others losers need to learn some humility.</p>

              <p>One thing I realized about network marketers is that, they failed to understand this saying which goes, "One man's meat is another man's poison." In my point of view, one's progress in life aligns very closely with his/her interest, and don't you think that by trying to persuade, or as what many have said, "Brainwash" people into believing that "in this world where got interest-based jobs?", the new recruits would feel as though it's a chore to come to office everyday.</p>
              <p>Yes, you emphasized a lot about 'knowing what is business'. I respect that. But I do believe not everyone is cut out to do business, and some people still enjoy and prefer taking paychecks from their jobs and their own careers, be it in the F&amp;B industry, the government sector, like signing on as an officer, in the army, Navy, or police. That's their interest. They have totally no intention of setting up their own business. They're being content with what they have, and what they're doing.</p>
              <p>To be frank, I was an agent in VE 2 years back, but have since left the company, due to school projects and all. I don't wish to share my experience there, for I do not wish to receive any 'rebuttal' or 'shootbacks' from anyone.  I do not discourage Multi-Level Marketing from continuing, but I do hope that people in this industry do respect people when they have absolutely no intention of doing their own business. You can try to recruit them by any means, but by over-doing it, like trying to question their future regarding financial security, and that by telling them that their job has no future, I think that's downright outrageous. In fact, I was glad my downlines and I left the company.</p>

                  'rebuttal' or 'shootbacks' from anyone.  I do not discourage
                  Multi-Level Marketing from continuing, but I do hope that people in
                  this industry do respect people when they have absolutely no
                  intention of doing their own business. You can try to recruit them
                  by any means, but by over-doing it, like trying to question
                  their future regarding financial security, and that by telling them
                  that their job has no future, I think that's downright outrageous.
                  In fact, I was glad my downlines and I left the company.</p>

              <p>With regards to the above highlighted text..</p>
              <p>Most of which are stuffs which I really agree on..</p>
              <p>Maybe I'll just add some key phases to sum it up.</p>
              <p><strong>MLM is meant for EVERYONE; BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS CUT OUT FOR MLM.</strong></p>
              <p>Having said that..I believe only those who have at least tried it (those who did put in some effort in trying will understand it..)</p>
              <p>Will not explain the details since the way this thread is going..it's going nowhere from what I personally feel.. (Own Opinion..thus no need to reply nor quote my post.)</p>
              <p>As for the part about their interest..this part I don't really agree..</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It's about their characters and personalities which makes each individual to come up with each of their respectives' choices..be it working for others...signing on as a govt employees etc..</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most importantly..it's the situation that each individual is currently in to determine the path whereby they will go..thus not all are cut for MLM..</span></em></p>
              <p>it's their choice..as to how they come about with their own choices..most of it comes from their background..and the people they have being hanging around with..</p>
              <p>There's a saying like this:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">"You are who you mixed with"</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Example: A Begger mixing with Nine Other Millionaire Friends VERUS A Millionaire mixing with Nine Other Beggers..</span></strong></p>
              <p>Roughly get the idea?</p>
              <p>It's about finding your true calling..what you're passion about to really succeed..</p>
              <p>Why many people do MLM..is partially because of the exposure they have...</p>
              <p>I personally learnt way a lot..especially when the company has just started couple of years back...that's when all the key important knowledge are being passed around in search of potential leaders to lead the company..</p>
              <p>It's about time and network which choosing a company as well..</p>
              <p>Details wise..will not be shared..since here from what I see..are only about rebuttals over sharing..</p>

              <p>seems to me that you only read what you want to read... My philosophy is "if MLM is not for you then dont join"... BTW, opening a shop requires lots of money and maintening it too is also costly....</p>
              <p>Indeed MLM similar to opening a shop is a medium... But you too have to consider the costs difference... that's why many shops close when they run out of funds to maintain their shops...</p>
