            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, just wanna share some research i did on my own... coz i was also approached by a friend to join VE too..<br><br>Not that i am trying to defame VE or watsoever.. but just my 2 cents abt some issues raised in the discussions.... I dun want to state things without quoting sources as it discredit my arguments, so i will try to provide sources if i can.<br><br>1) I guess like any other ordinary people who is trying to find out more abt the company we are invited to join, 1st of all we will go to the official website to find out more..<br><br>http://www.venture-eragroup.com/ or the so called official site has been mentioned to be under construction/revamp process.. but if u look at the countdown ticker in the site, it seems to be at least under construction for over t+ 206 days since 2007 ( assuming that the ticker was meant for 2007 new year countdown purpose...)<br><br>so that avenue is out. and the other ebiz reg just gave some brief and vague description of VE that doesnt help in providing any insights of the company profile..<br><br>2) I agree with Lawerence that MLM is a business in aspect that it is exchanging products/services with other parties in exchange for monetary gains.. and the business model is rather successful in the west rather than sg..<br><br>I also noticed that Amway was mentioned as a success story to inspire MLM business model locally?<br><br>But apart from hearing such success stories from the "unbiased" sources like your fellow NWMers, do u know that Amway was involved in many legal lawsuits as well for their business practices?<br><br>Then Amway launched a sister company known as Quixtar that create new wave of controversies..<br><br>Below are some videos from youtube showing documentations of investigation into MLM business practices and the hoaxes<br><br>Part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot31XhgE_XE&amp;mode=related&amp;search=<br><br>Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgnvMfDu47c<br><br>Did your "unbiased sources" share this with u as well when they inspires u with the many "zeroes" sales figures?<br><br>3) I strongly believe (my own person opinion tho) that for a business to be sustainable, the product must be credible and I must BELIEVE in the very product i am selling.<br><br>so i did some research again on<br><br>a) electromagnetic therapy<br><br>So far, there are no concrete evidence that electromagnets improve health conditions.. anyway some simple reasoning that doesnt requires a rocket scientist to understand - Researchers in high-energy physics laboratories can work for hours per day with their whole body immersed in magnetic fields far stronger than those from the bracelets, and there is no evidence they are more or less healthy than their peers.<br><br>for more info, u can check this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_therapy<br><br>b) Calstar Ionized Water<br><br>There is inadequate scientific evidence to conclude that alkaline water is beneficial to our health.<br><br>Hist summary of Ionized Water: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_water<br><br>Oppositions of Alkaline water: http://www.chem1.com/CQ/ionbunk.html<br><br>My take on the whole issues:<br><br>The enthusiastic VEers to be blamed? hmm I think they made to think this way and trust their products and leaders, so the response from them to defend their company and product is very natural.. Not that they wanna scam people... but i really think they feel that their products works...<br>They already invested so much time and efforts into this "entrepreneurship" to pull out i think..<br><br>But i feel that they shouldnt label the anti-MLMers "ignorant" and deny the possiblities of that the anti-MLMers might be right... by doing so, arent you being "ignorant" too?<br><br>As for whether the products really works.. from the research, i really doubt so, even if people using it claim that it works, it could be due to placebo effects or psychological effects... and not really becoz the product works..<br><br>definition of placebo effects in case the 18yrs olds doing MLM doesnt know: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/placebo%20effect<br><br>Last point, for me to charge someone a product that I know 80-90%% of the retail price goes into pockets of sales pple as commissions.. and not into R&amp;D/product manufacturing costs is really too shrew for my taste.. so i dun think i am cut out for MLM as well..<br><br>Okies sorry for the long post, again the above are just my personal views and for sharing/discussion purposes..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quoted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_therapy<br><br>Scientific tests of magnetic therapy for the treatment of wrist pain from carpal tunnel syndrome and chronic low back pain have concluded that <strong>there is no health benefit from magnetic fields in those cases</strong>. Blinding of any study into the efficacy of magnetic therapy is problematic as the participants in the study may easily ascertain whether they have been issued with a genuine magnet or a placebo dummy.<br><br>So VE? is that true or? please give an answer. proof to us that these magnetic therapy works.<br><br><strong>Criticism of magnet therapy focuses on scientific facts about magnets, including that:<br><br>The typical magnet used produces insufficient magnetic field to have a lasting effect on muscle tissue, bones, blood vessels, or organs.<br>Researchers in high-energy physics laboratories can work for hours per day with their whole body immersed in magnetic fields far stronger than those from the bracelets, and there is no evidence they are more or less healthy than their peers.<br>No magnet healing manufacturer has demonstrated scientifically that its products achieve what they claim, and most cannot agree on what exactly the magnetic fields do.<br>Some manufacturers claim that the magnets help to circulate the blood by some interaction with the iron in hemoglobin, a major component of red blood cells. However in its ionised form, iron is not ferromagnetic and cannot be affected by magnets.<br>Others claim that the magnets can restore the body's theorised electromagnetic energy balance. There are also claims that the south pole of a magnet acts differently on the body than the north pole.[citation needed]<br>Many of the websites that provide information and resources promoting the benefits of magnetic therapy belong to individuals and companies that profit from the sale of magnetic therapy products.<br>Water is a diamagnetic material, and thus cannot be magnetized. In addition, attempts to sell "north pole" or "south pole" magnetized water to treat different conditions ignore the fact that magnetized ferromagnetic materials inevitably acquire both a north and a south pole; science yet to have found evidence for the existence of magnetic monopoles.</strong><br><br>It is all from the website of wikipedia.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br><br><strong>nellee<br>is a Young Genkian</strong><br><br>It's odd how some people want rewards such as cars without working for it. It's called a reward for a reason, it's to REWARD you for your hardwork and effort. Do you really think there's such a thing as free lunch - or even an easy lunch - in the world? If you want financial freedom or a car (even if it's a cheap car) you gotta work for it. Let me ask you, at the age of 18 with at the most an A level cert, or let's say you're fabulous, you're 21 with a degree. Imagine going that path and then let me ask you,<br><br>When're you going to be driving a BMW or a Mercs, living in a bungalow with enough money to go on holidays on whim?<br><br>When you're sixty and dying? To feeble to take a plane?<br><br>Or maybe you dream that you'll be like those people who set up a business - your usual rags to riches story - and become successful seemingly overnight?<br><br>Let me laugh at you before I continue. Do you realize that those people are one in maybe a few hundred thousand?<br><br>Or maybe your parents are filthy rich and they GIVE you a BMV. Wow. But when people ask you, how'd you get your car? "Oh, my parents gave it to me." What will people think of you? Three words: Spoilt. Rich. KID.<br><br>People doubt companies like Venture Era because they say "Oh, because of this MLM company, I neglect my studies." Oh, I'm sorry, did the managers say, "YOU BETTER STOP STUDYING AND GIVE YOUR FULL ATTENTION TO VENTURE ERA." No, right? It's your own choice (subconcious or not) and your own lousy time management.<br><br>Now I'm not saying that working at MLM companies (in particular Venture Era, because I'm a distributor there) is not time consuming. I will not lie, it is. It's tiring and stressful too. But come on, no pain, no gain.<br><br>Look at all the people slogging away in their 9 to 5 jobs, attempting to climb the corporate ladder before being dragged down with several knives in their back. Is that not tiring? Stressful? Time consuming?<br><br>Life is not so easy! Come on. Working in a 9 to 5 job for, say, 30 years is easier? Gives you more rewards that Venture Era? Gets you a BMW? Gives you a holiday to the Bahamas?<br><br>Now i'm not saying that it's the ONLY way to financial freedom. You can be a neuro surgeon, or a litigator or an auditor. Or maybe even the president. OF COURSE you'll have a lot of money and cars and things, but the question is, do you have what it takes to be them?<br><br>If you do, good! I genuinely respect these people. They're brilliant and capable people. And I'm sure they'll have their BMWs at the very least by the time they're 40? So in a few years, when you guys turn 40 and I turn 21, we can finally drive our BMWs together eh?<br><br>But what if you don't have what it takes to be them? Then what do you do?<br><br><strong>Venture Era is offering people an EASIER route to acheiving your car, residual income, financial freedom,</strong> PURELY, because it's a pioneering company. It's been around for 6 years and is still going strong. It's still considered young! THAT, my dear friends, is why it is EASIER and POSSIBLE (as seen by the 25 car achievers) to get your car at such a young age! Try joining an MLM company that's been around for say, 40 years? By the time you reach your deathbed, you'd still be a few decades away from achieving their incentives. Why? BECAUSE THEY'RE ESTABLISHED!<br><br>I have one last point to cover. Ah, finally my long post is coming to an end.<br><br>Now, people say Venture Era is about force selling and that being in the company alienates friends and family. Blame your managers all you want, but ultimately, who is the one calling your friends and family? Who's the one talking to them and asking them to come down? Darlings, it's the WAY you approach them. Learn some tact and maybe then you'll still have your family and friends.<br><br>If you're not willing to give Venture Era a chance based on GOSSIP you've heard, then I say, your loss. Read up about it from NON BIASED sources and listen to your own common sense. Only losers can't judge by themselves. And only losers and listen blindly to what the other losers say.<br><br>So I'll wave to you while you're walking home in the middle of the night and I'm honking the horn in my very own BMW. Ah, I love the smell of leather seats in a brand spanking new car.</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>What crap.... ok... financial freedom.<br><br>Let's say you've got no sales for the whole month = no income?
