              <p>Frankly, having spent few years mixing with them, they would not
              be able to provide you an answer. The struggles they have, the
              significant rate of failures, the low standard of professionalism
              makes the industry what it is today, what we Chinese called 'guo
              jie lau shu'</p>
              <p>I did hope they would raise the standards equal to any other
              industry in the world, but there is a persistent drive not to do
              so. You see his posts, its still the same as the agents I lambasted
              on the first page of this topic.</p>

              <p>Hey, let the guy do what he wants to do lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you all keep telling him to quit MLM or that MLM is a road
                  to nowhere, it only gives him the resolve to stick on (until he
                  learns the painful truth himself later on in life).  That's
                  one of the techniques that MLM "managers" or "mentors" tell their
                  charges to screw with their minds - keep telling them the rest of
                  the people are jealous of their success, will want to bring you
                  down, criticise you etc.  And that sticking to their MLM
                  beliefs shows strength of character. yada yada.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A lot of these young impressionable teens think they will be the
                  next millionaire because they have been bombarded with all these
                  "get rich if you just stick to the MLM course" messages.  Just
                  let them learn it the hard way lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Firstly, I think that this is very enlightening. It really has brought in another perspective and I feel that it is valid. Now I can go and test my mentor to see if he really is screwing with my mind. <br><br>Secondly, I will not disappear. I will still be here posting my thoughts until when I go army. By then even if I want to post I also cannot, cause weekends are so precious that I might not even want to play dota or use the computer when I am out from camp. <br><br>Thirdly, maybe many youngsters think that school certs are useless. To me that is bullshit too. Without a proper degree or diploma, you can go nowhere. Maybe some job that gives you 1-2k a month, but never more.

              <p>Firstly, I think that this is very enlightening. It really has
                  brought in another perspective and I feel that it is valid. Now I
                  can go and test my mentor to see if he really is screwing with my
                  mind.<br> <br> Secondly, I will not disappear. I will still be here posting my
                  thoughts until when I go army. By then even if I want to post I
                  also cannot, cause weekends are so precious that I might not even
                  want to play dota or use the computer when I am out from
                  camp.<br> <br> Thirdly, maybe many youngsters think that school certs are useless.
                  To me that is bullshit too. Without a proper degree or diploma, you
                  can go nowhere. Maybe some job that gives you 1-2k a month, but
                  never more. People can follow the footsteps of Bill Gates or Warren
                  Buffett, but is one as determined as them?<br> <br> And yup my associate leader showed me his paycheck.
                  Disgusting.<br> <br> Hmm why am I MichaelJohn now?</p>

              <p>For tuitioning as a part time job, there are quite a number out there earning 5 figures. And especially for physics.com.sg, he earns &gt;20k monthly, working only 2 hours a day for 4 of the weekdays, and 4 hours a day for both weekends.</p>
              <p>So why not be a tutor?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is that a big paycheck?</p>
              <p>Or how about Adam Wong, an internet marketer who proclaimed that he is earning USD21k monthly at 25 yrs old by working only 4 hrs a day, and endorsed by Adam Khoo</p>

              <p>This is sgforums speech. What he meant was that whether we can
