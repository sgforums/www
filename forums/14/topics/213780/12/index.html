Let me challenge you.<br><br>What do they teach u in MLM other than how to sell and persuade ppl?<br>You think they'll "change your lives" just because they want to? Or do they want you to sell for them? You can change your life by joining social organisations or being volunteer/social worker. At least it benefits society.<br><br>Start a biz? That's what I've been hearing. So they group you into groups, train you, encourage you, and declare that you're on your own, starting a business? And yet ironically they call u "agents"? Distributors? So VE thinks of themselves as suppliers? In a business you buy, you sell and get the earnings from sales. But MLM leh? A PATHETIC few % of sales.<br><br>Working for others? In large companies there's no real boss. There's CEO, exec board ect. The CEO is chosen by the boards and shareholders. CEO of a company can be considered as an employee too. The highest paid CEOs here, of UOB and Venture Corp. See their pay. A few millions.<br><br>Ok fine, I see people making 10K a month, but its not guaranteed success. Even the take home pay is not fixed. What are the chances of success? Ppl don't dare take the job in VE? Why do you dare not take a job with basic pay? At least it's guaranteed income. Yes, you always say people get rich, but what's the percentage of successes? Dare not say how many people failed? If you say those who failed are failures, that goes against your 'principle' of encouraging people thru all those highly charged talks and lively seminars.Try to go on strike for few weeks. See how your upline react. As their income depends on you. Don't work as slaves. Don't channel your money to your uplines. Get what you deserve, like a basic pay. In business, you get what you earn. You call this business? MORE LIKE MONKEY BUSINESS.<br><br>Destiny. Measured in? Monetary income? Sales? Fame?<br>Or exceeding your own expectations? I rather do a job I have passion in, I have greater sense of satisfaction and I would love my job.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>helo all ..<br><br>Been awhile since i posted.<br>Went on holidays (enjoy before NS) and had some other<br>agendas to priorities for awhile before VE comes back to mind.<br><br>At the same time it showed me that VE is purely business by nature.<br>Many can call having their own business as a job.<br>And many can claim they dont have what it takes to be a business man.<br>Others just dont have the attitude for business.<br><br>I had a chat with a close friend of mine.<br>He mentioned about his father and his business. (lets say father = Mr A)<br>Mr A started out his working career selling speakers.<br>From there he equipt himself with the know-hows of selling/buying.<br>The right words to use/ how to push for sales and etc.<br>Thus, he took he chances and went into his own business.<br>He shared with his son that he thrived because of one thing.<br>Self belief that he can earn money this way and that selling/buying never stops. Be it selling the product, the company or himself.<br>Everything else that you guys think are un-ethical ways are still ways to succeed.<br><br>What i'd like to share is that business works that way.<br>Anybody can do it, but not everybody will be successful.<br>Alot of whom started feel the loss in income felt that they<br>dont have what it takes to succeed hence, fail.<br><br>In reference to VE,<br>VE is just doing business.<br>Some of you might like it, some of you might not.<br>So most those who really are grabbing this opportunity to succeed<br>in there is going all out to make sure they do. Self Belief.<br>It will be a pain in the ass to those who are not in favour of business or<br>VE itself.<br>But take a look from afar, those who suceed in VE are only<br>people who have grabbed this opportunity so tightly that it doesnt matter how<br>negative you might feel about VE.<br>Its just 1 more lost out of 4 million more of SG population.<br><br>Every other insurance agent whose succeeded also feel the same way.<br>I take reference from successful insurance agents as well.<br><br>To end it off, what more can you guys say to deter them ?<br>Some of you might have different reasons for joining in the first place,<br>and you feel cheated or otherwise because you dont get what your promised.<br>Guys, do ask yourself if u've dig deep to really tell yourself you've done all it takes to succeed?<br>Be it in VE or other kind of business.<br><br>I'm not one who has promoted VE in anyway since I first posted.<br>But I have been one to grab opportunities as the come.<br>Tight enough to succeed, only the future will tell so till then, i'll not<br>quit on business yet.<br>Take it easy all.</div>
