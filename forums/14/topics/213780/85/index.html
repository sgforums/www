              firms do it, does it mean almost or all MNCs do it? Those unethical
              ones are facing rep problems. VE is already in a very bad rep

              <p>I also stick to my stand. If you want to sell something, then you have to be prepared to address your customers who may well know more than you. If a customer who knows all about magnetism asks you 'So... exactly how does magnetic therapy work? Does it magnetise the blood or something?', then you had better be prepared to address him.</p>
              <p>Ask your advisor as to how the magnetic therapy and air system works. Ask for hard scientific proof of how they work, and not just anecdotal evidence like customer testimonials.</p>
              <p>If and when you do go to university, you will see that such anecdotal evidence will never hold in the absence of valid proof like controlled experiments and well-documented simulations. Your professor will just ask you 'So what?' and continue to bombard you because he knows better, and you haven't showed him that you know something that he doesn't.</p>
              <p>If you want to know, both Eagle and I are engineers as well, by the way. We are both taught to always ask how things work and raise questions when something doesn't seem to square well with what we know.</p>
