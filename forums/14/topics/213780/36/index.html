              <p>Haha guys, please read carefully and closely. Don't be
              too fast with ur words, i didn't said it
              will cure or treated. Be realistic bro, today if you go
              for operation, doctors will never tell you its a 100%
              success. What ever you see on commercials they will never tell
              you its 100%, but thats the fact that it helps. Bro
              seriously go read up on books please.</p>
              <p>lmao..</p>
              <p>Go to bookstores health section, in MPH or Kinokuniya( i think
              its spelled like tat) haha. Go and read up.</p>
              <p>Haha frankly speaking the more negative people in the
              market the more happy i will become. To alot of
              people they might be thinking ' wa! Doesn't
              tat means alot of people won't get it from me!
              Wa very difficult to do' .</p>
              <p>Haha to me, i'm simple, people don't do it, i do
              it, when People negative, they will limit themselves
              from executing, and starts to give excuses and pushing the
              blame away. And here comes a chance. First of all i know products
              work and i study them, and the good thing
              is theres alot of people who never study about it
              and comment on it or heard from others. What i got to do is to
              educate on how the product can help, and service, isn't that
              what me as a salesman should do. Second of all teach customers
              how to use it and fortnightly check on how customers doing, still
              getting use to the products.. etc, visit them occasionally, buy
              something for them. The best thing is when your customer call you
              back and thank you. It feels really good. It double up their
              confidence in you, they are more than willing to assist you.</p>
              <p>1) they trust your product.</p>
              <p>2) they trust your servicing [don't think wrongly <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> i'm clean, what they know is serious
              and your not doing this half-hearted]</p>
              <p>They will spread word of mouth and thats how your system kick
              start.</p>
              <p>Now thats what i call servicing. If you do it right its a no
              problem. This will be a cycle, and not just customer get
              it once from you and leave it there. You need to
              put in effort.</p>
              <p>Three kinds of people who will never get this
              right:</p>
              <p>1) People who refuse to execute and remains the
              same.</p>
              <p>2) People always feels that he/she is right or never
              even do it properly.</p>
              <p>3) People who wants something in return for whatever
              they have contributed.</p>
              <p>This is the technique what people in the sales&amp;marketing are
              doing. Read books on how people around the world are doing sales.
              That is why people are doing well in sales and some are
              not. This is not just pure luck or having a good market. I've seen
              people doing it with 'Yellow Pages', Co-operate sales. Get this
              clear its not who the person you look for, its
              the time, sincerity, passion that the person is having
              when they go out for appointments.</p>
              <p>If this way of doing is wrong, then seriously you will be
              penalising people all over the world who are making it big. I
              know you are very rational in what you have in mind. But
              slowly this debate will show how irrational a person
              can  be. Its already very obvious, when
              everyone in the thread is dwelling upon 'overpricing',
              'law thingy',etc.</p>
              <p>Good Luck readers</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>if you think sincerity and such canot be measured by money, then why are you rambling around the points that the products are worth it because of the service?</p>
              <p>you choosing to ignore all other points shows how you have actually conceeded to the fact that VE has no other point that it can argue on besides 'service' .</p>
              <p>And to back everything up, would u please tell us you rank and we will talk about it. if you have 100+ customers, i seriously dont think you would call them fort-nightly as you would find it a chore to do so.</p>
              <p>maybe what u ment by service is when a mlmer works as a Tele-marketer , door-to-door promoter, casher , after selling service staff, "expert" in magnetic/ virtually useless products with over-rated effects , cult-like recruter, profession liars who lie without guilt and try to lie to themselves to get over it, after sales service that you provide, casher ( like pass the money to ur admin ).</p>
              <p>i guess if you add everything together you might get a "reasonable" price for your service. btw VE sells their products for about 3k and u only get a 400- 600 dolars commission. did VE provide the other 3k- (400 to 600) service?</p>
              <p>its the agents who give the service, not VE so over-pricing the products and giving service as an excuse dont count at all, even if VE sells all their major products 1k cheaper, it would still be more expensive than the market value..</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>You quote, "Very simple if you can</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">find ANY products which can cleanse ur liver and kidney and at the same time detox your body without taking any drugs</span> and </li>
              <li>able to find testimonials on people who recovered from kidney failure, cancers, diabetics, tumour, hepatitis B, Stones.And its able to help people even in last stage cancer and AIDs. "</li>
              </ol>
              <p>There are loads of detoxifying products that are way cheaper out there in the market.</p>
              <p>Bro, you are contradicting yourself, 1st you said that VE products are able to recover patients health from the sickness/diseases that you have mentioned. Then in your 2nd post you claimed it doenst necessary cure or treat the patient. So which one is it?</p>
              <p>By the way, how does it help with patients with last stage of cancer and AIDs. Most likely they wont survive. So how does it help? Release pain?</p>
              <p>I think that you should go to the book stores that you have mentioned above and read up on health diseases etc. I do study medical sciences, dont try and challenge my knowledge unless you too study in the same field. Is there any scientific evidence that VE product works on everyone? If there is, show us links or reference of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">scientific research</span> to back up your claims.</p>
              <p>One eg. Magnetic therapy, for my mum, she does feel the effect but for my dad, its vice versa. I do understand that magnetic therapy work on some people, but NOT all. When I was in VE, the agents there claimed that magnetic therapy is for ALL. They should some documentary videos of magnetic therapy. The video doenst even seem reliable.</p>
              <p>Many people here do have negative opinion on VE, how is it that we limit ourselves and give excuses and push the blame away? We have negative opinions is due to consequences of many bad actions from VE agents.</p>
              <p>You claimed that you study your products well. From who? Your bosses? Is it it's they say so it has to be true?! Come on, back up with scientific research, not some hu-ha theory that this product works this way.</p>
              <p>When you 'educate' prospects, you educate them with what you know, which may<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> not even be true!</span></p>
              <p>From your post, you seemed as if you are doing well with customer service, which is good.</p>
              <p> However, its not worth the extra hundreds of dollars. You mentioned that service has no monetary value to compare to. How about the commissions that you are receiving? And that is little compared to the price that VE is selling at.</p>
              <p>Calculate this:</p>
              <p>Price of Product(VE) - your commission- upline commission - initial price of product - shipping - storage - miscelleneous = what is left is pay for Boss and C.A.s (which is alot)</p>
              <p>So the price of customer service that YOU provide MOSTLY goes to the boss and CAs!</p>
              <p>As I have said, use your own brain to think. Dont just follow blindly, cause when you fall, you wont even know what hit you.</p>

              <p>Today, I was doing some cleaning in my room and I found my old notebooks when I was in VE.</p>
              <p>I read back the notebooks and realised how stupid and brainwashed i was in VE.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is from mid 2006</span></p>
              <p>Steven Ho quote : VE product is the best and better than other co.s</p>
              <p>Kit Tan quote : No need read books, go out and do sales. Always ask for referrals.</p>
              <p>                                Its good that you are studying at the same time doing this business of yours, but always remember, you are doing business full time and school part time. Follow Mr. Dewey's eg. he skipped so many classes during his poly so that he could help me with my presentation. Look at where he is now. earning 5 figure income every month.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One quotes from individuals in VE:</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li>People who left VE are all in good terms. None of them have bad impressions of VE.<strong> ( What a lie! How many people hates VE now?!)</strong></li>
              <li>VE made me a more humble and mature person. <strong>( Really, how come there's a lot of childish VE agents around? More humble? Come on, there's so many arrogant managers and car achievers in VE, condemning those working 8-5 and driving below 2000CC cars)</strong></li>
              <li>Trust, believe and follow your seniors and you can reach your dreams. <strong>( Of course, be as blind as the 3 blind mice)</strong></li>
              <li>You all will be able to drive ferraris one day, and never have to work again and retire at a very young age. <strong>( A possible dream, but to retire early? Not with mlm, once no one is under you, you have no money)</strong></li>
              <li>VE  ionic calcium treat cancer and many diseases. <strong>( Lets see some scientific evidence)</strong></li>
              <li>MLM business is cheapest and easiest business to do. VE system is better than binary system. Worst than binary system is traditional business where many fail and lose a lot of money. In VE, your chances of success is higher<strong>.( Why is the attrition rate in mlm is very high?)</strong></li>
              <li>Saturation will never happen in singapore. There are also foreign workers here. Once all friends and relatives join, then recruit from other companies after that, recruit foreigners(banglahs etc.) . After that we can also recruit people from the whole world. <strong>( Ridiculous isnt it?)</strong></li>
              <li>I asked this qns," If too acidic burn, what happens if its too alkaline?" The ans," this would never happen as Singapore unhealthy eating habits, environment and lifestyle are causing more acidity. So, its impossible to have too alkaline<strong>".(Avoiding the 1st question. What is it with telling that too much alkaline will burn too? BTW, our stomach is acidic, once we take in alkaline, wont it be neutral. Taking alkaline should actually hurt our stomach since its supposed to be acidic to digest our food.)</strong></li>
              <li>It doesnt matter about the product, as long as we can make the sale its alright, regardless of the reason for the sale. <strong>( So much about caring for the customer 1st)</strong></li>
              <li>Keep calling your friends, ask them out for coffee. Convince them that VE is good for them. Never give up until they say NO ten times. <strong>( applaude for 'dont give up' attitude,  but surely irritate a lot of people that they surely wont join you anyways)</strong></li>
              <li>VE magnetic mattress is better than DW, Enyouth etc. VE magnetic mattress is the best, we have round magnets not the stripe ones from other co.s. We have more layers for comfortablity etc. That's y we are the best. <strong>( Claiming to be the best even though it is based on THEIR opinions.)</strong></li>
              <li>VE water system is better than Diamond because we have added ionic calcium which is better than just diamonds filteration system<strong>.( Condemning other co.s)</strong></li>
              <li>It doesnt matter, just get your friends to the office. Give some reason for them to come, then we'll talk to them about the business plan. In a way, by getting them to come down to office, we are actually helping them. <strong>( Denial! Giving excuses for their wrong doings)</strong></li>
              <li>Pyramid selling and MLM is different thing. MLM have product, Pyramid selling dont have product. That's y it wont fall. <strong>( Yes, they are different, however their structure is the same. Less people on top, more people below. Either way it will fall. More importantly, in both system, the below are are giving money to the top without the top contributing anything. Unlike a traditional co. structure, the top pays the ones below.)</strong></li>
              <li>Prevention is better than cure. Using VE product can prevent heart disease, cholesterol, diabetes, cancers etc. <strong>( Really, then confirm if I use VE product, I wont get all these diseases? give me a break)</strong></li>
              <li>The person who made this ionic calcium as it is once had cancer. He was beyond cure and doctors cant do anything to help him.

              <p>Today, I was doing some cleaning in my room and I found my old notebooks when I was in VE.</p>
              <p>I read back the notebooks and realised how stupid and brainwashed i was in VE.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is from mid 2006</span></p>

              <p>Kit Tan quote : No need read books, go out and do sales. Always ask for referrals.</p>
              <p>                                Its good that you are studying at the same time doing this business of yours, but always remember, you are doing business full time and school part time. Follow Mr. Dewey's eg. he skipped so many classes during his poly so that he could help me with my presentation. Look at where he is now. earning 5 figure income every month.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One quotes from individuals in VE:</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li>People who left VE are all in good terms. None of them have bad impressions of VE. <strong>( What a lie! How many people hates VE now?!)</strong></li>
              <li>VE made me a more humble and mature person. <strong>( Really, how come there's a lot of childish VE agents around? More humble? Come on, there's so many arrogant managers and car achievers in VE, condemning those working 8-5 and driving below 2000CC cars)</strong></li>
              <li>Trust, believe and follow your seniors and you can reach your dreams. <strong>( Of course, be as blind as the 3 blind mice)</strong></li>
              <li>You all will be able to drive ferraris one day, and never have to work again and retire at a very young age. <strong>( A possible dream, but to retire early? Not with mlm, once no one is under you, you have no money)</strong></li>
              <li>VE  ionic calcium treat cancer and many diseases. <strong>( Lets see some scientific evidence)</strong></li>
              <li>MLM business is cheapest and easiest business to do. VE system is better than binary system. Worst than binary system is traditional business where many fail and lose a lot of money. In VE, your chances of success is higher<strong>.( Why is the attrition rate in mlm is very high?)</strong></li>
              <li>Saturation will never happen in singapore. There are also foreign workers here. Once all friends and relatives join, then recruit from other companies after that, recruit foreigners(banglahs etc.) . After that we can also recruit people from the whole world. <strong>( Ridiculous isnt it?)</strong></li>
              <li>I asked this qns," If too acidic burn, what happens if its too alkaline?" The ans," this would never happen as Singapore unhealthy eating habits, environment and lifestyle are causing more acidity. So, its impossible to have too alkaline<strong>".(Avoiding the 1st question. What is it with telling that too much alkaline will burn too? BTW, our stomach is acidic, once we take in alkaline, wont it be neutral. Taking alkaline should actually hurt our stomach since its supposed to be acidic to digest our food.)</strong></li>
              <li>It doesnt matter about the product, as long as we can make the sale its alright, regardless of the reason for the sale. <strong>( So much about caring for the customer 1st)</strong></li>
              <li>Keep calling your friends, ask them out for coffee. Convince them that VE is good for them. Never give up until they say NO ten times. <strong>( applaude for 'dont give up' attitude,  but surely irritate a lot of people that they surely wont join you anyways)</strong></li>
              <li>VE magnetic mattress is better than DW, Enyouth etc. VE magnetic mattress is the best, we have round magnets not the stripe ones from other co.s. We have more layers for comfortablity etc. That's y we are the best. <strong>( Claiming to be the best even though it is based on THEIR opinions.)</strong></li>
              <li>VE water system is better than Diamond because we have added ionic calcium which is better than just diamonds filteration system<strong>.( Condemning other co.s)</strong></li>
              <li>It doesnt matter, just get your friends to the office. Give some reason for them to come, then we'll talk to them about the business plan. In a way, by getting them to come down to office, we are actually helping them. <strong>( Denial! Giving excuses for their wrong doings)</strong></li>
              <li>Pyramid selling and MLM is different thing. MLM have product, Pyramid selling dont have product. That's y it wont fall. <strong>( Yes, they are different, however their structure is the same. Less people on top, more people below. Either way it will fall. More importantly, in both system, the below are are giving money to the top without the top contributing anything. Unlike a traditional co. structure, the top pays the ones below.)</strong></li>
              <li>Prevention is better than cure. Using VE product can prevent heart disease, cholesterol, diabetes, cancers etc. <strong>( Really, then confirm if I use VE product, I wont get all these diseases? give me a break)</strong></li>
              <li>The person who made this ionic calcium as it is once had cancer. He was beyond cure and doctors cant do anything to help him. He sold his property, business assets etc. and then he found a magical powder given by his uncle in Japan. He consumed it and wa-lah, he got better and his cancer was gone. <strong>( Such a miracle, doctors should have used this miracle powder!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">)</strong></li>

              That is to allow them to tee up themselves in front of their friends. Imagine if your friend is a manager of a compnay, you will be more interested to find out more and is more willing to listen to them.
              
              Another thing is that the rank make them feel good. But not all the managers there earn a few k, what normal managers outside are earning.
              
              Besides, getting to manager rank in VE is not hard, the first manager rank in Enyouth is DM, second highest rank and AM in DW, third highest. In VE, I don't think MM is even half way up the ladder yet.

              <p>Today, I was doing some cleaning in my room and I found my old notebooks when I was in VE.</p>
              <p>I read back the notebooks and realised how stupid and brainwashed i was in VE.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is from mid 2006</span></p>
              <p>Steven Ho quote : VE product is the best and better than other co.s</p>
              <p>Kit Tan quote : No need read books, go out and do sales. Always ask for referrals.</p>
              <p>                                Its good that you are studying at the same time doing this business of yours, but always remember, you are doing business full time and school part time. Follow Mr. Dewey's eg. he skipped so many classes during his poly so that he could help me with my presentation. Look at where he is now. earning 5 figure income every month.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One quotes from individuals in VE:</span></p>
              <ol>
              <li>People who left VE are all in good terms. None of them have bad impressions of VE. <strong>( What a lie! How many people hates VE now?!)</strong></li>
              <li>VE made me a more humble and mature person. <strong>( Really, how come there's a lot of childish VE agents around? More humble? Come on, there's so many arrogant managers and car achievers in VE, condemning those working 8-5 and driving below 2000CC cars)</strong></li>
              <li>Trust, believe and follow your seniors and you can reach your dreams. <strong>( Of course, be as blind as the 3 blind mice)</strong></li>
              <li>You all will be able to drive ferraris one day, and never have to work again and retire at a very young age. <strong>( A possible dream, but to retire early? Not with mlm, once no one is under you, you have no money)</strong></li>
              <li>VE  ionic calcium treat cancer and many diseases. <strong>( Lets see some scientific evidence)</strong></li>
              <li>MLM business is cheapest and easiest business to do. VE system is better than binary system. Worst than binary system is traditional business where many fail and lose a lot of money. In VE, your chances of success is higher<strong>.( Why is the attrition rate in mlm is very high?)</strong></li>
              <li>Saturation will never happen in singapore. There are also foreign workers here. Once all friends and relatives join, then recruit from other companies after that, recruit foreigners(banglahs etc.) . After that we can also recruit people from the whole world. <strong>( Ridiculous isnt it?)</strong></li>
              <li>I asked this qns," If too acidic burn, what happens if its too alkaline?" The ans," this would never happen as Singapore unhealthy eating habits, environment and lifestyle are causing more acidity. So, its impossible to have too alkaline<strong>".(Avoiding the 1st question. What is it with telling that too much alkaline will burn too? BTW, our stomach is acidic, once we take in alkaline, wont it be neutral. Taking alkaline should actually hurt our stomach since its supposed to be acidic to digest our food.)</strong></li>
              <li>It doesnt matter about the product, as long as we can make the sale its alright, regardless of the reason for the sale. <strong>( So much about caring for the customer 1st)</strong></li>
              <li>Keep calling your friends, ask them out for coffee. Convince them that VE is good for them. Never give up until they say NO ten times. <strong>( applaude for 'dont give up' attitude,  but surely irritate a lot of people that they surely wont join you anyways)</strong></li>
              <li>VE magnetic mattress is better than DW, Enyouth etc. VE magnetic mattress is the best, we have round magnets not the stripe ones from other co.s. We have more layers for comfortablity etc. That's y we are the best. <strong>( Claiming to be the best even though it is based on THEIR opinions.)</strong></li>
              <li>VE water system is better than Diamond because we have added ionic calcium which is better than just diamonds filteration system<strong>.( Condemning other co.s)</strong></li>
              <li>It doesnt matter, just get your friends to the office. Give some reason for them to come, then we'll talk to them about the business plan. In a way, by getting them to come down to office, we are actually helping them. <strong>( Denial! Giving excuses for their wrong doings)</strong></li>
              <li>Pyramid selling and MLM is different thing. MLM have product, Pyramid selling dont have product. That's y it wont fall. <strong>( Yes, they are different, however their structure is the same. Less people on top, more people below. Either way it will fall. More importantly, in both system, the below are are giving money to the top without the top contributing anything. Unlike a traditional co. structure, the top pays the ones below.)</strong></li>
              <li>Prevention is better than cure. Using VE product can prevent heart disease, cholesterol, diabetes, cancers etc. <strong>( Really, then confirm if I use VE product, I wont get all these diseases? give me a break)</strong></li>
              <li>The person who made this ionic calcium as it is once had cancer. He was beyond cure and doctors cant do anything to help him. He sold his property, business assets etc. and then he found a magical powder given by his uncle in Japan. He consumed it and wa-lah, he got better and his cancer was gone. <strong>( Such a miracle, doctors should have used this miracle powder!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">)</strong></li>
              </ol>
              <p>The ones that I bold are those that I give my opinion on.</p>
