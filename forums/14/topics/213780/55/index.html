              <p>I have already stated what I meant (that pacer's efforts will come to naught), but you still persist in going out of point and tell me defamation is serious. This has been pointed out to you not just once. Just because you can't find and show me any other forums that will take responsibilities for the posts their members make doesn't justify why you should bring in irrelevant stuff.</p>
              <p>It's not that I'm immune; it's merely that the examples I see here are indeed childish and immature ones. Only people with low EQ (stupidissmart, gazelle) would be that sorely affected. Don't join their ranks.</p>

              <p><strong>Broadcast statements.</strong><br><strong>3.</strong> For
                  the purpose of the law of libel and slander, the broadcasting of
                  words by means of telecommunication shall be treated as publication
                  in a permanent form.</p>
              <p>It seems we have 2 different idea of publication... you seem to think publication need to be poof read by some type if quality manager before its caled a publication... but in fact, publication is defined as anything written, in short "anything you can see and touch", if I draw a power ranger with colour pencils on a piece of paper, i still considered a type of publication... if I were to write something anywhere in cyberspace, as long as humans can see it and touch it (hdd, flopy disc, cd-r, etc) it is a form of publication... I would know, we had the same arguement in B-Law lesson...</p>
              <p><br><br>anyway, don't you think this limitation of liability is a little wierd? The terms and condition is suppose to only affect the users only... but lets say I'm not a member of sgf but there is a defemation of me in sgf... isn't it wierd that I have to follow the terms and condition when I am not a user, but the publication on sgf affects me as a non-user...?</p>
              <p>Lets make an example, lets say you build a house and let anyone use it anyway they want and put up terms and condition, (1) cannot do anything illegal (2) limited liability...</p>
              <p>Then someone use it for a brothel or a drug den (illegal stuff like defemation), fair enough if you don't know about the illegal activity... but if the matter has already been brought up to you and you still do nothing, you are still abetting to the crime...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yes some of these little defemation are childish, but childish or not, if your words in cyberspace has affects on this side of reality it becomes a real problem...</p>
              <p>I can't remember really well, but there was a case of chain e-mails were sent to defeme a company in Singapore... legal suit follows and the original authors were arrested... but hotmail ( or was it yahoo??) is responsible to track down the users who forwarded the emails and put a road block to the spread... failure to do so would be abetting to defemation...</p>

              <p>Posts in a forum by a virtual nick is not a publication. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>Posting in a blog is a sort of publication. Simple as well.</p>
              <p>And in the case of chain e-mails, yahoo or hotmail does not guarantees the accuracies of the emails as well; they do not need to take responsibilities for whatever their users sent out. It's a duh. The same case for forums as well.</p>
