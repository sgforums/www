ferrite<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; is a kind of ceramic<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; its written as<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; ceramic magnets ( ferrite )<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; yea<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; but its more to ceramic<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; ooh<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; so u mean that your mattresspads do not have ceramics?<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; i mean magnets<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; we uses all ferrite magnets<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; how many years warranty does ur mattress queen give?<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; erm<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; 30 yrs if i am not wrong<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; oh<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; our company only 20 years tho<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; i mean<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; our company gives 20 years warrantly<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; but the magnets will only start to drop its gauss rate after 27 years<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; ooh<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; but the one ey gives is vv lousy<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; it does not give wear and tear warrenty<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; does yours give?<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; ours wear n tear only 3 years<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; haha its understandable tho <br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; coz normally when we sleep, we slot in below the bedsheet<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; ooh<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; yep<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; so it doesnt really wear n tear that much<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; theirs is not 30 years<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; that sux<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; thats why we give only 3 years for that<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; yea they gave 5 years for wear and tear<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt; o<br>&lt;el3mental_frog&gt; i almost tought u all give 20 yrs for that as well<br>&lt;Kiyosaki&gt;

              elementalangel, I don't think it's nice to put someone private information such as school and hp on a public forum even if you don't like the company.
                      
              My thoughts after reading this long long long chat.
                      
              At least the guy did not hide the fact that it's mlm when asked, that's one plus point considering that he's only an SE (second lowest rank) and he have to courage to face what may be coming next.
                      
              He kept comparing VE to Enyouth and only Enyouth, I don't know the reason behind it but if I have to choose between the two, I will choose VE because at least VE will not ask a group of SDMs to surround you and stop you from leaving the building. Enyouth is the very hard selling type one. But if you compare VE to other companies, there are much better choices. Maybe he is trying to make VE looks good by comparing to another company that is worse
                      
              No, it's not that he forget the plan, it's that they are not allowed to disclose the plan because they claimed they are afraid of copycats. But most other companies have what they have, there isn't much to copy.

              From what I know, the first time you go, you will listen to a two hours presentation on the products, company and opp on network marketing. After that, you get to choose to go for their 2-3 days job training. If you don't want, I don't think they can do much to you too.

              <p>however what i dont like is him blindly defending the company from the start<br>eg: the more ceramic<br>      claiming to forget the company plan ( he said giving 5-6 k )<br>      saying that his products is the best when some other more reputable companies       <br>      are doing so as well on the same product eg:diamond water</p>

              also cannot blame him, this is what they are taught to believe. But their water is really selling quite well, always out of stock.
              
              elementalangel, you should have said you from companies like Amway, FLP or even herbalife, I am very interested to see how he is going to make you believe that VE is better than these giants which have more reputable products, better comp plan, better marketing methods and more experienced uplines. Or you were really from enyouth?

              <p>personally.. i think ve is not unique.. their products are not unique.. and the scheme does not help u earn money... it helps the boss earn money..</p>
              <p>driving a car at 22 isnt a big deal..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and the reason why they target youths is because youths are inexperienced.. naive.. last of all youths are little precious to their parents so.. can scam the parents through the youths by promising a future for the youths</p>

              <p><br>This is relationship selling, best thing to do if you want to lose all your friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, no matter where you go there are sure people who are nice in front of you but say bad things behind you. Workplaces, schools etc. I wonder why he's so angry over it. It's happening everywhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for the post. Got to start calling my friends and told them if someone from VE ask you to write down your contacts in a list, die die also don't let them keep it, keep it yourself.</p>

              <p><em> </em>i was in VE for 3 months Plus a few years ago. And the experience there sucks big time.</p>
              <p>They were nice to me when i made sales. Soon after, my contacts started to shrink, and I wasnt doing very well with my sales. At first, they will try and 'motivate' me to do sales. calling whichever shitty manager to come and have some kopi with me at Lau Pa Sat there to have a talk. Most of them would come and tell me about their personal life stories which is not motivating at all!</p>
              <p>One manager told me at the time she wanted to hit her manager position, she would <strong>do sales at 2am</strong>. I asked her if she made the sale? She said no. Isnt it obvious, who would want to buy from you if you are causing them great inconvinience at 2am!</p>
              <p>She emphasized that we should go for what we wanted.(oK to me) , But does it have to be at the expense of others?Being as gullible,naive and brainwashed that I was, I just keep quiet.</p>
              <p>After the 'motivation' sessions, my sales still didnt go up. Well, not many people would want to buy such overpriced products! They started to ignore me when i was there. Except for my manager.</p>
              <p>In one of the incidents, one of the manager fought with her downline. Calling her unreasonanble etc. Then his friend said, let her go since she's too much of a trouble. He said he will, <strong>but 1st he must get her contact list</strong>. I was like WTF!</p>
              <p>This wasnt the 1st time that the upline is taking advantage of his downline. One downline wanted to quit. His upline stalled her from quitting and the reason is, he wanted to <strong>get his hands on her contact list</strong>.</p>
              <p>After so many rejections from my own relatives, I wanted to give up. My manager said this, " <strong>when you were a child and you were sick, your mum would force you to eat medicine right? Well, doing sales is the same."</strong> . Referring me as the mum and customer as the child. How can you really compare the two situations?</p>
              <p>After so many failed sales, and my contacts started to shrink, my manager wanted me to do recruitment. Of course many of my friends didnt want to come down for many reasons. dubious, heard of VE and wasnt interested.</p>
              <p>After so long, my manager wanted me to use the "i got job, you want?' technique. And she also introduced me to a similar EY technique. Meet up friend at Lau Pa Sat to have a meal together, she will come to 'convince' or force people to come up and see the office.</p>
              <p>After my recruitment contacts shrinked, she wanted me to do surveys and called people up for job interviews etc. As naive and brainwashed I was, I did as followed. I saw people at the back door sitting down and writing down their personal info<strong> as if they were in a real interview. </strong></p>
              <p>Of course MANY or even most VE personels uses this interview technique. But isnt it stupid? <strong>1st you lied to the prospect</strong>, when he/she finds out, the probability of them joining would be very very low. Even the good ones would want to run away and have a bad impression of mlm because of this stupid co.!</p>
              <p>I did some sales there and my manager only<strong> gave me a portion of MY money</strong>! My upline did warned me about her debts and all. But he told me too late.</p>
              <p>I want to ask all the defenders of VE, White_soulreaper, enquires,corwin_2k, c_hunter etc. Why do your co. have tricksters?! I read from page 1 till present. Many claimed that these tricksters are the minority and the blacksheeps. ah!your co. have a majority of blacksheeps? It seems that most VE personels uses underlying methods.</p>
              <p> its a the co. culture, it itself is corrupted with trickery right from the top. That's y, most of the people there are that way!</p>
              <p>One positive thing is that I met a new friend in VE. She too left. The reason is because she sold the queen mattress to her aunt, but her aunt payed in halves. When she wen to get her paycheck, it wasnt in existence. Y? Her manager used her paycheck to pay the other half, so the <strong>HE COULD GAIN MONEY FASTER</strong> that way. If I am not wrong, the manager is the youngest car achiever in VE. Pathetic!</p>
              <p>I should have told my story a long time ago. Those people out there that's approached by VE, pls read and listen to my story so that it doesnt happen to you!</p>

              <p>Enyouth, DW and VE are all doing the same things. The contact list, asking you to keep it in the coy so they can use it to make cold calls if you quit, writing down the top X number of people whom you want to benefit from the product, asking friends down to a nearby place to have a meal or catch up, then ask them to go to coy. Well, I don't think VE is doing the last since it's stupid to ask people to come all the way to there just to have a meal.</p>

              <p>You mean that they are initial from another mlm co.? From my knowledge, VE started not long before the govt. approved this mlm thing. Before that the 'beginning' co. was illegal?</p>
