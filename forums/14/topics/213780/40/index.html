              <p>Hey WSR..</p>
              <p>U damn sure or not u achieve ur car incentive oredi...?? U
              joined this yr in <strong>2008</strong> and it just takes
              u <strong>7 mths</strong> to achieve it...? Who r u trying to
              kid...? Old timers in VE also took years to achieve tat... Unless u
              tell me u got ur sugarmummy or ur sugardaddy to pump large amount
              of money in ur sales... Then maybe possible... But still i feel is
              impossible... 7 mths to achieve it is totally crap...  </p>
              <p>Cos from wat i know, u haf to be a BM and to achive the car
              incentives there's 3 cycle u haf to go through and each cycle
              took u 3 mths... To be a BM, it will take u time also,
              dun mention abt the car incentives.</p>
              <p>I think ah people like u r a disgrace not only to the company
              but also to the nation... U wanna defend VE, but i think u've make
              the name of VE even more disrespectful... WELL DONE!</p>

              <p><br>Hi one star,</p>
              <p>i am in mlm, so i know where the money comes from... Of course from the consumer... Isnt where money comes from for ALL businesses regrardless of mlm or not...(You post is so long just to ask me 1 point?)</p>
              <p>I dont take in commission from the people I know of. As I have stated in a post above, i profit my commission from their referrals...</p>
              <p>As an mlm entreprenuer, I can only lower my product to a certain price,.. Which is I dont take in my commission... But I dont do this for all my customers...</p>
              <p>P.S. People always want things cheap, if can they want it free... Its the human nature... Dont just mention salaried workers, its everyone... If its sold at $1, ppl will complain for price decrease to 50 cents... If its 50 cents, ppl would want it to be decreased to 10 cents... You get my point?</p>

              <p>Giving benefit of doubt, I believe there's someone who could have done it in VE. When i was inside for 2 weeks, i heard of a girl who got into bm in just 7 or 10 days. I joined around April 25th.</p>
              <p>WSR, that only point was extremely important. If u agree with me, the 'salary' that you have got would be from those who have bought the products from you.</p>
              <p>You chose not to lower the price when you could have.</p>
              <p>So you are still considered to be like a sales(wo)man.</p>
              <p>If you had not taken any commission, or the commission was actually negligible, would you then recommend the product since the product is (or claim to be) good?</p>
              <p>You will is most probably the answer that you will give.</p>
              <p>But you're a little selfish towards other people aren't you? People got to pay u commission for knowing and buying the product. -.- hmm... seems weird.</p>
              <p>So let's say if elementalangel could get a matterress (sorry don't know how to spell) at a lower price than VE over the internet, can you help EA to sell the matterress (they are of the same quality) ? I believe EA don't mind you earning $50 commission over the queen size matterress.</p>
              <p>Lastly, i shall put it in a more direct way.</p>
              <p>I mean to say, because you're getting a commission out of the product that you're not willing to lower the price of the product when you have the power of selling it at a lower price. If you're a salaried worker for VE, you would have chose to lower the price but you may not have the authority to do so. It has nothing to do with people always want things cheap. (Both ideas are different, i am looking at the one who is selling).</p>
              <p>so... there isn't much that you did actually to earn that amount of sum, i wonder where does the respect comes from? If you had indeed earn a lot, it just simply means that A LOT of people bought the "health product" from you at a higher price, where there is actually a way to get the product at a much lower price. Why not simply decrease the profit margin? Why must VE people earn so much from the product? I doubt you are really helping your clients...</p>

              <p>in order to be a bm u need 3 mms under u. so its quite impossible unless you have rich parents willing to be your downline after u turn to a mm</p>

              <p><br>the thing is, i didn;t see just 1 or 2 VE ppl that uses unethical &amp; manipulative tactics. It's the seniors that teach all theLIES! Everyone below would follow. I didn't listen to the ppl here. I experienced it. And I think the people here too had their own negative experience with VE. Your third point is a typical VE tactic, try to put down something that can be achieved without MLM. And Elementalangel, I hope you do well to prove this B!TCH wrong!</p>

              <p>To elementalangel and curiousity84,</p>
              <p>yes, I have achieved my car incentive... It's not that difficult, but it's a lot of hardwork... Fortunately for me, I attract the right people as my downlines...</p>
              <p>Curiousity84, those old timers would have a hard time compared to mine is because, last time, it's more difficult to sell the products compared to now... And those old timers were experimenting... For me, I have learnt  a lot of things to do and not to do from my seniors and from best selling sales, mlm, self improvement books...</p>
              <p>Elementalangel, how come I am not surprised by you... You got so 'worked up' when i got my car incentive... 1st of all, I am good at sales,  2ndly, I attact hardworking and street smart downlines... It's not difficult to actually get to my level... For you maybe, but for me, it wasn't that bad...</p>
              <p>here's how I progressed in VE,</p>
              <p>3 days  MM</p>
              <p>12 days BM</p>
              <p>120 days car achiever...</p>
              <p>I dont have rich parents, but I have a sincere heart for my customers, that is why they buy from me... That paganist loser definitely not my 'clone'.... He won't show his face here anymore, don't want to get sued again... hahaha...</p>

              <p>Giving benefit of doubt, I believe there's someone who could have done it in VE. When i was inside for 2 weeks, i heard of a girl who got into bm in just 7 or 10 days. I joined around April 25th.</p>
              <p>WSR, that only point was extremely important. If u agree with me, the 'salary' that you have got would be from those who have bought the products from you.</p>
              <p>You chose not to lower the price when you could have.</p>
              <p>So you are still considered to be like a sales(wo)man.</p>
              <p>If you had not taken any commission, or the commission was actually negligible, would you then recommend the product since the product is (or claim to be) good?</p>
              <p>You will is most probably the answer that you will give.</p>
              <p>But you're a little selfish towards other people aren't you? People got to pay u commission for knowing and buying the product. -.- hmm... seems weird.</p>
              <p>So let's say if elementalangel could get a matterress (sorry don't know how to spell) at a lower price than VE over the internet, can you help EA to sell the matterress (they are of the same quality) ? I believe EA don't mind you earning $50 commission over the queen size matterress.</p>
              <p>Lastly, i shall put it in a more direct way.</p>
              <p>I mean to say, because you're getting a commission out of the product that you're not willing to lower the price of the product when you have the power of selling it at a lower price. If you're a salaried worker for VE, you would have chose to lower the price but you may not have the authority to do so. It has nothing to do with people always want things cheap. (Both ideas are different, i am looking at the one who is selling).</p>
              <p>so... there isn't much that you did actually to earn that amount of sum, i wonder where does the respect comes from? If you had indeed earn a lot, it just simply means that A LOT of people bought the "health product" from you at a higher price, where there is actually a way to get the product at a much lower price. Why not simply decrease the profit margin? Why must VE people earn so much from the product? I doubt you are really helping your clients...</p>

              <p>*I'm yixing then. Ask Jasmine, Jessie or Alvin about me. Can i assume that you couldn't figure a way to 'correctly' answer my question that you treat me as EA's clone (and your tone seems a little inappropriate).</p>
              <p>"I DID lower down the price of the product as I can, you should know too that I do not have the authority to lower the price to an extend to where I would getting a negative profit..."</p>
              <p>You have *admitted that you do have the choice of lowering the price just that you will get a negative profit. If EA model is successful, i supposed he'll sell at 40 to 50% of the price VE is selling, *and you can still get a 'decent commission' if you sell it at 50% or 60% of the price VE is selling (Assuming 100% is equivalent to the price SA got to sell).  </p>
              <p>And if you wonder why i recommended EA model is because *there isn't a need for you to climb rank and therefore even a SA (or rather just joined people can sell it at a cheap price). *don't you think that it's quite senseless that you can only sell cheaper when you're of a higher rank?</p>
              <p>I do agree that all business must earn. (my very first post on sgforums had even argued on that). But to earn by such a margin?</p>
              <p>And you seems to be quite focus on your profits rather than the help you can bring to clients.</p>
              <p>If you still think that it's alright for you to get so much commission, by all means go ahead. I'll treat it as i lose this argument. It's not so much of my problem anyway. As long as it doesn't affect the people around me.</p>

              <p>I DID lower down the price of the product as I can, you should know too that I do not have the authority to lower the price to an extend to where I would getting a negative profit...</p>

              <p>P.S. No one here really mentioned about Elementalangels 'business plans' for selling the mattress except for you! No way I'll help elementalangel to sell his mattress... i dont help people that I know are sure to fail... It's you! =)</p>
              <p>one more thing, don't make it so obvious la... You just created that account and only posts in VE thread...</p>

              <p>And to add,</p>
              <p>"I DID lower down the price of the product as I can",</p>
              <p>you wrote before that you didn't lower the price for your referrals and thus i state that you do have the choice to lower the price for them</p>
              <p>"i dont help people that I know are sure to fail"</p>
              <p>this is your perception... sure-fail? lol... i do really wonder if it is so.</p>

              <p>"gosh!" the tone, hmm... i'm quite sad though to be assume to be EA. When you've made this assumption, you lose the ability to argue in a just manner.</p>
              <p>WSR, can you help ask your friend (i'll accept even if they're from mlm) whether did i write logically on all the previous post i've written, or whether it's plain nonsense.</p>
              <p>I'm fine if my arguments are rejected. Moreover you need to have the belief and conviction to keep on working in this line. You can choose just to belief in the system. Moreover it's just the money "lost" by your clients, they will earn back eventually. I hope that you'll try your best in not straining those clients having financial difficulty.</p>

              <p>Lets say you found out that the current job you're in, be it mlm or any job, isn't suitable for you, would you quit? Or tahan to the end? Stop intimidating people. You give them confidence when they join ve, but degrade people who leave the company?</p>
              <p>Care for consumer. Hmm. Few years ago I was subjected to "holding back" tactics and was tricked down. I hope VE had changed for the better now,</p>

              <p><br>ok, if you are unhappy with VE, you quit... You are more happy after you quit... People in VE say that you are a quitter...</p>
              <p>Come on... Does it really matter what VE people think of you? If you think that you are happy after leaving VE, then so be it...</p>

              <p>Sorry OneStar I dont entertaint clones... Initially, I thought that you are your own individual, as I have said before, after reading your posts, language and the way you rebuttle, its the exactly same as elementalangel...</p>
              <p>One Point that convinced me is that you like to ask me question that I have already answered, same as elementalangel...</p>
              <p>FIY,</p>
              <p>Co. price = $1</p>
              <p>My commission = $0.40.</p>
              <p>I can lower the price to $1 whereas I have no commission... If I lower the price again, it would be from my pocket already... You get my point? I have said this many times elementalangel, or OneStar... It doesnt matter, you're the same...</p>
