              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Ok this is to respond to fudgester. As a disclaimer, I am also
                      not very convinced by our water. I can only convinced by our
                      magnetic beds and the air system. My mum is using the magnetic bed,
                      and her blood pressure has dropped from a high to a borderline high
                      level. To me, it really works. For the air system, I have loaned
                      trials to customers for rooms in their offices where there are air
                      quality problems, and situations have improved and they have bought
                      from us, so I believe in the air system too. But the water system,
                      it has yet to reach out to me. However, I will try my best to
                      answer your question. If not I will ask my mentor, who is an
                      engineer and very good at chemistry, and he might tell me more and
                      then I will reply to your question with more depth.<br> <br> Firstly, I think absorption of water starts in the mouth, or
                      somewhere before the water reaches the stomach. I am not a biology
                      student, so I might be wrong. So we are talking about alkaline
                      water in your bloodstream and body before it even gets neutralized
                      in the stomach.<br> <br> Yes I do know that our blood is a buffer. However, how do you know
                      one's blood is still in a healthy range? Maybe it is already
                      starting to change. And if it has changed one would already be in a
                      serious condition. So we cannot take for granted that our blood
                      will always be at a healthy pH level. For the things that we take
                      in nowadays are mainly acidic. Like our meat and even vegetables
                      due to chemicals. Also, our products reach out to people who are
                      concerned about health or already have some health problems like
                      high blood pressure. Youths like us will not be interested in these
                      products as health is not really a big issue to us right now. So
                      this is about marketing to the right group of people.<br> <br> Your last point is that "Any minor change of the pH of blood will
                      denature the enzymes in the blood and lead to a lot of problems for
                      the human body." I agree. A new borned baby has a blood
                      constitution that is alkaline. But over the years due to our modern
                      lifestyle and intake of food, a majority of us would have a
                      slightly acidic blood constitution by the age of 40. And that is
                      when problems start coming in. So our water changes our slightly
                      acidic blood back to alkaline blood so that you are healthy
                      again.<br> <br> Btw Fudgester, if you have any more queries just post, meanwhile I
                      will ask my mentor about your three points.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1. Your mum's personal experience counts as 'anecdotal evidence'. That is to say, it can only be an <em>anecdote</em> to hard evidence from proper controlled studies that reduces bias and accounts for factors like the placebo effect.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I can hold an ordinary rock and reasonably claim that it protects me from tigers. After all, I'm just stating my personal experience.... there are no tigers around me.</p>
              <p>2. Even if absorption of water starts in the mouth, the bulk of it goes into your stomach before it gets absorbed via your small intestines. If you're not sure, go drink a glass of water. Hold the water in your mouth without swallowing and tell me what you think.</p>
              <p>Also, even if you're not a bio student, basic chemistry will tell you that concentrated hydrochloric acid will totally neutralize weak alkaline solutions.</p>
              <p>3. pH of normal blood is around 7.4 (weakly alkaline). If it drops below 6.8 or goes above 7.8, death can result. Just a slight change less than those 0.6 units will cause trouble. No kidding.</p>
              <p>Sure, our blood pH levels may drop very slightly from time to time due to lactic acid buildup during exercise (which is why you get sore muscles). Which is why our body already has built-in mechanisms like acidic buffers and increased respiration rates to get rid of any excess acid buildup. No intervention needed except for drastic cases.</p>
              <p>On a final note, if you're not 'very convinced' by the very products you sell, then honestly speaking, you shouldn't be selling it.</p>
              <p>How do you expect to convince your customers if you're not convinced yourself?</p>

              <p>Lastly, for salesman who dont achieve their target, its because they are like you, thinking about salesmen who dont achieve their target as a natural thing. Got a goal, aim for it, dont be  wuss and look at the other side.</p>

              <p>I also stick to my stand. If you want to sell something, then you have to be prepared to address your customers who may well know more than you. If a customer who knows all about magnetism asks you 'So... exactly how does magnetic therapy work? Does it magnetise the blood or something?', then you had better be prepared to address him.</p>
              <p>Ask your advisor as to how the magnetic therapy and air system works. Ask for hard scientific proof of how they work, and not just anecdotal evidence like customer testimonials.</p>
              <p>If and when you do go to university, you will see that such anecdotal evidence will never hold in the absence of valid proof like controlled experiments and well-documented simulations. Your professor will just ask you 'So what?' and continue to bombard you because he knows better, and you haven't showed him that you know something that he doesn't.</p>
              <p>If you want to know, both Eagle and I are engineers as well, by the way. We are both taught to always ask how things work and raise questions when something doesn't seem to square well with what we know.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>laurence82, do you know you just supported me point not long ago saying that eagle is defeatist? And now that you analyse my own point about closing 4 out of 10, I notice that I am defeatist there too. I will do my best to change that attitude, but please let me increase my closing chances first. I am currently working with a closing rate of about 10% of the appointments that I go to. Increasing that chance to say 20% would be easier than to 100% for now. So I am taking one step at a time. I ask for patience for that part. <br><br>And your point about agreeing and disagreeing is rather confusing. If you do not agree with my point, you would disagree. A non yes would be a no. Nothing else. There is a discussion in the first place because not everyone feels the same way. Otherwise, why would there be a discussion? After the first post in this thread there would be none more, for no one has anything else to say rather than "Hey I agree!". But that is not the case, is it? <br><br>Now to eagle. Your point does stand, but I feel that you might be a little inflexible. Very simply put, it is just a salesman with commission for VE. But it is definitely not the same as a salesman for, say, a retail salesman in a Giordano shop. I dare say a salesman in VE learns more than a retail salesman in a Giordano shop. What I am trying to say is that being a salesman in VE lets you learn things that might help if you wish to run a business next time. Things that many 8-5 jobs might not offer. Because a salesman in VE has to decide more things, like who to find appointments, who to recruit, how should i plan my schedule, etc. <br><br>And maybe by explaining why i posted in the first place will let you guys know why I am here. I find that the situation looked rather bleak for Venture Era when you just google it and up came results from sgforum, amongst other forums, flaming Venture Era. The flamers are not exactly wrong, but they are not exactly right either. So I wanted to let the readers know the two sides of the coin, so that they can get a clearer picture about Venture Era. That is about the real reason why I am here.<br><br>oh and fudgester, I do know how magnetic beds and air systems work. As in scientifically. That is why I believe in it a lot. For the water, it might just be me, as I think water is still water. Good water and bad water, it is still for drinking. So to me it doesnt really make a difference. Would you want me to share with you how the beds and air systems work? <br><br>And i totally agree that anecdotal evidence does not work. My research papers since secondary 3 has asked for footnotes for almost every point, and reference to sites like wikipedia was not even accepted. And since you two are engineers, and if you do not mind me sharing with you how the air system and bed works, could you hear me out and provide me with more questions? Cause maybe it's cause I only take courses up to A level, so the questions that I asked are of a certain level, and so far those questions have been answered. Maybe if you can highlight problems or doubts I can go and ask my mentor, who is a NTU engineer too, so that I can learn more and be more prepared should I get customers who are engineers too.

              <p>Again this point has been shot down in the pages before. Bringing it up again is only putting yourself on the target board.</p>
              <p>In short, you will be a VE salesman in the same league as insurance agents and financial advisors. That was what I said in earlier pages before you came.</p>
              <p>And no, as corebooster has already said. He learn more things about business in his 8-5 job than in VE.</p>
              <p>And I can tell you now that even for a simple thing like giving tuition, you have to also decide your own things, find your own students, plan your schedule, do up your own advertising campaign, where to locate, etc etc. I can go on and on...</p>
              <p>But as you see, your mind is only and deeply entrenched in what VE has told you. Everything we are telling you is disagreeing with you. Although you said you are open to opinions, you are already giving us this impression that you are not.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>now erm SexyChin, you have sort of brought a very big issue. Indeed, like you have said, there are many professors that have done research to show that magnetic therapy has worked, but incidentally there are also an equal number that has done clinical trials to show that it has not worked. But what I know is that magnetic therapy is widespread in Japan, and is a billion dollar industry in USA, and that it has helped many people. Whether or not it really has a placebo effect or otherwise, I do not really know. We just have to leave it to the professors and their research. What has been proven thus far is that magnetic therapy has an effect, just that they do not know exactly what yet. Maybe you can try reading up Dr. William Philpot's research. He is one of the leading scientists in this magnetic therapy. <br><br>And erm I already apologized for compromising on the past 74 pages. What I ask is that you would kindly bring up the point again so that I know rather than say that it has been shot down again. <br><br>Now eagle. Firstly, corebooster only stayed for two weeks. So if he learned more things in business at his job than two weeks at VE, there might be right. But what if he compared it with 1 month at VE, 3 months at VE? That we do not know right? So that point is invalid. <br><br>Tuition. Indeed we do plan our own things when having our own tuition. But you would be lying through your teeth if you say that you would learn more about business as a tuition teacher than be a salesman at VE. <br><br>And lastly, I do not think that I am not open to opinions. Though this sentence might have already shown that I am not open. But nevertheless, you have to know that there are times when I agree with several of you. Did you really read all my posts, like the very long one? If you haven read all that I have posted, than I would appreciate if you will try to not jump to conclusions yet again. <br><br>And for laurence82, that post of yours seems totally emotional, and I will not bother to reply that for one cannot reason with an angry man. I also think that you are rather defensive. For what I also do not know. Defeatist is not totally bad. Some can say that a defeatist attitude is being realistic. It does not mean you are a loser. And your post doesnt make sense too. <br><br>And eagle, there are more than 10 people in my firm earning more than 20k a month (management team), and close to 30 people earning more than 10k a month (business group and associate managers). Then there are about 400 people in the firm. To me, 10k a month before hitting the age of 30 (the oldest guy in my firm is 34), is rather big already.</p></div>

              <p>Please do not evade the points by talking about being emotional. Its an old ruse I have seen MLMers use all the time.</p>
              <p>1. Which points I have used said that supports that eagle is a defeatist?</p>
              <p>2. People come here to review the points that are laid out here. Unlike MLMers, they do not engage in siding, collusion or even conspiracy theories. So your point about being accepting that people will not agree with you is a defeatist attitude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The harsh reality of businessworld is this, you dont beg for chances, you do not think that not achieving target is a natural thing, people do not come here readily to agree or disagree or to side. And that means the non-MLMers. Its up to the MLMers to prove they are serious, professional and not to evade difficult issues.</p>

              <p>Frankly, having spent few years mixing with them, they would not be able to provide you an answer. The struggles they have, the significant rate of failures, the low standard of professionalism makes the industry what it is today, what we Chinese called 'guo jie lau shu'</p>
              <p>I did hope they would raise the standards equal to any other industry in the world, but there is a persistent drive not to do so. You see his posts, its still the same as the agents I lambasted on the first page of this topic.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am not evading. If I wish to evade I would have already left this forum. I am just waiting for you to calm down. Look at that post of yours. It was filled with anger. When one tries to reason with an angry man normally it ends up in a fight. So I was not using any ruse as you have accused. I find that you and eagle are rather similar. You both like to jump to conclusions, dont you? <br><br>Ah there you see. Your point two is much more clearer now. I could not make head or tail of what you were saying beforehand. <br><br>And we both seem to have different reasons here. I am here to show that Venture Era is not totally as claimed in this forum, and that if you wish to join, at least come down to the orientation, look around, then gauge if this company is good or bad. One would not make it very far anywhere if he or she decides things by seeing how other people feel about those things. <br><br>And I still stand correct with my point that people only agree or disagree. Even if people sit on the fence, deep down they actually side someone, but just to avoid trouble, they say that they sit on the fence. Who will target a person that is neutral? Accepting that people will definitely disagree with me might be a defeatist attitude, but realistic at the same time. Idealism can only bring you that far. One must balance both. <br><br>I am 19. Not 27 as I think you are, inferred from your username. I do not see the harsh reality of the world yet. Hence I still bear hope that this world is not as bad as people say, and that out there exists people that will help you. I believe that not everyone is out to, in a crude way, screw you. Why do you repeatedly talk about the harshness of this world, crushing my hopes bit by bit as you do? Were you not naive once? Are you saying that ever since you joined the corporate world everyone that you have met has stabbed you one way or another? It is due to this naiveness that brought me to post at this forum today, when people tell me that it's useless as people will just shoot you down like nothing. I just gotta try before I give up. <br><br>I shall end this post, before people complain that it is long again.</p></div>

              <p>Ad hominem argument. You are more interested in character, behaviour or mood of the forumer behind the post. I am not really interested in this. I have laid out the specific points and its up to you whether you choose to answer, evade or simply state that you do not have any clue.</p>
              <p>Your posts have bring strength to the point that VE agents lacked depth and maturity, and have not advanced these past few years, especially points you have brought up were proven to be wrong right from the start of this topic.</p>
              <p>I am not interested, nor is the issue about people will agree, disagree or sit on fence. By coming here and expecting majority of people not to agree with you, you are only plying along the line of 'groupthink' and possessing defeatist attitude. Its only a short step away from the rest of MLMers who think the whole world is against them.</p>
              <p>Again, this is businessworld, not some charity or NPOs. You are asking for chances, but you have not yet to prove you or VE deserve those chances. Your last line clearly shows your defeatist attitude. Again and again its about you have the thoughts of 'its them against us', 'people shooting you down'. What is the difference between this and the wussies who keep crying that the whole world are against them?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>now erm SexyChin, you have sort of brought a very big issue.
                      Indeed, like you have said, there are many professors that have
                      done research to show that magnetic therapy has worked, but
                      incidentally there are also an equal number that has done clinical
                      trials to show that it has not worked. But what I know is that
                      magnetic therapy is widespread in Japan, and is a billion dollar
                      industry in USA, and that it has helped many people. Whether or not
                      it really has a placebo effect or otherwise, I do not really know.
                      We just have to leave it to the professors and their research. What
                      has been proven thus far is that magnetic therapy has an effect,
                      just that they do not know exactly what yet. Maybe you can try
                      reading up Dr. William Philpot's research. He is one of the leading
                      scientists in this magnetic therapy.<br> <br> And erm I already apologized for compromising on the past 74 pages.
                      What I ask is that you would kindly bring up the point again so
                      that I know rather than say that it has been shot down again.<br> <br> Now eagle. Firstly, corebooster only stayed for two weeks. So if he
                      learned more things in business at his job than two weeks at VE,
                      there might be right. But what if he compared it with 1 month at
                      VE, 3 months at VE? That we do not know right? So that point is
                      invalid.<br> <br> Tuition. Indeed we do plan our own things when having our own
                      tuition. But you would be lying through your teeth if you say that
                      you would learn more about business as a tuition teacher than be a
                      salesman at VE.<br> <br> And lastly, I do not think that I am not open to opinions. Though
                      this sentence might have already shown that I am not open. But
                      nevertheless, you have to know that there are times when I agree
                      with several of you. Did you really read all my posts, like the
                      very long one? If you haven read all that I have posted, than I
                      would appreciate if you will try to not jump to conclusions yet
                      again.<br> <br> And for laurence82, that post of yours seems totally emotional, and
                      I will not bother to reply that for one cannot reason with an angry
                      man. I also think that you are rather defensive. For what I also do
                      not know. Defeatist is not totally bad. Some can say that a
                      defeatist attitude is being realistic. It does not mean you are a
                      loser. And your post doesnt make sense too.<br> <br> And eagle, there are more than 10 people in my firm earning more
                      than 20k a month (management team), and close to 30 people earning
                      more than 10k a month (business group and associate managers). Then

              <p>Self contradictory</p>
              <p>You said corebooster stayed only for 2 weeks, so he couldn't have learned much.</p>
              <p>Yet you are talking as if you gave tuition for a long time that you could compare??? Wow. This alone already showed you are not opened to opinions. And it shows that you are setting double standards.</p>
              <p>I have read your posts, and at least from 50 odd pages within this thread. You still give the impression of not being opened to opinions. Like quite a few other youngsters, you are thinking you know something that many others do not know, therefore you will succeed.</p>

              <p>Yes this can be considered as an answer to my original question. Can't believe you took a few long posts and one big round around the bush just to answer a simple question.</p>
              <p>Then again, I have never condemned MLM model throughout this thread.  So your point of me being defeatist doesn't hold at all. Rather, it was you who wasn't opened to opinions.</p>
              <p>My next question is, how do you know they earn more than 10k a month? From what they say in their orientation speech? Or did you see their bank accounts and cheques?</p>

              <p>When you all keep telling him to quit MLM or that MLM is a road
              to nowhere, it only gives him the resolve to stick on (until he
              learns the painful truth himself later on in life).  That's
              one of the techniques that MLM "managers" or "mentors" tell their
              charges to screw with their minds - keep telling them the rest of
              the people are jealous of their success, will want to bring you
              down, criticise you etc.  And that sticking to their MLM
              beliefs shows strength of character. yada yada.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A lot of these young impressionable teens think they will be the
              next millionaire because they have been bombarded with all these
              "get rich if you just stick to the MLM course" messages.  Just
              let them learn it the hard way lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>MLM might be able to earn him some bucks, that I won't deny.</p>
              <p>But to keep saying that it is your own business, that you will learn the trades of business in MLM and not anywhere else, etc, etc is pure bs.</p>

              <p>I only started thinking about finance near graduation :(</p>
              <p>Then again, I dun like to spend money on unnecessary things; it's part of my nature...  So still ok....</p>
              <p>Now I don't dream of first million; I'm planning and putting in place actions. Not really to reach a million, but to achieve sufficient income from stock dividends and probably property rental revenue in the future, such that I can choose not to work if I wanted to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I also think these youngsters nowadays think school certs are useless. Then they take examples of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett (without truly understanding why pple like Bill Gates left sch) to support their points.</p>
              <p>Everyone dreams of being the next Bill Gates, setting up the next Facebook, being the next Adam Khoo, etc...</p>
