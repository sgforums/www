              <p>Wrong paradigm.</p>
              <p>If size can be a good indicator of quality, prove it. If you can prove it, means its can be applicable to al, ceteries paribus. And also, to prove these two are linked to VE. Quite simple two steps.</p>

              <p>Just because you can name some companies that are against the
                      run of things, that doesn't mean that your theory is proven. It
                      remains a hypothesis still. For the majority, size is a very good

                      perception.</p>
              <p>I'll give you a very simple and stupid analogy. If most people
                      fall to their death if they jump off from the 6th storey, while
                      there is a small exception of people whom survived. It does not
                      prove that jumping off the 6 storey is not deadly. You are not
                      proving anything, but rather trying to "bullshit" your argument
                      through by naming some examples.</p>

              <p>If many people smoke, yet still live on for very long, are you going to tell us that smoking does not affect your lifespan at all?</p>
              <p>I give u another analogy. If majority of the people who plays the stock market lose money, are you going to tell everyone that the stock market is a place where you will lose money? And thus, don't touch the stock market at all?</p>
