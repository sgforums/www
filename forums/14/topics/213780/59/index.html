              <p>cant believe he motivates people by telling false info =(<br><br>Donald trump case?<br></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Did Donald Trump ever say he’d turn to MLM to make back his fortune? (insert drum roll here…)</p>
              <p>Yep, he sure did.</p>
              <p>But alas, that’s not the whole story. The MLM grapevine has managed
              to fold, spindle and mutilate the facts just a bit. Here’s the actual,
              absolutely factual, events that occurred during that fateful Tonight
              Show episode:</p>
              <p>It indeed happened on the Tonight Show, and it was Johnny Carson at
              the helm. The date is fuzzy, but it’s probably circa late ’80s, early
              ’90s since Johnny did indeed ask Trump what he would do if he ever lost
              his fortune (so it must have been pre-Trump-thump and Artful Comeback).
              And what Donald Trump said in responses was, “I’d join Amway.” He said
              it with a rye grin, and the audience laughed accordingly.</p>
              <p>They got the joke. Apparently some MLMers didn’t.</p>
              <p>Yes, Donald was being facetious. He was poking fun at us, or more
              specifically our granddaddy, Amway. He wasn’t being serious about
              joining us, he was MOCKING us! But hey, technically, he DID say exactly
              what he was rumored to have said. Technically.</p>
              <p>Of course, this all begs the question, how the heck do I know this?</p>
              <p>Well, glad you asked, because I could not have gotten this from a
              better source than to have asked Johnny or The Donald himself. I asked
              Fred De Cordova, the producer of the Tonight Show for over 30 years.
              The opportunity came when a good friend at the time (a member of a
              famous band) was performing on the Tonight Show and I was invited to
              tag along. I got to sit in the green room with Martha Stewart and
              Sinbad. But I digress. Anyway, while strolling backstage with my friend
              we happened upon an elderly gentleman standing alone near the stage
              entrance (where Jay now emerges from each weeknight). It was Mr. De
              Cordova. He had since retired but, I was told later, still liked to
              hang out around his old stomping grounds. This chance meeting occurred
              just a few months before he passed away in September of 2001.</p>
              <p>My friend and he spoke for a short time, as I stood silently aside,
              then we parted ways. I remember thinking just moments after about the
              Trump “myth” and regretted my missed opportunity to ask him about it.
              But a short time later I was allowed to explore on my own. Sure enough,
              Mr. De Cordova was still there. With more than a little apprehension I
              approached him and sheepishly introduced myself. He shook my hand and
              remembering me from our earlier indirect meeting asked if I was “with
              the band.” Once I had giddily provided him with may to much information
              about my utter lack of musical talent, I took a breath, and popped the
              question. With only a moment’s pause, he replied that he did recall
              such a conversation. And I was surprised to learn that I was not the
              first to have asked him about it! He did not recall the details of the
              previous inquiry, but he was clear on the Trump/Carson exchange…</p>
              <p>…and that Donald Trump was just kidding.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>anyway good luck with your VE escapade. From all your false information, we can deduce that you are still in VE :)</p>

                  u r really a dreamster - still in ur own dream. please wake up and read. I am not targeting school dropouts. There is absolutely nothing wrong with them. 
                  I am targeting ur company venture era!!!
                  Teach u guys wrong things. So what if ur pay is 4k 5k? (if thats ever true n i doubt so lol)
                  tell ur so call "friends" in the company to get lost and stop the propaganda.
                  During these difficult times where alot of companies are affected, I wonder if mlm companies still claim themselves making money now. If they claim they are then it must be very obvious that they must be lying all along.

              <p>you can choose not to believe this but the best time when an mlm company grows is when the economy is bad, just do proper research of looking through statistics and not from people's comments, statistics are much hard proof you will ever need, but words from people's mouth can't be believed all the time, just like i'm telling you all this stuff, whether you want to believe or not, you can check it up yourself or you can choose to complain and whine and be a victim to the circumstances happening around you, it's you're life, you make the decision.</p>

              <p>First, I have already shown to you that Adam Khoo is a university
                  graduate with first class honours. Not a school dropout who stopped at
                  primary school and still became a millionaire. Your example is totally
                  out. Try a better example.</p>

              <p>Fresh grad with first class honours in a job can already earn near 3~4k in a job in which you still have lots of free time excluding bonus.</p>
              <p>And for a fresh grad, setting up group tuition isn't very hard. Easily 2k to 3k or even more a month from tuition.</p>
              <p>Given the time you would have to spend, I would say 4k/5k is extremely little. Really can't believe that you tried to sound like you have high ambitions, yet don't see earning 4/5k as being little.</p>

              its people's freedom to choose wateva they want to believe in and I have no right to criticise u.
              If u truly earn 4 to 5k thru mlm then congrats to u.
