              <p>Yes, i undertsand that selling to strangers have a lower chance of closing rate. But as i am still under going training, my first few appointments will be with my friends.</p>

              <p>First point, there are 3 ways for people to sell
              things,.....</p>
              <p> 1. put your product on the table or shelf to let people
              buy.</p>
              <p>2. call up your friends to tell them about this product</p>
              <p>3. knock door to door to sell to strangers.</p>
              <p>He also told us that those who did not make is at SA or drop
              outs of course won't achive their dreams.</p>
              <p>He added that if Venture Era is selling health products to
              people and people think MLM is a scam, he asked us if a hospital or
              small shops are selling different health products to people... Is
              it right for them to do that or is it a scam?</p>

              <p>You know, actually I have no comments on your posts till I read this part. Your post oversimplify the whole situation.</p>
              <p>Hospitals put their reputation and professionalism at risk to sell the products to patients. They arent your neighbourhood one day old setup which could scoot away, neither are they your pushy door to door vendors. I wouldnt say its 100% safe, but the degree of scrutiny on their products backed by the army of medical practitioners is at comfortable level. I am not sure why you lump 'hospital' and 'scam' together.</p>
              <p>Neither is it realistic to lump small shops and MLM together. MLM is considered scams by many is largely due to the business model and lack of professionalism among the agents, which bring suspicions on the products that they are pushing. Shops take a reactive approach and only sell to people who patronises them. They are not like MLMers who have to reach out to consumers instead.</p>
              <p>Your statement is giving the impression people are biased against MLM because they are selling health products, but show different attitude towards hospitals and small shops, neglecting that MLM, hospitals and small shops are unequitable entities, and that health products is not a defining factor in why people think MLM is a scam.</p>
              <p>Please, like I have told other MLMers before, do not oversimplify matters and put them into few liners and end off with a lot of insinuations. Its unprofessional and superbly inaccurate</p>

              <p>1st. we will not bluff to sell our products. <strong>we will share the truth on what the products can do, backed up by science and professionals.</strong></p>
              <p>2nd. we will not pester our family and friends to buy products because <strong>we respect their decision to know whats best for themselves.</strong></p>

              <p><br>reply to ur 1st statment:</p>
              <p>probably some of the agent need to learn more about the product that they are selling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>reply to your 2nd statement:</p>
              <p>when their friends and family do not want to buy their products, they asked them to join VE themselves. Thats the pestering part when they really find ways and means to get the person to join VE. i got a friend who got very traumatised simply because her friend pressure (and after attending those talks in VE) to join and her parents simply refused to let her join even after one of the agent went to her house to explain the whole thing to her mother. The family relationship got jeopardize because of the whole incident.</p>
              <p>i must say some of the agents in MLM companies are very professional, but some are simply pulling downlines and thats it.</p>
              <p>one thing to note though, it has been quite a while since i see "fruitful" discussion in this thread and previously, those who supported MLM has to resort to flaming in here, but i can see some light in this thread finally.</p>

              <p>I must say, it is true that more and more people are getting the idea that MLM is "scam". I remember there was this local TV serial drama showing this part when there was this lady doing MLM was trying to sell dunnoe wad pill or pillow and kind of like pestering and "grabbing" every opportunity to sell. It might not hav potrayed that MLM is bad itself, but it showed things that are really happening and people will have the idea that people doing MLM are only after money, not real friendship.</p>

              <p>This isnt a reply to my post.</p>
              <p>I have asked specifically why he compare three unequitable entities together, and oversimplifying the situation. What is he insinuating by jumping from VE selling health products and stating that hospitals and shops are also selling health products? What are his grouses that he did not dare to make clear? After all these, what have you answered for him that and which he simply 'parroted' along?</p>
              <p>Not only that, in return, you can only make conclusions about skeptics without pointing out how and why, when you dont even respond specifically to my posts. How to justify skeptics no having other responses other than 'its a scam la'</p>
              <p>Bear in mind, you are promoting your business, if you cant win people over and resort to lambasting people who dont give you business, be professional and stop whining like a sore loser.</p>
              <p>Consumer have their rights, and the best businessmen are those who won over their customers, not whining about it.</p>
