It's all abt innovation, how confident u are in the product u've created and how bold u are to promote it, without external financial help, where u're not afraid to lose it all and restart again. I dun see that in MLM. And pls dun refer to urself as an entrepreneur if u're at the bottom of the MLM corporate ladder. No, the first stage of whatever 'manager' rank they give u doesn't count, cos' the 'manager' I met is merely a young punk who haven't even tasted the soil in NS. It's just a make-believe term used by those high ranking managers, to make u feel good and continue to work blindly for them[b]</strong><br><br>VE is not entrepreneurship. VE is just a place where people hang around there , wasting time. Dreaming that they can earn bucks throught their friends and relatives. When all their contacts are used up, they start targeting young students who are looking for part-time. Using cunning and underhand means, VE ' managers ' told the students that they are short-listed for an interview which end up using lies to recuit them. This is what 'managers' in VE told their down line to do because they are despo for money. and also, people think that VE is a place that makes money? showing some videos about 2 guy in cartoon? thats stupid and dumb. brainwashing technique. just wake up please! you can say whatever you want, praising VE or what. Government promoting MLM? because the Government needs money too! GST 7%?<br><br>Average income families? they have difficulites even in paying their child's school fee, PUB bills and etc. AND THOSE HEARTLESS VE PEOPLE STILL NEVER NEVER GIVE UP AIMING THOSE AUNITES TO BUY THEIR " INCREDIBLE " PRODUCT!!! WHEN PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE 3 MEAL PER DAY??!!! VE ARE HEARTLESS! THEY ARE JUST PRETENDING TO BE NICE, BUT THEY JUST WANT YOU TO MAKE MONEY FOR THEM! WAKE UP PLEASE!!! THAT IS NOT ENTREPRENEURSHIP! BMW? 5 figure income? if everyone were to be able to own them, VE would have died long ago.<br><br>Governement encouraging entrepreneurship? you got the wrong idea. Is VE for entrepreneurship? the answer is no. VE is teaching everyone there the wrong things. putting a mask over their faces, using lies and temptations, getting innocent youngsters in joining them. VE offices are just for show. Those "MANAGERS" "EARNING $2K PER MONTH" are just sitting down there, advicing their downline and continue brainwash them. never to let them go. i tell you this because i was once in VE. I TOTALLY HATE THE WAY THEY TARGETING PEOPLE! SO SICKENING! GROSS ME COMPLETELY AND I HATE THAT PLACE! VE is just a wolf in sheep's clothing. IT WILL BE EXPOSED ONE DAY! IT WILL! AND IT WILL BE THE DAY WHEN THOSE PEOPLE IN VE ARE SEEING THE REAL LIGHT!<br><br>STOP YOUR LIES AND DESIRES FOR MONEY IN UNDER MEAN WAYS! YOU WAN MONEY? EARN IT IN A DOWN-TO-EARTH WAY! REPENT BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!![/b]</blockquote>Yes I still remember when I was in that company, my upline convinced me to go to this auntie house to present my product, but then I was against the idea cuz my auntie is not well off, and I don't want to burden her ... so I told him that I don't want to present the product to her ... but he kept trying to brainwash me .. in the end .. I keep saying no and no . and then he gave up and gave a frown face.<br><br>I am so embarassed of myself .. for being such a fool in joining this heartless company, this poster is right, entrepreneurship is about innovation and ideas, not this crappy mlm shit.<br><br>Its useless.<br><br>I'm so stupid.<br>so so so stupid.<br></div>

But in fact, the $300 - $400 actually come from the first deal u clinch with yr parents or guardians to be promoted from MA(P) to MA (mktg agent on probation to mktg agent).<br><br>I rmb when one of the mktg mgr first called me, he mentioned that this job is also related to my course. I'm doing a science course at poly. how is this related to VE?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Perhaps it's the presenting thingy (any job will req presentations anyway). other than that, it isn't related to my science course at all. In fact, anyone from any field can do this -.-<br><br>Ugh... crazy &amp; materialistic VE ppl. Out to rob ppl's money away. Only care abt big pays and cars. Their "benefitting ppl with healthcare pdts" is just an excuse for them to get their downline to approach EVERY SINGLE family member.<br><br>In fact, they're hypocrites! I rmb after one long boring and unproductive day at VE, some ppl from my 'team' were happily smoking outside. Prolly they hv their MT matresses to remove all the toxins from their body after smoking. zzz<br><br>They can do whatever they want now, but I'm sure one day their unethical ways will be exposed and VE will fall!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Do read abt my 'adventure' at VE at my 12 Oct post in this thread.</div>
