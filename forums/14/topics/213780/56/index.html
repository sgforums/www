              <p>1) The forum is already not registered in Singapore. Just because it is named sgforums doesn't mean it is registered here.</p>
              <p>2) It is not a broadcasting station. There's no licence, not is it authorised by law to broadcast anything. A forum is a place for chit chats, not for broadcasting.</p>

              <p>So back to the question which you keep avoiding.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is sgforums
              responsible a not for such a post?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's extremely easy to cover one's tracks, start an account and
              accuse, defame you, in sgforums. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">So if you want to take legal action,
              are you going to sue sgforums?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note: I'm giving you the case where the IP cannot be traced.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I would also like to see
              pacer going all the way to UK to take legal action there to get the
              IP address, then come back to Singapore and take legal action to
              get the owner of the IP address from the local service
              provider.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And hor...</p>
              <p>1) The forum is already not registered in Singapore. Just
              because it is named sgforums doesn't mean it is registered
              here.</p>
              <p>2) It is not a broadcasting station. There's no licence, not is
              it authorised by law to broadcast anything. A forum is a place for
              chit chats, not for broadcasting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm really finding it hard to keep bringing you back to the
              point because you kept going off tangent. I shall reiterate my
              point:<br> Pacer's efforts will most likely come to naught.</p>
              <p>I don't see any reason why you like to keep going off
              tangent.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I don't know yet because it involves United Kingdom statutes which I am not fimiliar with which I've already mentioned above...</p>

              <p>So conclusion, I can't say for now whether sforums can be held responsible, but unless you can state whether sgforums can't be held responsible either (since its based in UK, UK laws applies), the arguement is on hold for now...</p>
