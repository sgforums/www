              <p>Since I am waiting to join this garena room I shall reply to more questions.</p>
              <p>Gensis asked this "How much do you earn a month?"<br><br>I do not know about others, but I can give you my figures. So far, I have earned around 900-1000 in the month that I am here. I admit that it is not much, and many are 8-5 jobs at $7 an hour gives you more. But I do not complain that its boring compared to all my friends. Cause it is so challenging that sometimes I also get sian, cos it's not easy.<br><br>Many people in the firm do not tell you this, but for me, I tell it to recruitment on their first day here. I tell them this.<br><br>What I can offer you?<br>- I can guarantee that you will learn skills that you will not learn in many other areas, like people managing, people training, sales skills and how to sell yourself. Knowing how to sell yourself is very important. When you go to university interviews or job interviews, it is a battle as to who can sell themselves in the best way. <br>- I cannot guarantee that you will see money very quickly. Maybe not even in the first few months. But you will definitely see money, and I guarantee that in the first year that you join. Because I cannot foretell your luck. We have agents in the firm that we refer to as Child of God, as they close 9 out of the first 10 deals that they go to, and I mean closing big products. We also have people not closing any things in the first two months. I do not know which type of people are you, so I cant guarantee when you will see money.<br>- I can offer you my attention. Only one thing is more important than you. Customers. And I believe that that is logical. Customers are what runs the firm after all, indirectly or directly. <br><br>What I feel is that why youths can join this company is because we can afford to not earn anything for a period of time. Most of us dont pay rent, we dont have a car, and we dont pay tax. That's why we can get jobs to learn skills for now, instead of money. That was what Warren Buffett did, if you didn't know. I am not saying I am Mr Buffett, but who don't want to be him?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Wa I dno how you quote so many at once, eagle, this forum is really alien to me.<br><br>Yes indeed corporate world lets you think a little like an employer, but I was comparing between jobs now. Do you think at the age of 19, I can get a manager job, or be part of a quality assurance team now? I am just waiting for A levels, who will accept me? That's why start in MLM when you are yong like 18-20, then see if you like it, then go on to university and join the corporate world if you do not like MLM. To me that is a reasonable plan. <br><br>You ask how many people make it big in MLM? That very sentence makes you a defeatist already. You are giving up before you even try. Or perhaps you tried, I dno. <br><br>And I do run my own advertising campaign. It's small, but my mentor and I post ads on newspaper to get recruitment. To me it's more ethnical than doing surveys. That method really is unethnical. But I will not say more since it is actually legitimate (Sg govt allows it) and many people, not only MLMs, use that method. <br><br>For corebooster, maybe he/she got a bad mentor. I do not know. But if he had persevered, I will bet all my money that he is doing quite well now. I know he quitted, so you guys would say that I will confirm not lose money. So maybe he can ask around people that joined the same time as him and had stayed on, and what are they doing now. <br><br>Even if I am an employer and I made it far in the firm and I made the company rich and earn 24k a month like my associate head, I do not think I will complain. And any MLMer in Singapore has done what? Please specify your question. There are many replies now so I myself will also get confused, so sorry for that. <br><br>And please do not jump to conclusions like I cannot answer Gensis, for I was replying when you posted that. Once again I appeal for all to maintain a harmonious discussion. Thank You.</p></div>

              <p>I have only one query: for your<a href="http://www.venture-eragroup.com/sg/cal_water.html"> Cal Ion Water</a>, how does (I quote from the link):</p>
              <p><em>'.....the alkaline (pH) level of Cal Ion water at 7.5 â 8.5, helps to neutralize the body toxins and other acidic substances and aids in prevention of diseases</em>'?</p>
              <p>Because as far as I know,</p>
              <p>1). The stomach contains highly concentrated hydrochloric acid which will instantly neutralise any slightly-alkaline inflow of food and water</p>
              <p>2). Human blood contains buffer solutions to control the pH within a narrow pH range</p>
              <p>3). Any minor change of the pH of blood will denature the enzymes in the blood and lead to a lot of problems for the human body.</p>
              <p>Believe me, I am being objective. I am simply on the side of science, and I want to see the scientific rationale behind your products.</p>

              <p>Wa I dno how you quote so many at once, eagle, this forum is
                  really alien to me.<br> <br> Yes indeed corporate world lets you think a little like an
                  employer, but I was comparing between jobs now. Do you think at the
                  age of 19, I can get a manager job, or be part of a quality
                  assurance team now? I am just waiting for A levels, who will accept
                  me? That's why start in MLM when you are yong like 18-20, then see
                  if you like it, then go on to university and join the corporate
                  world if you do not like MLM. To me that is a reasonable
                  plan.<br> <br> You ask how many people make it big in MLM? That very sentence
                  makes you a defeatist already. You are giving up before you even
                  try. Or perhaps you tried, I dno.<br> <br> And I do run my own advertising campaign. It's small, but my mentor
                  and I post ads on newspaper to get recruitment. To me it's more
                  ethnical than doing surveys. That method really is unethnical. But
                  I will not say more since it is actually legitimate (Sg govt allows
                  it) and many people, not only MLMs, use that method.<br> <br> For corebooster, maybe he/she got a bad mentor. I do not know. But
                  if he had persevered, I will bet all my money that he is doing
                  quite well now. I know he quitted, so you guys would say that I
                  will confirm not lose money. So maybe he can ask around people that
                  joined the same time as him and had stayed on, and what are they
                  doing now.<br> <br> Even if I am an employer and I made it far in the firm and I made
                  the company rich and earn 24k a month like my associate head, I do
                  not think I will complain. And any MLMer in Singapore has done
                  what? Please specify your question. There are many replies now so I
                  myself will also get confused, so sorry for that.<br> <br> And please do not jump to conclusions like I cannot answer Gensis,
                  for I was replying when you posted that. Once again I appeal for
                  all to maintain a harmonious discussion. Thank You.</p>

              <p>Yawns</p>
              <p>Another typical MLMer that condemns others fast. Harmonious discussion indeed!</p>
              <p>1) I merely asked a question, then you tell me I'm a defeatist before even raising any example.</p>
              <p>2) Corebooster cannot make it, you tell us it means he got a bad mentor (or he's lousy).</p>
              <p>3) About Gensis' question, who knows. You answered only after I said you cannot answer, then you tell me I jump to conclusions. Bad excuse.</p>
              <p>In any case, you are already showing that you cannot take criticisms or differing opinions on what you are doing.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>So, in short, just go and do what you like ok? Don't say pple never warn you. It's your life. Not even asking you to join the corporate world. More of telling you to go in with eyes wide open.</p>

              <p>I have only one query: for your <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.venture-eragroup.com/sg/cal_water.html">Cal Ion Water</a>, how does (I quote from the link):</p>
              <p><em>'.....the alkaline (pH) level of Cal Ion water at 7.5 â 8.5,
              helps to neutralize the body toxins and other acidic substances and
              aids in prevention of diseases</em>'?</p>
              <p>Because as far as I know,</p>
              <p>1). The stomach contains highly concentrated hydrochloric acid
              which will instantly neutralise any slightly-alkaline inflow of
              food and water</p>
              <p>2). Human blood contains buffer solutions to control the pH
              within a narrow pH range</p>
              <p>3). Any minor change of the pH of blood will denature the
              enzymes in the blood and lead to a lot of problems for the human
              body.</p>
              <p>Believe me, I am being objective. I am simply on the side of
              science, and I want to see the scientific rationale behind your
              products.</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>You are waiting for your A Levels and trying to defend MLM against a group of graduates/middle aged managers working in the real corporate world.Â  Don't you think they know something that you don't?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Bringing up impressive names like Warren Buffet and Ray Kroc and Bill Gates and trying to link them back to MLM are just techniques that your MLM "manager" or "mentor" use to entice you (and other young impressionable kids) to join these MLM companies.Â  All the glitz and cars and money that they flash in front of you are just that, for flashing in front of you.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>As far as I know, most of these MLM companies depend on more and more suckers to be recruited for the top "managers" to make more money.Â  If they can a few thousand dollars from gullible students like you, it is income for them without having to lift a finger to do any real work.Â  The products that they purportedly sell can be crap shit from space for all they care.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Call it being your own boss or entrepeneurship or striking out on your own or being a "manager".Â  Sooner or later, you will realise the moral and unethical issues.Â Â </p>
