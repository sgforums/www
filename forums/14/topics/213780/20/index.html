              <p>having more awards that not proof that one product is better the other... Were they 'nominated' for the same award? what was based on getting this certain award? It all comes down to advertisements n exposure to the market...</p>
              <p>Lets compare carlsberg beer &amp; Tiger beer as an eg. Which one is the better product? I would say that it would depend on the consumer itself even though tiger beer may won many awards.</p>

              <p>you may not know, however most diamond water agents too claim that their water filter is the best in singapore.</p>
              <p>what i mean is , if the qualitites VE agents claim is true, why dont they put it up on their web as well, like diamond water?</p>

              <p>so wat u r trying to say is that, because VE agents dun put up on their web abt how good their product is compared to diamond water, that means that VE cal star is inferior than Diamond water's?</p>

              <p>So lets put 2 beautiful ladies looking for love on the net... Girl A puts lots of good info on herself than Girl B, does that mean that Girl be is inferior than girl A?</p>

              <p>i understand what are you trying to say... however this is not
              like something which is cheap, eg a pen from a stationary shop. you
              wont feel the pinch. its only 1 dolar...  we are talking about
              a price difference of about 2k here... would you buy something from
              your niece knowing that it costs 2k more the outside?</p>
              <p>not saying you are wrong.. however, to me.. i personally wont
              buy.. perhaps different people got different mind set..</p>
              <p>teh credibility part... diamond water has their own tv show and
              such.. if you were to choose between who products, one which is
              widly advertised and has many awards and proofs for show that it
              works, or another which has no backing and claims that it works
              from certain indivisuals... i would not judge you by your choice ,
              however can you give me an answer for this qn?</p>

              <p>what qns is that?! u haf already said that its up to perspective! so if it's my perspective, y shud i answer to YOU?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they did put credits means that management is poor or product is flawed? I dun get u, it just means that the product have no strong credibility, but that does NOT PROVE that they product is inferior to another product or does it say that is the best... I didnt NOT agree that VE cal star is the best... But YOU R PUTTING DOWN the product based on what you SEE on the WEB.</p>
              <p>The awards that they claimed they have won, is it credible sources... Who knows that the award is from some awards that doesnt exist... Would u know? unless u r a diamond water agent who is trying to put down VE...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You wouldnt know that carlsberg go around telling ppl that they r better than Tiger... Y not u go and ask the manufacturer and the whole co. if they taste better than Tiger... They wont say that they r better but they think that theirs is better... It's perspective...</p>
              <p>Abt VE agents putting down other products it goes back to ETHICS! How would I know y the hell they do that, I am not an agent YET! or will i follow or condone such acts... So y BOTHER ASKING ME Y THEY DO THAT?!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's really irritating having to answer such irrelevant qns... Y not u do what u plan to do to starve VE ppl then we'll see if it works...</p>

              <p>This is where u and i haf a problem... i do not judge which product is better even if they all try to psycho me which one is better...

And u INSIST as it is w/o hard prove...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Answer my qns: <strong>HOW</strong> <strong>is</strong> Diamond Water better than VE's Cal star? Or vice versa?</p>
              <p>Provide credibility NOT from the web coz they claim it as it is... They lie, would u know? U wont also be CONvinced by them the same way...</p>

              <p>My qns is HOW... Better in design? Health benefits? have u encountered any experiments? Do u know how both product is made? How both product works to ppl?</p>

              <p>Just a general comment - most "awards" are bullshit.</p>
              <p>You can basically buy awards for your product.</p>
              <p>Usually what happens is the company will sponsor something - so perhaps the company will buy a lot of advertising in Reader's Digest, or will sponsor some Reader's Digest affliate. You then have the right to submit your product for consideration for an award. But they will just say your product was "nominated" for the award.</p>
              <p>And usually, there will be so many catagories that you will be sure to win something.</p>

              <p>Long time didnt post here...</p>
              <p>elementalangel, i dun get u... I wasnt defending VE, i was trying to get STRAIGHT facts... I am just PISSED that you always say something bull w/o proof and be happy abt it. (How childish)...</p>
              <p>by doing this I am member of VE? FIY, i am strongly considering joining VE, mostly on elementalagel's part...You made me realised that MOST ppl here r those that FEEL that they r cheated by VE, therefore their posts are very opinionated and NOT 100% true...</p>
              <p>Glad though that u admit that u r very opinionated on ur posts...(I just read from page 1-20)... I dun get abt the car though... Y loser if they get car?</p>
              <p>Abt the awards... So, u do agree with Phaze that 'most' awards are bull? If so, y waste money on some 'bull' award? Like I have said, would you know if VE spent money vying for the same award?</p>

              <p>Again, it depends on what you mean by "better than nothing."</p>
              <p>Most awards have no intrinsic merit because any company can basically buy the award. So it really boils down to the marketing strategy and how important are awards to your customer base.</p>
              <p>So if you feel that it's important to your potential customers that your products have many awards, you would pursue that strategy. Someone else might argue that awards don't really drive sales so they may choose not to spend their marketing budget that way.</p>

              <p>would you be proud by driving a car where you had to cheat your families and friends for it...</p>
              <p>i am not totally against this thing,, i have friends in it.. however the got it straight that i would not join them from the start... if you dont really care about r/s with your friends and family or you are REALLY good at handling R/S problems, why not give it a shot?</p>
              <p>the pricing and such. if you dont mind a distributer earning so much (400% of cost), give it a shot too?</p>

              <p>Ah.... The 1st sentence already like that... Baseless claim... What is it of cheating families &amp; friends? It is your OPINION(+ some others)... PROVE?PROVE?PROVE?</p>
              <p>Cheating friends n families HOW?</p>
              <p>As I have said b4, this is where I have a problem... BASELESS CLAIMS...</p>
              <p>I tot as u have mentioned b4, that distributors are paid $400?</p>
              <p>I dun mind the high price, since there's a lot of things that the co. have to cover... rent of place, electricity, phone bills, distributor commission, incentive etc...</p>
              <p>And pricing expensive or not to consumer as Phaze once said, it's a matter of PERSPECTIVE...</p>

              <p>seriously.. all of your claims are w/o proof too... they are just.. yours have no proofs... typical example of a loser debate team...</p>

              <p>debater A :do you have proof that god doesnt exist ?<br>debater B: no<br>debater A: SEE? there fore it exist</p>
              <p>of your families and friends know that there are ways you can get it much cheaper and u sell it to them so much more expensive. once they discovers it, you are in deep shit...</p>
              <p>have you seen an ethical agent before?</p>
              <p>that is because of their structure... the agents have no basic pay and they want to earn more and more money..... thats why they resort to "cheating" people into their office for more downlines... you have seen agents not cheat people down into their office before?</p>
              <p>do you have proof that the agents dont scam people down? i have a whole lot of proof that teh agents scam people down..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i HAVE ALREADY PROVEN THE COST OF PRODUCTS BTW&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
              <p>the company have to cover so many things right? so they take 300% of the cost to rent a office in a lousy area.... 2 dolars psf?</p>
              <p>totalling to abt 10k-20k a mth?</p>

              <p>You call me a loser debate team? Look yourself in the mirror, opps, i mean look at all ur previous posts... I TRY to show logic to you... U r the one who is bragging like a child abt how ppl are cheating or these product is gd and that product is bad. calling ppl loser... Look at all ur previous post here...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Price of the product, tell the truth, if the product sells at $2K +++, how much commission do the agent really get since the product is sooo 'expensive'...(not many ppl want to buy-assuming)-how much profit if not many ppl buy... As I have said matter of perspective... Space in s'pore is damn expensive if u have not read/seen the news... Again, lousy place? why is it lousy?  ? ? ? ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would u know what the co. would have done with the money(that they gain)... 1st go to boss, the rest I have mentioned... So, if relatives say that they can get it cheaper, then so be it... It's their choice to buy it from the agent or not... </p>
              <p>Why should the agent be in deep shit since the product cost goes to so much...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am aware that there is a lot of unethical agents... All of them are unthetical??? U r BRANDING the whole lot based on what YOU see...</p>
              <p>I have not seen an ethical agent so far as I havent join them... If there isnt any ethical ones(I strongly doubt so), Then I'll be an ethical one...</p>
