              <p>Heroin, or its derivative Morphine, is still being used in the medical field as a painkiller for lung cancer patients. It's good for them, relieve their pain. So there are afterall people who used heroin well. At least they can still write a will after that.</p>

              <p>Firstly, corebooster, I am surprised that at your age you have already completed NS. I am your age but I am waiting for NS. A thing I would like to ask if being an officer matters a lot when entering universities and applying for scholarships. Cos I am still deciding whether to aim to be an officer inside. And maybe when i come out of NS people will accept me into a good position like yours now, but with only 3 months to commit before entering NS, few will want me.<br><br>Also, your group seems to be rather small. The group that I am in now is considered of a size slightly below average, and there are already 20-30 people in my group. So I think that your business manager really had some problems. Maybe that is why you quit after 2 weeks, as you couldnt find help that you want or answers to questions that you were asking due to the limited number of people that you could us.<br><br>My mentor who is a business manager two star is earning about 4-5k of passive income a month. As mentioned his organization has about 20-30 active people. His income is stable cause his group is not small. Your business manager probably had shaky income due to his small group and not all may have been active. That's why he quitted</p>

              <p><br>Fyi, when i mentioned my group, it refers to my close friends in VE. if u want to know the team im in, its a group of at least 50 acquaitance.</p>
              <p>and when i refer to BM. its my friend, who went in the same time as me, who got promoted all the way to BM and left 3 months ago.He downline comprises of agents and consumers. Pay-wise, its unstable, secondly, he realised that, the confidence in the product was no longer there.</p>
              <p>I left not because the BM was unable to answer my qns, but rather, his answer was not in tandum with my values.</p>
