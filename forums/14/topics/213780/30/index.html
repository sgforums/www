              <p>EA,</p>
              <p>You were being childish(though your intention may not be).  The way your posts were written seems childish, which enquires replied childishly too, especially when you are the one posting... And no doubt that your english is better than enquires, but i dont think that its appropriate to condemn him based on his command of english.</p>
              <p>He initially lied that he was in VE, i too condemn such cowardly acts. But not because his command of english is bad. I am not on your side or his. This is my own view of things on what's going on.</p>
              <p>I believe owning a 2nd hand BMW car is alright for a car achiever. He can buy a toy truck for car incentive for all i care... If it's true that he laughs at others for driving other 'lousier' car, then condemn him. If he did laugh at others, it only shows how arrogant he is. ( Is this guy bryan soh?)</p>
              <p>It's true that i can't please everyone. And I am NOT trying to. This is just me... If you think that I am trying to please you, well..... Don't think so highly of yourself... The only person I need to please is just me...</p>

              <p>and if u acted what u acted like when he said i was childish.. please proceed to asking enquiries to stop typing or help him edit coz his englist sux...</p>

              <p>From Wiki:</p>
              <p>Singapore has perhaps the world's <strong>strongest libel laws</strong>. The country's leaders have clearly indicated to the public that libel, as they choose to define it from time to time, <strong>on the Internet will not be tolerated</strong> and that those they deem responsible will be severely punished.</p>
              <p>Reason I can sue is due to the fact that I am not a presentation of the word 'bitch'. Therefore, it is a misinterpretation of who I am. In addition, it is a very vulgar word.</p>

              <p>An interesting topic going on here.</p>
              <p>WSR, it isn't a big deal being called a bitch, really... why not try to leave the guy alone, he isn't worth the effort from his earlier post. Some of the VExposed questions on page 28 isn't answered.</p>
              <p>EA, i think that most comment you gave are sincere &amp; analytical.</p>
              <p>Lol, don't you all think that this is a realistic world?</p>
              <p>So what if someone from VE admit that the product is overpriced? what if someone from VE admit that some of the car achievers are owing money? what if someone from VE admit that, yes i am taking the commision? or some other facts and rumors...</p>
              <p>Hmm... actually MLM isn't that bad... just that the initial approach from distributor (the same or other MLM) causes the negative mindset in ppl and when these spread through people, nothing, absolutely nothing can improve it.</p>
              <p>The profits gained is being magnified here. No doubt that the selling price may be more than 500% of the buying price... but then most people who are rich uses this theory. (Any stalls selling things, especially food) So why aren't they being targeted? Lol, do any one of you seriously consider that it's worth it? Maybe it does. But when you spend about $2k in food outside, i guess that the cost price is around $500? No one is complaining eh?</p>
              <p>laurence82 if shops take a reactive approach and only sell to people who patronises them.. erm... erm ... erm then how do you expect the customer to know what products are there in the market? Somehow, sales reps have to push for the products initially, to get that product out of the market. They of course can do it through advertisement, but then why will they do it if it decreases their revenue? And not forgetting that if reactive approach is being used, there won't be so much jobs out there. (this is just a comment, not directed towards you)</p>
              <p>I am just one who had gone down twice, and today will be the third time.</p>
              <p>If ever, it is true that my 'upline' will push me to get in contact with my friends and family to sell the products, then i guess i will leave as well. (not that i don want, but it will be too early to recommend the products that i am unsure of)</p>
              <p>Not forgetting that some of the training that they give are useful. (and seriously it can be applied to real life scenarios) Let's not focus that it is 'brainwashing'... It's just that whether those people will use it in their life (it doesn't stop after quitting ventureera)</p>
              <p>Lol i like this sentence: "and say "YES!! YES!! YESS" just like what he do when his higher ranks con his family =x" and i feel that it's pretty irritating -.- </p>
              <p>Oh... and i do love all those 'facts' and 'rumors' in those post although i am wondering if it was right to post those 'harmful' remarks...</p>
