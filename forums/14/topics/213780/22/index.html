              <p>Hi this is David....</p>
              <p> I am here to defend Venture Era again online..... I went to so many different forums in this site and i must say almost 90% replys are bad.</p>
              <p>I myself joined this group because i want to proof myself wrong and others wrong that what they say about MLM been bad is uncorrect. I found out that my friends at VE are all very nice and supportive......... And i learnt alot since i last joined 3 weeks ago. My parents bought the Cal ion water from Ve and they are happily drinking it....... I sold a couple of singles out already. Currently holding the rank of SE still.... And i am aiming by the end of this month or the start of april, i will become a ME myself and have a badge on my shirt.</p>
              <p>To all out there who dun support MLM or Venture Era, why not challenge yourself and take up a business in VE? I can promise you that once you join in MLM, you will not be scared of it anymore. I can tell that</p>

              <p>David, gd for u la to have gd self confident in urself and tat u r doing quite well in VE. I myself dun believe tat mlm is bad. I believe that MOST ppl in the mlm industry is bad coz they like to use unethical techniques.</p>
              <p>care to share wif all of us here the compensation plan for VE, I dun want to waste my trip to Eunos just to see ur compensation plan.</p>
              <p>Ur frens at VE gd n supportive. Of course la. Wait until u r not doing so well, not promoting to next rank and be emotionally down, then see if they still so supportive. My fren was in VE once, she was stuck at the 1st rank, many VE 'frens' talk behind her back and brand her as loser, cannot make it etc.</p>
              <p>And to the last point, what r u trying to do? Recruit ppl? Ppl here not scared of mlm, they join, then this and tat happen. We know wats gg on!. So what challenge is there, when we know tat VE ppl use unethical techniques to sell, recruit. Ur last point really a turnoff sia. Make ppl pissed.</p>
              <p>Dun tell me ur r those naive kids that dunno the world yet, tat VE recruited. They say u do this, u do. Tell u jump off building, u go jump off. Use some brains la. U haf been brainwashed! Save urself b4 its too late.</p>

              <p>well david,</p>
              <p>I am too a member of VE..I dont think that u should BRAG about thigs that you have not accomplished.. It only shows abt your immaturity... Stop and think properly...It good that you have your goals and plans layed out... But its not wise for you to brag about it when you have nothing now...</p>

              <p>I was just thinking of this question over the weekend....</p>
              <p> Why are most people scared of MLM, I asked a friend of mine over sms and i asked him why he is afraid of MLM and he replied : "not sure, maybe because of the word MLM." But i think its what happened to sunshine MLM company that make everyone so scared.</p>
              <p> I don't know why some people keep saying MLM is a scam or some sort grabing other people's money. I don't think that way. When ever i go to a sales appointment. Instead of wanting to earn money, i want to benifit my friends and ask them to try my product because i myself use them at home.</p>
              <p> I was out on the bus on friday to a sales appointment with my friend and i happen to ask my presenter what she think of some people been scared of MLM. She replied that most new SAs just worked for few weeks and gave up without earning money.</p>
              <p> To me, we should not give up in no matter what we do. I did not give up when i was a SA. Now, i am going for my ME rank.</p>
              <p> Anyway, i do hope that singaporeans will change their mind towards MLM and look on the bright side of it. Not all MLM company are as bad as sunshine empire company that closed their store.</p>
              <p> This is my thought and view towards MLM this week......... I am not giving up as yet and i will continue to work hard even though people might reject me as a MLM member.</p>

              <p>First point, there are 3 ways for people to sell things,.....</p>
              <p> 1. put your product on the table or shelf to let people buy.</p>
              <p>2. call up your friends to tell them about this product</p>
              <p>3. knock door to door to sell to strangers.</p>
              <p>He also told us that those who did not make is at SA or drop outs of course won't achive their dreams.</p>
              <p>He added that if Venture Era is selling health products to people and people think MLM is a scam, he asked us if a hospital or small shops are selling different health products to people... Is it right for them to do that or is it a scam?</p>
              <p>He also reminded us at Ve that when we all frist start working at VE. There will confrim be alot of rejections by people.</p>
              <p>I went to Venture Era not just to make money and work experience, i decided to join because i want to achive something that normal people can't get in companies outside. When i grow bigger in ranking, i myself can ask people to come join my organization.</p>
              <p>Well,,,, i don't have enough time to write down all here as i need to go back to Venture to help them now. I will tell you guys more about what i learnt in Ve tonight.</p>
              <p>Btw, postme any of your questions in this forum and i try to get back to you ASAP.</p>

              <p>He added that if Venture Era is selling health products to people and people think MLM is a scam, he asked us if a hospital or small shops are selling different health products to people... Is it right for them to do that or is it a scam?</p>
              <p>He also reminded us at Ve that when we all frist start working at VE. There will confrim be alot of rejections by people.</p>
              <p>I went to Venture Era not just to make money and work experience, i decided to join because i want to achive something that normal people can't get in companies outside. When i grow bigger in ranking, i myself can ask people to come join my organization.</p>
              <p>Well,,,, i don't have enough time to write down all here as i need to go back to Venture to help them now. I will tell you guys more about what i learnt in Ve tonight.</p>
              <p>Btw, postme any of your questions in this forum and i try to get back to you ASAP.</p>
              <p> Take care and god bless all of you.</p>
