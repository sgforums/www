              <p>So, one day i was called down for interview at some v.e group, the guy refused to give the full name of the company, only going with "v.e group" i decided to go since i had nothing on hand.</p>
              <p>It was rubbish, car winners, top sellers, and people posing in suits, i left early after a crap presentation on why the de-oxygenised water will help preserve your organs due to prevention of oxidation of organs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.And the guy who brought me in finally let slip and told me in the meeting the "managers will teach you how to make money from our products."</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Lummies:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>       Eagle Bro , i suggest you
              should watch the Movie : The Secret : Law of Attraction . Seriously
              in the society of Singapore , if you want to be successful. You
              really have to think out of the box . Be the minority than the
              majority , you must always be in front of the trend in Singapore.
              Now MLM ,NM is legal in Singapore , is just that there are some MLM
              company are those "Black " but there are some who are operating
              legally.Now for what i know Venture Era is a Company who obtain
              ISO9001:2001 which means in product and COMPANY . Now in Singapore
              , to obtain ISO for Company ( not product ) is actually very hard.
              They have to gone through alot of processes.</p>
              <p>         <strong>Now Venture Era
              is a company who have reputation , name , good customer service.
              Thats the point you all cannot deny </strong>. You can say that MLM and NM
              is not good.But the product is innocent right?</p>
              <p>        Think of this again ,
              NTU already have Network Marketing as an optional course. If you
              think that network marketing is a scam . This indirectly saying
              that MOE is teaching you how to scam? Isnt It?</p>
              <p>         Next point
              , "Brainwash" i give u an example , in olympic . Every athletes are
              train in their best of the best condition and it reach the limit.
              But why there is people win and lose . Its not about their physical
              , but is because of their desire towards gold medal and bring the
              glory to the country. Their desire towards Victory is always very
              strong . You compared someone who have no desire and have poor
              mentality thinking with a person who have strong believe and strong
              desire .You would find alot of difference .</p>
              <p>        If what i said is not
              true , well take it i am talking to the wall.If its true , then
              think about what is the most practical thing on the earth =) 
              ( the answer is obvious )</p>
              <p>       People would saying  (
              Wow recruit 2 person and you can earn money and get 5 figure income
              ) Now what is Network Marketing .... its through network . Come on
              use your brain and think. Not all people you recruit will fight
              with you and they find recruit will stay with you.</p>
              <p>        You just need 2
              of the person in all Recruited who willing to fight for you is
              enough. Thats what they mean.They doesnt mean where you just need
              to find any 2 of them.This is common sense i am sure you would
              understand.</p>
              <p>        Well i guess i end
              here if not when i login to see again i would have flooded by
              people =x</p>

              <p>I have not even gone into saying anything about MLM and network marketing yet... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Don't know why the unprovoked reaction and post for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Maybe it's guilt conscience and self-pacification at work <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>MLMers may succeed, but this poster definitely won't. Went totally off-tangent. Or is that the style he used to sell things? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i have read countless of self-improvement books and yet you are here saying that if I do not believe in the mlm system therefore I do not read self-improvement books. Mind you that self-improvement books does not mean money only, but also in other factors. By what you are saying, without mlm, I cannot earn a substantial amount.</p>

                              lol wats the use of reading all those self improvement book when u all dun even have basic business ethics???
                              u r right i dun read all those self improvement books becos I dun need them. so what if u read them all? 
                              They are just çº¸ä¸Šè°ˆå…µ anyway
                              MLM makes my blood boil and I sibei buay song is that they spun a web of lies using cars as baitand they always use tactics like peer pressure from ur so called "friends" in mlm. Also they normally gave empty promises and unrealistic promotion opportunities (Career path? LOL) and they mainly target naive people like students and make them scapegoats.
                              I can use my head n guarantee that mlm is a failure and no need to waste ur time in this line. 
                              I would rather go sell insurance then dwell with this unorthodox time wasting thing.
                              Btw im a business student and I studied proper business skills and strategies.
                              mlmers are just a bunch of unrealistic losers, wanting to learn how to fly b4 learning how to walk. 
                              Then when they join the cult, they are stuck with the goods health products like useless mattress, useless bracelets selling at overpriced price.
                              I think rather than join mlm, go rob a bank is faster and can guarantee u see money. 
                              investing in mlm is like throwing ur money down the drain. Only PHD people believe that mlm could work.
                          continue to dream big angeleon, wif mlm in ur dreams. passive income? charity work? how about be more realistic a bit? mlm doesnt take u anywhere. U sure u make SUBSTANTIAL INCOME OR LOSSES? why not reveal ur true income amount to us?
                  lol professionalism? does mlm require that? continue to dream on as u are nothing more than just a salesman who struggles to climb up the social ladder.

              <p><br>so??? lol wats the use of reading all those self improvement book when u all dun even have basic business ethics??? u r right i dun read all those self improvement books becos I dun need them. so what if u read them all? They are just çº¸ä¸Šè°ˆå…µ anyway MLM makes my blood boil and I sibei buay song is that they spun a web of lies using cars as baitand they always use tactics like peer pressure from ur so called "friends" in mlm. Also they normally gave empty promises and unrealistic promotion opportunities (Career path? LOL) and they mainly target naive people like students and make them scapegoats. I can use my head n guarantee that mlm is a failure and no need to waste ur time in this line. I would rather go sell insurance then dwell with this unorthodox time wasting thing. Btw im a business student and I studied proper business skills and strategies. mlmers are just a bunch of unrealistic losers, wanting to learn how to fly b4 learning how to walk. Then when they join the cult, they are stuck with the goods health products like useless mattress, useless bracelets selling at overpriced price. I think rather than join mlm, go rob a bank is faster and can guarantee u see money. investing in mlm is like throwing ur money down the drain. Only PHD people believe that mlm could work. continue to dream big angeleon, wif mlm in ur dreams. passive income? charity work? how about be more realistic a bit? mlm doesnt take u anywhere. U sure u make SUBSTANTIAL INCOME OR LOSSES? why not reveal ur true income amount to us? lol professionalism? does mlm require that? continue to dream on as u are nothing more than just a salesman who struggles to climb up the social ladder.</p>
