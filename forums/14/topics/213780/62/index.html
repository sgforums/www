            <div class='col-md body'><p>hi eagle, when i said that in my company, when i have a lot of downlines, passive income can be generated because we have an auto-ship of products, meaning we not only build the business but we are also the customers of the products, my downlines are also the customers of the products and since they order every month, and i get a percentage off their purchases then they are already like my customers who purchase goods from me every month. hope you understand that.</p></div>

              <p>of course I understand that simple point.</p>
              <p>But you still fail to understand my point (which I have repeated.... twice?) about passive income. -.-"</p>
              <p>Anyway, up to you la... I rather focus on the conventional way.... As of now... my dividends from stocks will already average $120 a month, excluding fixed Ds or money market funds in my "security basket" etc etc. And I'm looking at &gt;30 years time horizon for that. This is only about 6 months after graduation hor. Maybe your downlines will also last you 30 years hor. Looking to acquire other assets like properties to rent out in the near future, with an agent friend who will help to find people to rent for a small commission.... -.-"</p>

              <p>Or just get that amount of money to buy some property, and get rental. You pay agents commission to find tenants. All you need to do is to record down which property you have bought, and how much you collecting...</p>

              <p>1) I gave you reasons in which you have yet to refute. Then you tell me I didn't come to terms with it???? It's not only me you didn't manage to convince; your 'points' didn't convince others as well. Furthermore, the source of your 'points' comes most likely from the MLM companies too. One-sided.</p>
              <p>2) You are a MLM salesman, yet now you think that it's ok to let other win with words. Like that how to sell???</p>
              <p>3) I doubt you have even much headway into life yet, and you are telling people here who are more experienced than you that what matters is whether you win the game of life.</p>
              <p>4) I didn't talk much to friends about businesses. Most of what I understand about money comes from wide reading in addition to having a little hands-on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your persistence in MLM is commendable, but I'm pretty sure this persistence could be better utilised elsewhere in your case. If you have shown greater persistence in improving your studies and knowledge, I think you have a better chance in life.</p>
              <p>There's little point breaking away from tradition. The world richest investor continued to invest in a way that was around damn long ago; he's still successful now because he stuck to the traditional way of investing.</p>
              <p>I have never read a conventional financial book that states that you can achieve wealth and financial freedom from MLM. I think you should read The Richest Man in Babylon to come down to more practical terms.</p>

                  a logical explanation on why his ideas/concept of life work. All of
                  his explainations appear to be logical only to heavily brain washed
                  mlmers.<br> <br> What mlmers dont get is that the bad points of mlms out weigh the
                  good points(if there are any).<br> Why not the mlmers do this. Come out a list with all the good
                  points of mlms regardless if its accepte or not by the masses. And
                  allow the rest to come out with the negative poitns of mlms. Post

              <p>What I know is, a lot of people like get-rich-quick schemes and ideas of early retirement/financial freedom by talking about passive income sources. There are too many of such things in the current world right now... There seems to be a financial awakening, which might be good or bad.</p>
              <p>Some of them get conned easily... Conventional wisdom: if it sounds too good to be true, it is indeed too good to be true</p>

              <p>Ya, you got it. the main thing is that it is a monopoly. So is SPH.</p>
              <p>To me, that constitutes an income stock, part of my income investment strategy. It's something that would almost never fail in Singapore. That's what is important to me.<br>Anyway, it was just an example, yielding about 5% p.a. for Singpost and SPH. One could easily achieve much more (~15%) by applying proper value investment techniques.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are other ways too... some by reading market psychology, some by momentum trading using TA, etc... Or like me recently... play for fun for market psychology (along with some speculation, which I admit is a bad habit)... Bought OCBC and contra-ed off for a small profit after deducting brokerage and clearance fees. :D</p>

              <p>1) I gave you reasons in which you have yet to refute. Then you
              tell me I didn't come to terms with it???? It's not only me you
              didn't manage to convince; your 'points' didn't convince others as
              well. Furthermore, the source of your 'points' comes most likely
              from the MLM companies too. One-sided.</p>
              <p>2) You are a MLM salesman, yet now you think that it's ok to let
              other win with words. Like that how to sell???</p>
              <p>3) I doubt you have even much headway into life yet, and you are
              telling people here who are more experienced than you that what
              matters is whether you win the game of life.</p>
              <p>4) I didn't talk much to friends about businesses. Most of what
              I understand about money comes from wide reading in addition to
              having a little hands-on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your persistence in MLM is commendable, but I'm pretty sure this
              persistence could be better utilised elsewhere in your case. If you
              have shown greater persistence in improving your studies and
              knowledge, I think you have a better chance in life.</p>
              <p>There's little point breaking away from tradition. The world
              richest investor continued to invest in a way that was around damn
              long ago; he's still successful now because he stuck to the
              traditional way of investing.</p>
              <p>I have never read a conventional financial book that states that
              you can achieve wealth and financial freedom from MLM. I think you
              should read The Richest Man in Babylon to come down to more
              practical terms.</p>

              <p>Share price is a different consideration, because I bought for their dividends :D Long term wise, the dividends would have paid off the share price, while you still have the shares. This is especially good if you buy in it the current recession.</p>
              <p>Anyway, about listing, I think they have already tried. Unless you want to see a repeat of all their points.... which is quite boring...</p>
