What is so hard, if a company or its members claim to be good, or have potential?<br><br>I seriously dont understand why they can claim Singaporeans easily give up when its claimed that people dont do well in MLM, when they dont even attempt to answer people's questions.<br><br>While your ordinary company out there is scrambling to shore up any flaw in its customer service, its mind boggling to see MLM industry generally dont really care about it<br><br></div></blockquote>It's either 1:<br><strong>Purely monthly paid wage.</strong> Staff no monetary motivation to sell. Just wait for your money to come. Of cos there's sales target. No matter how much you sell pay is still the same, unless boss ups your wage.<br><br>Scenario 2:<br><strong>Got basic pay, albiet lower. Then additional commission (a few %) of your sales. </strong>This is the best, most stable job in a selling job. Trust me.  You already have a basic stable pay, and there's a commission to entice you to sell more. Since you don't have to worry about not able to bring home money, you can concentrate on selling.<br><br>Scenario 3:<br><br><strong>Purely commission pay.</strong> No basic pay. Worst. Least stable income. Die die got to sell as much as possible. If not no income. It's strongest motivation though. But sometimes some people use underhand or unethical methods to sell. Like lies, misinterpretation, excuses, acts, etc... This is the case of mlms. Financial freedom? Greatest joke ever.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MightyFlameboy:</div><div class="quote_body">Back to the main issue at hand, addressed to shaas_no1, I shan't be lengthy and address all ur pts, and I shall tackle the most concerning issue IMO, which is the phonecall recruitment. Similarly to enquiries, u told me that u personally wun hide the nature of ur company. Yet mths after he made tt statement and promised to educate his agents, I still see MANY cases of ppl getting scammed the same way I was.<br></div></blockquote>I am not sure who called you. Erm if its not from your circle of friends than Im presuming its from what is called 'cold market'. In this instance, its hard to reveal so much and expect the other party to accept it easily over the phone. Recruitment is also another form of selling. Selling the company and the person itself as your potential upline.<br><br>On summary, its hard to educate all agents on the dos and donts. VE allows flexibility yet new agents are taught the fundamentals of Sales appointment and phone techniques. With this mentioned, different agents might change the flow of words mentioned to his own style. Whichever way creates results, the agent decides.<br><br>On the hind-sight, given this flexibility some styles may work all the time yet others will only deter people from joining because they feel cheated and etc.<br><br>Look at it this way, at the end of the day those who strictly follow VE way of doing can only suceed. Some may have implemented their own style which becomes a better tool than taught by VE. They too will succeed. Others who choose to stick to their own style but is not producing results, will only hinder their own progress in the company.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong><br><br>And another bigger prb in local MLM is tt employees and the employers are not tied to contractual bonds. Even if ur employer exploits u, cuts the profit share tt u haf and swallow everything, u haf no case against them, cos' simply, u're not RECOGNISED by manpower laws tt u're under this company. Ur employer can act blur and pretend not to know u, and u're in deep sh!t. Or if he feels tt u're too capable and a big threat to his position, he can simply ask u to get out for good, and u would oso haf no case against him. So much for financial freedom, and job flexibility, when u dun even know whether u're still considered part of the company the next morning. Perhaps shaas_no1 would like to touch a little on this issue?<br><br></strong></blockquote>VE has adopted a good business plan for their agents. There is no need to worry about losing you position in the company.<br><br>In the scenario MightyFlameboy gave where an individual might feel threatened. It is impossible to happen in VE. VE have adopted a very unique business plan which allows everybody to grow to any position they can reach and not feel threatened it will be taken away from them.<br><br>I regret not being able to give a more detailed assurance because it will be un-ethical on my side to show VE details to a large audience like this.<br>Dont get me wrong, I'd be glad to give the details and clear your doubts in person. Be it in the office or somewhere else.<br>But I presume you have come down to the office yourself ?<br>You can see that the business plan allows an individual to go ahead from their upline if they choose to strive harder and enjoy the benefits first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks but no thanks, I feel that since this is a forum, there should be an open discussion for all.

Perhaps u would like to enlighten us on this aspect?<br><br>I dunno the dealings of VE in general. I'm clueless abt wad goes behind the scenes. So, I'll be taking ur word for it, tt ur agents are given the freedom to use any recruiting methods they deem fit, and the company bears no responsibilities for any misleading info they gave to us. I shall rest this case until another poor soul complains of a similar fate tt most of us in this forums suffered.<br><br>As for the employment issue tt I've raised, I'm not saying tt VE explicitly deploys such underhand tactics. I'm just listing out the possibilities tt a VE agent might run into. It's a fact tt being an MLM agent requires no contractual bond at all, so how do u prove to us tt if we work in VE, our positions are secured? Is there any policy to secure my position which I've missed out during my 2 hr 'interview' at VE? I mean, to convince ppl to join VE, esp. those who're kiasi abt job security, wadever details u're referring to muz be made public to assure them. It's nth confidential right?

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun remember doing any survey, so I guessed that maybe I was referred to by a 'friend'. So, if it's a 'friend', why doesn't he/she do the phonecall recruitment by himself/herself, rather than getting total strangers to call us up?<br><br>And I heard abt the surveys u guys conduct as well. I heard that it's dubious and misleading, asking street-goers very general matters, such as their views on business and if they need a job, and not going straight to the point, juz to get their contacts for recruitment.<br><br>But I seriously doubt either of these are totally true, since almost everyone duped to go to VE's offices here are called up by total strangers, and recalled doing no such survey.<br><br>But I did remember my agent telling me that someone from my JC works in VE and is enjoying a high position now, which leads me to the hypothesis that ur agents do extensive networking for contact information. I dun recognize her at all, and I believe at most, she'll be a third-degree friend, nowhere close to being even an acquaintance. While it's not any underhand means legally, I think it's pretty underhand ethically. Any truth to this?<br><br>And yes, I think u misunderstood me about employment issues. To quote an example, let's take myself for an example. After 2 hrs of drivel, my recruiter asked me to return to the office for my 1st training session. I was like "Huh, isn't that too fast? I thot there should be an interview? Wouldn't the boss want to noe if I'm capable or not? DUN I EVEN SIGN A BLARDY CONTRACT TO NOE TT I'M PROTECTED BY EMPLOYMENT LAWS?".<br><br>Then I realised it's a whole pyramid-like recruitment based scam, where it doesn't matter if I'm the shittiest salesman on Earth, as long as I can sell even 1 freaking mattress and leaves the company after that, my uplines would be $100+ richer and they'll look fer the nxt replacement.<br><br>Ok maybe the abovementioned statement could be a little sensitive. Anyway, moving on, I hope u get my point after reading my comments. I'm not saying VE would be such arsehole(s) to kick u out of the company after making use of u. I'm saying wad legal documentations would we have as security?</div>

And within 6 months or so, i quietly MIA and left VE eventually... Yea.. My point of view is that although they kept on emphasizing about "investing" more time over there, however, we MUST NOT forget that our STUDIES is still the more important, and don't because of VE that caused you to have no time for yourself. I have experienced it for myself and it's quite a painful one..<br><br>Okay... For me, at least I managed to gain a bit of experience and make friends with those who joined around the same batch as me (which most of them have left VE also liao...) over there..<br><br>I don't say that their products there are spam that kind of thing... No doubt their products are damn solid (but relatively expensive lar...) and effective, but we all as a student, we should know and focus more on our main priority right now, which is education.<br><br>Well, don't get too upset over it... What I can advice you is just BE NATURALLY YOURSELF (don't because of VE and makes you changed yourself completely). If you are the kind of person who like to work part-timer one, find a part-time job that you like and work while you are still studying... And whatever hobbies you have, go ahead and enjoy your hobbies. For me, I'm a poly student who likes buses as 1 of my hobby, I just go ahead with my hobby activities (take photos of buses, etc etc..) and my relatives/friends/teachers/parents would naturally have that impression back that I "siao" (means crazy in hokkien) buses a lot, and no longer have the impression that I'm still in VE and &amp;*%^&amp;%$%@#@.<br><br>If you still having any doubts or in worry of anything about VE or what, feel free to approach me (PM me...)<br><br>Cheers =)</div>
