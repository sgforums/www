              <p>Why do MLM like to claim that they are doing business and that they are the boss of their career?</p>
              <p>Isn't it funny that an MLM-er have no flexibility of a true boss?</p>
              <p>1. You can't control the price of the products</p>
              <p>2. You have to CONvince people to join you whereas a boss need people to convince them instead.</p>
              <p>3. You have to attend training from someone that profits from you.</p>
              <p>4. A boss profits his own money not from others 'bosses' and his 'profits' are not taken away to higher ranking 'bosses'.</p>
              <p>MLM-ers are not bosses, they are merely agents/distributors.</p>
              <p>Passive income? Let's say no one under you made a sale, then where is this 'passive' income coming from?</p>

              <p>Yes,passive income can be made,BUT definitely not when you have no one under you or if the agent scams you by saying "it's so simple:you just drink coffee,tell story,make money!!!",things are not so simple,passive income is gained your hard work has shown results.</p>

              <p>You have little idea of what exactly is passive income. In current times, many people change jobs over their lifetimes. The turnover rate of your 'downlines' will be so high that you will find that you will change from being a salesperson to being a trainer if you want to have that many downlines. In the end, you will find that the amount of time and work you need to put in is still a lot, so much so that it is still not passive income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Examples are stocks that you have spent some time analysing their past 20 years of financial data. And all you need to do is to relook at their financial report every year for 1 extra year of data. It builds upon your previous knowledge of them.</p>
              <p>Another example is to build information websites. Everytime you add information, it compounds into what was originally there. There's little need to start from zero for someone new, unless the server crashed and all data is lost. Then again, constant backup should be done (common sense) to minimize such losses.</p>
              <p>But in the case of MLM, when one of your 'downline' leaves, you need to start all over again with a new person. <strong>All your previous efforts will come to naught when someone under you leaves.</strong> This is not passive income. It's only passive income for the topmost (maybe it's still not for them), where he has already a team of salesman (like you) to train newcomers for him to sell his products. Basically, MLMers are not much different from insurance agents, and I would say, you will be better off as an insurance agent, because your passive income can come from people with term policies, in which you get recurring passive income for a policy sold whenever they pay to renew their policies again.</p>
              <p>The way to so called passive income is to acquire assets when you are young. MLM could earn you an amount, but it's how and what you do with the money, whether you acquire more assets or liabilities when young, that determines whether you could be financially free in the future.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Examples are stocks that you have spent some time analysing
              their past 20 years of financial data. And all you need to do is to
              relook at their financial report every year for 1 extra year of
              data. It builds upon your previous knowledge of them.</p>
              <p>Another example is to build information websites. Everytime you
              add information, it compounds into what was originally there.
              There's little need to start from zero for someone new, unless the
              server crashed and all data is lost. Then again, constant backup
              should be done (common sense) to minimize such losses.</p>
              <p>But in the case of MLM, when one of your 'downline' leaves, you
              need to start all over again with a new person. <strong>All your
              previous efforts will come to naught when someone under you
              leaves.</strong> This is not passive income. It's only passive
              income for the topmost (maybe it's still not for them), where he
              has already a team of salesman (like you) to train newcomers for
              him to sell his products. Basically, MLMers are not much different
              from insurance agents, and I would say, you will be better off as
              an insurance agent, because your passive income can come from
              people with term policies, in which you get recurring passive
              income for a policy sold whenever they pay to renew their policies
              again.</p>
              <p>The way to so called passive income is to acquire assets when
              you are young. MLM could earn you an amount, but it's how and what
              you do with the money, whether you acquire more assets or
              liabilities when young, that determines whether you could be
              financially free in the future.</p>

              <p>You are simply stating all the negative points, when my downlines stay then isn't there passive income generated, just because you don't like mlm doesn't mean you have to say I don't know stuff, you only point out things that will happen negatively from my comment and now you say I don't know what is passive income.</p>
              <p>Look at what I commented again:Yes,passive income can be made,BUT definitely not when you have
                                      no one under you or if the agent scams you by saying "it's so
                                      simple:you just drink coffee,tell story,make money!!!",things are
                                      not so simple,passive income is gained your hard work has shown
                                      results.</p>
              <p>Actually your comments are biased judgements as I believe you have never been in mlm before and you are commenting and bad-mouthing the industry just because you heard stories but is that fair to us mlmers. Go ask the people who told you that mlm is a scam or whatever, ask them why did they fail, how come things did not work out, did they follow the system, ask if they were afraid to even talk to anyone about the opportunity or products, ask everything about why it didn't work out then you understand better.</p>

              <p>You still do not understand what is really meant by passive income. Passive income is really acheived when you can just drink coffee, tell story, and with minimal efforts you still make money. Just as you have stated it yourself, you need hard work. But this hard work is still required year after year after year; thus it is not passive income. It's work all over again when your downline leaves. I don't believe you will be able to get downlines who will stay under you and work till the day you die.</p>
              <p>Passive income is to be built upon through hard work, yes. But not through your downlines; that is not called passive income. Don't get confused.</p>

              <p>Nah, it's you who don't get the difference between active income and passive income. It doesn't show any better on you when you made this post without anything to substantiate yourself. It only shows that you can't refute any points I have made because they are the truth. And the truth hurts.</p>
              <p>Looking at what you have said, I believe you would also tell me most bosses are earning passive income. You are saying that as long as you have people working under you, that's passive income. That's clearly not true.</p>

              <p>I guess it still isn't clear to them.</p>
              <p>If the passive income was so great, people wouldn't change (this topic has already been year for &gt; 2 years). They would instead be more and more active because they would have more time to spend. There are only 2 reasons I can think of at the moment why the original batch disappeared.<br>1) They are disllusioned.<br>2) They must be working very hard at MLM, so hard that they do not have the time to post here anymore ==&gt; clearly passive income building didn't succeed.</p>
              <p>Why is it that most youngsters nowadays like to think that they are definitely smarter than most people just because they have attended some course/training or read some books?</p>
