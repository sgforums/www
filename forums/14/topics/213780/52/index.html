              <p>Hello all , i'm really shocked to read all this negative truth from victims of venture era . Cause a few hours ago , i was intro-ed into this job. The person who intro me this job claim that he's working in this co. for about a month since .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And he say it's very easy to earn money ? Just help the managers to demo products and i can get to earn about 160 - 450 SGD ?</p>
              <p>I at first was very fasinated but also full of doubts .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And this guy weren't close to me at all , he was one of my friend's friend . Thus , i find him really very suspicious and i went into google to check out this forum as a miny research before meeting him at eunos mrt as he offered to bring us to VentureEra Co .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm really glad that i've read this before i go into this company .<br>Thanks all , withlove ;)</p>

              <p>Hi, after reading some of the posts here about Venture Era, I feel obligated to share my experience which took place just yesterday only. The reason why I am researching up on this company is that there were many strange incidences which I am going to elaborate on.</p>
              <p>1) From this ad in classifieds, I called the company. They were very vague when I asked questions such as the job scope and the pay.</p>
              <p>2) I went for the orientation. Met up with A who was 18. She gave me a form to fill up which required your family's particulars. I wrote down one family member only. The manager,B, (can't rmb her position, nonetheless a higher-up) came and looked through my form. B said, "Oh, so your ___ works at ___". This is strange because of her tone. She sounded very interested.</p>
              <p>3) Was given tour by A. Then went for the presentation. </p>
              <p>The host(they call it HOST, but i think it's more like emcee): She was dressed professionally. However, her linguistic ability, at least for English, did not seem good to me because she made stark grammatical errors. Personally, I feel that if one cannot communicate well and accurately, one is lacking in professionalism. What more in sales where communication is important is selling?</p>
              <p>1st presenter:</p>
              <p>They said he was 21 but he didn't look 21. Then he explained it by saying he got this 'chao lao' syndrome. Now thinking back, maybe he was lying about his age. ??? Generally, I had a good impression of him. He could communicate using proper and accurate English and was doing a good job introducing the products.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd presenter:</p>
              <p>A lady, who in my opinion, is not well-versed in the English language since she made stark grammatical errors too. Her job was to explain to us the payment system. She shared with us her own story of how she was a quiet girl blah blah. After finishing her A levels four years ago, she joined this company. This made me think, did she flunk her A levels so that is why she did not further her education. She kept repeating,"You all don't think that this quiet, shy girl like me can make it big right. But now I am already at __(this position cant rmb the name, the car one) where the company is contributing towards my car.</p>
              <p>*Note</p>
              <p>Anyone with prior experience would know that they would introduce their many positions. I think there are about 7 to 8 with long names. Then they introduce some point system which they use to calculate for different things. In short, my point is that their tactic is such as to give you a lot of information as they know you cannot possibly retain everything they have said. Though she was clear in her explanation, but I felt their ultimate aim is to confuse us.</p>
              <p>After the talk, A asked me if I had any questions. I asked, "So long have you joined VE?"</p>
              <p>"3 months"</p>
              <p>I asked, "So how much have you earned so far?"</p>
              <p>"$2400 which is 6 deals"</p>
              <p>I asked, "How did you get these deals?"</p>
              <p>"From friends and referrals:</p>
              <p>I: "referrals?"</p>
              <p>"Ya, like basically my friends and relatives introduced them to me"</p>
              <p>*Note</p>
              <p>I was thinking, "Then isn't it just selling to my social circle only?"</p>
              <p>Then waited for B to come and talk to us. She began her persuasive talk. I do not think there's the need to go into details here.</p>
              <p>FIRST VERY ODD INCIDENCE</p>
              <p>B said, " So after you go back today, try not to overshare(what a word) with your family and friends because see, what you retain today is not 100% right, maybe retain only 80%. Later when you tell them they only retain maybe 40%? not even past the passing mark (trying to be funny. HA HA)" I patronised her by giving a grimace smile." Everyone, don't you find it weird that B had made such a statement? Which reputable company would say that?</p>
              <p>SECOND VERY ODD INCIDENCE</p>
              <p>About ten pm in the night, A called me and asked, "So everything's alright? With your parents?"</p>
              <p>I: "I didn't tell them"</p>
              <p>A: "Oh okay, so you are coming for the training right?"</p>
              <p>I:"Yeah"</p>
              <p>Well, after her call, it reinforced my thought to research about VE online and this is what I found. Coincidentally, i asked around on msn and my friend told me that he and another friend went for VE too. He did not elaborate much but his last line was,</p>
              <p>"trust me, dont join"</p>
              <p>Yep, so just sharing my experience here and thanks to all those who shared their experiences. I am so glad that I decided to research on the company and this spared me from wasting my time by going for the training.</p>
              <p>What I have learnt is that next time, check out the company first. A convenient way would be the internet. Any registered company would surely have a homepage.</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading thus far, if you have.</p>
