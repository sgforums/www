Thus its not really passive income if you would really want to scrutinise .<br>Any way can <a href="../../../users/246796">Ageleon</a> post the entire compensation plan here? so we could calculate the maximum ammount of money each upline could get from his downlines?<span style="font-family: georgia;"><span style="font-size: 180%;"><span style="color: red;"><em><strong></strong></em></span></span></span></p>

              <p>I was once in VE and i have to say that their income and promotion plans are quite solid. At the start you get $400 for every sale of their water purification system, magnetic matress or their air purifier and as you promote your profit raises by $100 until you reach a max of $800 per sale. Every upline also gets $100 for a sale made by the downline.They do not cheat their employees of their money and u can make a decent earning. The reason i quit was because their products were overpriced and they couldn't give a good explanation for why this was so.</p>
              <p>The first product, the water purification system is about $2000 by a brand known as cal ion water. They say that alot of research has gone into the product and that it is used in korea but you can't find anything about it on the internet and the ppl at VE told me that all the websites are in korean</p>
              <p>The second product, the magnetic matress is sold for abt $2000 for queen and $3000 king. The matress is manufactured by VE in the US. If u searched for magnetic matresses on the internet you will find that all of them are priced between 300 to 500 US dollars. The excuse they give for this is that the mattresses made by other companies are lousy quality even though these companies sell their products to a global market and their products are reviewed by websites like amazon.com</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can find the same ecoquest fresh air purifier that is sold by VE for abt $3000 selling on the internet for 800 US dollars. According to them, they spend money converting the voltage of the product, which u can bypass by buying a $30 step down adapter. They also told me that shipping costs are included and since only ppl at VE are trainned on repairing the product ppl have to pay extra for service.</p>
              <p>So, this is how VE makes money. They get teengers to sell their products to their parents and relatives who will buy them overpriced to "support their business". It is not illegal but i feel like its exploiting teens to rip off their relatives.</p>

              <p>Well after much reading and all, i realised that it's rather pointless for me, at least, to venture in to venture era. ;D</p>
              <p>I mean, yea , like people have said, i was actually in this group for a little less then a week, before i got a little weeny suspicious and went to reseach about it . They use what i would say more of a " cheat tatic " rather then really selling it , and as said, there are cheaper ones available of the same products they have.</p>
              <p>It's rather weird, the whole thing, and i'm glad to say , since i'm waiting for results, that i managed to find a part time job at starhub with a decent temp pay. =)</p>
              <p>Though i can't say for certain that this Group is all bad, but somehow, it doesn't appeal to me as i thought it first would. Even so, i was lured by the fact that they said there would be a FIXED salary doing admin stuff, i got totally " tricked " in a way to come down and look at thier products instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So yea, O level results are due on the 12th. OMG</p>

              <p>If VE is really that good,why should I join VE instead of going for a PROPER,more RECOGNIZED degree in university? Furthermore, what people are doing at VE is that they are SELLING a product and not doing a BUSINESS.What kind of business do you think you will learn? Basic law of economics? Mind you, many universities across the globe include that under business course because you can't run a business without knowing it.</p>
              <p> If VE products are really THAT good, why can't I find a VE store anywhere in Singapore? Just like Rolex has its own store in Orchard?</p>
              <p>And, what is the science behind all the products? There seems to be no mention of it on the VE website. I was once approached by one of the VE sales to sell me some kind of purifier. And guess what he said?</p>
              <p>quote~"It makes  water molecules smaller so that they can be absorbed easily by the body."</p>
              <p>How on earth do you shrink a water molucule?!?! Remove electrons? Then destabilise it where it breaks into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions? Any O level chemistry student would know that  you CANNOT SHRINK a water molecule!</p>
              <p>If someone from VE can give me a  reasonable answer to my questions, I'll definitely join VE.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>i wan to clarify thing propertly. I am a student from nan yang
              poly and i not working and i feel that i need to say something out
              in my mind…</p>
              <p>Firstly, i read book regrading mlm and pyramid… mlm and pyramid
              is totally different… mlm is you work without investing any money
              but pyramid is that you need to invest money so you will earn
              money… but then mlm is legal but pyramid is illegal… and also if
              mlm is a scam why do singapore government let them set out… u see
              if u say that government don’t care why does police wan to
              investigate sunshine empire… and everyone know that actually
              working at sunshine need to pay money dun u think is pyramid le ma…
              so u can see that why pyramid we cal illegal…</p>
              <p>secondly, ppl say that ve is a scam why police dun wan
              investigate lei… this mean that actually ve is not a scam at
              all…</p>
              <p>thirdly, not everyone can be a tuition teacher who can earn 3k
              to 4k… my uncle is a tution teacher who is earning 4k a month but
              do u know why he can earn that much coze he is a degree holder… u
              see if u are a <span>GCE O LVL</span> grad and u wan be a
              tuition teacher yes u can but if u think other way if u are a
              parent and ur child is taking o lvl would u rather find a degree
              holder or a gce o lvl holder… u would confirm find a degree holder…
              so u think tat everyone can earn 3k to 4k being a tuition teacher…
              so the rest who is only o lvl grad dun need earn 3k to 4k lo… yes i
              know that mlm can earn 3k more…<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> this is where a chance to let those
              who cant really be a tuition teacher etc to succeed over there… and
              not everyone so lucky as other who can study poly… there is ppl out
              there who score high mark for o lvl but yet cant enter poly coze of
              moeny… so if so u think tat they really wan it ma… no they oso dun
              wan tat why they mlm can let them succeed…</strong></span></p>
              <p>fourtly, i am using ve products… lyk magnetic braclet… do u know
              tat eventually their braclet is cheaper than owell itself… why i
              use their product is coze when i read a book they say that actually
              magnetic can help to improve blood circulation… and i at first
              wanna buy owell but it is so expensive that i nv buy at all… and i
              when to check other brands which oso selling and i came arcoss that
              ve oso selling it and their price is cheaper and eventually i buy
              it by goin down to that company alone without anyone accompany… and
              after that i oso brrought their pearl ion lotion it really improve
              my skin and i oso ask my dad to try using the magnetic bed itself
              eventually it helps him to lower his high blood pressure… and btw
              the price is much more cheaper than some other brands itself… that
              why i feel that ve product is good…</p>
              <p>ur will be asking why i helping mlm saying good things and why i
              didn’t join them it is very simple… firstly i studying for last
              year poly and den no time to commit at all… secondly i goin oversea
              next year and be staying there for years and no point to work half
              way… but if i got chance i would oso lyk to work there… the product
              is a good product which i had confidence in it… and lastly no
              matter i go oversea i still will contiune buyin their products…</p>
              <p>guys everyone got their passion… everyone would lyk to earn
              money… so pls dun say other company is a scam or not good etc… b4 u
              say others think abt urself… we should say those who try mlm is a
              encourage person coze they willing to try… and the rest who will
              only say work mlm will earn more money is a dreamer… but u ask
              urself would u there to try out… what if one day one of ur friend
              one is mlm and he/she earn 6k per month… dun tell mi u will nt work
              over there… if u work over there den i oso can say u are dreaming…
              guys pls help other to think… dun be selfish… dun see one side… but
              pls see both side…</p>

              <p>Actually in singapore, if you are of low income family and if your O lvls results are good, there are many organisations that pay for your remaining tuition fees. Furthermore, there are loans provided too. It's just a matter if the persons are informed about available schemes or not.</p>

                                      electrons? Then destabilise it where it breaks into hydrogen ions
                                      and hydroxide ions? Any O level chemistry student would know
                                      that  you CANNOT SHRINK a water molecule!</p>
              <p>If someone from VE can give me a  reasonable
                                      answer to my questions, I'll definitely join VE.<img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well... it doesn't breaks down the molecule structure. It breaks down the molecule structure CLUSTER .</p>
              <p>H2O definately cannot be seperated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so .. example..</p>
              <p>Tap water molecule structure cluster is 12-13 H2O</p>
              <p>The products breaks it to 3-4 H2O</p>

              <p>My mum wasn't very happy when I joined Venture Era and she told me to quit immediately. I told my 'manager' in VE and he told me to continue doing the job.. but secretly, keeping from my mum.</p>
