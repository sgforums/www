They're forgetting who gives them bread on their table everyday. That's the consumers, or rather in the case of MLM, blind supportive friends and family. They're so quick to boast about their new car or salary rise, but seldom give thanks to all the attributing factors to their success.<br><br>And I'm kinda bored. Where are those VE peeps? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thought u guys love ur company so much, tt u guys must defend it till the death. Can u guys pls answer my questions straight to the point? Or u guys dun even dare to do so? Zzz... </span><br><br>As far as I know, the recent testimony of a phonecall scam seem to be a month ago (in the case of X999). Which I believe should be still continuing. I really hope someone with law background can bring the shady dealings of this darn company to light.</div></blockquote>I get the part that you must be friendly to customer. Standard in all sales, though sometimes is fake friendliness. Is to make customer feel better and to establish relationship.<br><br>That's what I'm wondering too.<br><br>Defending company to the death. Rarely see such drastic reactions. Company insulted machiam his whole family kena insult like that, must fire back. Worst, register JUST to promote or defend the MLM corp then vanish forever. Not just VE, but other mlms as well. Or promoting your company like a religion. Recruiting, can be thru better means like headhunting, or advertising, etc. Not by pulling people on the pretext of something else, hiding the truth about the nature of biz (knowing many ppl don't like MLMs) until the last minute.<br><br>'Marketing'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In sales, or any biz, first and foremost should be ETHICS and integrity. NO misleading anyone, sales, recuritment, the public or anyone at all. NO lying. NO exaggerated claims. Give concrete claims. NO half lies. Don't say it's not counted as this because of that. Sorry to say but I notice some MLM companies are very fond of boasting. About being able to afford rent at Shenton Way (makes me laugh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). About having car and 10K income at age 20s. A car is expensive to maintain. You have to continously pay rent to stay in the building. Not everyone can have 10K earnings. And they should jolly well know this, but refuse to acknowledge the truth. Let's say I buy lottery once and strike $1000. Then I see people strike $15M loto, should I become a professional lottery buyer?<br><br>Claims of early retirement, financial freedom, all the crap. WTF?<br>Ok answer me this. I'M A GOONDU, YOU AGENTS ARE THE PROFESSORS.<br>Should you have low sales income, where the financial freedom? Since pay is by commission, no basic pay. A job with monthly pay gives you a higher chance of having financial security. Companies can collapse, boss can fire you. BUT, isn't MLM a company too? There's no iron rice bowl... so MLM is.... diamond rice bowl ah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Unless you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that more than 70% of agents have monthly earnings of at least 3K, I'll believe in MLM biz.<br><br>I say once, I say again. I've seen people quit school saying "why study when MLM can give me a 10K monthly income, more than uni grad" for full time MLM. Then what happens? He makes less than $100 a month and sadly has only PSLE / O level cert. Yes you can make 10K. BUT what's the percentage of people who make it to that level? Give me a statistical report please. Why hide your earnings when it's so good? Nothing to be ashamed of right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Even ministers declare their pay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, do you think that VE sales can florish continuously for the next 10 years? now in singapore i can say that perharps 40% of the people had heard about VE. and it has a bad reputation for lying to jobseekers, begging your relatives &amp; friends to buy the products, putting up a fake-friendly face to everyone, and known for brainwashing. can it still be expanding with its bad reputation? you can say it is still in its pioneer stage and there's still room for expanding. and you compare with other MLM company like amway and others? do you think that you can be like them? whatever you wan to PROMOTE to the others, the people had already been attended by the other MLM people. do you think they still give a fuc* about you? so what if you shared with them about VE? do you think your relatives will also give a fuc* to help you to do reference? fat hope! they would probably tell you parents to advice you to stop!<br><br>those financial freedom, cars, $15k income are just tactics to tempt the ignorant youngster of our community.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the VE peeps are afraid, now that we ask for direct no-bullsh!t answers haha. That Alessandro guy who's triple posting at one shot isn't seen ANYWHERE on these forums now. Come back leh, I would love to hear about ur latest analogies besides OTO/Osim. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>We aren't unreasonable peeps. We just demand straightforward answers. As long as u VE peeps resolve these issues, we'll let the matter rest.<br><br>1) Explain the financial freedom u guys experience in VE in full detail. And we dun want stupid empty boasting abt ur 10k fig salaries and BMWs anymore.<br><br>If u have to mention them, give accurate time chronology of when u attain those rewards eg. I slogged 2 yrs before I got my first car allowance etc, and give honest testimonies of difficulties u faced in reaching ur goal.<br><br>I dun believe those dumb MLM agents who speak abt BMWs and 10k fig salaries like it's nothing. Owning a BMW takes hard work, EVEN in MLM. If MLM's really that good, everyone would have joined long ago. What deters them?<br><br>And I would also love an accurate statistical report of the percentages of the success stories in VE, as well as dropout and failure rate. We have to give potential recruits both sides of the story for them to believe u. If u juz harp on the benefits and hide the ugly side under the rug, u guys'll have a tough time convincing peeps to join.<br><br>2) Give us a few good reasons why the products are priced at such a high rate, that it nets VE agents at least 50-60% profits of the sales.<br><br>U guys always say in ur presentations that without the middle party involved (retail distributor), it enables u guys to sell the products at a lower rate than commercial counterpart products.<br><br>But I can say the price has almost no difference between VE products and commercial products. So why should we trust a product that isn't popular, advertised, fully certified and proven effective?<br><br>The more impt issue at hand is, why should we let u guys pocket that much, when u guys dun spend much effort in R&amp;D and advertisement, and all u guys have to do is spit floods of saliva on ur vulnerable preys?<br><br>3) Give us MANY good reasons why VE recruiters mislead jobseekers thru their infamous phonecall recruitment (which until now, I dunno how they got my number. I bet many ppl are wondering too, such as X999).<br><br>Why do u guys hide the MLM nature of ur company and mention bullcrap like 'budding company wif capable managers seeking capable assistants and entrepreneurs'?<br><br>Why do u guys mention that we're interviewing for an admin/call centre job, when it's sales-based, at least for the 1st month or 2 as a trainee recruit?<br><br>Why didn't u guys mention that the job has no basic pay and completely based on commission?<br><br>I think I've summarised all the queries that most of us have here. Pls feel free to add on, if u guys feel that I missed out on anything. And I'm eagerly waiting for the next VE reply. Hopefully it's something intelligible, not some psycho-ed 16-17 yr old O Lvl dropout's rant and glorification of his beloved MLM company. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello all,<br>Im thinking its my first post and I'd just like to give a honest reply to<br>MightyFlameboy as requested.<br>Please if you need anymore clarifications just continue asking.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MightyFlameboy:</div><div class="quote_body">1) Explain the financial freedom u guys experience in VE in full detail. And we dun want stupid empty boasting abt ur 10k fig salaries and BMWs anymore.<br><br>If u have to mention them, give accurate time chronology of when u attain those rewards eg. I slogged 2 yrs before I got my first car allowance etc, and give honest testimonies of difficulties u faced in reaching ur goal.<br><br>I dun believe those dumb MLM agents who speak abt BMWs and 10k fig salaries like it's nothing. Owning a BMW takes hard work, EVEN in MLM. If MLM's really that good, everyone would have joined long ago. What deters them?<br></div></blockquote>When any agent from VE mentions financial freedom, it's meant to be the end product of your hard work in VE. Upon reaching certain stages in the company, you'd see financial flow without you making that effort. That is somewhat meant as financial freedom. I'd actually refrain from saying such things though because Yes it is possible to reach there, but putting in more effort no matter what position you are in in any MLM company would only garner you more results in terms of your pay cheque at the end of the month.<br><br>In terms of time chronology, I'd say it depends on individuals. The system to reach such rewards are stated black and white. E.g Going up the ranks in the company before you reach such stages where you can own a continental car.<br>There are examples of those who took as long as 2 years and someone in the company has done it in 7 months since he first joint. I'd say in terms of difficulties, it also differs between the agents. Mayb you'd like to highlight in details what kind of difficulties you want me to share about? I'd be glad to get the details for you.<br><br>What deters and force people to quit MLM companies like VE is only themselves. But please dont be offended but hear me out. MLM as a whole frankly doesnt look like a clean industry in Singapore. In VE itself, agents find such difficulties to answer about the industry.<br>Why people are detered,<br>50% because of the industry - MLM is a growing industry in Singapore. It is just legalised in 2000. But any pyramid scam is illegal.<br>Pyramid - Where you stand in the company when you join is where your goin to be at the end of the day as well. Minimal or no chance for you to go up the ladder.<br><br>And of course there are other MLM companies out there who works on scams and are only out to cheat money. That itself is compromising the image of MLM.<br><br>But take this<br>e.g Before insurance were who they are today,  there are other insurace companies when govt legallised it are only out to cheat money as well.<br><br>The other 50% is only the agents themselves.<br>Reasons being:<br>- Not getting the support from the people around you.<br>- It is hard to do when people are detered by MLM in the 1st place.<br>- Etc..<br><br>But why others succeed is only because they have decided, this is what they want to do as a career/business. So no matter what's the odds, they will only continue to persevere in the industry.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong><br>And I would also love an accurate statistical report of the percentages of the success stories in VE, as well as dropout and failure rate. We have to give potential recruits both sides of the story for them to believe u. If u juz harp on the benefits and hide the ugly side under the rug, u guys'll have a tough time convincing peeps to join.<br></strong>[/quote]<br><br>Its hard to give such statistics. One reason mainly because no individual need to answer directly to the company if they choose to dropout. The current system allows individuals to leave and come back a year later if they choose to and still retain the positions they once held.<br>The ugly side as you mentioned can only mean that the agents who find it tough to do one way or another chooses to quit the battle.<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]<br>2) Give us a few good reasons why the products are priced at such a high rate, that it nets VE agents at least 50-60% profits of the sales.<br><br>U guys always say in ur presentations that without the middle party involved (retail distributor), it enables u guys to sell the products at a lower rate than commercial counterpart products.<br><br>But I can say the price has almost no difference between VE products and commercial products. So why should we trust a product that isn't popular, advertised, fully certified and proven effective?<br></div></blockquote>Profit margin remains at 40% going back to the sales force in VE. It might be different in other MLM companies.<br><br>Maybe you had a slight misunderstanding. The prices are kept at retail prices to give as much profit as possible back to the company. Afterall, VE is still running a business. Fact is, MLM companies get such products at a much lower price than normal retail distributors. Selling it at the same price as the retail market will only garner more profits to the company.<br><br>However, given the factual knwoledge 40% returns to us, an agent can choose to even increase the price or lower the price when he is doing his sales. This is not uncommon among business tradings itself.<br><br>And the 40% returns is not directly propotional to the price of the product. It is measured by a different system in VE called PV.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong><br><br>The more impt issue at hand is, why should we let u guys pocket that much, when u guys dun spend much effort in R&amp;D and advertisement, and all u guys have to do is spit floods of saliva on ur vulnerable preys?<br><br>3) Give us MANY good reasons why VE recruiters mislead jobseekers thru their infamous phonecall recruitment (which until now, I dunno how they got my number. I bet many ppl are wondering too, such as X999).<br></strong>[/quotes]<br><br>Like mentioned above, VE is also running a business. Products sold have alredy gone through R&amp;D from other sources.<br>E.g The magnetic therapy have already gone through extensive research and books have also been published about the capabilities of it. In the book itself you can find out the kind research that this products have gone through.<br><br>I'd recommend 'Magnetic Therapy' book which can be found in Jurong East Library. If you choose to go more in depth, there are other books available that even mentions why there is the scepticism among doctors.<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]<br>Why do u guys hide the MLM nature of ur company and mention bullcrap like 'budding company wif capable managers seeking capable assistants and entrepreneurs'?<br><br>Why do u guys mention that we're interviewing for an admin/call centre job, when it's sales-based, at least for the 1st month or 2 as a trainee recruit?<br><br>Why didn't u guys mention that the job has no basic pay and completely based on commission?<br></div></blockquote>.<br>All this 'bullcrap' are only giving you reasons to come down and look at Venture Era for yourself. VE as a company have always shown its transparency in the system.<br>But like many other VE agents who have tried to come up and said it in the forum. Not all agents shows the transparency of it.<br><br>I personally would not disguise about the job scope. But, I wouldnt mention it unless questioned also. All in all its still about doing a job/running a business, where work ethics amongs people differ.<br><br>If not for a product, humans have always been selling themselves or the company they work in. Its amongs the roots of doing business. The tactics used sometimes though might offend some. Be it in MLM companies or not.<br><br>E.g You can be suprised how much chepaer you can get the car for compared the price tag mentioned by the dealers.<br><br>VE is only out to make it big in the MLM industry. One aim would be to be as big as Amway. But to be as big as them, VE do require leaders to help the company grow.<br><br>Look at it this way, go through shit with the company now and enjoy the rewards later. Amway pioneers are earning six figures just staying home. That's financial freedom. But is anybody complaining about the company Amway now? Wives likes to buy Amway products every month.<br><br>I hope this clarifies some doubts. Feel free to continue asking. I'd be happy to answer if I am capable.</div>

I guess that's all down the drain now. And pls dun make generalising statements like 'we hate networking so we dun have much frenz'. I seriously dun see the link between hating networking and not having frenz. It's like saying that I prefer Western food over Chinese food, therefore I'm a Westerner instead of a Singaporean.<br><br>And if u think ur frenz in MLM are really that trustworthy and well-bonded, why not try leaving the company for a month or 2? After the initial persuasion, I think they'll give up on u and find new recruits to replace u. My MLM fren pestered me DAY AND NIGHT to meet up wif him for a so-called harmless catch-up gathering cum lunch. Once I rejected his offers for me to join his company, he NEVER contact me EVERSINCE.<br><br>How's that for a fren? I'd get a close knit of frenz tt really cares, than a multitude of business trash-talking wannabes who come and go. Enjoy their so-called companionship while u can, cos' either they'll forget u 3-4 yrs down the road when u quit, or vice versa, they quit and dun wanna haf anything to do wif MLM ever again, which includes urself.<br><br>Back to the main issue at hand, addressed to shaas_no1, I shan't be lengthy and address all ur pts, and I shall tackle the most concerning issue IMO, which is the phonecall recruitment. Similarly to enquiries, u told me that u personally wun hide the nature of ur company. Yet mths after he made tt statement and promised to educate his agents, I still see MANY cases of ppl getting scammed the same way I was.<br><br>And comparing the details of the scams wif my own experience, it seems tt the agents are manipulated to say certain things. So, are we to blame the individual agent for their immaturity? Or is sth shady going on behind the training tt the agents receive frm the company? I've always believed in transparency and honesty in any given business, including MLM. The fact tt my job recruiter lied to me abt certain things already put me off. Even if I'm impressed with ur business plans and products, I'd be sure I'd not join cos' right from Day 0, thru the agent tt called me, it already reflects the level of honesty tt VE has.<br><br>And addressing 72312, there's no work in the entire world that isn't miserable at times. Even in MLM, isn't it miserable if ur sales or recruitment is stagnant for some time? And I agree wif redstone tt wif a stable assured base income, life is more secure, than having to source for recruits day and night, or desperately pitching sales.<br><br>And another bigger prb in local MLM is tt employees and the employers are not tied to contractual bonds. Even if ur employer exploits u, cuts the profit share tt u haf and swallow everything, u haf no case against them, cos' simply, u're not RECOGNISED by manpower laws tt u're under this company. Ur employer can act blur and pretend not to know u, and u're in deep sh!t. Or if he feels tt u're too capable and a big threat to his position, he can simply ask u to get out for good, and u would oso haf no case against him. So much for financial freedom, and job flexibility, when u dun even know whether u're still considered part of the company the next morning. Perhaps shaas_no1 would like to touch a little on this issue?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by MightyFlameboy:<br><strong><br><br>I used to respect u a little cos' u were the only calm and collected VE MLMer in the past. I guess that's all down the drain now. And pls dun make generalising statements like 'we hate networking so we dun have much frenz'. I seriously dun see the link between hating networking and not having frenz. It's like saying that I prefer Western food over Chinese food, therefore I'm a Westerner instead of a Singaporean.<br><br><span style="color: red;">[b]And if u think ur frenz in MLM are really that trustworthy and well-bonded, why not try leaving the company for a month or 2? After the initial persuasion, I think they'll give up on u and find new recruits to replace u. My MLM fren pestered me DAY AND NIGHT to meet up wif him for a so-called harmless catch-up gathering cum lunch. Once I rejected his offers for me to join his company, he NEVER contact me EVERSINCE. </span></strong><br><br>How's that for a fren? I'd get a close knit of frenz tt really cares, than a multitude of business trash-talking wannabes who come and go. Enjoy their so-called companionship while u can, cos' either they'll forget u 3-4 yrs down the road when u quit, or vice versa, they quit and dun wanna haf anything to do wif MLM ever again, which includes urself.<br><br>Back to the main issue at hand, addressed to shaas_no1, I shan't be lengthy and address all ur pts, and I shall tackle the most concerning issue IMO, which is the phonecall recruitment. Similarly to enquiries, u told me that u personally wun hide the nature of ur company. Yet mths after he made tt statement and promised to educate his agents, I still see MANY cases of ppl getting scammed the same way I was.<br><br>And comparing the details of the scams wif my own experience, it seems tt the agents are manipulated to say certain things. So, are we to blame the individual agent for their immaturity? Or is sth shady going on behind the training tt the agents receive frm the company? I've always believed in transparency and honesty in any given business, including MLM. The fact tt my job recruiter lied to me abt certain things already put me off. Even if I'm impressed with ur business plans and products, I'd be sure I'd not join cos' right from Day 0, thru the agent tt called me, it already reflects the level of honesty tt VE has.<br><br>And addressing 72312, there's no work in the entire world that isn't miserable at times. Even in MLM, isn't it miserable if ur sales or recruitment is stagnant for some time? And I agree wif redstone tt wif a stable assured base income, life is more secure, than having to source for recruits day and night, or desperately pitching sales.<br><br>And another bigger prb in local MLM is tt employees and the employers are not tied to contractual bonds. Even if ur employer exploits u, cuts the profit share tt u haf and swallow everything, u haf no case against them, cos' simply, u're not RECOGNISED by manpower laws tt u're under this company. Ur employer can act blur and pretend not to know u, and u're in deep sh!t. Or if he feels tt u're too capable and a big threat to his position, he can simply ask u to get out for good, and u would oso haf no case against him. So much for financial freedom, and job flexibility, when u dun even know whether u're still considered part of the company the next morning. Perhaps shaas_no1 would like to touch a little on this issue?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>x2. not-close-fren sudden's contact. lies to me. loser 1</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mr enquiries:<br><br>I like to enquire about certain things. Why, as MightyFlameBoy and many people had said, do agents put up a false facade, give excuses and tell half lies, half truths or manipulating the facts just to pull people into the company? Brainwashing? You call this recuritment marketing, but its questionable. The level of transparency and the tatics are questionable<br><br>Transparency? About as transparent as a brick wall I'll be banging your head onto. Since you're the 'official mlm representative' here, please answer me this.<br><br>And. Defending the company to the death? Register just to defend the mlm and vanish? Marketing and public relations dept?<br><br>Telling people you CAN make 10K a month income and FINANCIAL FREEDOM? Without even a measly basic pay? Freedom when you reach the higher ranks. That to me is making use of people, akin to slavery. You are new recruit, you work hard, you by hook or CROOK hit sales target and get promoted, your downlines grab more downlines, pushing you up. There you shake leg. If not for low rank agents like you slogging away desperately trying to sell via sometimes unethical means (lying, deliberate misinterpretation, giving excuses, etc), they would not be up there, there would not have their 'freedom'. Try this. Gather all your 'friends' and go on strike for a week. Or say a month. See what happens.<br><br>Declare all your agent's individual income.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, its a frustrating thing to see MLMers claiming to 'learn business' and yet become totally unprofessional in their conduct.<br><br>I think most consumers or prospects want some answers, and if possible, responses that specifically answer those questions. What is so hard, if a company or its members claim to be good, or have potential?<br><br>I seriously dont understand why they can claim Singaporeans easily give up when its claimed that people dont do well in MLM, when they dont even attempt to answer people's questions.<br><br>While your ordinary company out there is scrambling to shore up any flaw in its customer service, its mind boggling to see MLM industry generally dont really care about it<br><br></div>
