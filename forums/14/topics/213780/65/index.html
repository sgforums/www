              <p>Being a MLMer in VE is not a rewarding business; it's not even

              <p>Time is money indeed. If you want to argue it that way, then I have nothing to say.</p>
              <p>What I mean is that by spending 2 weeks or even 1 month to find out the truth might bring you unexpected surprise, there is really nothing much to lose. If this time really translate into so much money to you that you're not willing to give it a shot, then I really can't say anything.</p>
              <p>As to what eagle has said, personally I feel that being a MLM in VE may or may not be a rewarding business depending on the individuals. It's not appropriate to stereotype everyone into the same category. There are definitely successful people as well as people who cannot make it.</p>
              <p>Indeed this business ultimately does not belong to them which I completely agree. It is not their own business in a sense that they do not own the company. But it is their own business in a sense that they are in control of how much they earn, unrestricted by any uplines. More effort will bring in more money as compared to those that put in little effort.</p>
              <p>As for the passive income, all businessmen earn passive income. Perhaps this is one parallel that we can draw as to why VE claims that they are doing their own business. Definitely it is not suitable for everyone. There are people who prefer earning a stable income under a stable company. I mean it's their own preference, nothing is right or wrong. In the end, this is still an appropriate job and they are making an honest living.</p>
              <p>And to add on, I personally feel that being an agent in a MLM company is better than holding a job with fixed salary in a way that one is less vulnerable to financial crisis in terms of retrenchment. One definitely earns lesser in a financial crisis, but at least he will not lose his job though he might earn less, while still able to find other jobs at the same time.</p>
              <p>My views are definitely neutral. I am not a pro MLM or neither am I against MLM. What I mean is that MLM is not meant for everyone, but it doesn't mean that we should all condemn MLM and close our doors on them. If you get what I mean, then you'll feel that I'm definitely neutral.</p>

              <p>I would be more convinced if you could name me a couple of businesses which the owners do not earn passive income. Thank you. Isn't owning a business a job as well?

Earning zero income is less likely in an MLM job even when there's a financial crisis, unless you're selling unmarketable products which Venture Era isn't. Whereas when one is retrenched, he is definitely earning zero income. As you have said, the company doesn't make a loss by employing one more person who gets no basic pay. In terms of pay, yes it is unstable, but you have a stable job.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In a financial crisis</span></strong></p>
              <p>Given good skills, when one is retrenched, one can still easily find a job in less than a month, and that's after receiving retrenchment packages. There are still a lot of employments around for highly educated and skilled workers even in a financial crisis, perhaps at a lower pay. It's whether these workers are willing to accept that lower pay. FYI, I know someone from IMFS who got retrenchment package of 11 months, and found a job in less than 11 months. And when economy recovers, they are even more established, have learned even more new things, putting even more value on themselves. Their resume will look even more impressive.</p>
              <p>Given good skills, business owners will explore alternatives and increase their own products range, and create opportunities for themselves to enter a new market, establish their brand name as the leader in the industry. And when economy recovers, they are now the leader, they have greater market share, and they are more well known.</p>
              <p>Given good skills, what can MLMers do? Sell the same products, still without any brand name at all, and work hard for .............. drum rolls................ their company. Same as a job. But your income will most likely decline, which is the same as being forced to accept a severe pay cut as having a job in a MNC. And when the economy recovers? They are still the same, with the same skillset that won't bring them much further. Nothing much extra on resume, nor will they garner a higher market share because they survived the crisis when competitors can't, nor do they build up any personal brand names.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given bad skills, once retrenched, indeed, it would be hard to find a job, thus zero income. And given bad skills, you will indeed earn zero income in MLM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bad skills, not much difference between being employed, self employed or in MLM in a crisis.<br>Good skills, I don't see how MLMers are much better off than those climbing the corporate ladder. And it is extremely obvious they cannot compete at all with true business owners.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your information. I hope there are enough Adam Khoos out there.</p>
              <p><strong>There is a clear difference between being an agent or owning
                                      your own business. One, you employ people, you have your own brand
                                      name. The other, you work for other people's brand name.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Again, another duh.</strong></p>
              <p>You are wrong. Firstly, agents can hire agents which is equivalent to employing people. Secondly, owners do not necessarily have their own brand names. Ever heard of distributors and sub-contractors? Nike has sub-contracted to many companies, they do not produce their own products. These sub-contractors produce goods of other brands and do not have their own brand. Unless you are talking about owning the company's name. Then I'll just have to laugh.</p>
              <p><strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In a financial
                                      crisis</span></strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Given good skills, when one is retrenched, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">one can still easily
                                      find a job in less than a month</span>, and that's after receiving
                                      retrenchment packages. There are still a lot of employments around
                                      for highly educated and skilled workers even in a financial crisis,
                                      perhaps at a lower pay. It's whether these workers are willing to
                                      accept that lower pay. FYI, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I know someone from IMFS who got
                                      retrenchment package of 11 months, and found a job in less than 11
                                      months.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">And when economy recovers, they are even more established, have learned even more new things, putting even more value on themselves. Their resume will look even more impressive.</span></strong></p>
              <p>I hope you've realised that you are stereotyping. Firstly, working in VE doesn't equate to not having good skills. About the retrenchment packages, you are right. But as compared to still having a job, I am not sure whether being retrenched is better after all. Definitely there are jobs around with lower pay, isn't being in MLM one of them? Secondly, are you sure everyone can be like that? Getting a good retrenchment package and increasing their market value after the financial crisis? Can't people that work in VE achieve that too? And by the way, working in VE as MLMer = salesman?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Given good skills, business owners will explore alternatives and
                                      increase their own products range, and create opportunities for
                                      themselves to enter a new market, establish their brand name as the
                                      leader in the industry. And when economy recovers, they are now the
                                      leader, they have greater market share, and they are more well
                                      known.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Are you sure all good business owners can successfully increase their own product range? Are you sure they can create opportunities for themselves to enter a new market? Are you sure they can establish their brand name as the leader in the industry? Are you sure when the economy recovers they will become the leader with greater market share and more well known? Are you sure? And what makes you think that VE can't do any of those above? Aren't they owned by a boss too? You are generalising everyone.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Given good skills, what can MLMers do? Sell the same products,
                                      still without any brand name at all, and work hard for
                                      .............. drum rolls................ their company. Same as a
                                      job. But your income will most likely decline, which is the same as
                                      being forced to accept a severe pay cut as having a job in a MNC. And when the economy recovers? They are still the same, with the
                                      same skillset that won't bring them much further. Nothing much
                                      extra on resume, nor will they garner a higher market share because
                                      they survived the crisis when competitors can't, nor do they build
                                      up any personal brand names.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Whole chunk of stereotyping and hypothetical assumptions. What's the difference between what you've said and "All those families with two working parents have kids that go astray" Are you sure VE doesn't invest in new products? Are you sure given good skills, MLMers can't do anything? Are you sure they are still the same after the financial crisis? Are you sure they have only the same skillset? Are you sure they have nothing much in their resume? Are you sure they cannot survive the crisis?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Given bad skills, once retrenched, indeed, it would be hard to
                                      find a job, thus zero income. And given bad skills, you will indeed
                                      earn zero income in MLM.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Hypothetical assumption<strong> </strong>yet again.</p>
              <p><strong>Bad skills, not much difference between being employed, self

                                      cannot compete at all with true business owners.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Yes you are right but you are getting nowhere because what you have said is irrelevant. I was drawing a parallel between "owning a business" and "being an agent as a MLMer". You can hire agents to work for you even if you are a MLMer, that is parallel to employing workers just like what a boss does.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And... that's not a true statement about MNCs. There are two

                                                  competitions occur. The other, technical path, is based solely on

              <p>Yes indeed there are different types of career paths in MNCs. Managerial positions are definitely limited. You are right again. But in Venture Era, it is a completely different story because you do get promoted into managerial positions based on merit instead of nomination. So I guess I have made myself clear enough that being in Venture Era is better in a sense that you have less competition from others vying for the same position.</p>

              <p><strong>There are many business owners who don't earn passive income.

              <p>Of course I do understand what is meant by a business. Sub-contracting is a business. No doubt about that. They are agents contracted to the respective MNCs to produce goods for them. Just like how MLMers are distributing goods for the company and earning a commission. There is a parallel over here. And of course I also do understand what is a brand name. That is why I've said that "owners do not <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">necessarily</span></em></span></strong></span> have their own brand names", just like Nike's sub-contractors.</p>

              <p>Firstly, you are stereotyping. I'm not exactly sure whether all good business owners can definitely achieve all of the above. Especially when you have other competitors that have good business owners as well. Even if we assume that all good business owners can achieve all of the above, not everyone can be good business owners. And being a good business owners are better off than being a MLMer. Duh. I wasn't comparing them anyway. I was merely saying that being a MLMer is a decent job.

              <p>Alright if you need me to spell it out. Here goes:</p>
              <p><strong>"Good skills,<span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">I don't see how MLMers
                                                  are much better off than those climbing the corporate ladder.</span> And
                                                  it is extremely obvious they cannot compete at all with true
                                                  business owners."</span></strong></p>
              <p>MLMers are not necessarily better off than those who earn fixed salary who are climbing the coporate ladder. So you are right. But I have to say that you are generalising all MLMers to lose out to true business owners. Definitely not all MLMers are better than business owners, neither are they definitely worse off. A Business Associate Manager for example can earn up to $15k a month, and he might not have to own the company. (FYI, Business Associate Manager in Venture Era is an agent as well) Whereas true business owners of SMEs might not even earn half as much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And by saying this, you are effectively telling us that given
                                                  bad skills, you can still earn money in MLM. Means any Tom Dick and
                                                  Harry can be in MLM and definitely earn money. That, clearly, is
                                                  not what most MLMers want to tell us; they tell us here that not
                                                  everyone can earn in MLM.</strong></p>
              <p>The MLMers are right. Perhaps in their context, earn money = decent salary. But in my context,  earn money = more than zero income. And yes, given bad skills. one can still earn money in MLM in Venture Era. Even if you can't sell nuts, you can still depend on your downlines who can sell to get commission from. Even if they can't sell, you will still have your manager to depend on to make the sales, which you still get to earn comission from. They won't be your manager if they can't make a single sale, because they would have to made a certain amount of sales to reach the position of manager. However, by saying this, I am not saying that you can survive off these commissions earned from others, but definitely it is money.</p>

                                                  business" and "being an agent as a MLMer". You can hire agents to

                                                  But in Venture Era, it is a completely different story because you
                                                  do get promoted into managerial positions based on merit instead of
                                                  nomination. So I guess I have made myself clear enough that being
                                                  in Venture Era is better in a sense that you have less competition

                                                  include selling the products directly. So they are not salesmen.

                                                  a MLMer is a decent job. I'm advising everyone to try accepting MLM
                                                  instead of closing their ears even before anything is being said or
                                                  they miss what might have been a great opportunity.</p>

                                                  true business owners. Definitely not all MLMers are better than
                                                  business owners, neither are they definitely worse off. A Business

                                                  might not have to own the company. (FYI, Business Associate Manager
                                                  in Venture Era is an agent as well) Whereas true business owners of

                                                  income. And yes, given bad skills. one can still earn money in MLM
                                                  in Venture Era. Even if you can't sell nuts, you can still depend
                                                  on your downlines who can sell to get commission from. Even if they
                                                  can't sell, you will still have your manager to depend on to make
                                                  the sales, which you still get to earn comission from. They won't
                                                  be your manager if they can't make a single sale, because they
                                                  would have to made a certain amount of sales to reach the position

              <p>There's no difference between MLMers and salesman, or if climbing the corporate ladder, there's no difference with climbing it in the MNC as well. Following your logic, there are indeed parallels to running a business in a lot of jobs. It doesn't give MLM any extra advantages. Bank insurance agents, property agents, head salesman, supervisor in MacDonalds, etc all get the same experience.</p>

              <p><strong>So? It's still not running your own business.</strong></p>
              <p>Yup. It's not running your own business. So? My point was, agents can also hire agents to work for them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Yes, but it is still their own brand name. Good example, Sasa is
                      a brand name, but they sell other brands. Duh.</strong></p>
              Nope. Not all companies have their own brands. You should really consider doing some research. I did gave you one example didn't I?
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And the sub-contractors will still have their own brand. Do you
                      think that they will sub-contract to a company with no branding,
                      without any sense of quality?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes they can have their own brand, but not necessarily. Research on the example that I gave you. If it's not enough you can ask for more and I'll find them for you. Do you understand the difference between branding and quality? There is no link between these two.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Simply put, they can also brand themselves as manufacturers for
                      Nike Shoes to potential companies like Reebok. It's a branding.</strong></p>
              <p>Wait a minute. Do you understand the meaning of branding? You can't brand yourself that way. Simply because your company is your company, it is not Nike or Reebok.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rubbish. I have already explained above, they still have to have
                      a brand name. It's not just simply a company's name, or a factory's
                      name.</strong></p>
              <p>You didn't. Do your research. Find out about the example that I gave you and also find out what is meant by branding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In a recession, how are you going to increase your market value
                      within? That was what I had been pointing out.</strong></p>
              <p>Well you didn't make it clear enough because you obviously said <strong>"<strong>Can you even describe how working in MLM will
                                              increase your market value? Sell more products? Please
                                              la."</strong></strong> And so my answer was to this statement.</p>
              <p>Ok now you've brought up a new question. Firstly, I don't think why a person's market value cannot be increased during a recession, be it working in MLM or not. As to how, there can be many ways, such as learning how to sell things even during bad times. If you can sell products during bad times, there is much to show about your salesmanship. And by saying salesmanship, it is not just literally being a salesman, but also the ability to sell yourself to companies when you're in for an interview. Of course different people can have different ways of increasing market value. This is just an example. And not everyone can increase their market value during bad times. Same applies to business owners and employed workers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <strong>So it is the agents. All along I have been telling your it is
                      VE's business; it's not your own business.</strong>
              <p><strong>Do I need to repeat that many times?</strong></p>
              <p>And all the while I've been agreeing. Aren't you silly?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Still different name for salesman.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Just now how an insurance agent or bank agent can have different
                      names. In short, a salesman given different names.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Eh... Can you stop ignoring my points? Or are you pretending not to see it? Ok, I shall repeat one more time. Make sure you register this in your head this time.</p>
              <p>Being a MLMer can be marketing managers, marketing group managers,
                                              marketing associate managers etc. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">their job scope does not
                                              include selling the products directly. So they are not salesmen. </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AND again, if you are going to be promoted to a manager, you are
                      still not running your own business with your own brand name.</strong></p>
              <p>And yes I have agreed countless times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>It seems that you are getting dumber.</strong></p>
              <p>I wonder if you're qualified to say that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you are questioning me about that point, you are accusing.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong> Simple as that. If you cannot find anything that I have said before
                      that equates the two, then why the hell did you even bring it up

              <p>Why can't I? And obviously I brought it up for a reason. You were talking on and on about people with good and bad skills irrelevently. Can't I ask you that question to bring you back to the main topic?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Why did you even need to ask? When I have clearly stated
                      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both situations of having
                      good skills in VE, and having bad skills in VE</span>. Asking the
                      obvious?</strong></p>
              <p>Erm... Haha? Don't claim that you have clearly stated something that you didn't. Don't insult your own intelligence. Don't even try to copy and paste something and try to argue your way out coz that's just gonna make you look funnier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Obviously not. Why bring up something unrelated?</strong></p>
              <p>That's because someone's living in self denial. Ignoring my points, fully focused on personal attacks. That's why he doesn't see what I've said as being coherent. I'm humiliating you too, I'm not denying. But at least I can multi-task.</p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>

                      MLM."</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Are you still going to tell me it is hypothetical?</strong></p>
              <p>Well... you're getting close, almost there. Keep it up! Given bad skills, you can still earn money in VE, but you can't live off it. So that's not zero income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>And are you saying that without totally bad skills, the
                      possibility of earning zero income is indeed almost zero.

                      give that guarantee to anyone who joins?</span></strong></p>
              <p>Yup. I can guarantee that. Unless he's out to challenge me by signing up and not attending any single appointment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>If they cannot achieve those, they are not good business
                      owners.</strong></p>
              <p>Ever heard of Oligopolistic and Monopolistic competitive market structures? Firms in these market structures might not be the leading companies in their industries, neither can they afford to come out with new products, but that doesn't translate into being bad owners. Because every industry has it's own characteristics that seperate itself from others, bounded by their own restrictions such as imperfect knowledge and barriers to entry. Every business has it's unique way of running.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Even when your competitors are good owners, there are bound to
                      be some who are bad, and thus you will take their market share.</strong></p>
              <p>Ok here's some basic microeconomic lessons for you. Only firms in the Monopoly and Oligopoly Market Structure can gain market share because of the domination of market power. Whereas firms in the Monopolistic Competitive Market Structure do not and cannot gain market share simply because there are too many of such firms, their market share is insignificant. The majority of firms belong to the Monopolistic Competitive Market Structure. Singapore itself is dominated by SMEs. Taking over of market share is thus not valid unless you are the vast minority of the owners of mega firms. Thus, even when there are competitors that are bad, you can't take their market share, unless you're a mega firm.</p>

              <p>LOL?!!! Do you know what you've just said was downright hilarious? DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS SME? How much do you expect SMEs to earn given their size are market share? So if your "good business owners" do not include owners of SMEs, then who do they include?</p>

              <p><strong>There's no difference between MLMers and salesman, or if
                      climbing the corporate ladder, there's no difference with climbing

                      parallels to running a business in a lot of jobs. It doesn't give
                      MLM any extra advantages. Bank insurance agents, property agents,
                      head salesman, supervisor in MacDonalds, etc all get the same

              <p>Hi Mr. Stereotyping-cum-sweeping-statement-cum-points-ignorer. If you want to argue, at least make sense. Aim at my points. One by one. Counter them with sensible and valid points. Make sure you answer my points!!! That's another GP lesson. Always be relevant!</p>
              <p>MLMers are not all salesmen! HELLO HELLO HELLO? Get this through that densed layer of air and into your brain. And stop repeating it again.</p>
              <p>There's a BIG BIG BIG DIFFERENCE in climbing the coporate ladder in VE and MNCs. And I have said it. Climbing in VE is based on MERIT. BASED ON MERIT!! HELLO!!! GET THIS IN!! No nominations required. No limited vacancies for the positions. Once you meet the quota you will AUTOMATICALLY GET PROMOTED. This is the advantage in VE.</p>

              <p>Whereas for your previous example, a company manufacturing shoes for Nike has its own brand, and could, for example, brand itself as the manufacturer of Nike shoes, or even other brands of shoes.

              <p>You might want to consider that a large majority of the MLMers
              that are posting here are likely to be teenagers, thus the
              credibility.</p>
              <p>Maybe it's a little harsh to say that all that tried had failed.
              There are definitely people who are doing well, otherwise it
              wouldn't have made any sense for anyone to stay in that
              company.</p>
