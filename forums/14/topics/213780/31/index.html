              <p>To newcomer,</p>
              <p>as if I am not paying them... My lawyers can refuse to take the case, but they still do... What is it any of your problem? You paying for my lawyers is it?</p>
              <p>To EA,</p>
              <p>yup, nothing I can do unless he give me his full name and home address for me to send the summons... So far he refuses to give me his necessary particulars and insist that I give him my hp for him to contact me... What if he calls me and scold vulgaritities and threats? Wouldnt it be a waste of my time?</p>
              <p>Cant demand the singtel, M1 or starhub for his particulars right? After all it is a civil suit... Unless he give threats provided that I record it, then police case... So  far he only say that he got strong back up and i should be scared... Threatening me w/ tyranny... As if I am afraid...</p>
              <p>To pagan911,</p>
              <p>what's so difficult?</p>

              <p>my lawyer meet your lawyer,</p>

              <p>I don't usually visit forum but when I happen to see this thread on the venture era due to typo when using google, I have this urge to sign up for to post something that happen to me when I was in this company for about a few months ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was looking for a job at the moment and this "friend" (I lost contact with her for a long time but somehow he manage to get my no) of mine introduce to this job and he said it was to "assist the manager in sales, customer support etc" He told me it was VE group but refused to disclose the full name of the company and even offer to bring me all the way from the MRT station to the company. Since I was quite free that time, I went down to take a look.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was introduced to this manager Miss Z** Y*** She was quite young, I think she's 18 or 19 and I was quite suprised why the company will hire someone so young to be a manager. She and my "friend" start to psycho me to join their "business".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was quite naive and did not know the danger of mlm so I decided to give it a try.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was later when I discovered I was in this team R** M****** and my manager actually quited poly to run this "business" They start telling me how good is mlm, the videos and car achievers and so on. But they also told me not to share it with my friends first before I do not have enough knowledge to share.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was actually impressed (stupid!) and I told them I wanted to start my network as soon as possible. It was during my poly hoilday then and I want to get their so called ME (forget what's it called) before my school started</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My manager then suggest that I should let my parents know what I am doing first and she suggest going to my house to "talk" with my parents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree to her request and that was the stupidest mistake I ever made. When they say go to your house, what they mean is going to sell things to your partents. She keep pushing my partents to support me by buying these products and it was not like 1000 to 2000 dollars but 10k to 20k because she said I can beome a ME right away if my parents support me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My parents did not buy anything but I had lost their trust because I had told them beforehand that my friend is only coming to tell them more about what I am doing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course after that night I never went back to VE. Thinking back, I remembered my manager telling me there are some who get their ME rank or even manager rank in a day, I bet it must be the parents throwing in their hard earned money to support their children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My friend is sprending more and more time there and I am worry for him because they will psycho him to quit poly too to go full time there. He is a bright student and I do not want to see him throwing away his bright future for that ****ing company and for that ****ing manager. But I think he is too brainwashed to listen to me now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think all I can do is hope for the best and hope that the ****ing manager will get her deserts someday for breaking my trust between me and my partents (and maybe many others' too) which I am still trying to rebuild even today.</p>
