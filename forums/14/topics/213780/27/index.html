              <p>the kids are still here !!!   no wonder <strong>elementalangel</strong> <strong>is</strong> being branded by forumers here as <strong>inmature</strong> and talk rubbish.  until now, still havent improved. haiz.. nowadays, the kids are too <strong>egoistic</strong> to accept their own mistakes.</p>
              <p><strong>after editing the 1st paragraph.. i gave up on you...</strong></p>
              <p>we can see people talking about what pay la, what products benefits la, what crap la... to me, all waste time. what for explaining to kids, they should go out and learn themselves. obviously, they dont understand how things work and just shoot rubbish out from their mouth, thinking they are very good... WHAHAHA..  i think they look stupid in front of the pro.</p>
              <p>frankly, because of all this childish remarks, it actually motivated alot of agents. well, maybe the childish and stupid kids here wont agreed with me.. who will admit they are stupid? LOL~!  but only people who are matured, definitely can agree with me. LOL ~!</p>
              <p>some who cant eat the grape, said the grape is sour... isnt that quite obvious to some people who cant achieve much but trying hard to pull other people down? well, this wont work and only reflect how narrow minded and naive you are. oh well, maybe you dont understand all this at all... haiz.</p>
              <p>keep up the good work guys! because of you guys talking so much things here, it only makes VE look better! lol ~!! dont understand what i mean? obviously you dont want to understand what i mean.</p>
              <p>i mean that the world will not have clever people when there aren't any stupid people around. with stupid people commenting about VE, VE look even better than before. thank you guys !!!! I LOVE YOU ~!! WHAHAHA</p>

              <p>wow... so many things happened when i was not online...</p>
              <p>My opinion:</p>
              <p>-everyone here have 0 credibility since everyone is hidden behind a mask. Many childish arguements have been going on.</p>
              <p>- I agree that VE seniors are someone arrogant in a sense looking down on 8-5 working ppl... (VE ppl dun slam me, i am just stating the truth). Elementalangel calling VE agents trash of society or something, aren't you similar to those arrogant agents in a sense condemning ppl because of the occupation they want to choose?</p>
              <p>I use to look down on ppl who work 8-5. (before I knew of VEs existence).. When I joined VE, that mindset changed for a reason. So far my experience in VE is really humbling. But that's me.(Doubt its the same for the rest.)</p>
              <p>-Definitely for the past few pages, there's a lot of immature argueing. Those who critisized VE, as I have mentioned before are those who felt cheated by the agents.( which MOST of VE agents are unethical)</p>
              <p>-someone mentioning a car achiever driving a 20 yr ols BMW model(dont know if its true or not). I dont see whats the bad point in this. Cars more that 10 yrs old are more expensive to maintain, especially in singapore.</p>
              <p>-honestly speaking, enquires's english is not good. Elementalangel, though your english is better than that of enquires, your english too is still not up to standard. So dont mock people who is weaker than you in certain areas.</p>
              <p>-My overall opinion of this thread:</p>
              <p>Pro VEs have no proof for their claim here in defending VE.(Even if there is, its not shown here.</p>
              <p>Anti VEs have no proof either. Just people supporting each others stories which I have said, everyone here have 0 credibility... I too find that anti-ves in this thread would try and find every little reasons that they can to condemn the co.</p>
              <p>I have my negative opinions of VE too, and I too have positive opinions of the co. too, but I dont belittle the co. or placing the co. status as god. If I seem to do any of these, I actually dont.</p>
              <p>What enquires said do have a point, about many childish people here posting their comments immaturely would have below 0 credibility... One eg. I was on the fence about joining VE, but elementalangel was the one who practically 'chased ' me into joining VE, even if his intention was not to do so.</p>
              <p> Enquires I too think that you tend to be childish when posting here especially when there are childish postings that put VE in a bad image.</p>
              <p>P.S. I dont believe in magnetic therapy no matter how hard my seniors try to convince me that it works. So, I dont sell it.</p>

              <p>when he said i was childish in my comments... instead of reprimanding him.. you came to shoot me instead... is this considered a practice of double standard?<br><br><br><strong>Anti VEs have no proof either. Just people supporting each others stories which I have said, everyone here have 0 credibility... I too find that anti-ves in this thread would try and find every little reasons that they can to condemn the co.<br></strong>no proof??!?! i quoted so many sources selling reliable products which are much cheaper then VE in terms of pricing... If you can show a proper website which sells products more expensive than VE.. then i would have nuttin to say..<br><br><strong>someone mentioning a car achiever driving a 20 yr ols BMW model(dont know if its true or not). I dont see whats the bad point in this. Cars more that 10 yrs old are more expensive to maintain, especially in singapore.<br></strong>so now buying old cars is a treand ar... So why dont they just buy new cars if the price balance up? btw the models are actually second hand cars...</p>

              <p>condemn me? lol.. you cant even condemn me because you are just a shit.. how to condemn ? lOL ~!</p>
              <p>for a childish boy like you, i have to use childish words to let you understand, haiz.. really put down my own standards. lol ~!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) you claimed you quoted so many sources selling reliable products. is the source reliable? NO. is the product reliable? NO. is the product the SAME? NO. if you want a proper website which sells more expensive, i think you CAN do the search since you are so FREE everyday. maybe you dont want to be convinced by your own actions when you saw such website selling more expensive products. LOL !!</p>
              <p>2) the BMW model is not even 20 years old, obviously you dont know about cars!! 0 credibility!! LOL ~!! there are so many good cars driven by the achievers. example, BMW 330 COUPE, BMW Z4, Maserati, SLK etc etc etc, but you choose to ignore and just pinpoint that particular car... isnt it obvious that you are finding every SMALL LITTLE THING to say negative about MLM ? how about critizing what SOCKS they are wearing ?? LOL ~!!</p>
              <p>3) I said I am INDEPENDANT distributor of VE. do you know what is INDEPENDANT ??  I said I'm not from VE, thats TRUE because i'm not a staff or worker over there. you DONT KNOW what i mean, and you ASSUME what i meant. izzit it quite obvious that you DONT KNOW what is MLM and the relationship of distributors with the company?</p>
              <p>4) You just cannot accept people comment NEGATIVE about you. You are unhappy, fight back whatever points mentioned. if you cannot accept, then in the first place, YOU DONT go around commenting negative on others. YOU are the one the STARTED this flaming war, then you should end it. oh yah, in case you dont agreed, please check back all YOUR posts, see whether you are INDEED the one that started this war!</p>
              <p>5) I dont mind my english no good, because having good english doesnt mean anything at all. the japanses and chinese also dont know good english, but they also can be doing very well... the sad thing is, what about you? YOU COMMENT so much, how good are you? NOTHING but a just a POLY BOY BOY.</p>

              <p>eh.. the one driving the ALMOST 20 year old BMW is bryan soh the ugly fuck. yeah. u talk about others driving high end continental cars... how many?  only a hand full of them do. and its thanks to people like you , that they are able to afford it. by the way. what car are you driving?</p>
              <p>Enquiries. u must be from house of red. cos everyone from there speaks crappy english. are u alex wong?</p>
              <p>What do you really know about the company? do u really believe that no complain from CASe has been made before? Do you really believe everything that the seniors tell you?</p>
              <p>How about Sarah Tan getting close with another guy in orchard while she was engaged to kit tan? i believe she only loves his LIMITED money.</p>
              <p>anw. even if you are an independent distributor. you are just a HIGH CLASS BEGGAR <strong>HOPING</strong> that someone will buy products from you so that you can <strong>TRY</strong> to survive with that minimal amount of money.</p>
              <p>shall i hop down to Eunos and donate some money to you ? :D</p>
