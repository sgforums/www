            <div class='col-md body'>i just got one good comment for VE : the atmosphere there cant be described...and i mean negative...and leading to people actually mass msging in friendster??? ask urself first la VE members... are you really business people??? You are disturbing people's privacy somemore...seriously irritated at how you guys get your so called custmers...<br><br>seriously, if for now, i'll go for something that earns me real passive income monthly aside from commisions from recruitment...unlike VE talking passive when theres actually no passive....must keep recruiting, then ask them to recruit, then ask those people to recruit...<br><br>so i wanna ask who else go those cars apart from those on the plasma screen? got addition to it or not??? or have u been using the same presentation slides for years??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone! This is my 1st post on sgForums. I have read a lot abt Venture Era ppl on the various forums and decided to post here coz VE is still a hot topic here.<br><br>Let me share with everyone my VE exp here, which isn't at all gd. I only lasted 4 days there. And the unthinkable happened in just a short span of 4 days, shocking my family members.<br><br>I was called by a stranger abt more than a mth ago, telling me abt a job which seems lucrative. Can help me write resume and all. Seemed too gd to be true. Someone unknown calling me out of the blue, saying abt all those gd stuffs. Who wouldn't be fascinated? Being naive and having zero knowledge abt mlm, I decided to check the company out out of curiosity. I was merely looking for a decent job and working exp but I got more than that.<br><br>Met my upline at Eunos MRT stn few days ltr and then he brought me ard the company, and meeting his colleagues as well. I was kinda fascinated since the environment at VE wasn't what I expected of a normal company. People there are in their late teens to early 20s anyway.<br><br>Speaking of age grp, let me quote this from hiphop2009:<br><br><blockquote><strong>i just felt dat more and more students are being targetted by MLM companies. when more students join, students will poach more students.<br><br>i think it shld be raised and brought to attention of parents.</strong></blockquote>Yes, this is so true! My upline is a student himself. And soon he wanted me to call up my friends to get them to join VE. It will become a vicious cycle, with ur network of friends being trapped in it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Anyway, my upline told me to come back the next day and also telling me NOT to say anything abt the company, which I blindly followed.<br><br>2nd day: training started. They got me and some new recruits to watch some video, which might hv been used as a means of brain wash. They even taught phone techniques, which is often used to call up clients. I learnt that they used "cold contacts" to get at strangers to make appointment to come to the company. Must hv been how the mysterious call had reached me.<br><br>They even got the recruits to copy down EVERY single number in their phonebooks, saying that if ur handphone gets lost, stolen, spoilt or whatever, u still hv this list of contacts. Ouh crap! That muz hv been how they get the numbers to "cold contact" ppl  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> I hope they hv shredded my contact list and the rest of the people who hv left. It's really intruding the person's privacy.<br><br>Another thing. They even asked the recruits abt their family and relatives. What they work as, any ilnesses etc etc etc. This is also intruding one's privacy. But the SLOW and NAIVE me didn't reslise that at that point of time. Which decent company will want to dig out EVERY SINGLE DETAIL of their employees? It's madness!<br><br>Anyway after some training, I was told to call up my parents for my first sales Appointment (SA). It was supposed to be to "get my parents' consent" for working at VE, since they still don't know I'm working for them. The Marketing Manager (MM) who went with me kept using me as a reason for them to support me. He says I shd be benefitting my family and relatives with the health pdts from VE, but it was just an EXCUSE for targetting ur close ones. VE just wanna sap all the money from us. Any company's aim is to make as much $$$ as possible. So yea.<br><br>I was quite in a dilemma coz my parents wanted me to stop working for them, since someone else from VE hv approached them earlier and they had rejected their pdt. On the other hand, I was quite controlled by my MM who wanted me to do things as he wanted. I was like following his every single command. I don't know what was up with me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Anyway I decided to stop working for VE on the 3rd day. Told the MM my decision and he told me to come over to the office to talk things out. I agreed, but little did I knew I wld be dragged inside again. I decided to explain my reasons for leaving because I felt it was a decent way to resign from a job. Sheesh, I didn't see that coming. Somehow they convinced me to stayed on and yup, went for even more SA which didn't went well.<br><br>During the SA, I felt like a robot. I didn't know what to do. I felt weird in front of my relatives. it was just not me. I was totally controlled by them VE ppl. haiz<br><br>After going for 3 SA (one with my parents, 2 with relatives) I asked my MM "in what other ways can I close the sale?" (means being successful in selling the pdt to the customer).  He said he withdrew his savings from his bank acct (which I presumed he had done b4) and I HAD to agree to that!<br><br>So on the next day, w/out my parents knowing, I went with my that MM and another lady (prolly a MM too) to withdraw cash (I wont say it here but it's really a lot). This was to buy up the pdts so I could get promoted to a Marketing Executive in 3 days from the day I started out as a Marketing Agent.<br><br>Let me explain this bit here: For a new recruit who have closed their 1st sale with someone (usually parents or guardians), they will be promoted from a Marketing Agent (Probation) to Marketing Agent [MA(P) to MA]. From there, they are encouraged to close a few more sales to hit Marketing Executive rank in THREE days. Usually ppl wld sell off their pdts to their relatives successfully to complete the sales but for others who wanted the award, they might resort to using their own money to buy up the pdts and get promoted to ME.<br><br>For my case, it was because I was pressured by my MM in a way, because it was the end of the month then and I was in a VERY GOOD POSITION to boost up their team's sales to compete for the Best Team Award (meaning the team which can make the most sales in a month). And I had to freaking helped them to bosst up the sales with my own $$$. Ouh crap! *bang head against wall*<br><br>And yup, my parents soon found out abt it after they made me squeeze out what I did on the 4th day (withdrawing cash and all) since I wasn't behaving like myself when I got home. Coz I realised being ME isn't a big deal. It means anyone who hv enuf $$$ in their acct can simply rise up to ME like that. And my MM can try to cheer me up by saying "why aren't you happy? u can earn more now"<br><br>So what if I can earn more? I wld be benefitting from my downline who wld slog hard for their upline and I cld just shake legs and hv money flowing in. it's not right. I don't find it satisfying. I rather work at something that is fulfilling, no matter how small the pay is. U see ppl who don't hv such big salaries but they're CONTENTED! They're happy! VE ppl? They won't be satisfied and contented with 4-figure salaries! All they care abt is making MORE &amp; MORE MONEY!<br><br>Freak! money faced ppl! Life ain't abt money totally!<br><br>I called it quits after that incident. Abt my money, well they're saying they might pay back thru sales but I really really doubt they wld do so. Dang! my money's gone like that...<br><br>*url removed for mightyflameboy's sake. pls refer to redstone's post for url*<br><br>I know the owner of this Friendster profile! it was posted b4 by redstone on Oct 6th. It belongs to one of the uplines! He's a Business manager and I personally feel he's very arrogant and a show off! I rmb on the first day, when one Malay guy told him he needed to leave soon, he gave that "I don't want you to leave" look, since things haven't even started. Bleah! His ringtone was irritating too, but that's out of topic.<br><br>He is from this very dominating team in VE and sadly I was from this team of very agressive sellers. All the people below him and those above me, like my upline and MM, I might know. Sighs.<br><br>I hope the readers of this forum will learn from my experience and not commit my STUPID mistake.<br><br>Really, I don't know why I chose to trust ppl I know i like 2 - 3 days, over the ppl I hv known ALL my life (i.e. my family, parents)<br><br>btw, I received another call from another company, VEG pte ltd, which deals with the same line of pdts. HAH! I knew that caller's intention from the start and I replied "oh, I hv my hols planned! sry!" My stomach turned when he mentions health pdts and all those shitty stuffs. He was also trying to make me feel like I'm the luckiest guy on eath by saying "congragulations!" a few times! how lame can these ppl be?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So yea, this is my VE exp, and sry for the extremely long post!</div>
