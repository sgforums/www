            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, i had just been to a company in eunos weeks ago. Being conned by a friend of mine to his relaxing company which does "presentation" for a high pay. For a student, a 10 dollar an hour job is already big money, considering the fact that we have to qualifications.<br><br>When i went into the company, i was impressed by the fact that they actually have a building or maybe 3/4 of a building for their company, the first impression in my mine was, " wow , this must be quite a reputable company". However after a brief introduction about the company, i found out that the company is actually a multi-leveled company, aka salesmen job.<br><br>I then had a talk to several employees in the company , known to them as "entrepreneurs" . I found out that they either had low qualifications and they always try to impress others by their "knowledge". I wasn't impressed by them, however i acted as if i was when i was listening to them, after all they promised lots of cash if i join in the company.<br><br>I was convinced that their products are useful. YES, indeed they are useful. Thats why i wanted to join the company at first.<br><br>However, when i went home to check on the prices of similar products on the net, i realized that the profits they rake is about 900% of the cost. That was totally unacceptable to me, thats why i did not want to work in this job. Imagine selling a product to your relative or friend when you know that the price is SEVERELY OVER-PRICED.<br><br>OK, now i shall tell you how this company works.<br>1) You join in as a newb<br>2) You get impressed and then start to "invest" on the products, buy the product for yourself.<br>3) You then start selling to your relatives and friends.<br>4) You start to find out that the product is over-priced but it was too late, you have already invested in the product and "scammed" all your friends and relatives<br>5) You will run out of contacts to sell to!<br>6) Then start pulling people in to be your "down-line" as its your only way to make money.<br>7) You start to "inspire" others to join the "right" job.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> The vicious cycle just keeps repeating<br><br>One thing you don't realize is that in the process, you might lose friends, break ties with your relatives and such. And it is only the BOSS who wins, the one right on the top would earn all the money and you would be the one losing out in the end.<br><br>So here are some things to remind you<br>before you join a MLM/ network-marketing company<br><br>1) do research about the background of the company ( usually the company would have a website which is never updated or going to be update, even if that is so, they would not even give the prices of their products in their websites. )<br>that means that the company would most likely be selling over-priced items<br>2) CHECK the price of the company items on the internet and compare the items wisely.<br>3) DONT BE GREEDY, if it is too good to be true, its not true<br><br></div>
