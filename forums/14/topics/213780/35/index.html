              <p>My friends from both DW and enyouth had confirmed that their bosses were related and their top management do not deny on this. I also heard from my friend in DW that the bosses of VE, Enyouth and DW bosses were of the same "team" before they start their mlm company. As for VE side, I have not found out anything yet, maybe someone from VE will like to tell us VE view on this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I heard from the VE side that they claimed that Enyouth (and its former name) is older than them. If I am not wrong, VE started just after the mlm act, if Enyouth is around before that, what are they doing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some USA companies such as forever are already operating in China now, but they are doing the retail way but at the same time, they are building their "network" Since mlm is still illegal in china, they cannot benefit from their "network". The reason why they still do it is because once mlm become legal there, they can go all out immediately since they already have their network in place. Maybe that's what they were doing in singapore before the mlm act.</p>

              <p>Haha, element y so hostile. Eh bro come bugis swenson i treat u drink coffee la. haha fight hard sia you. haha you very cute. Your really an entertainment tool for me haha. Everytime when a person post a thread then u'll find means and ways to counter it. Then it makes me very thrill and eager to c how u'll reply.</p>
              <p>to me It's very logic that u have been to VE and i guess ur more or less a manager ba. And u got some serious conflicts with the colleagues in there and you left. I guess your still in your poly life. Haven been through NS.</p>
              <p>Its quite a waste, haha your stubborness used in the wrong area. If you were to start up your own business i think your gona make it big. Since your as bored as me..</p>
              <p>Why not try counter my question.</p>
              <p>try this, Whats wrong with over pricing of products. Today you go buy a can of coca cola in Econ Minimarts or MAMA shops. It cost around 70cents to 80cents.

              <p>Today consumers get products from Venture Era they don't pay for the Customer Servicing right.

It comes from the time, sincerity, and passion from the agent. How do you measure time, sincerity, passion with money.</p>
              <p>Thats why theres nothing call free lunch in the world, and the servicing is life time thing. Today you go to 'Best' try get yourself a TV. If anything goes wrong with the TV after the 1 - 3 years warranty the person come up to your house and just do a check, and they found out that its just because switch's lose, they'll still have to charge. Maybe you don't pay. Go ask the adults that did it.</p>
              <p>Now maybe you might be thinking, "but i can dispose it and get a new one". But your health can't right. Try dispose your lungs and heart.</p>
              <p>After this part there will be another thing that comes up to alot of people. 'Theres so many health products out there why do we have to support VENTURE ERA''s product. Very simple if you can find ANY products which can cleanse ur liver and kidney and at the same time detox your body without taking any drugs and able to find testimonials on people who recovered from kidney failure, cancers, diabetics, tumour, hepatitis B, Stones.And its able to help people even in last stage cancer and AIDs. Brother find me one that can help in all this fields and its cheaper than VENTURE ERA products. Even if its $o.5o difference i also buy from you.</p>

              <p>relax man, studentofite, you said Bugis and Herbalife (one of their training centres) and DCHL are there. Hmmm...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's not mlm or the system of marketing that piss people off, it's the way they are introduced to the system. If you want to tell your friend that a movie is good, you will tell him directly. Will you said "come, let's go to an interesting place, don't ask me what is it because too hard to explain, let's go" Then your friend will find himself watching the movie for no reason.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is mlm concept "too hard to explain"?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mlmers will not tell their friend what they are doing until they step into the company or until the last minute of their presentation. Ok, I admit there are some which do before they step into the company but not VE and these are very few in number.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go to mocca, VE most favourite recruitment website. How many of VE people there really state the truth nature of their business. They even give a fix range of salary even through you can be earning nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They also use lies to recruit people to their network. They will tell you how easily it is to earn etc. But come to think of it, mlm has a less than 5% success rate for those who joined, if it's so easy, why the high drop-out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If someone drop out from mlm, they will not tell you and just keep their mouth shut. If you ask why this guy or that girl is no longer around, they will tell you busy with school work, NS etc or tell you this person actually come in but when you weren't around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one like to be tricked or misled. Even if a retail shop trick or misled people, everyone is going to talk bad about it.</p>

              <p>wait i shall just say about the points you gave ok?<br>instead of other factors.</p>
              <p>at least the restaurant dont claim that they are modeled in a way that they would sell products cheaper than the rest of the places such as teh mamashop.</p>
              <p>u see. VE introduces their products in such a way that they are the cheapest in the market. Why? they claim that the mlm model helps to drive down prices and such.</p>
              <p>however how much are they selling? 3-4x of market price.<br><br>I am sure there are much much more detoxification products outside. Their prices have been severely marked up due to several factors, however do you actually realise that their prices are still lower than VE?''</p>
              <p>Is there such a product from VE which could genuinely "cleanse ur
              liver and kidney and at the same time detox your
              body without taking any drugs and able to
              find testimonials on people who recovered from kidney failure,
              cancers, diabetics, tumour, hepatitis B, Stones.And its able to
              help people even in last stage cancer and AIDs." From scientifical reports and proofs? If you are trying to promote your water system again, then diamond water is lousier than it? they also claim to detoxify..</p>
              <p>Why not i say it this way.. one guy just eats some sweet like eclipse mints every day, he has aids, cancer diabetics and whatever... den he recovered just one day.. he gave the testimony that says eclipse mints saved his life or whatever, do you really think testomonials are fair?<br><br>The service part.. is there any mlmers who are pleased to receive a call from a customer who had bought products from them and answer all their Qns and GENUINELY help them? If a customer calls you every day for help and such.. would u help? i mean every day from a month.. and you have no time already.. whould you prioritize her problems? or would u rather make a sale at that time?</p>
              <p>you are not paid for giving services. could you even match up to the services that people in best denki service sector?</p>
              <p>Let me tell you something in large megastores in singapore , even if your warrenty expires, they would still help you in your problems , free-of-charge.. i have gotten free of charge services even after my warrenty before.. why? because of people like us they get their pay. they need work to do or they wont get that job..the workers would most likely extend your warrenty for free coz its the repairs they do that gives them the money.</p>
              <p>In a mlm, you have just simply too many roles to play. its impossible to perfect all of them to match the standards of any genuine bussinesses.</p>
              <p>you claim that you are an entrepreneur. however you work just like a worker with no basic pay. You all dont know the main strategy of being in a bussiness. it is honesty without honesty.. your bussiness would be doomed to fail. <br><br>btw i wasnt in VE at any point of my life.. my impression of MLMS used to be veyr good until i went to VE for the "orientation". there i got lied to many times .</p>
              <p>mlmers always simplify everything disregarding all moral etics , if this is in the real world, those so called entrepreneurs from VE start their own bussiness and sell things teh way they do in VE , they are doomed to fail. <br>WHY? because they are not selling to their peers and relatives or their relative's and peer's friends any more.. they are selling to unknown people would what to get the best specs for the best price..</p>

              <p><strong>Now maybe you might be thinking, "but i can dispose it and get a new one". But your health can't right. Try dispose your lungs and heart.</strong></p>
              <p>After this part there will be another thing that comes up to alot of people. 'Theres so many health products out there why do we have to support VENTURE ERA''s product. Very simple if you can find <strong>ANY products which can cleanse ur liver and kidney and at the same time detox your body without taking any drugs and able to find testimonials on people who recovered from kidney failure, cancers, diabetics, tumour, hepatitis B, Stones.And its able to help people even in last stage cancer and AIDs.</strong> Brother find me one that can help in all this fields and its cheaper than VENTURE ERA products. Even if its $o.5o difference i also buy from you.</p>
              <p>Lets just talk about this will do. All the best..</p>

              <p>VE product is overpriced, but so what? So is McDonalds.</p>
              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p>You are already brainwashed in VE. I was in the same situation before until I woke up. You try and think for yourself using logic rather than just listening to those 'seniors'.</p>
              <p>1st you want to talk about service. VE service is not that great that its worth thousands of dollars!</p>
              <p>You quote, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"How do you measure time, sincerity, passion with money."</span></p>
              <p>Come on la, sincerity? The reason why you people keep calling your customers is not that you care a great deal about them. The thing is, you want referral customers from them!<strong> How is that sincerity?</strong></p>
              <p>You quote, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Now maybe you might be thinking, "but i can dispose it and get a new one". But your health can't right. Try dispose your lungs and heart."</span></p>
              <p>Is there hard evidence that if I use VE products I wont get heart &amp; lung disease at all? If I consume whatever calcium you have and use the magnetic bed, I wont have get lung cancer, heart disease etc?</p>
              <p>From your last paragraph, are you sure that VE product can treat/cure such sickness/diseases?</p>
              <ul>
              <li><em>How can someone with kidney failure recovered from using VE products without having to go for a kidney transplant?</em> I didnt know that VE product could 'revive' back both destroyed kidneys? If so, why are there still many kidney failure patients going for dialysis, which is more expensive than VE product? Why arent doctors all over the world recommending VE products?</li>
              <li>Diabetic? <em>Recover from diabetes?</em> Once you are a diabetic, you will always be a diabetic! So by using VE product, diabetics does not need to eat their medication? You have got to be kidding me!</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I wont comment on hepatitis B as I do not have sufficient knowledge about it.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Cancers and tumours? How can you be so sure that VE product are the ones that recover these patients? So, those who doesnt use VE products will die of cancer or their tumour cannot be treated?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Before you claim that VE products are 'miracle' products, please do your research on all these! Know about the diseases first before commenting. Ask yourself these questions first. Dont just believe what VE seniors say, you dont even know if its the truth!</p>
              <p>By the way, all those testimonials, are they really realiable? Those who give the testimonials, are they the only customers that use VE products? How about the ones that are dissatisfied with the products? No testimonial? Think for yourself la bro.</p>

              <p>Haha guys, please read carefully and closely. Don't be too fast with ur words, i didn't said it will cure or treated. Be realistic bro, today if you go for operation, doctors will never tell you its a 100% success. What ever you see on commercials they will never tell you its 100%, but thats the fact that it helps. Bro seriously go read up on books please.</p>
              <p>lmao..</p>
              <p>Go to bookstores health section, in MPH or Kinokuniya( i think its spelled like tat) haha. Go and read up.</p>
              <p>Haha frankly speaking the more negative people in the market the more happy i will become. To alot of people they might be thinking ' wa! Doesn't tat means alot of people won't get it from me! Wa very difficult to do' .</p>
              <p>Haha to me, i'm simple, people don't do it, i do it, when People negative, they will limit themselves from executing, and starts to give excuses and pushing the blame away. And here comes a chance. First of all i know products work and i study them, and the good thing is theres alot of people who never study about it and comment on it or heard from others. What i got to do is to educate on how the product can help, and service, isn't that what me as a salesman should do. Second of all teach customers how to use it and fortnightly check on how customers doing, still getting use to the products.. etc, visit them occasionally, buy something for them. The best thing is when your customer call you back and thank you. It feels really good. It double up their confidence in you, they are more than willing to assist you.</p>
              <p>1) they trust your product.</p>
              <p>2) they trust your servicing [don't think wrongly <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> i'm clean, what they know is serious and your not doing this half-hearted]</p>
              <p>They will spread word of mouth and thats how your system kick start.</p>
              <p>Now thats what i call servicing. If you do it right its a no problem. This will be a cycle, and not just customer get it once from you and leave it there. You need to put in effort.</p>
              <p>Three kinds of people who will never get this right:</p>
              <p>1) People who refuse to execute and remains the same.</p>
              <p>2) People always feels that he/she is right or never even do it properly.</p>
              <p>3) People who wants something in return for whatever they have contributed.</p>
              <p>This is the technique what people in the sales&amp;marketing are doing. Read books on how people around the world are doing sales. That is why people are doing well in sales and some are not. This is not just pure luck or having a good market. I've seen people doing it with 'Yellow Pages', Co-operate sales. Get this clear its not who the person you look for, its the time, sincerity, passion that the person is having when they go out for appointments.</p>
              <p>If this way of doing is wrong, then seriously you will be penalising people all over the world who are making it big. I know you are very rational in what you have in mind. But slowly this debate will show how irrational a person can  be. Its already very obvious, when everyone in the thread is dwelling upon 'overpricing', 'law thingy',etc.</p>
              <p>Good Luck readers</p>

              <p>Readers remember this,</p>
              <p>Service don't talk about trend, comparison with other companies, it has no competitors, it has nothing got to do with whatever kind of products one is dealing with. </p>
              <p>Its has to do with only one thing call 'human relation'.</p>
              <p>That is why Big companies they focus alot on service, because this a very important step to retain a customer. If you're in a business then you got to know how to service a person. Haha<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>That is why i narrow it down to service.</p>

              <p>Studentofite a.k.a Goosebump, if you want to create a clone, at least not make it so obvious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't see what argument there is here by stating your somewhat irrelevant points. You are skirting the major issue of deceptive marketing and selling, overpricing, agressive pyramid-like recruitment on the pretext of sales service. Yet, you still ironically speak of rationality. But I'm sure it's not tactics we're not already used to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, I like and I admire your approach to closing a sale, customer centricity and good after-sales. That is something every salesman should strive for. Some agents mean well and are genuine and they're indeed a rare breed. Great qualities and ideals being exploited in the wrong environment is something else to be said though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I don't see why you need to use warped analogies like using people with professionalism and expertise providing a service in environments where claims are mostly legitimately backed by research vis-a-vis dubious scientific claims. But these comparison games is not what i'm interested in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When i read your post it seemed to me, when selling a product or service, you think it right to "whack" people unreasonably while claiming it is justified by providing good service. But that's a good thing isn't it? Since you say you cannot put a price to sincerity and commitment it would be jolly fine to inflate any arbitrary value to suit your whims huh? I pray not though, in case people everywhere from retailers to cashiers will be demanding exhorbitant fees for quality customer services they cannot substantiate or quantify.You know, I don't think it's fair to say there is sub-standard or lack of sales service whatsoever before and after a transaction between mlm/non-mlm entities because this is subjective and it's not for one person to speak for the community who provide any kind of sales service. I hope your over-emphasis on good sales service does not mask the focus on the value of the product itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To justify that extreme prices for products that do not boast any cutting-edge technology or offically endorsed by any leading scientific papers or journals (as opposed to anecdotes) would really undermine companies with legitimately developed products don't you think?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is only one aspect which I'll address for now since I'm tired. There is much to be said about the manner of conducting VE's business and their culture, which is no less pertinent to a rational person, which I will kindly leave for another time. </p>
