Sigh, it's this greed in u guys that make u guys believe MLM blindly. I bet when the 'managers' talked to u abt BMW and 5 fig salary before the age of 30, ur eyes lit up immediately, right?<br><br>Do u even realise how little the percentage of success rate? Do u even earn a consistent $2k a mth in MLM? Once u run out of immediate friends and families to market ur products to, in the near future, who do u rely on to sell ur products, to sustain ur monthly income?<br><br>Dun be fooled, as others say, u're warming the seats of ur managers. They're probably the ones who're driving their BMWs by 26 cos' they're the pioneers of the company, and while u idolize them and hope to be like them someday, u're foolishly allowing them to make use of u, cos' by now, they'd run out of their immediate contacts to push sales, and they making use of recruitment and ur extended network to continue their business.<br><br>And dun be foolish. U call this entrepreneurship? U can't even type properly in English, and u wanna be an entrepreneur? Sure, education doesn't necessarily grant u riches in future. At least, it's still a mandatory tool for success. How are u gonna type reports, business proposals, and deal and converse with ur clients comfortably in ur broken 'Engrish'? Wake up la, there's no shortcut to riches and success, even in MLM.<br><br>In the meantime, go find out the real meaning behind entrepreneurship. To me, having to rely on unmarketed and unknown products to earn money isn't exactly the entrepreneurship I'm looking for. The manufacturers probably can't afford media advertisement and mainstream distributors, which is why they rely on private MLM companies as their medium of sales.<br><br>Entrepreneurship is abt starting from scratch, such as Bill Gates in the early stages of him and his team designing Windows. It's all abt innovation, how confident u are in the product u've created and how bold u are to promote it, without external financial help, where u're not afraid to lose it all and restart again. I dun see that in MLM. And pls dun refer to urself as an entrepreneur if u're at the bottom of the MLM corporate ladder. No, the first stage of whatever 'manager' rank they give u doesn't count, cos' the 'manager' I met is merely a young punk who haven't even tasted the soil in NS. It's just a make-believe term used by those high ranking managers, to make u feel good and continue to work blindly for them.<br></div>

VE is just a place where people hang around there , wasting time. Dreaming that they can earn bucks throught their friends and relatives. When all their contacts are used up, they start targeting young students who are looking for part-time. Using cunning and underhand means, VE ' managers ' told the students that they are short-listed for an interview which end up using lies to recuit them. This is what 'managers' in VE told their down line to do because they are despo for money. and also, people think that VE is a place that makes money? showing some videos about 2 guy in cartoon? thats stupid and dumb. brainwashing technique. just wake up please! you can say whatever you want, praising VE or what.

Those "MANAGERS" "EARNING $2K PER MONTH" are just sitting down there, advicing their downline and continue brainwash them. never to let them go. i tell you this because i was once in VE. I TOTALLY HATE THE WAY THEY TARGETING PEOPLE! SO SICKENING! GROSS ME COMPLETELY AND I HATE THAT PLACE! VE is just a wolf in sheep's clothing. IT WILL BE EXPOSED ONE DAY! IT WILL! AND IT WILL BE THE DAY WHEN THOSE PEOPLE IN VE ARE SEEING THE REAL LIGHT!<br><br>STOP YOUR LIES AND DESIRES FOR MONEY IN UNDER MEAN WAYS! YOU WAN MONEY? EARN IT IN A DOWN-TO-EARTH WAY! REPENT BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!</div>

Try to learnt as much as you can from your working experience. No point joining quick rich schemes because you don do well in your job. Instead try to improve on yourself by keep upgrading and change your working attitude.<br><br>2 Start a decent biz: Nowadays, you can still start a biz although shop rentals are high. <span style="color: red;">Doing MLM is not biz, but marketing or pyramid scam. Only the owner of the MLM company is doing "biz". </span>Due to high rental &amp; other biz cost, one can start biz with a group of friends or relative.<br><br>3 You can also do online biz online or do parallel import biz as low startups. These methods really take away the following cost: rental, distributor, labour cost, etc. Although MLM claims it took away some of these cost but cost going towards many line of uplines. Most of the time, goods from MLM cost many times more than market price<br><br>4 Do some investment: Invest in shares, stocks, property, unit trust.. etc.<br>However, earn throught investment can be riskly but need to manage risk if you are into it. Do your homework &amp; reseach before investing your $. <span style="color: red;">[color=red]Don't pour all your $ into investment or loan $ to invest</span>[/color]<br><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span><br><br>Alessandro Tan, its good to leave mlm. In mlm, many ppl are not able to earn back the $ they invest . Most of them lose $ and some even go into debts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> ask my friend who is a mm of ve.<br><br>he told me tat casetrust n case are diff thing.it's under active members there.<br><br>if possible,i ask him 2 pass me the website if he's free.<br><br>Since u both know ve ,u sure know their history.<br><br>they been for 7 yrs.Let say their so-called case certi is fake n they'd<br><br>saying<br><br>that they had dis certi for the past 7 yrs<br><br>pple/customer n etc should<br><br>sued ve long time ago n case should had been alerted by dis fake<br><br>certi which the company had!!!!<br><br>If even they hide the fact that they're being sued.They couldn't<br><br>hide it 4ever,it's only a matter of time.how come in recent yrs or past yrs,<br><br>case or etc nvr do anything about it--&gt;Like case should had a list of<br><br>blacklisted company list in their website or put it in newspper.Y now still have<br><br>not,right???I hope u understand wat i mean!!!!!!!! </strong><br><br>Who knows what they used to cover it up? If they are under CASE, why they did not appear in the list of companies? Leading people misunderstand or in fact VE really does not have certification of CASE.<br><br><strong>AlessandroTan you better brush up on your English. It sucked.</strong><br><br>In short about the average families, they even have difficulites in their average life or i say financial problem. and you guys who doing MLM still 'persuading' them to buy. First, you brainwashed their kids. Next, you guys went their house and show all those things to their parents. i know you guys said, it is best benefitting one's family and it is more of sharing about the products then selling. This is just cover-up. Trying to deny when others are saying you are trying to sell to them, trying to brainwash the kids out there. Am i right to say that?<br><br><strong>Dun 4get that s'poreans led a busy lifestyle.majority does not had the time 2 exercise.so they will reply health products.<br><br>As u know that majority of S'porean are beginning 2 be health-consciense.<br><br>Furthemore,s'pore will becoming an aging population in future,wat does<br><br>singporeans need most during that period of time,health care n health products. </strong><br><br>This is just part of MLM's tactic to promote their products. Who don want to sell the products? They have 1000 ways to say things about the world. Am i right to say that? i want to sell you things, of course will boast about how great my product works and the demands in economy. Aiming at all the weak points of the family, like doing fact finds. Finding out who in the family have illness and then persuading the family to get the product for their elderly. Am i right to say that? In the end, it is still money you VE/MLM are targeting at.<br><br><strong>agree that $$$ play a part.If they do purchase health product,it's also 4<br><br>their own gd.i mean they can benefit from the product.<br><br>if u purchase health products from osim n etc,they also make $$$$$!!!!!!!<br><br>there4,win-win situation 4 both parties.<br><br>anyway,we persuade pple 2 buy not by begging!!!!!!!!</strong><br><br>Who don't know? got money or not? you pay for me? $2k you think everyone can buy ah? don say for what long-term usage. comparing seeing doctor than using the products. It is two different issues. Using VE products does not make you invulerable against illness. Please get it clear before using this to lie again!<br><br><strong>I also BELIEVE IN EDUCATION.Nothing's impossible.Some pple study is just 4<br><br>that "pper"!!!!!!!!<br><br>it's one of the 5C.That certi also play a part in making $$$ IN FUTURE.<br><br>That certi also determine yr pay n position.<br><br>The better the certi is,the more $$ n better position u will earn<br><br>Frankly speaking,We also reply on that pper 2 earn $$$.</strong><br><br>At least i have a diploma or degree showing others i have completed my studies. VE got certificate? "Degree of Venture Era" ? Teaching us how to Venture in the new Era? lols<br><br><strong>however,if u depend a certi 2 retire early n rich,it's hardly nowadays with rising cost!!!!!!!!<br><br>erm.may i ask u that osim salemen n insurance salemen earn through<br><br>commission based or fixed salary with commssion???If they earn<br><br>through commission based,it's just the like agents in ve.There4,it's<br><br>still consider a job.As long as it not illegable n not against the conscience,<br><br>I'll consider it as an a down-to-earth job!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Agree that greed can turn 1 in2 evil person!!!!!!!!!</strong><br><br>But at least i am doing a fixed-paid job, having my certification. What if VE had sales going down? or some unknown causes in the products? Who knows what will happened. At least i have my cert, i still young and can go else where to look for job. And in VE? The "Certificate of Venture Era" leads you no where? MLM don't not make money forever,  mind you. Working in a fixed 9 to 5 company still earn as much. Stop brainwashing the kids please. Don ruined them. <strong>They are Singapore's future.</strong><br><br>I agreed with RachelX. Doing business of course has to be decent. VE is doing it decently or not. All of us knew about it.</div>
