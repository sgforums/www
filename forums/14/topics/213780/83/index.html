              <p>Well, if I can easily earn more than being in MLM or VE, or
              easily find a job that pays more, or easily start my own tuition
              business part time that pays more as well, any good reason why I
              should join?</p>
              <p>And from what I read about all the MLMers that come here,
              including your posts, I can conclude that I wouldn't want to be
              associated with this bunch of people at all.</p>
              <p>I rather do things that confirm will work, and already tried and
              tested by others. Leverage on others' experience. This is similar
              to you concluding that Heroin is bad because of scientific proof
              =&gt; that's concrete evidence.</p>
              <p>Why go and try something that has no concrete evidence that it
              will work? Many things in this world, or many people in this world,
              went big with things that are already working... I.e. Google was
              not the first search engine in this world... Nor was Nokia the

              <p>Yes exactly. I am saying that Venture Era should be something you try. Do it forever or not I do not know yet. I am saying that there are many guys that come out of jc and have to go NS, or people that only have a few months to commit to a job, and VE is a good option for them. <br><br>and Sunshine Empire made it to the news cause of their scheme. If VE made it to the news cos of something you would definitely have heard of it.</p>

              <p>You want to try is your problem. I won't recommend joining MLM at all to any guys before their NS; it's a lousy option. From what you said, you earned less. And you can't commit after that. Then what for? When in NS, you are back to square 1, but you have less cash than others who did it the traditional route. And there are much more forumers here who had already said that you don't learn much in VE.</p>
