              <p>No one has answered why if magnetic therapy works, why aren't hospitals, hospices, and other medical institutions using it?</p>
              <p>Why aren't sports physiotherapists using it? If you are paying your athlete a few million dollars, you need him fit and healthy at every game. Even if you believe there's some vast medical conspiracy to suppress knowledge of the effectiveness of magnetic therapy (which is total nonsense), there is no way that sports medical practitioners would not use it if it worked. Sports physicians already do a lot of things that border on unethical. Eg. Shooting the athletes up with pain killers.</p>

              <p>To ATan...</p>
              <p>first.. its ion HAVE not HAD benefits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe i would emphasize. that many Venture Era agents quit school to pursure their "DREAMS" and end up speaking and typing in poor english.</p>
              <p>Obviously this is due to people in VE that are chinese educated. a few names.. like Danny teow, Ho shun jie,  Steven Ho, Christopher Zhou, Bryan Soh.</p>
              <p>They speak terrible English. Btw. who buys a almost 20 year old BMW for a car achiever. an ugly fuck.</p>
              <p>Yes he drives an SLK, yes hes talks are very entertaining. but the english thing still matters.</p>
              <p>If people everyone in Venture Era can learn to speak like Dewey Ho, then your sales will probably increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>okay back to Atan. i dont care if the ions benefit me or not. Cant you see im trying to bring the message across that you will never be assured a fixed salary in MLM.</p>
              <p>i know certain individual's accounts have been frozen because they are not active. whats the bull with residual income.</p>

              <p>first.. its ion HAVE not HAD benefits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe i would emphasize. that many Venture Era agents quit school to pursure their "DREAMS" and end up speaking and typing in poor english.</p>
              <p>Obviously this is due to people in VE that are chinese educated. a few names.. like Danny teow, Ho shun jie,  Steven Ho, Christopher Zhou, Bryan Soh.</p>
              <p>They speak terrible English. Btw. who buys a almost 20 year old BMW for a car achiever. an ugly fuck.</p>
              <p>Yes he drives an SLK, yes hes talks are very entertaining. but the english thing still matters.</p>
              <p>If people everyone in Venture Era can learn to speak like Dewey Ho, then your sales will probably increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>okay back to Atan. i dont care if the ions benefit me or not. Cant you see im trying to bring the message across that you will never be assured a fixed salary in MLM.</p>
              <p>i know certain individual's accounts have been frozen because they are not active. whats the bull with residual income.</p>

              <p>Hahaha.... Hey elementalangel.... I'm no clone here... I purposely shoot tat question earlier to see whoever VE personnel out there who wanna ans my questions. I wanna see wat they gotta say... I too believe tat VE is a crap company. All those fake faces saying tat they dun "sell" the product. All those phone calls saying they wanna share knowledge abt boi life science... how lame is tat. No matter wat they say, whether it is sharing of knowldege, sharing of watever crap, the main thing is they wanna close the deal and make money. The more appoinent the better, cos higher chance of making money.</p>
              <p>N 1 more thing... The trinity plan tat i learned abt it, the 3,6, 9.... Wats the big deal abt tat. So wat if u manage to complete the 3,6,9... Imagine if u nvr contact ur bmt frens, army frens, primary sch frens, or watever frens u got... for such a long time.... N the managers ask u to call them up to join u to make up the trinity plan.... I tell u, u'll chase them away and they'll avoid u for sure... Becos of VE, ur friendships become sour.  Just a matter of time, this 3,6,9 can collapse and turn into ashes...</p>
              <p>N also, I wanna say this to 1 of the BGM. I'll always remember he say this, "y bother to work 8am-5pm, tire out yourself working long hours..." Hey, VE rely on this 8-5 people to make money and buy product from them. W/o this 8-5 people, think VE can become wat it is today.... Better wake up your idea VE. Dun look down at these 8-5 people. At least they earn a decent salary.. N they got bonus salary to enjoy. Wat abt u VE?</p>

              <p>agreed..</p>
              <p>one more point... the bgm say why work 8-5.. however.. from what i can see.. the VE people work 24 hrs a day... day time trying to persuade ppl to join.. at night spam their frenster account and such... and yet earn merely 600 dolars a month... there are simply too many distributors in this company...</p>
