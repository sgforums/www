              <p>Firstly, you do not know if it is overpriced. Find me another firm that sells the exact same air system as VE and then I will judge if it is overpriced. So i did not contradict myself as I did not say that VE items = overpriced. It might, it might not be. I said this. "Even if the products are overpriced, what can I do?" I am opening myself to the possibility that it is overpriced. </p>

              <p>Now is your turn to be really hard working. Out of these 84 pages, elementalangel once put up lots of links regarding the overpriced of VE's products. I think pages of 30-65? Or consult elementalangel for the info. If you really want to know, then ask him personally.</p>
