              <p>i read your posts on the VE thread... sad to say that your experience in VE was not a pleasant one... However, VE now is very much different... If you dont mind, why not you come down to our office and take it look? It's now its located at MDIS building near Eunos MRT... VE now is much better, one example is our building is much bigger and we have better space and facilities for us to use...There's also an addition to our products range that can benefit other peoples quality of life our agents too have grown in numbers... ...</p>
              <p>I gurantee you that if you join me, you'll grow into a rational thinking, matured young man... And you too have a chance to earn some money for yourself, and benefit others...</p>
              <p>Why not you come down and just take a look... You have no obligation to join me... Just give me a chance to prove my worth... I'll try my very best to keep it all under 1 hour... Your time wont be wasted, I can gurantee you that...</p>

                  Look at what he said. Use relationship and trust to sell products. Even enyouth people know that's the reason why some mlmers end up losing all friends. Are you sure this is what your manager taught you? No wonder VE has a worse repulation than some other bigger companies.

              <p>Haha. They claim they have 5 figure earnings right? Ok fine. I challenge all the downlines to stop selling for a month, or 2 weeks also can. A week also can. Get everyone you know under the same upline, to stop selling for a week. See how much their income is.</p>

              <p>actually the outcome is obvious... they just cant selll... i guess after you work in a mlm for an extended period of time.. you wont be able to sell as much.. your contacts would all be drained. you can only depend on your downlines for pay. look at all the old timers at VE. who is actually actively selling? no one . because they have no more referals and contacts already. aside from their customers who buy small products regularly, no one would buy anything from them already. all they have left is their downlines for support.</p>
              <p>Forget about residual pay. VE works in a way where if a person is in the same level as you, you wont get any pay. other than their managers fund and such..</p>
