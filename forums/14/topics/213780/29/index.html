              <p>Dear EA,</p>
              <p>If you think that I am backing up enquires, I actually dont, it's my own personal perspective. Most of the time, I do agree with him. But at times, I dont. I am not backing enquires, I am backing up my own perspective. It would only be comfortable for you if I have the same perspective of you isnt it?</p>
              <p>And if you think no one of the sane mind would join VE, you are wrong. I am in the sane mind and I did join VE. So, only crazy ppl join VE? Isnt this statement ridiculous? You would say that no sane ppl would join VE because ONLY YOU think so.(maybe a few too) Why not you phone IMH and tell them to get VE ppl as they are 'crazy'...</p>
              <p>Yes, VE have no proper pay. And its commission based and risky. That is one of the reasons why I join mlm. The more I work hard for it(the smart way), the more I earn. I personally like to take risk.</p>
              <p>One more thing, I do NOT believe in magnetic therapy, but I do love the ionic calcium and the air series. I dont sell magnetic products, but I do sell the others.</p>
              <p>I would humbly retract back the statement that Anti VE ppl have no proof. But I have to say, MOST anti-VE ppl have no proof too...</p>
              <p>In my previous post, I did commented that enquires too is childish. Please read that part back. I expected you to be the bigger man.</p>
              <p>On the car part, its more of perspective, so car achievers can buy only 1st hand bmw cars is it? Personally, I wont. But if he wants to buy 20 yr old bmw 2nd hand car, its not really my problem. It's his car.</p>

              <p>then why didnt you scold enquiries for labeling me as childish? instead of double assuring me that his english sux you turned to say that i should not do so....</p>
              <p>seriously.. it does matter if its first or second hand.. if you laugh at others for driving a honda civic or wadeva lousier cars.. 70k range... when u buy a second hand bmw which would cost less in the attempt to win others over and join u.. that does matter</p>

PS: i wont tell C about it.. dun wori..  but remember raw is war...</p>
              <p>Name : Lili<br> <br> Age : 24<br> <br> Place of origin: PRC, Shenyang<br> <br> Looks : 7.5 ( She has this next door gal look which most guys simply
              adore. She’s certainly the type of gal that would have yr mother
              grinning the whole night like Bro Raintree if you brought her back
              home. She has this shy look around her and her sweet smile is simply
              captivating.)<br> <br> Figure : 6.5 (She’s considered quite petite for a northern gal. No
              doubt her skin is not that smooth and slightly tanned but that’s not a
              major issue.)<br> <br> Boobs : 8 ( This must be one of her biggest assets. Lili is a must for
              boobs lover for she commands a pair of soft and succulent 38B boobs on
              that petite body of hers. Dark brown sensitive nipples included.<br> <br> BBBJ : 8 ( She was quite reluctant to provide bbbj initially but
              eventually was persuaded to do so by me. She has a hardworking style
              whereby she will work on yr head followed some strong sucking before
              proceeding to some ball licking while stroking yr penis. I especially
              enjoyed her ball licking skill whereby she will lick and twirl her
              tongue all over your balls, occasionally taking them gently inside her
              mouth to give you that sudden yet enjoyable sensation.<br> <br> Frenching : 6 ( Not much of a frencher but still can kiss a bit. Maybe
              she’s still not used to me but will work on that should I rtf.<br> <br> Painting : 8 ( Confirm can be painted. She has this very neatly trimmed
              pussy which makes it all the easier to me to paint. Her pussy slit
              isn’t that wide and comes with no smell. As I started working on the
              clit and pussy lips, her juices started flowing ( and I mean really
              flowing, m8!) especially when I used my finger on her. Throughout the
              painting session, she was moaning lightly and jerking and twitching her
              body in respond to every stroke of my tongue.<br> <br> FJ : 8 (Being young does has its advantages. Lili has a tight pussy
              which you can immediately feel clamping onto your dick upon entry. I
              recommend her being on top to best enjoy that. She is definitely very
              hardworking and accommodating when it comes to a FJ. While being on
              top, she will really rock and grind her pussy against my dick along
              with some plunging action once in a while. I best enjoyed the part when
              I put her legs over my shoulders and inserted into her. For this is the
              moment whereby I not only get to hear her sexy and light moaning and I
              also get to see her facial expression ( eyes slightly closed plus
              biting of lips while bonking her).<br> <br> Attitude : Very good and no rush. The feeling one can get from her is just like bonking your next door neighbour's syt daughter.<br> <br> RTF : Yes <br> <br> Damages : $60 (FJ) + $10 (tips) + $10 (room)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>service is good ... trust me.. better than V or C.. lol... enjoy bro...</p>

              <p><strong>Career</strong> is a term defined by the <a title="Oxford English Dictionary" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> as an individual's "course or progress through life (or a distinct
              portion of life)". It usually is considered to pertain to remunerative
              work (and sometimes also formal <a title="Education" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education">education</a>).</p>
              <p>A career is traditionally seen as a course of successive situations that make up a person's worklife. One can have a <a title="Sport" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport">sporting</a> career or a <a title="Music" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music">musical</a> career without being a professional <a title="Sportsperson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson">athlete</a> or <a title="Musician" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician">musician</a>, but most frequently "career" in the <a title="20th century" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century">20th century</a> referenced the series of jobs or positions by which one earned one's money. It tended to look only at the past.</p>
              <p>As the idea of personal choice and self direction picks up in the
              21st century, aided by the power of the Internet and the increased
              acceptance of people having multiple kinds of work, the idea of a
              career is shifting from a closed set of achievements, like a
              chronological <a title="Résumé" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9">résumé</a> of past jobs, to a defined set of pursuits looking forward. In its broadest sense, career refers to an individual’s <a title="Employment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment">work</a> and life roles over their lifespan.</p>
              <p>In the relatively static <a title="Society" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society">societies</a> before <a title="Modernism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism">modernism</a>, many workers would often inherit or take up a single lifelong position (a place or <a title="Role" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role">role</a>) in the <a title="Workforce" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce">workforce</a>, and the concept of an unfolding career had little or no meaning. With the spread during <a class="mw-redirect" title="The Enlightenment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enlightenment">the Enlightenment</a> of the idea of <a title="Social progress" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_progress">progress</a> and of the habits of <a title="Individualism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism">individualist</a> self-betterment, careers became possible, if not expected.</p>
              <p><a title="Career Assessments" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_Assessments">Career Assessments</a> are tests that come in a variety of forms and rely on both quantitative
              and qualitative methodologies. Career Assessments can help individuals
              identify and better articulate their unique interests, values, and
              skills. <a class="mw-redirect" title="Career counselors" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_counselors">Career counselors</a>, <a class="new" title="Executive coaches (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Executive_coaches&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">executive coaches</a>, <a class="new" title="Career development centers (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Career_development_centers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">career development centers</a>, and <a class="new" title="Outplacement companies (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Outplacement_companies&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">outplacement companies</a> often administer career assessments to help individuals focus their
              search on careers that closely match their unique personal profile.</p>
              <p><a class="new" title="Career counseling (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Career_counseling&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Career counseling</a> advisors assess people's interests, personality, values and skills, and
              also help them explore career options and research graduate and
              professional schools. Career counseling provides one-on-one or group
              professional assistance in exploration and decision making tasks
              related to choosing a major/occupation, transitioning into the world of
              work or further professional training. The field is vast and includes
              career placement, career planning, learning strategies and student
              development.</p>
              <p>By the late 20th century a plethora of choices (especially in the range of potential <a title="Profession" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profession">professions</a>) and more widespread <a title="Education" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education">education</a> had allowed it to become <a title="Fashion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion">fashionable</a> to plan (or design) a career: in this respect the careers of the career
              counsellor and of the career advisor have grown up. It is also not
              uncommon for adults in the late 20th/early 21st centuries to have dual
              or <a title="Multiple careers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_careers">multiple careers</a>,
              either sequentially or concurrently. Thus, professional identities have
              become hyphenated or hybridized to reflect this shift in work ethic.
              Economist <a title="Richard Florida" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Florida">Richard Florida</a> notes this trend generally and more specifically among the "<a title="Creative class" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_class">creative class</a>."</p>

              <p>EA,</p>
              <p>You were being childish(though your intention may not be).  The way your posts were written seems childish, which enquires replied childishly too, especially when you are the one posting... And no doubt that your english is better than enquires, but i dont think that its appropriate to condemn him based on his command of english.</p>
              <p>He initially lied that he was in VE, i too condemn such cowardly acts. But not because his command of english is bad. I am not on your side or his. This is my own view of things on what's going on.</p>
              <p>I believe owning a 2nd hand BMW car is alright for a car achiever. He can buy a toy truck for car incentive for all i care... If it's true that he laughs at others for driving other 'lousier' car, then condemn him. If he did laugh at others, it only shows how arrogant he is. ( Is this guy bryan soh?)</p>
              <p>It's true that i can't please everyone. And I am NOT trying to. This is just me... If you think that I am trying to please you, well..... Don't think so highly of yourself... The only person I need to please is just me...</p>

              <p>A <strong>pyramid scheme</strong> is a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Non-sustainable" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-sustainable">non-sustainable</a> <a title="Business model" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model">business model</a> that involves the exchange of <a title="Money" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money">money</a> primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, usually without any <a title="Product (business)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_%28business%29">product</a> or <a title="Service (economics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_%28economics%29">service</a> being delivered. It has been known to come under many guises. Some famous examples including the massive <a title="Albania" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania">Albanian</a> Pyramid Schemes of <a title="1996" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996">1996</a><sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> were technically not Pyramid schemes but <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ponzi schemes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_schemes">Ponzi schemes</a>.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>There are other commercial models using cross-selling such as <a title="Multi-level marketing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing">multi-level marketing</a> (MLM) or <a title="Party plan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_plan">party planning</a> which are legal and sustainable, although there is a significant grey
              area in many cases. Most pyramid schemes take advantage of confusion
              between genuine businesses and complicated but convincing moneymaking <a class="mw-redirect" title="Scam" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam">scams</a>.</p>
              <p>The essential idea behind each scam is that the individual makes
              only one payment, but is promised to somehow receive exponential
              benefits from other people as a reward. A common example might be an
              offer that, for a fee, allows the victim to sell the same offer to
              other people, or receive bonuses through other people they refer. Each
              sale includes a fee to the original seller.</p>
              <p>Clearly, the flaw is that there is no end benefit; the money simply
              travels up the chain, and only the originator (or at best a very few)
              wins in swindling his followers. Of course, the people in the worst
              situation are the ones at the bottom of the pyramid: those who
              subscribed to the plan, but were not able to recruit any followers
              themselves. To embellish the act, most such scams will have fake
              referrals, testimonials, and information.</p>

              <p>Actually, from experience, MLM is more like a disemmination of
              tried and tested methods, spreading downstream from the leader,
              with allowance given to downlines to tweak it to match their style
              and circle of friends.However, what David is, is probably a mirror

              <p>Soul reaper has many meanings... one can be found as such...</p>
              <p><strong>Death</strong> as a sentient entity is a concept that has existed in many societies since the beginning of history. In <a title="Western world" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world">Western cultures</a>, death is often given the name the "<strong>Grim Reaper</strong>", and shown as a skeletal figure carrying a large <a title="Scythe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythe">scythe</a>, and wearing a midnight black gown, robe or cloak with a hood, or sometimes a white burial <a title="Shroud" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud">shroud</a>. Usually when portrayed in the black-hooded gown, his face is not to be seen, but is a mere shadow beneath the hood.</p>
              <p>In some cases, the Grim Reaper is believed to actually cause the
              victim's death, leading to tales that he can be bribed, tricked, or
              outwitted in order to retain one's life. Other beliefs hold that the
              Spectre of Death is only a <a title="Psychopomp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopomp">psychopomp</a>, serving only to guide the deceased to the next world and having no control over the fact of their death.</p>
              <p>second one can be found as such</p>
