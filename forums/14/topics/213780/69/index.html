              <p>Mark my words on this,</p>
              <p>I'll give you 5 years.</p>
              <p>"5 years later, be it you succeed or fail in the company or by
              then you have lost hope or is already hopping around other mlm
              companies, by then you will be a lost soul in the mlm without any
              direction, goal, and are just seeking money, dun care abt it being
              scam or not already."</p>
              <p>Even if you succeed, top end position, you will leave the
              company by then</p>
              <p>VE is already a few years old already, other than negative media
              coverage, there's little to none positive coverage in the media nor
              in the news.</p>
              <p>All i remember was something like a VE/Enyouth (can't confirm on
              the exact company) agent tried to commit suicide some years back
              over failed decisions... ---&gt; that's the most stupid decision
              that I've seen over the years in mlm evolving phrase.</p>
              <p>It's not the company that got the problem in actual fact, it's
              the lack of mangement, admin side which makes the company looks bad
              to worse, wrong building planning etc. In short, it's the people
              that makes the company bad - simply put it, the culture in the
              company is bad.</p>
              <p>No point selling Top-Rated products when the sales agents/ mlm
              distributors only know how to memorize the lines and talk. It's
              just like a lousy salesman/woman trying to sell a top end product
              which is alien to a lot of us without going down for a visit.</p>
              <p>Simpler terms : A Toyota car salesman trying to sell a Ferrai
              car without proper knowledge and trainning. --&gt; if you need more
              info on improvements, you can ask me personnally - feel free to
              ask. (at your current stage and thinking with mlm education
              knowledge, i don't think you'll understand what I mean even if i
              explain it.)</p>
              <p>Layman terms - Lack the human touch. (a very simpler yet
              complexed term)</p>

              <p>Not everyone can succeed in this line.</p>
              <p>It promises too much but deliver too little.</p>
              <p>And there's bad culture and organisation.</p>
              <p>Frankly I haven't heard of any news on the negativity of this company. Would you mind sharing?</p>
              <p>This is what i am here for. Thanks for your advice.</p>

              <p>Yes I understand what you mean. Thanks for your opinions. But
              thus far I haven't seen any good arguments against joining Venture

              claiming that VE doesn't work without any evidence, just like how
              they're demanding evidence to prove that it works. So I'll leave it

              <p>Wrong. It has been proven, like the examples before, that quality was never a factor in these firms, yet they have grown big, they fooled the public, like yourself with the word 'quality'. Yet they go bust or survives as hobbling elephants.</p>

              <p>Which is why i am questioning you. How I know you are not fooled by fake certificates, ambiguous and bombastic uses of terms, irrelevant but yet supportive points?</p>
              <p>I am expecting you, to use little grey matter, and verify these points. Its already ridiculous that you said these are verified and checked by PSB, knowing well PSB or other organisations would not place themselves in a position to support alternative therapies 100%. Even conventional drugs already has problems passing HSA tests.</p>
              <p>You also contradicted yourself by saying these are shown to be of quality, not effective. Means I know these magnets are of 100 gauss but is useless in any treatments or preventive therapies?</p>
              <p>Get your facts right before even presenting them.</p>
