              <p>enquires, I salute u 4 ur bravery to confront flamers in this thread face to face... somemore go alone... However, if u r from VE, why not say so earlier so that some questions that were posted could b answered.</p>
              <p>for elementalangel, same again... Biased opinions.. I shall put it in a metaphor...u r like a 'cop' trying to nab the 'bad guy' in the name of justice. But the thing is, no 'justice' is being done as u have made up ur mind abt the one u haf targeted w/o being objective, as ur mind haf made its own dicision. This case no 'justice' is done thus not being fair and very very one sided.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In ur post, "ITS ONLY NOTHING MORE THAN TAP WATER..." ... R u sure? have u tasted it? make experiments on it? by saying that its merely tap water I doubt that u haf ever been to a VE presentation. Their tap water that have ionic calcium does have different taste depending on ur body condition. my home tap water doesnt have that effect. urs do?</p>
              <p>abt they buy from blaclisted overseas co. ... Pls SHOW PROOF or CREDIBLE links so as we can see it with our own eyes rather from ur posting which shows no facts, but just UR opinions...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being 17, get a life coz even if u flame and flame the co. in this forum what can they do? make sure that ppl wont join? elementalangel postings only make me more eager to join VE myself..</p>

              <p>enquiries, since you said that importing the products in singapore and selling it on my own wont work, can you kindly explain to me? because i just realised that you are a VE member and you have contradicted in the form that you say that i do not know how the company works, so are you admitting that the people buy the product because they
                                          receive the hard sell, and are pressured by their friends and loved

              <p>Abt the product price, i believe there's only one person that u can ask and that person is the CEO. No point asking the agents abt the difference in price they wont know how to answer u... But i think one reason of the "incredible" increase in price is becoz of the agents commission. I am not sure but mayb they do tat coz singapore market quite small so to earn a gd amt of money is to increase in price. But that's wat i think, i also m not sure myself...</p>

              <p>actually if u do the math, 2k+ multiplied by 1.44 is about 3k for 5 air purifyers</p>
              <p>so 3000/5 is 600</p>
              <p>3000-600= 2400</p>
              <p>minus the cost. is 2400</p>
              <p>then the agents get 400 + their commision</p>
              <p>so its 2400-400- commision</p>
              <p>2k- commision is what the company earns... HOW MUCH CAN THE COMISSION GET?!?!?!</p>

              <p>as what i said for the 3rd time, some people here really <strong>inmatured until they can twist and turn my words</strong>. nevermind, i can forgive small boy.</p>
              <p>i'm not working for ve. i'm a <strong>indepentant</strong> distributor. dont you understand how network marketing works? i doubt you know. please read up more before commeting, really making <strong>a fool out of yourself</strong>.</p>
              <p>regarding the water hardness thing. please read the following:</p>

              <p><strong>I had told you to read the official WHO report</strong>. you didnt do your homework and now still dont want to do your homework. you are really waste time here.</p>
              <p><strong>regarding the</strong> <strong>ebay</strong>, i think you can also find playstation and other stuff at much lower price than the retail price. why? use your brain and think la. i really salute you that you can use ebay to present here. then you buy from ebay la! </p>
              <p><strong>regading your claim on ecoquest</strong> being unpopular.. wa.. another big joke! ecoquest is famous in usa for their branded air purification system and are very popular among comsumers. will i say you are a very <strong>unpopular 17 year old kid</strong>? no! because i'm not so childish to make that comment. lol.</p>
              <p><strong>regarding the magnergy</strong>, your claim is another big big joke of the day. please.. i started to have weak tummy! help!!</p>
              <p><strong>regarding overprice</strong>, please la.. what bullshit you talking about. please find me a superior product that sell cheaper than ve products lor. if you dont do <strong>market study and analysis</strong>, just buy all the similiar products and do the <strong>testing yourself</strong>. please dont just quote a brand and claim being superior when you havent do the<strong> testing yourself!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>ve products are very reasonably priced</strong> and can be <strong>even cheaper</strong> than some inferior brand. if you dont know, then go and do your homework again.</p>
              <p>I said for the last time. if you are <strong>sincere to learn</strong> more on network marketing and ve products, i can explain to you when i'm free. if you just want to be critics, then you should learn how to do your homework before presenting your point because you are <strong>wasting people time</strong>!</p>
              <p>you guys are just finding fault in network marketing when you guys are <strong>paying so much money to buy your daily stuff that mark up so high</strong>! network marketing is just a form of <strong>product distribution</strong>, <strong>same as everywhere</strong> you bought your stuff. a <strong>normal car cost $70,000</strong> meh? <strong>a handphone cost $500 when manufacturing cost is only around $20??</strong></p>
              <p>i think your <strong>lack of knowledge</strong> in network marketing make you to misunderstand the whole picture. i suggest you to buy the book, "Network Marketing for <strong>DUMMIES</strong>" to read.</p>
              <p>lastly, for <strong>all the skeptics and critics</strong>, <strong>where are you?????</strong> where is the <strong>redstone</strong>, the poly guy that make so many <strong>untrue claims</strong>? lets meet up tomorrow once and for all. dont hide behind the computer screen and talk big. i'm waiting.</p>

              <p>As what i had said, some people simply are too
                                          <strong>inmatured</strong>. they claim based on <strong>own
                                          assumption</strong> and judgement, so unprofessional. oh ya, i
                                          forget. they are professional in <strong>skepticals</strong>.</p>
              <p>so far, only one person can show something about WHO. good.
                                          however, i strongly suggest you to go to WHO official website and
                                          read up the latest information and updates on Water and Calcium. I
                                          did my homework before but apparently, it seem like you just start
                                          to do your homework with so <strong>irrevelant information</strong> on our <strong>patented</strong> CAL ion.</p>
              <p>on the WHO information you posted,  i think you should read
                                          the <strong>179pages official report</strong> ! the cut out is only
                                          a small little paragraph of the whole report which <strong>support
                                          water hardness</strong> but it seem you didnt do a good homework
                                          and <strong>backfire your claim</strong>. ahahhahaha, great
                                          joke!</p>
              <p>regarding doing our product testing, please do so! i'm sick of
                                          seeing <strong>childish people</strong> who can only comment but
                                          cant even present anything constructive with proof and testing.</p>
              <p>please dont talk about what livehood at stake la, we are
                                          professionals network marketer in the wellness industry and we
                                          arent afraid of anything since we do <strong>nothing
                                          wrong</strong>. you started to make me think that you are just a
                                          small boy who havent come out to see the big world. i doubt you
                                          even serve national service before. LOL.</p>
              <p>I suggest to <strong>meet up</strong> with all the skepticals
                                          here for a coffee. i can go alone, <strong>you guys can gang up
                                          together</strong> to meet me. since now is chinese new year, i'm
                                          <strong>more free to entertain</strong> you guys. hahaa. how about
                                          this coming <strong>tuesday</strong>?</p>
              <p>oh ya, if you guys are not sincere, just wanna be the
                                          <strong>typical skepticals</strong> that only want to talk their

                  you didnt do your homework and now still dont want to do your
                  homework. you are really waste time here.</p>
              <p><strong>regarding the</strong> <strong>ebay</strong>, i think
                  you can also find playstation and other stuff at much lower price
                  than the retail price. why? use your brain and think la. i really
                  salute you that you can use ebay to present here. then you buy

              <p><strong>regading your claim on ecoquest</strong> being

                  their branded air purification system and are very popular among
                  comsumers. will i say you are a very <strong>unpopular 17 year old
                  kid</strong>? no! because i'm not so childish to make that comment.
                  lol.</p>
              <p><strong>regarding the magnergy</strong>, your claim is another
                  big big joke of the day. please.. i started to have weak tummy!
                  help!!</p>
              <p><strong>regarding overprice</strong>, please la.. what bullshit
                  you talking about. please find me a superior product that sell
                  cheaper than ve products lor. if you dont do <strong>market study
                  and analysis</strong>, just buy all the similiar products and do
                  the <strong>testing yourself</strong>. please dont just quote a
                  brand and claim being superior when you havent do the
                  <strong>testing yourself!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>ve products are very reasonably priced</strong> and can
                  be <strong>even cheaper</strong> than some inferior brand. if you
                  dont know, then go and do your homework again.</p>
              <p>I said for the last time. if you are <strong>sincere to
                  learn</strong> more on network marketing and ve products, i can
                  explain to you when i'm free. if you just want to be critics,
                  then you should learn how to do your homework before
                  presenting your point because you are <strong>wasting people
                  time</strong>!</p>
              <p>you guys are just finding fault in network marketing when you
                  guys are <strong>paying so much money to buy your daily stuff that
                  mark up so high</strong>! network marketing is just a form of
                  <strong>product distribution</strong>, <strong>same as
                  everywhere</strong> you bought your stuff. a <strong>normal car
                  cost $70,000</strong> meh? <strong>a handphone cost $500 when
                  manufacturing cost is only around $20??</strong></p>
              <p>i think your <strong>lack of knowledge</strong> in network
                  marketing make you to misunderstand the whole picture. i suggest
                  you to buy the book, "Network Marketing for
                  <strong>DUMMIES</strong>" to read.</p>
              <p>lastly, for <strong>all the skeptics and critics</strong>,
                  <strong>where are you?????</strong> where is the
                  <strong>redstone</strong>, the poly guy that make so many
                  <strong>untrue claims</strong>? lets meet up tomorrow once and for
                  all. dont hide behind the computer screen and talk big. i'm
                  waiting.</p>

              <p>its fine selling items being marked up once... however the cost of those items are less then 200 dolars as said in other forums.... after one mark up ECOQUEST sells the items to INDIVIDUALS at 5 for 2k+... THAT IS AFTER THE PRICE THEY MARKED UP ... imagine if you buy it whole sale? it would be a whole lot cheaper</p>

              <p>Well I think there's a bit of nitpicking here. Does it really matter if the term "working for" or "independant distributor" is used? I think most people understand that when we use the term "working for" in the MLM context, it's not the same as the traditional employer/employee relationship. For example, we may say a taxi driver works for Comfort, but of course, technically he or she does not. Same with a franchisee owner.</p>
              <p>I have no idea what is the hardness of local tap water so I have no comment on that. However, in some places, tap water can be very hard.</p>
              <p>I was a bit curious about the Ecoquest Fresh Air product and found the following two articles:</p>

              <p>I actually don't see the problem with getting price quotes from Ebay. As far as I can tell, Ecoquest doesn't list price quotations on their website. However, Ebay and other shopping metasites like Amazon.com and shopping.com can give you an indicitive price of what people are retailing the product for. As far as I can tell, the highest quotes for the Ecoquest Fresh Air run about USD$900. So this is the price including retail, distributor and manufacteror markup.</p>

              <p>enquires, i assume that u r quite pissed with elementalangel from some of his claims in this thread... chill dude... No point getting pissed at a boy, it's not worth it...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When i think abt the pricing of the products, can ebay be the 'real' price or is it a 2nd hand price?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets say that elementalangels calculation is right, it means that the $2000 is for the co. .. DOes it include shipment price? The office rent, electricity, miscelleneous items etc. If the price is high just to maintain the items stated above, doesnt that mean that many ppl aint buying the products?</p>
              <p>How about the car achievers car allowances, who is paying them? How abt the CEO and the other 'real' employees of VE? who's paying them? Then go events, who's $$$.. Guess that's where the $$$$ goes to...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the links that phaze contributed did give me some rough ideas abt this air product... The 1st link is more on a formal format(like news), the second link is more on opinions, there is are rebuttals that state that the product helps them...</p>

              <p>i think you are the more sincere one, i will explain to you. by the way, i will only be free today to answer all your questions, tomorrow onwards will be busy le.</p>
              <p>regarding the 1st article, they are claiming on the alphine air system from alphine, <strong>not ecoquest</strong>. the alphine is an old system that are <strong>not sold by ecoquest at all</strong>. some people with motives just want to bite the point that one of ecoquest executive is from alphine, just like some people in sgforums <strong>trying to find "bones in an egg"</strong>.</p>
              <p>regarding the 2nd article, its written by a person called joe from San Francisco, California. i think i dont have to explain further on it, right?</p>
              <p><em>the source of the 2 articles is an <strong>independent Web-based</strong> consumer news and resource center. We are <strong>not a government agency</strong>, <strong>not affiliated with any other consumer organization</strong> and not affiliated with any of the corporations whose products are reviewed on our site.</em></p>
              <p>regarding the ebay and amazon, they are sold by distributors, not ecoquest. they can be even selling at a loss, who knows? however, i must stress that every country has different retail price. for example, a fujitsu laptop selling in japan is very much cheaper than in singapore. why? because of <strong>costing into singapore</strong>, <strong>redesign the program</strong> to work for singaporeans instead in japanese, <strong>warranty parts and support</strong> because i dont think you want to ship back to japan for repair etc etc etc. another example is, i can buy a branded t-shirt from batam at <strong>$70</strong> and the same shirt cost <strong>$180+ in singapore</strong>, why? because the <strong>manufuactuer plant</strong> is in batam! i think i explained to you enough why retail price is different in every country and i think you will understand if you have business background. =)</p>
              <p>of course, <strong>for any skeptical out there</strong>, i think you can order just 1 unit of fresh air from USA and tell them to reconfig everything just for you to use in singapore plus warranty, see how much they going to charge you lor. haaha.</p>
              <p>ecoquest fresh air series is state of the art product using space technology to purifiy the air and they are awarded the only space certified air purifier in the whole world by space foundation.</p>

              <p>Well I think there's a bit of nitpicking here. Does it really
