              <p>But I really hate them for trying to recruit young people as

              and here we have people trying to distort their future. And I
              really detest how u play with my feelings about earning big money

              <p>Typically MLM. Using emotional manipulation, hard persuasion etc... I've seen some poor EY girl trying very desperately to shatter my emotion but ended up being shoot upside down by me. Later I've heard this is actually a tactic taught, yes TAUGHT by the company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why they recruit O levelers, cos they are at the crossroads of their lives, and are presumed to need money, have lots of friends, etc.</p>

              <p>Er... people feel they were cheated because they were lied to. Unless of course, you are saying that VE people do not lie or behave in an unethical manner when recruiting new members.</p>
              <p>The dispicable part is that <em>because</em> people want their parents to be able to retire early; <em>because</em> people want to take care of their loved ones; they become emotionally vulnerable to these schemes.</p>
              <p>I do agree that doing bulk sales to kill the business doesn't make sense. That's because people don't buy the products for the sake of getting the product. People buy the product because they receive the hard sell, and are pressured by their friends and loved ones.</p>
              <p>I think people are actually trying to be polite if they say that VE people are naive. That means they are well meaning but deluded. The alternative is to say they are unethical criminals who are well aware of what they are doing and have no qualms about harming others for their own personal gain.</p>

              <p>A vast majority of MLM participants do ALL this, and still do not succeed. Until one day, they wake up and look back, and ask themselves how they could ever have gotten involved in the scheme. But they are still burdened with the financial loss, and more importantly, broken relationships some of which can never be repaired.</p>

              <p>do you guys really think people buy the products only coz of their r/s with their relatives? Its only coz they think that the product is useful + the R/S with their relative as assurance then they dare to buy. Do you guys really think R/S is so impt in a relative that you would fork out 2k+ more for an item? i certainly dont think so. To me i think the relatives part is just for assurance =D and to a certain extent persuation for the relative to buy the item.</p>
              <p>actually i have read enquiries posts in this forum and saw that he has always been supportive in VE in every way =D i am not saying that he is in VE but it is pretty obvious that he is the only one who is defending for VE.. LOL talking about VE when no one who is defending it WOULD EVEN ADMIT that they are from there.. LOL... hahhahahaha</p>

              <p>Ok I understand the spy part lol. Maybe because I didnt add the " on the "good experience" and "lesson learnt"</p>
              <p>But actually there are some things that is really a good lesson. So of their quotes are meaningful :</p>
              <p>"Some succeed, some didnt, so what? (It doesnt matter to you)"</p>
              <p>To enquiries :</p>
              <p>Some neutral and negative arguement:</p>
              <p>Neutral</p>
              <p>VE is not excalty bad, but there are many black sheeps in there who are causing the negatively among us and I have only seen a few good souls (or using the ethical method) in VE, so I cant claim all VE agent is totally bad...</p>
              <p>For example, there is this high rank guy, botak with the name of Mr D, he is a very good speaker and I must admit his skills are very good, and of course the approach he use is different from a normal "job offer to assist manager" approach....</p>
              <p>Negative</p>
              <p>If u are a VE agent, why not just take some time to sit down at the telephone area and heard what those agent calling other is saying.... "job offer, pay of 10 dollars per hour (when there is no basic pay), come a few hours a day, assistant manager position for grab"</p>
              <p>Imagine that person is calling one of yr friend, how would you feel? Will you feel that somehow yr friend is being deceive?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And the link between cheating feeling and retiring early.</p>
              <p>"Your father is working right? How old is he, do you think it is tough for him to work"</p>
              <p>Start to imagine about my father, about the sleepless nights he is having, about even having to work at home after coming back from office. I answer yes</p>
              <p>"So do you want him to retire early?"</p>
              <p>Obviously is yes</p>
              <p>"So you should start to establish your future now.............." (Obviously lighting up "the way is to VE")</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the business plan elementalangel is proposing, there is some obstacles....</p>
              <p>1. Have to import the products from overseas, for example taiwan if you are taking about the calcium stuff (They claim is taiwan, so for now I believe it is from taiwan)</p>
              <p>2. VE claims that there have a sole distributorship in SEA (they claim, so for now I believe again)</p>
              <p>3. Need guts and capital to buy the product (Not saying that you have no guts but more on referring to the risk involve...</p>
              <p>And anyway are u joking or serious lol?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>To the VE claims about sole distribution... _!_ FAKE!!<br>i emailed eco quest (air purifyer company) and several other magnetic companies and another water purifyer company, they said that they could be able to sell it to me at a wholesale price for 100 pieces each and the air purifyers at 1/5 of the price that VE is selling bundled up with lots of freebies.</p>
              <p>BTW I suspect VE's water purifyers are a hoax with fake statements. The ONLY water purifyers in the world with exactly the same effects with what they claimed is diamond water which had won MANY awards. VE's water system has TOTALLY NO AWARDS FOR WHAT I KNOW and they did not even UPLOAD the water purifyer in their website..</p>
              <p>i am serious btw, free advertistments from the VE agents and then all we need to do is to put flyers into people's mailbox and money would come to us fast =D.</p>
              <p>for the guts and capital part. take deposit and order from states the same day and ship to sg via air =D</p>
              <p>the pills have TOTALLY NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE from what VE claimed they can do, however i could find similar pills from the states</p>
              <p>and for all your info VE's water is may ACTUALLY be HARD WATER which is BAD for health =D.</p>

              <p>oh well it would actually make a difference. since they trust their relatives, their relatives would "present" the product to them and they would believe everything whole heartedly. then they would actually remember another companies product and shows it to the person. Until the presenter finds out that they are actually the same products and freaks out after slandering the product like they always do  =p</p>

              <p>alright. i checked on the specs of the VE's items on their sites and also the brands and realised that VE is actually selling for MANY other MLMs</p>
              <p>then i emailed the companies and realised that they ship EVERYWHERE in the world. those MLM companies have also been black listed for up to ten years in their own countries for over pricing their non-proven working items which are the magnetic items. The rest just lose to their competitors in specs and die off gradually thus not becoming so popular</p>
              <p>and it is actually the agents who gave the misleading point that they are the sole distributer of every product they sell and call themselves UNIQUE</p>
              <p>the CAL stuff part. i did not say anything about that because i could not find anything about that besides the fact that there are many other web sites which sells similar pills which are either black listed or totally obselete</p>
              <p>the selling of items part was actually supposed to help me find and identify VE spies in this forum who would actually react alot against the idea =D because their livelihood is at risk. YET AGAIN</p>
              <p>those at the bottom are from the website. i do not like companies which sells things bad for human health at such an expensive price . this alone is enough for us to condone the company.</p>

              acidic substances and aids in prevention of diseases. Cooking using
              ionic calcium water can even retain nutrients in food.</p>
              <p>Cal
              Ion water also has anti-oxidant functions, it protects cells &amp;
              structure from harmful bacteria, improve immunity system and anti-aging

              <p>btw for those who dont know what hard water is</p>
              <p>\we can actually do the hard water test if someone gets to buy a bottle of water from  ve and then post it to youtube =D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Hard water</strong> is <a title="Water" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water">water</a> that has a high <a title="Mineral" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral">mineral</a> content (contrast with <em><a title="Soft water" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_water">soft water</a></em>). Hard water usually consists of <a title="Calcium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium">calcium</a> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), <a title="Magnesium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium">magnesium</a> (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) <a title="Ion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion">ions</a>, and possibly other dissolved compounds such as <a title="Bicarbonate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate">bicarbonates</a> and <a title="Sulfate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate">sulfates</a>. Calcium usually enters the water as either calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), in the form of <a title="Limestone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone">limestone</a> and <a title="Chalk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk">chalk</a>, or calcium sulfate (CaSO<sub>4</sub>), in the form of other mineral deposits. The predominant source of magnesium is <a title="Dolomite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomite">dolomite</a> (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>). Hard water is generally not harmful.</p>
              <p>The simplest way to determine the hardness of water is the lather/froth test: <a title="Soap" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap">soap</a> or <a title="Toothpaste" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste">toothpaste</a>,
              when agitated, lathers easily in soft water but not in hard water. More
              exact measurements of hardness can be obtained through a wet <a title="Titration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titration">titration</a>. The total water 'hardness' (including both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions) is read as <a title="Parts per million" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million">parts per million</a> or <a title="W/v" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W/v">weight/volume</a> (mg/L) of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>)
              in the water. Although water hardness usually only measures the total
              concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent, <a title="Divalent" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divalent">divalent</a> metal ions), <a title="Iron" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron">iron</a>, <a title="Aluminium" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium">aluminium</a>, and <a title="Manganese" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese">manganese</a> may also be present at elevated levels in some geographical locations.</p>

              <p>As what i had said, some people simply are too <strong>inmatured</strong>. they claim based on <strong>own assumption</strong> and judgement, so unprofessional. oh ya, i forget. they are professional in <strong>skepticals</strong>.</p>
              <p>so far, only one person can show something about WHO. good. however, i strongly suggest you to go to WHO official website and read up the latest information and updates on Water and Calcium. I did my homework before but apparently, it seem like you just start to do your homework with so <strong>irrevelant information</strong> on our <strong>patented</strong> CAL ion.</p>
              <p>on the WHO information you posted,  i think you should read the <strong>179pages official report</strong> ! the cut out is only a small little paragraph of the whole report which <strong>support water hardness</strong> but it seem you didnt do a good homework and <strong>backfire your claim</strong>. ahahhahaha, great joke!</p>
              <p>regarding doing our product testing, please do so! i'm sick of seeing <strong>childish people</strong> who can only comment but cant even present anything constructive with proof and testing.</p>
              <p>please dont talk about what livehood at stake la, we are professionals network marketer in the wellness industry and we arent afraid of anything since we do <strong>nothing wrong</strong>. you started to make me think that you are just a small boy who havent come out to see the big world. i doubt you even serve national service before. LOL.</p>
              <p>I suggest to <strong>meet up </strong>with all the skepticals here for a coffee. i can go alone, <strong>you guys can gang up together</strong> to meet me. since now is chinese new year, i'm <strong>more free to entertain</strong> you guys. hahaa. how about this coming <strong>tuesday</strong>?</p>
              <p>oh ya, if you guys are not sincere, just wanna be the <strong>typical skepticals</strong> that only want to talk their own point, then i think you can <strong>give excuse</strong> now how to reject my meeting up. hahaha.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yes how did you know i am only 17. well at least my plan worked right? enquiries you claimed you were not a part of VE and now u finally admitted =D. why not you quote what is good about your hard water from WHO and put it here ? like what i do... instead of whining about your companies goods?</p></div>
