              <p>condemn me? lol.. you cant even condemn me because you are just a shit.. how to condemn ? lOL ~!</p>
              <p>for a childish boy like you, i have to use childish words to let you understand, haiz.. really put down my own standards. lol ~!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) you claimed you quoted so many sources selling reliable products. is the source reliable? NO. is the product reliable? NO. is the product the SAME? NO. if you want a proper website which sells more expensive, i think you CAN do the search since you are so FREE everyday. maybe you dont want to be convinced by your own actions when you saw such website selling more expensive products. LOL !!</p>
              <p>2) the BMW model is not even 20 years old, obviously you dont know about cars!! 0 credibility!! LOL ~!! there are so many good cars driven by the achievers. example, BMW 330 COUPE, BMW Z4, Maserati, SLK etc etc etc, but you choose to ignore and just pinpoint that particular car... isnt it obvious that you are finding every SMALL LITTLE THING to say negative about MLM ? how about critizing what SOCKS they are wearing ?? LOL ~!!</p>
              <p>3) I said I am INDEPENDANT distributor of VE. do you know what is INDEPENDANT ??  I said I'm not from VE, thats TRUE because i'm not a staff or worker over there. you DONT KNOW what i mean, and you ASSUME what i meant. izzit it quite obvious that you DONT KNOW what is MLM and the relationship of distributors with the company?</p>
              <p>4) You just cannot accept people comment NEGATIVE about you. You are unhappy, fight back whatever points mentioned. if you cannot accept, then in the first place, YOU DONT go around commenting negative on others. YOU are the one the STARTED this flaming war, then you should end it. oh yah, in case you dont agreed, please check back all YOUR posts, see whether you are INDEED the one that started this war!</p>
              <p>5) I dont mind my english no good, because having good english doesnt mean anything at all. the japanses and chinese also dont know good english, but they also can be doing very well... the sad thing is, what about you? YOU COMMENT so much, how good are you? NOTHING but a just a POLY BOY BOY.</p>

              <p><br>u certainly know that this topic is posted to HELP the INDEPENDENT distributers of VE.. however you calll it... what i ment by personal is PEOPLE LIKE U...</p>
              <p>yep poly boy boy.. how about all of ur school drop outs at VE???!?!? for all u know.. ur bgm have not even completed poly...</p>
              <p>i was just refering to one.. and not even creating a big fuss out of the car... i just dun like the fact that he kept stressing that he has a bmw... u see the other bgms? they got bm wadeva.. oso keep low profile.. just say that they have achieved a car.. instead of a guy driving a 20 year old car.. still wanna flauunt..</p>

              <p>Dear EA,</p>
              <p>If you think that I am backing up enquires, I actually dont, it's my own personal perspective. Most of the time, I do agree with him. But at times, I dont. I am not backing enquires, I am backing up my own perspective. It would only be comfortable for you if I have the same perspective of you isnt it?</p>
              <p>And if you think no one of the sane mind would join VE, you are wrong. I am in the sane mind and I did join VE. So, only crazy ppl join VE? Isnt this statement ridiculous? You would say that no sane ppl would join VE because ONLY YOU think so.(maybe a few too) Why not you phone IMH and tell them to get VE ppl as they are 'crazy'...</p>
              <p>Yes, VE have no proper pay. And its commission based and risky. That is one of the reasons why I join mlm. The more I work hard for it(the smart way), the more I earn. I personally like to take risk.</p>
              <p>One more thing, I do NOT believe in magnetic therapy, but I do love the ionic calcium and the air series. I dont sell magnetic products, but I do sell the others.</p>
              <p>I would humbly retract back the statement that Anti VE ppl have no proof. But I have to say, MOST anti-VE ppl have no proof too...</p>
              <p>In my previous post, I did commented that enquires too is childish. Please read that part back. I expected you to be the bigger man.</p>
              <p>On the car part, its more of perspective, so car achievers can buy only 1st hand bmw cars is it? Personally, I wont. But if he wants to buy 20 yr old bmw 2nd hand car, its not really my problem. It's his car.</p>

              <p><strong>Multi-level marketing</strong> (<strong>MLM</strong>), also known as <strong>Network Marketing</strong> is a business distribution model that allows a parent multi-level
              marketing company to market their products directly to consumers by
              means of relationship referral and <a title="Direct selling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_selling">direct selling</a>.</p>
              <p>Independent unsalaried salespeople of multi-level marketing referred
              to as distributors (associates, independent business owners, franchise
              owners, sales consultants, consultants, independent agents, etc.),
              represent the parent company and are rewarded a commission relative to
              the volume of product sold through each of their independent businesses
              (organizations). Independent distributors develop their organization by
              either building an active customer base, who buy direct from the parent
              company and / or by recruiting a downline of independent distributors
              who also build a customer base, expanding the overall organization.
              Additionally, distributors can also earn a profit by retailing products
              which they purchased from the parent company at wholesale price.</p>
              <p>Distributors earn a commission based on the sales efforts of their
              organization, which includes their independent sale efforts as well as
              the leveraged sales efforts of their downline. This arrangement is
              similar to <a title="Franchising" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising">franchise</a> arrangements where royalties are paid from the sales of individual
              franchise operations to the franchisor as well as to an area or region
              manager. Commissions are paid to multi-level marketing distributors
              according to the company’s compensation plan. There can be multiple
              levels of people receiving royalties from one person's sales.</p>

              <p>A term of endearment for the mentally handicapped or stupid. It is commonly believed that retards are created by fucktarded, <a title="Mouth breather" href="http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Mouth_breather">mouth breather</a> <a title="Cum" href="http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Cum">sperm</a>.
