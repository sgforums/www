              <p>seriously... you told me not to say that enquirires english sux.. well.. double standard as usual, i must say.</p>
              <p>i realised something.. you like to use the same words as others you have just seen them use on you.. is it a lack of vocab or what?</p>
              <p>you earned 10k in 3 months.. and then u say 10k is nothing to you? wow? even working adults earning 40-50k a month, 10k is alot to them...<br>u go geylang.. ask around.. many would kill for 10 k..</p>
              <p>about the lawyer part.. i totally dont believe anyone would hire a lawyer and not follow up... since u have already wasted 2k.. why not file a lawsuit towards the isps and get that guy's ip and address??? sue sgforums as well.. for making people call u a bitch..</p>
              <p>stop making empty threats... notice something? after u join VE.. u start talking big and such...</p>
              <p>listen</p>
              <p>I DARE YOU TO SUE THAT GUY.. IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO</p>

              <p>What nonsense are you talking about using 'others' words? We are speaking in english... The only way i can NOT using the same words is when I am speaking a different language... Use common sense boy.</p>
              <p>And yes 10k is not that much of value to me... If it's sooo much of a value to you and others then its's YOUR perspective... NOT mine...</p>
              <p>What makes you think I am not following up on the civil suit? Its not 1 day i file to get the isps then immediately get... It will surely take 1 week at the very least!</p>
              <p>Why should I sue sgforums? Sgforums didnt call me a bitch...</p>
              <p>No, I dont think that I am talking big...</p>
              <p><strong>I find it odd, you ALWAYS try to come back to old statements and 'attack' me w/ it... If you think that I am 'talking big' based on ONE post then it shows how lack of maturity you possess.</strong></p>
              <p>No need for you to dare me... I am already doing it...</p>

              <p>Soulreaper, you are really childish if you think you can sue the forumer. Let me list the points for you</p>
              <p>1) The forumer in question did not quote your post, nor did he/she imply that the word is referring to you directly.</p>
              <p>2) The forumer can claim that bitch stands for  Beautiful Individual That Causes Hardons or other similar jargon, though a bit hard.</p>
              <p>3) The forumer can easily add on a charge on you via the Sedition Act for your thread on Origins of Malay. It is ironic how you could post out a law to threaten someone for legal action, yet blatantly ignore the law on the Sedition Act. Double standards?</p>
              <p>In addition, it would be much harder to defend yourself against your Malay thread.</p>
