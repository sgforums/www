            <div class='col-md body'>i was a former instructor in tekong bmtc. i am very shocked by this and i must say i believe that your son was the victim of a rogue instructor. i am no longer serving my national service but i feel hurt that the bmtc instructor's image has been tarnished by such rogue instructors. i can tell you that having been an instructor there for a year, such cases are very rare and all instructors know and agree that such acts are wrong. i insist that that the instructor was only a black sheep. i think you should call the CO or commander BMTC.</div>

He later went through some channel and complained the PC's actions to some chiefs who finally was punished in Detention Barracks.<br><br>When I was posted to an admin unit (Formation HQ), a parent cried all her way to the chief's desk and tell her how her son was "suffering" in the unit....<br><br>I think the chief had a meeting with the Unit CO and trashed it out in front of him.<br>Outcome: better than no reporting.<br><br>So, I suggest the parent bring this matter up to the OC first before bringing it up to  the Commanding Officer, then to the Chief, finally to the Ministry of defence.<br><br>Normally, it should be resolved at the early stage, shouldn't be any problems.<br><br>All the best to your son's training &amp; education in Singapore.<br><br>Campus News <a href="http://www.aimoo.com/ntu" rel="nofollow">http://www.aimoo.com/ntu</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by Heartlander:<br>It was a "shock" for parent like us to send our children to NS! While its chief was assuring us that they will take care of my only son during the sending off ceremony, but on the contrary the trainees were asked not to report any abuse not even to parents! And it was the scar on my son's face that shocked us! His face was kicked by a Malay Sergeant during his jungle training. What if this kick landed on his eye and blinded for life? Who shall I bring this matter up or shall I write to the Minister of defence for redress?<br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Maybe you cannot totally blame the sergent for kicking your son. I'm not sayin that your son deserve it.<br>But i've done my duty and i know that such things are quite common. Have you heard about the hokkien peng? those in mono intakes? They are treated harsher than those in BMTC schools. So be glad your son is in a BMTC not MONO intake.<br>What can your complain do?<br>Ask your son, have he done anything wrong?.Being Chao Gen or Sabo king? The sergent is also human, he is prone to his own temprement, maybe it's at the spur of the moment.I am not saying he's right in kickin your son. And i surpport that he seek redress.<br>But, How is he going to stand up for himself when his mama steps in?. What will his plattoon mates think of him. Will you be with him every min in camp?. There's many many ways to play/disturb a person in camp if you are still a recruit or "green<br>bird" or worst a "Marksman".<br>Do you know blanket parties still exist?, do you know you can get charge easily if you make a small mistake and everything has to go by the book? But chances of this slowly diminish when your experience increases.<br><br>I had friends who went in DB just because of certain minor things ,and just because someone wans you to. But that's the extreme case.<br>Minor Cases will be Confiment, or loads of extra duties.<br><br>------------------<br>~~~```` run..while you can ''''''~~~~~~~</div>
