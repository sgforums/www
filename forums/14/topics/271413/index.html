            <div class='col-md body'>motoway, what u heard was wrong and misleading. That's what happens when some pple get too excited, carried away and start to distort the original facts provided by the company.<br><br>The "10k, 11k" is not shares at all, because Sunshine Empire is NOT a listed company. Rather, it's an amount of $ used to purchase a product package. The highest level of consumption, in fact.<br><br>The "get back capital at the end of 10 yrs" (oh my god..) is actually, if i'm not wrong, referring to the Customer Rewards Privileges which gives a monthly benefit back to members who sign up with the EmCall packages. Why the woman said "get back capital" is because the benefit is monetary in nature and after about 10 months (not years), the accumulated benefit would be roughly equal to the amount spent on the package.<br><br>The price increase has nothing to do with the company doing well or not, it is simply part of the structured package plan which is available to members.<br><br>Lastly, the lady was right on one thing : the promoter shouldn't call it an investment. Because Sunshine Empire does not have any existing investment plans nor a license for that.<br><br>For further discussion, i think you can try referring all further thoughts and correspondence to the main thread on Sunshine Empire/NTI/EGA, because that's the company in which you're enquiring on..</div>

If you're strong enough to reject them, relationships will be affected somehow.<br><br>I wish some of them would use their heads and think for themselves.

            <div class='col-md body'>Never tell people you are not selling an investment scheme just because you are not publicly listed, or licensed<br><br>You will appear foolish, and your facts wrong<br><br>Investment is a broad term, which include but not exclusive to securities trading, and under securities trading umbrella you have a number of instruments including but not exclusive to shares...and of trading you need not to be selling your own company shares. Usually a company engages a third party, usually a bank, to set IPO and sell its shares on the market.<br><br>You are licensed depending on what you are selling, not whether you are selling any investment product at all.<br><br>Any MLM scheme can be straightaway considered an investment scheme, since the main aim is to gain an income or earn off from participating in such schemes.<br><br>I dont know why people like to bamboozle prospects by providing very misleading information themselves, while accusing of fellow affliates of doing so.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GNC has a programme in which it encourages its customers to recommend its brand to their friends/relatives, in which if they do so, they will get bonus points in which they can redeem additional products.<br><br>This is also an example of earning from participating in such a scheme.<br><br>The primary aim of an MLM company is supposed to distribute its products and services, but due to human greed, many play up the promise of high income that is connected to the company's compensation plans to levels that may not be considered very ethical.<br><br>To most laymen, a definition of an investment is to input a sum of money or capital into something in order to gain profitable returns, as interest, income, or appreciation in value.<br><br>But what about sums of money used to purchase products and services (of value, not worthless), or when an income is generated only when work and effort is being applied? Would it still be called an investment? If a person spends a sum of money to open a business, develops it into a profitable SME and that sum of money is considered an investment, then yes, MLMs are also an investment of sorts.<br><br>However the current definition of investment in SG is to place capital somewhere without purchasing retail products and services, and to expect returns for that capital alone.<br><br>The line is thin but defined.<br><br>By the way, the company has only 1 standardised way of disseminating its plans and operations. Anyone who deviates from the standard information risk charges of misrepresentation from the company and may face appropriate action. If fellow affliates choose to continue promoting information not approved by the company, they risk not only themselves but also the company's reputation.<br><br>redstone&gt; I still maintain good relations with friends and relatives who declined to join the company. If a person defends a company "to the death" but without reason and objectivity, then yes, that's not a very right thing to do.<br><br>^tamago^&gt; if the young people join because they think its easy and fast money, then yes, they're kinda disillusioned. It's a good opportunity, but nevertheless requires hard work and effort just like any other job. I hope they can realise this fact too.</div>
