            <div class='col-md body'>In summary, those seeking wealth need not seek Sunshine Empire<br><br>So this so called 'proof of income' is rubbish anyway, since they dont really earn income or profit from it. To think some boast earnings which enable them to buy BMW or earn at least USD 5k per mth nonsense.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>With regards to earnings, the point is wrong. MLM is an alternative product service distribution system, as well as an business opportunity, whatever the level of ethics. It provides an alternative method of income in lieu of the normal salaried system.<br><br>The part about investment is wrong and confusing. Purchasing products and services alone, and investing through a scheme to promote products and services, and earning from it, are two different things. Nowhere was the talk of purchase alone came up, so I am not sure why the talk about some thin line. What is the point of that anyway?<br><br>Note the patten of rebuttal, if level of ethics in MLM is questioned, MLMers would deride the earning bit of MLM, otherwise, the earning potential is always presented foremost to prospects. I am not sure how long you guys are going to continue contradicting your own stance, even among the people from the same company.<br><br>Then again, you guys have always been contradicting, even more so for those who come up to point out how the other affliates are black sheeps. There emerge a pattern in which on a a few mthly basis, a new group of affliates always come up to 'correct' the wrongs of the older group.<br><br>Nothwithstanding, the danger of misrepresentation was warned many years back, yet till today nothing was done, except rounds and rounds of warnings and  general statements which by present results would amount to cheap talks. Once something happened, then company garang gabuk and issues a memo.<br><br>Yet, the problem is still there.

            <div class='col-md body'>i see it as a good opportunity to expand the business, raise funds and really develop something concrete. I see it as good news for those that are vested. Seriously the rest should stand aside and stay out... I don't encourage anyone to join for they will be greatly disturbed by all the negativity. Just stand aside and watch. Be it up or down, as least its just a free show. For SE merchants, i hope SE can make good use of this to string the rest of the substandard ventures together.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

If fellow affliates choose to continue promoting information not approved by the company, they risk not only themselves but also the company's reputation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Please don't put it in such a nice and professional way like the banks, where, the company, in the first place, won't take any "appropriate" action.</span><br><br>redstone&gt; I still maintain good relations with friends and relatives who declined to join the company.
