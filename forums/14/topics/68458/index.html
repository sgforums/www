            <div class='col-md body'>Manufacturer of Unicity has 300 scientists ?<br>Only fools will believe them. Even the world's largest healthfood supplements or nutritionals products do not have 300 employees !!<br>Just one of those marketing ploys created by mlm companies.<br><br>FYI, Unicity was recently(late last year) sold off by Royal Numico, a Dutch Company major in manufacturing baby food. Royal Numico has been their product supplier since Enrich time. When Enrich and Rexall(a better known US MLM company) closed down few years back, RN bought over them and give a new name Unicity as Enrich owed them heavy debts, after 2 years, RN decided to sell it off. They could not find a buyer and now, the some staffs of Unicity bought it. RN still supply them products.<br><br>Enrich was actually started by some very bad people who are good in creating ploys and gimmicks. In US, ask anyone, no one ever heard of Enrich. They are only meant for Asian market, Malaysia especially. They changed their comp plan at least twice, changed owner at least twice too, a Company full of doubts and uncertainty.<br><br>New distributors do not know their background, but any intelligent fella will ask, " Why should a food supplement manufacturere need 300 Scientists ? They dont even need 300 workers !!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank You milohse for your introduction,<br><br>Unicity is a 3yr old network marketing company. its a merger of 2 hugh american healthcare companies. Enrich International with a 32yr history in america and Rexall showcase with a 14yr history in america. Royal numico which has a 104yr history in america bought and merged these 2 companies and started producing both companies products. And the merger resulted in UNICITY. Unity Meets Velocity. All can be found in www.unicitynetwork.com<br><br>I can tell you guys on and on about the perks about this company which Im proudly associated with, but im not going to. I've researched on alot of network marketing companies, inclusive of the elusive NTI Paris and have found that UNICITY to be the company which encapculates a correct trend direction, a great compensation plan and most importantly a excellent team(www.teamrich.com) where one can get great training exp to develop their life skills.<br><br>So for those who has more questions, pls do email me at alvintanhk@teamrich.com<br><br>Rdgs,<br>Alvin<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by milohse:</div><div class="quote_body">i got the information below from a friend who was working with unicity. i think now his wife selling it and he in a full-time job.<br><br>i think it might have something to do with mlm.<br><br>Web sites you can access are:<br><br>1.The Parent Company,Numico : www.numico.com<br><br>2.The Network Marketing Arm of Numico : www.unicitynetwork.com<br><br>3.For details of some products : www.enrichinternational.com<br><br>4.For additional information of unicity &amp; who is who in the biz: www.nmlifestyles.com/articles/449.html<br><br>more info:<br>High-Quality, Science-Based Products For the Health of Your Body and Your Business<br><br>What truly distinguishes our company from competitors is the science and quality behind our products.
