            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">refer to my replies with the arrow sign and words in blue color</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MightyFlameboy:</div><div class="quote_body">Ur English sentence structure and grammar usage are rather weird. I dunno if u're adding on to my pts, or rebutting them. But anyhow...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">well, to be successful in business doesn't means that the boss have to be good in education.<br><br>A boss knows how to make good use of their employees, boss have financial ability and the brain to hire those professionals to work for the boss.<br><br>education doesn't make a person successful.<br><br>success belongs to people who knows how to use their knowledge apply it, and use their knowledge to earn money via marketing their knowledge, and not by letting others make use of the knowledge. (this is what i learnt, and pick up after reading chapter 5 of Think and Grow Rich)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I'm just elaborating more on that point, no worries, as long as people are not misleading people, than I will not rebut nor tee-down the person (if there's a need to; than i will)</span><br><br>1) 'A good business leaves the customer happy'. Well said! But I tink MLMers piss more ppl off than those they convince. This forum is a very good physical testimony to that I've claimed to be. True, everyone can do business. Why MLM is not tt big in SG is cos' of wad u mentioned, lack of professionalism.<br><br>SG MLM companies are too focused on recruitment, rather than consumers' interests. Those 16 - 18 yr old kiddos without receiving adequate training, are expected to go out into the marketplace to sell the products. It's laughable how the VE guy tried to explain the products' viability in proper English, but out of his mouth came Hokkien Bengish 'Engrish'.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;"> in business, there has a balance, without any, then there will be ascending number of complaints.<br><br>thanks to lack of training, and bad image of the service sector, thus singaporeans dislike sales line, thus they don't put their heart into it.<br><br>moreover, at the end of the day, be it the customer is happy or not, the employee still gets his/her fixed or hourly based salary at the end of the month or day, thus there see no need in providing quality service.<br><br>I would only comment that there's a major flaw in a lot of sales occupation in fact, they don't emphasis on training, rather they look for people with knowledge in similar industry and give a basic training than off they go to do sales.<br><br>Example: Sales Line - selling MP3 IT gadets etc..they just need to have some basic knowledge that will help them to secure the job already.</span><br><br>Another gd pt by u, 'success depends on the direction of the company'. As for local MLM companies, I tink the direction is 'getting a BMW by 26 yrs old'. I noticed how most MLMers harp on their personal benefits 90% of the time, and only 10% of the time is dedicated to explain their products, and only when u show vulnerability tt they decide to preach to u abt how gd the products are, to try clinch a deal/recruitment. Is that gd business? *shrugs*<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;"> well for this, it's rather a advance knowledge on comparing and notice the difference between each company to shop for the right company.<br><br>for this, i'll explain it in simpler terms : I treat going to mlm companies very much the same like normal shopping when i go shopping for clothes shoes etc,<br><br>by observing the differences, than i'll know which company/retail store has quality service and good training.<br><br>i can only say a lot of companies are focus on their personal commission over their customer benefits, coz it's really the fact that their only payment of salary is commission, thus it normal that they are eager to clinch that deal/sale at the expense of neglecting their service standards.</span><br><br>2) My definition of 'drastic measures' is not how local MLMers do their business. "This thing is gd, sure work one! See, it's certified by wadever fu|ck ministry! U dun try, u regret ah!" Wad I was referring to, is tt foreign MLMers may be more willing to try their products out BY THEMSELVES first, using themselves as guinea pigs, to prove to the community tt they're convinced tt they're selling a trustworthy product. Ppl would see their conviction, and would be more open-minded to give the products a try.<br><br>Local MLMers are juz given stupid theory talks abt how gd the products are, and after seeing a few magazine articles and certificates, they totally buy into the stories of those managers. Do they actually try the products to determine if they're in the right honourable company? Most of the time, when they sell the products to their frenz n family, it's usually wif a profit n career motive in mind, rather than genuine concern fer their well-being, esp. if the products are health-related.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;"> typical expample of bad sales made or bad training by either a normal business or mlm company.<br><br>even in sales line - Car Trade to be exact, the car salesman/saleswoman might be selling posh cars but do they really try or own the same brand of posh car  themselves to sell it? the answer it no. thus they can only based it on normal sales tatic. to encourage better sales and services, there's this Go the Extra Mile to provide service to clients; but not many people do that. </span><br><br>In a nutshell, local MLM companies must ditch the fantasies of getting rich by themselves, and start focusing on the consumers' benefits. Once they wake up to this reality, it'll make them use better business tactics and haf better business ethics, in turn gaining the consumers' trust, and riches will come naturally. Nuff' said.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">they will not wake up, as some of the founders of the companies in Singapore just start an mlm company for the seek of earning money, but they are just a chip off the block, with no improvement, they just copied identical idea from the previous company which they are from, thus that's the reason why there are more and more un-ethical and unprofessional tatics being practised to clinch that deal. </span><br><br>Oh btw, which MLM company are u frm? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">does it make any difference to which i reveal which company i'm from?<br><br>The reason why I'm netural is because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">i have being in Service Line (sales) for 6 yrs already to date,</span> and with many different experience in different sales occupation, thus I learnt it from experience (having worked in below average, average and high class industry), 1 occupation which help shaped me up to who i am today is Shangarila Hotel Singapore which emphasis on Service.<br><br>Anyway, my objective isn't to recruit people, thus I will not reveal it Online or via PM, only when I meet up the person, upon request than I'll reveal, as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my objective is just to help readers here to know how to avoid being conned and to be a Good Shopper to pick the right products (something which i learnt from Retire Young Retire Rich) and to make more frens</span> thus i like to answer questions, but only quality questions or when there's misleading threads or thread replies, than i'll do the clarification like what i did in the thread with contents about 'investment project' </span><br><br></div></blockquote>If you like to learn how to be a good shopper, u can PM me and we can meet up to discuss in general sales and mlm. Rest assure that i will not sell my company cause I'm just here to help provide advice and tips. not for recruitment into my company.<br><br>Last but not least, thank you for your compliments.</div>
