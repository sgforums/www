Than i might be able to suggest a few ways to help you improve your impression of that certain company. (applicable to all companies)<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Just treat it like shopping lor, the more you shop, the more you see and ask, the smarter you are as a consumer and thus in time to come, you know how to choose the right products, and not to be manipulated by the sales people in future.<br><br>If there's any queries and doubts, feel free to ask, in fact I like to answer questions, but only face to face.<br>Jus PM me your particularsif you are keen to clarify your doubts.<br><br>Full Name : (I don't accept nickname)<br>Age:<br>Hp:<br>Email:<br>Any Experience in any company: (List all that you have)<br>Visited any company:<br>- Negative Experience(s) if any; Kindly State:____________<br><br>Any incomplete details will not be entertained.<br><br>Reason for meeting is to avoid any mis-representation (very common complaint every month as reported in newspapers), i will only explain it face to face thus to clarify any doubts immediately.<br><br>I will only meet people and share what I know face to face.<br>Sharing of information requires explaination which rookies don't understand.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe there's nth wrong wif MLM as a business system by itself.

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, if a system cannot deal with human behaviours, then the system fail, no matter how many times you can say system is good but humans are at fault.

And we all should be aim to be realistic<br><br>And i agree with mightyflameboy's last point, that though the ideals of MLM is that it suspercede and is supposed to take over as the so called next generation marketing, business or whatever terms they choose to call it, it hampered by rampants frauds, hardselling and lowest level of professionalim<br><br>The members turned it into a inward looking self contained business industry very cut off from reality, the reality of consumers behaviour and corporate professionalism.<br><br></div>

I dunno if u're adding on to my pts, or rebutting them. But anyhow...<br><br>1) 'A good business leaves the customer happy'. Well said! But I tink MLMers piss more ppl off than those they convince. This forum is a very good physical testimony to that I've claimed to be. True, everyone can do business. Why MLM is not tt big in SG is cos' of wad u mentioned, lack of professionalism.<br><br>SG MLM companies are too focused on recruitment, rather than consumers' interests. Those 16 - 18 yr old kiddos without receiving adequate training, are expected to go out into the marketplace to sell the products. It's laughable how the VE guy tried to explain the products' viability in proper English, but out of his mouth came Hokkien Bengish 'Engrish'.<br><br>Another gd pt by u, 'success depends on the direction of the company'. As for local MLM companies, I tink the direction is 'getting a BMW by 26 yrs old'. I noticed how most MLMers harp on their personal benefits 90% of the time, and only 10% of the time is dedicated to explain their products, and only when u show vulnerability tt they decide to preach to u abt how gd the products are, to try clinch a deal/recruitment. Is that gd business? *shrugs*<br><br>2) My definition of 'drastic measures' is not how local MLMers do their business. "This thing is gd, sure work one! See, it's certified by wadever fu|ck ministry! U dun try, u regret ah!" Wad I was referring to, is tt foreign MLMers may be more willing to try their products out BY THEMSELVES first, using themselves as guinea pigs, to prove to the community tt they're convinced tt they're selling a trustworthy product. Ppl would see their conviction, and would be more open-minded to give the products a try.<br><br>Local MLMers are juz given stupid theory talks abt how gd the products are, and after seeing a few magazine articles and certificates, they totally buy into the stories of those managers. Do they actually try the products to determine if they're in the right honourable company? Most of the time, when they sell the products to their frenz n family, it's usually wif a profit n career motive in mind, rather than genuine concern fer their well-being, esp. if the products are health-related.<br><br>In a nutshell, local MLM companies must ditch the fantasies of getting rich by themselves, and start focusing on the consumers' benefits. Once they wake up to this reality, it'll make them use better business tactics and haf better business ethics, in turn gaining the consumers' trust, and riches will come naturally. Nuff' said.<br><br>Oh btw, which MLM company are u frm? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
