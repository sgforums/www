            <div class='col-md body'><br>Interesting to note that the negative message below about Reliv is from a Usana distributor.<br><br>Reliv is Usana's biggest competitor.<br><br>It's really ashame that any network marketing company gets thrashed simply because of the way they market their products. It could be the most phenomenol product in the world and someone will still find something wrong with it simply because of the marketing.<br><br>The fact is network marketing is not for everyone, but does that mean that you have to discredit the company because you could not make your business grow. This is not a get rich quick scheme, this is a REAL business.<br><br>1. In any marketing plan, when you open a traditional store and buy in bulk you get a better discount, correct?? So, why is it not correct to offer that to distributors in network marketing? And what business or franchise gives you a 90% money back guarantee??? NONE!!!<br><br>2. When you start any new business whether it's traditional, franchise or network marketing there is an investment. It can be anywhere from $10,000 to millions. However, in network marketing or MLM, whatever you want to call it, the investment is a fraction of the cost and because of that the industry gets a lot of people who are looking for a way to get rich quick.<br><br>3. Network Marketing is just like any other business and it takes a lot of work, committment, an investment of some sort, focus and belief in your products.<br><br>4. Unfortunately, because the investment is so low we end up with people who do not do what is necessary to make their business a success and then they blame it on the company or the product.<br><br>Is MLM a real business? Answer that question after you view this video.<br><br>http://www.anmnow.com/streamofincome/index2.shtml<br><br>In reference to Reliv. There are thousands, upon thousands of people who have had life changing results. If someone did not get results it's because they were not taking it properly.<br><br>If a doctor prescribes a medication to you and gives you specific directions, do you follow the directions?? Well, that is the same with Reliv. There are specific directions that people DO NOT follow and then they blame it on the product when the problem is they didn't take it correctly.<br><br>I am on my way to Singapore in September because of many, many people who have had great results with the business and the products. And Reliv will grow regardless of naysayers because it WORKS and it changes peoples lives.<br><br>Check Bigcharts.com to view the growth of the company and where it is headed.<br><br>Lisa</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Glad to share the news with you that they are on the way down in Malaysia, so badly that you see majority Indians now active with them and the Management placed advertisement in the Star Paper to recruit distributors, asking people to invest between 2K to 14K. This is the first time I see a MLM Company advertising for distributors after one year of operations.<br><br>Is it because their business is really so bad or that their practice is bad ?<br>Whichever reason, its still bad, very very BAD !!<br><br>So Singaporeans beware, don't be fooled by them into the business !!</div>
