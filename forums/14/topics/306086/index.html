              <p>Since MLM have a bad reputation in this forum, I thought that it's mostly becoz of the agents using unethical methods to recruit ppl.(e.g. VE &amp; enyouth)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What if these agents doesnt use unethical methods that could break friendship &amp; kinship?</p>

              <p>I disagree that MLM's don't work because Singaporeans have access to every kind of information. That implies that in a location where access to information is poor, MLMs can succeed.</p>
              <p>MLMs fail because they ignore the laws of supply and demand. Once again, it depends on how you define success. For those at the top of the chain, an MLM is a success. For someone retrenched from Yahoo!, Yahoo! is a failure.</p>
              <p>MLMs are very effective because it leverages on the strength of relationships. People find it hard to say no to their relatives and friends. But I think instinctively we feel uncomfortable with this because we hate the "hard sell" and when your friends and relatives are used to pitch the hard sell to you, you feel betrayed. It's one thing to tell the pushy California Fitness sales guy to f*ck off. It's another to tell your brother or your best friend to do the same.</p>

              <p>Every industry sure will have some black sheep to spoil the reputation. Cos this world is profit driven, revolve around money. Of course people will do things to maximise profits. Profits = Money = Expand = beat competitors = SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS YEAH!!!</p>
              <p>And obviously I am not shooting myself in the foot (by contradicting myself by labeling XX company as unethical and at the same time) saying that these people are using unethical methods just because if they dont, they will go bankrupt.</p>
              <p>Of course they can use ethical methods, just that no one dare to take this risk. They should, after all they are claiming that they entrepreneurs and creating a new business revolution</p>

              <p>i would say one of the factors, but not THE factor, where access to information is important to the rise and fall of MLM schemes</p>
              <p>as for strength of relationships, not sure, but it weaken the bonds when relatives feel uncomfortable in buying, so the leverage power may be gone</p>
