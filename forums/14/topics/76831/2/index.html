This is crucial. If they can easily convince you of its effectiveness and u gain confidence of using the products, this confidence allow one to sell products easier<br><br>Lastly, teaching methods. Many newbies will definitely think they do not have enough connection. If their teaching techniques are there, you will sure discover how many friends you really have. And I aint gonna discuss friends philosophically here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>These points do largely, but not wholly bring out the saleman in all of us.<br><br>But I aint gonna go into specifics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about the marketing techniques, i must say that depending of the attitude of the boss/shareholders. True, in business world, everyone is talking about money. But sometimes it depends, if the management is really looking forward to expand its business and helping its agents to achieve to its fullest potential, this company will soar to the highest. But looking at this company overall outlook, just have a look at the management, maybe in your heart, without me saying, you can see how far can this company goes...<br><br>Seeing is believing...Follow your heart wherever it goes and you will have no regrets!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after reading thru so many topics on mlm and network marketing,have to agree laurence82 give one of the best and neutral opinion...personally my view on selling mattress thru MLM method is hard....1 thing is mattress is non consumables,after 1 sale then u need to find another new person to buy,then end up similar to pyramid headhunting...maybe if thru traditional method like SLM easier for ppl to accept..just my 2cts worth of view</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JiWz,<br><br>I don't agree with you that magnetic mattress is hard to sell or that consumer product is better in direct-selling, whether SLM or MLM. I think what matters is whether the product is Value-for-Money and if there is a big demand for it.<br><br>Your mention of "winners never quit or quitters never win" is also not true.<br>Suppose if you joined a Company that can never win, you must quit to join another  better Company. Your slogan and belief is only used by Company mangement and Uplines who will not want their distributors or downlines to leave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agree w/ your 2nd part of joining a lousy company.True if the company that you join really sucks,but if it sucks why will you join in the 1st place...Winners never quit, quitters never win....it's true,in life and not just mlm,if u give up too easily,you will find yourself a loser most of the time.<br><br>anyway, i say mattress hard to sell thru mlm,but never say impossible to sell.reason being the income of distributors is generate thru constantly sales of the products which is then spread thru the network of distributors.but in mattress,how u get constant sale to maintain the income? you won't find yourself having loyal customers, cos your mattress can last me yrs if it's good and value for money...after i buy 1 time,you need to search for new customers,normal customers won't buy 1 every mth...therfore thru direct sales more feasible cos the direct distributor that sells may get a larger portion of commision from the sale than thru MLM.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok,if you want to argue this way,then i have to agree every household can have more than 1 mattress.but still,even if assuming 4 persons per household,at most u can only get 4 sales from 1 household.assume 1 per month so how are you going to get this certain household to remain as your customers and continue buying after the 4th mattress after the 4th month????Unless you tell me this household change mattress every few months even if the mattress are not spoil(not suppose to be if value for money) or they like to continue buying to stock up in case they got alot of guests staying overnite...in the long term i still think hard for mattress to sustain the system of MLM and residual income.I still think Referral programs or SLM is better.

The company here can sustain by selling just a few pieces every month but the distributors will not survive.<br><br></div></blockquote>you check and found all? wow.. any prove to backup your claims?<br><br>or just another casual remarks to discredit your competitors?</div>

Hahaha ! You are promoting it.  You should prove that there is R &amp; D and being sold elsewhere, not me. You must be new to magnetic products. Leave me your contact number. I will prove Japan Life's background to you.<br><br>Do I give casual remarks ? My remarks have facts.
