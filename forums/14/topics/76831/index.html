            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I replied to their advertisement and out of curiosty I went over and happened to know their MD. He is in magnetotherapy business for close to 20 years.. He has very good connections with Japanese and Koreans. The Japanese developed a very unique product for them. Besides magnetotherapy, it also has FIR and negative ions material manufactured by nanotechnolgy and using BAE fibres. I saw their presentation and demonstration, very impressive, all based on scientific proofs. One of their demo using lemon juice placed on the procduct, the taste changed instantly without having to wait and there is no electricity or any charger used.<br><br>I joined straightaway, brought in 4 prospects and 3 joined within the same day and 1 the following day. Their marketing is also very unique and rewarding.<br><br>They are a new Company. I asked many friends about them, so far nothing negative or bad.<br><br></div>

I will check with my friends on this Mr Liew.  Is he also an ex-agent from asayo ?<br>20 years experience is not good enough. Most important is whether the boss is a sincere and trustworthy person. Is there no Singaporean boss ?<br><br>What is the difference in their products with asayo or wbg ??? It sounds similar.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello ck,<br><br>I just refered to Mr. Liew and slso do my own research from Malaysia, he was the GM of Stronshine and he resigned as a GM from Asayo because the Company owed him many months salary. He is still holding all the returned cheques and other records. If you do not believe me or others, it's best that you refer to the Asayo boss, Raymond Ng and hear for yourself what he will say. I am sure he will give you all sorts of excuses BUT you can tell him I challenge him to POST his reasons here IN BLACK AND WHITE. If he do not dare do to it, then it proves he is lying to you, how about that ? Or at least, you post her what he says !!<br><br>Remember, I am waiting for "black n white" here.<br><br>P/s. I am sure some Asayo agents will see this message and refer back to Raymond, if there is no response from them, it proves I am right.</div>

Any name ?<br><br>Besides magnetotherapy, it also has FIR and negative ions material manufactured by nanotechnolgy and using BAE fibres.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> I heard Nanotech-manufactured products carry a Nanotech Certificate, have your MD shown you any ?<br><br>I saw their presentation and demonstration, very impressive, all based on scientific proofs. One of their demo using lemon juice placed on the procduct, the taste changed instantly without having to wait and there is no electricity or any charger used.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> This demo is nothing new. Some MLM Companies from Malaysia have used this trick. By giving a stronger radiation treatment on the product, the effect is instant but it is no good for the body. Thats why all the Japaneses and U.S. magnetic pads Company are not using it. In fact, I heard it was actually banned in Japan. If the radiation is light, the effect can diminish after 2 or 3 years. If too strong, it will be warmth and uncomfortable to sleep on.<br><br>I joined straightaway, brought in 4 prospects and 3 joined within the same day and 1 the following day. Their marketing is also very unique and rewarding.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Well, many people jumped on a new opportunity without really studying the products. How much is the joining fee ?<br><br>They are a new Company. I asked many friends about them, so far nothing negative or bad.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I think too early to tell. Just wait and see later from the customers feedback.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I have done the above demonstrations using my old magnetic pad and it can still produce the same effect after 5 minutes, but I know magnets are permanent. So why should I pay for something which is questionable ?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
