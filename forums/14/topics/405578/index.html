              <p>Hi all, by the way. Another 'MLM' company is starting up in bugis maybe in FORTUNE CENTER called <strong>PREMIERE PURE.</strong></p>
              <p>This is definitely true since I heard it for myself, and the <strong>PP is the reborn of VEG PTE LTD.</strong></p>
              <p>It was said that the president of VE(Simon Sim), couldn't accept the working styles among his fellow managements and have his own concept of managing the company. The board eventually did not agree upon each other, and some the managements decide to part ways and disband <strong>VEG,</strong> and has quit for the company, and now he is starting another company in Bugis.</p>
              <p>Well, for all of this shit that is happening now, I am actually very happy that VEG is gone for sure this year, but question still arise within me because for all this years the President, he has fail to answer the public for so many misunderstandings that arises on the sources and people.</p>
              <p>For what he claimed that he no longer will be <strong>in VEG due to certain disagreements with</strong> the managements, I strongly have a disbelief of what he says and what he is going to do next.</p>
              <p>Is it just because that the reputation of VEG has stink and he plan to start anew for his empire? Or that he has other motive for his next move in making some big bucks.</p>
              <p>Students who were approach to do survey in Bugis please take note. </p>

              <p>Mr Simon SIm is by far the more sincere boss that I've ever seen
              comparing to the corporate world outside. There is a reason to why
              premierpure this company is started up.Mr Simon Sim wants the people in
              the company to earn more money and be more fair, thats why they shifted
              out. While U may have ur reason to be defensive or skeptical against Mr
              simons action, please dont be that particular black sheep to stink the
              whole entire company.<br>Premierpure have this name simply because
              premier stands for the top, the elites and pure is purity..make up of
              people of pure heart, simply just wanted to help young adults realise
              more of their dreams and moving on closer to their goals. If Mr simon
              Sim isnt a capable boss, why would the people in the company all follow
              him. When one man leaves, whole company leaves. The boss finds no
              meaning to answer to people on its sources and people just like how
              other mlmers work, right?<br>So, sincerely ask yourself,  have u really
              been doing yourself good by posting this up to the forums? Well, Mr
              Simon Sim havent been bad mouthing about u people right. Is there any
              injustice to you?True, permierpure might be made up of VE people but
              definitetly, the  education and the culture that is being taught is
              something that shouldnt be questioned. In fact, The company should
              thank you for helping them,boosting this news to everyone and helping
              out in the advertising. Thanks alot dear!<br> <br> but honestly speaking..I kinda feel sad for you..I' guess you didnt have too much of a result?</p>
