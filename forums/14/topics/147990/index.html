            <div class='col-md body'>Bel'Air - has been bad for some but good for some.<br>Some gave up when not making headway when still stuck with local market and not making progress.<br>And few are doing really well when they connect to overseas market from local.<br>So there are failures &amp; success -<br>Chances of success very much depends on the leader who can show you the "practical how-to-do" based on actual experience instead of the rah-rah- feel good motivational talks and promises.<br>Start-up amount is your choice: minimum $60 for a professional looking Organiser-type presentation folder plus one-year Corporate newsletter mailed to your house.<br>No compulsory maintenance and no maintenance required to enjoy retail &amp; over-riding commissions.<br>I am not an employee of Bel'Air, just an independant distributor who have expanded to Toronto, Canada (also given the opportunity to operate a stockist operations there because of the volumes I managed to grow and sustain in past years in Canada and USA). The Middle East markets is my next growth market from next month.<br>So this is the way to ride on the MLM opportunity and not selling to friends, uncles and aunties.<br>I have known of people who failed badly in Bel'Air too and I know why. So if you want success, talk to those who succeeded well (not just one month) for many years already. Contact me via "send message" button if you want to know more - and if you want to verify documents to show overseas volumes sustaining. I am a humble person, no BMW's, no rah-rah and no-bull-shit.<br>Success is Your choice.....<br>cheers... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It really depend on which grp you want to go to. Bel'Air has three main network branches, with a wide spectrum of different values. For one, I was told they are pushing for a challenging count investment which is somewhere from 50K - 72K. Please think seriously.<br><br>Please consider all factors before deciding. Don't let emotions control you.<br>It's your choice.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To put things in the proper perspective,<br>1)I agree with Concerned_man, dont let emotions control you. Even in one MLM company, talk to a few leaders and choose one that you feel has what it takes to work with you to achieve what you plan to do. Choose the one who will be your mentor to your success<br>Overall, remember, this business may not be suitable for everyone. You need to have certain qualities and personality to succeed.<br><br>2) You only need a minimum $60 dollars for registration and accumulate and build your rank up -quickly or slowly, it is up to you.  You have a choice of various entry positions and various returns on your effort for various position. One of the lowest entry and fairest system I've seen to start your own international business.<br>You can take orders and build your volume gradually till you get promoted to the net higher rank to enjoy more returns.<br>You do not need to start with the 50k to 72k mentioned in earlier post - those capacity are good for multiple positions especially if you have immediate overseas distributors to transfer the high ranking positions- so, for beginners, don't have to fret about this which are for more eperienced, bigger players who want the fastest returns from big overseas markets.<br><br>3) Key difference that I have experienced myself in the past 3 years is besides new distribution lines opening up here and overseas, the repeat consumption and re-ordering volume has outpaced new-sign ups.  This is something not many MLM'ers dare promise. But I have personally done this.<br>Anyone who wants to verify my documents is welcomed to take a look.<br>So, choose your mentor carefully. Not just the group.<br>The fact is : It is not easy.  (contrary to what most networkers even in Bel'air will claim) but a good leader who has done it will help you shorten your learning curve.<br>I am confident you know your own strengths and find the right business and business partner &amp; leader that matches your strength.<br>Wishing you success in your endeavour..... cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks alot man....<br>my fren joined and i am very concerned about whether she/he think of everything carefully, did detailed research, or made a quick decision. it was a big start by the way.<br><br>in my openion, the one that she/he took doesn't sound like purchasing the demonstration set, coz the price is way much higher than what the normal terms of business value for that aroma oil.<br><br>i looked at the regulations governing the MLM industry "MLM Act, revised MLM Exclusion Order" and understood below items;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>a) Safeguards - A participant cannot be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to become a participant in the scheme, other than the purchase of demonstration equipment which are not for resale, at no more than cost price and for which no commission can be given out. A legitimate multi-level marketing scheme would not impose a financial risk on salespersons. For example, salespersons should be entitled to full refunds, under reasonable commercial terms, for any inventories kept or purchased by them which are not sold to end consumers, so long as the inventories are returned within a period of 60 days.<br><br>b) Behavioural checks - The companies must not misrepresent the scheme as get-rich-quick opportunities, and should not use fraud, coercion, harassment, or unconscionable means to force people to join the scheme. Instead, the companies should focus their efforts on promoting the quality and features of the products. If a company wishes to show potential participants the earning potential, they must keep records of the maximum, minimum, mean, mode and median earnings of their salespeople in the past.<br><br>c) Sharing of commission - It is all right for a salesperson to share commissions from several layers of salespersons recruited by him. However, such commissions must be generated by sale of the product or service in question, and not through the recruitment of additional participants into the scheme.</span><br><br>what my friend currently going to do is (from what i understand) exactly like recruiting more people and get comission from the earned member fee (in form of buying those oils in unbelieaveble price). This sounds to me like breach of law enforced. will what she/he do going to risk any lawsuit?<br><br>I also wish to acquire more knowledge about how to help friend, since she/he already started and paid money. maybe how to enhance to get the returns and make successful.<br><br>any good or bad suggestions are appriciated.<br><br>thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear GSXR Racer,<br>sure, give me a call or send a private message via email anytime, if it helps to allay your fears and concern.<br>Your concerns are definitely valid.<br>Every true professional network  distributor must have a concrete business plan to (1) generate product sales via developing distributor channels, (2) provide the required money-back guarantee and  (3) not present the business as a get-rich-quick scheme but a business that requires initial hard work, right skills, duplicatable system.<br>And the key to sustaining success is -I 'll say again (1)developing market categories for repeat consumption - This continual consumption volume must  exceed "recruitment volume" in a short time (2) speed in expanding to ready-overseas markets -ie, cant depend just on Singapore market (3) Your immediate mentor's leadership.<br><br>Conclusion:- Depending on how individual distributor conduct their business and presentation, although the company may be operating legally, the individual's conduct may be unethical or worse still, running against the law.<br><br>From my 3 years experience, looking at the industry, I can share with you-<br>This business can grow very big for you as long as it follows ethical and legal grounds. But don't join because of peer-pressure or undue influence from friends or family.<br>If you do this business for the right reasons, then join the right company and the right leader. (better to keep friends and family intact)<br><br>Cheers and good luck.... Stephen</div>
