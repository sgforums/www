            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All the anti-mlmer, please come here&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>life cycle of the typical MLMer:<br><br>1) Mr X gets enticed into joining MLM.<br>He persuades people around him (including YOU) to join him in a new business opportunity,quoting the need to have dual income, need to have entrepreneur spirit, need to change mindset..... He will also quote big and prominent names and corporations and say they are into MLM also...names like Bill Gates, IBM, Microsoft, Nike etc.....<br><br>He also claims that his MLM company is the best, with the best product, best mgmt, best team, best remuneration structure.<br>bankers, lawyers, heart surgeons and 747 pilots have joined this company.<br>top men in this company drives Porsche, lives in 2 bungalows etc....<br><br>He also mentions why things like why work for 40 years and retire for 10years. why not work for 10 years and retire for 40 years.<br><br>2) Mr X stops bothering you, taking it that you are hopeless and stubborn and ignorant.<br>Off he goes on his new "business" venture.<br><br>typical paraniod questions thrown at you in the heat of frustration trying to<br>convince you includes:<br><br>i) pyramid selling? can you explain to me what exactly is pyramid selling and the difference between pyramid selling and MLM????????<br><br>ii) you not interested then you ask so many questions for what???!!!!!<br>iii) if I answer this question of yours, you agree to buy and join???, then???!!!!<br><br>You will see him approaching people in all scenarios from a wedding banquet, a drinking session, a mahjong session, lunch, Incamp training etc.....<br><br>3) Mr X having been rejected by the numerous people that he approaches, now complains to you, and starts to bad-mouth those who reject him, labelling them as no ambition, kiasi, no entrepreneurship and so on. But notice that he will not mention a slight hint of the MLM business he is involved in to you, even if you ask him. Vague answers will be given like new way, new business, new concept of selling.<br><br>4) Mr X now having failed considerably to make good on his MLM business, now makes a call to you, asking casually if you are interested in joining his business venture. at most, he will mention the product itself,(magnetic mattress, health food, gold coin) but not the MLM company name itself.<br><br>5) Mr X could have approach his MLM upline trying to refund the product, but this will not be made known to people whom he had approached. Whether the refund is successful or not, only Mr X knows, (I would see this as something being done BACKSTAGE, away from the audience)<br><br>6) Mr X now still stuck, keeps to himself and stop mentioning the business. this is where the embarassment part comes into play. Extreme embarassment meaning he has shown to you so much faith, hope and promise in the thing at the very beginning and now it has failed him entirely and make him so lost. still he presists and refuses to admit its not working, for saving face sake,<br><br>7) so once in a while Mr X unleashes it again,"how would you like to join me in my business."<br>and the name Robert Kiyosaki is probably a standard dish being served in this whole banquet.<br></div>
