They also get cash for recruiting other MLM marketers.<br><br>Under Sunshine's scheme, people usually put down $12,000 to become a 'merchant', as it calls users of its online shopping platform offering thousands of goods, including health supplements, lingerie and electronics goods.<br><br>After signing up, they can buy Sunshine's online goods.<br><br>But they are also rewarded with potentially hefty cash rebates, though these are not guaranteed. Merchants can build their own sales force as well.<br><br>The scheme is structured in such a way that participants are not required to use the rebates to buy Sunshine's goods.<br><br>The cash rebates are based on Sunshine's global turnover. The option of converting the rebates into cash only makes Sunshine more attractive than other MLM firms where people must maintain sales quotas.<br><br>But this is understood to be the nub of the concerns held by the authorities over Sunshine's business practices.<br><br>The fact that its 'merchants' can notch up what seem like profits without ever buying or selling products means its business model looks like a pure financial investment scheme.<br><br>Sunshine was placed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) investor alert list last month and that of Malaysia's Securities Commission a few months ago.<br><br>The regularly updated MAS list warns people of companies which may be offering products regulated by MAS without authority.<br><br>Read the full story in Wednesday's edition of The Straits Times.<br><br></div>

Books for network marketing are used to confuse ppl that network marketing is different from pyramid scams. Useless to insist that i know nothing about MLM just to divert attention. Only ppl who do not have courage to leave such scams try hard to defend pyramid scam online.<br><br>Printing network marketing books are wasting natural resource such as trees. Any tom dick or harry can write network marketing books. Even ppl from woodbridge hospital can also write books on mlm.<br><br>Mlmers who keep insist on doing mlm are being looked down as they are hopeless &amp; stupid. Look at what type of ppl insist on doing mlm. They are usually unemployed, ppl who are being condem at work place , have no courage to start own biz and ppl who refuse to upgrade themselves. Enquiries,the longer you stay here to defend network marketing, the more you are being look down.<br><br>Up till now, i only heard mlmers go into debt. Some even go on their knees &amp; beg friends or relatives to lend them money for the scam. Not a single mlmers is on newspaper article as successful icon. Successful icon are mostly successful business owners &amp; employee.<br><br></div>

Only ppl who do not have courage to leave such scams try hard to defend pyramid scam online.<br><br>Printing network marketing books are wasting natural resource such as trees. Any tom dick or harry can write network marketing books. Even ppl from woodbridge hospital can also write books on mlm.<br><br>Mlmers who keep insist on doing mlm are being looked down as they are hopeless &amp; stupid. Look at what type of ppl insist on doing mlm. They are usually unemployed, ppl who are being condem at work place , have no courage to start own biz and ppl who refuse to upgrade themselves. Enquiries,the longer you stay here to defend network marketing, the more you are being look down.<br><br>Up till now, i only heard mlmers go into debt.

True entrepreneurship is taking things in ur own stride, despite the criticism and unbelief of the others, while constantly improving urself and finally proving the world wrong. All millionaires go thru tis stage some point in their life. Bill Gates, whom u guys like to quote ALOT, is definitely one of them.<br><br>So, I agree wif the rest. Instead of sitting behind ur com n wasting time to set up tis useless thread to evoke other people's hate towards u (and intensify and further justify our hate fer MLM), u shld be busy out in the marketplace trying ur best to prove us wrong, by raking up sales by ethical means and getting ur company listed etc.<br><br>U can continue being a blardy retard over here. I'm more than happy to keep u entertained. Besides, u haf to reply dozens of other ppl's posts, whereas I only haf to reply to ur posts.
