At the expense of truanting your relatives, close friends and even your family members? Where is your ethics? Or do you know what is that? The way I see some MLM members from that particular company is more like harassing people. Forcing people is not the way to go. As that will definitely break friendships especially when one become desperate for $.</div>

For tt $$$ I'd be paying fer ur dumb products, I can find a better commercial alternative wif proper certification and quality assurance. Pls gimme an example of an MLM product tt is both CHEAPER and even much MORE TRUST-WORTHY than commercial counterparts?<br><br>#2: Why do manufacturers haf to resort to using MLM as their medium of sales circulation? Cos' their products are out of the market radar, they dun haf sufficient capital to support advertisement and awareness of their products.<br><br>To quote commercially successful products is foolish and childish. Lemme noe if there's any MLM company that decides to invest in Coke manufacturing. I'd go to their offices personally and laugh at their faces.<br><br>Cos' #1: there's such thing as patents. Nobody but licensed dealers are allowed to sell or manufacture Coke. Or else u'll see ur MAMA shopowner making his own Coke like teh tarik and sell them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Pls ask ur company to sell Coke or Macdonalds wadever u quoted. I'll be happy if u get slapped wif a lawsuit.<br><br>#2: Even the dumbest of the MLMer noes mkt dynamics. Coca-Cola company exercises a full monopoly over their products, and enjoys a gd reputation. Lemme see u succeed in selling Coke frm door to door, see which auntie would want to buy frm u. They might be wondering whether the Coke has been tampered wif or ur filthy hands haf stained the tins wif ur bacteria. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>FYI i was juz saying wat if... wat if......<br><br>anyway... i juz hope that u see things on a neutral point of view....<br><br>Now, u been eating this calcium tab u buy from Guardian.... so 1 day u freind in MLM says that he carry the same things same brand same packing for example u buy 80 from Guardian and getting from ur MLM friend is 60 same item same packing from the same factory even u ask guardian they can confirm so u will still buy from guardian??? or give up eating??..... Whn my mum was on Glucosamine, i realise my friend selling the same... i order from him cheaper... why??? Its not MLM but he is the supplier....again its my own network.... U might not be eating all this ur so called CRAP.... but 1 day u wana try and realise apart from buying off the shelves u can buy from ur friend in MLM u wont even consider eating it???<br><br>Why so narrow....<br><br>This will end my post.... whether i made my point or not its ok coz i know u guys juz wont accept it.... Well SGP government approved it in Yr 2000... Like it or not.... Its here and happening daily... unless u wont intro anything to anyone anymore.... Network will surely stop.....<br><br>NOTHING FURTHER OUT!<br></div>
