Especially for ordinary people like me. But my experiences tell me that people who made the withdrawal were very statisfied about getting back the 90%. All that they wanted to do is to disengage and not to have any association with Bel'Air in the future. They ran as fast as they could .... far away from commonwealth.<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>cheers,<br><br></div></blockquote>the question is how long do they need to wait to get back the full 90% refund if not more?</div>
