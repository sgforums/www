            <div class='col-md body'>First, we are in same boat. I lost my close friend because she decided to join Bel Air and ignored what I told her about it. Im so far away from Singapore to be able to do anything about this. I threw our relationship on the table to beg her to think again but there was no use at all. It was like 2 weeks already and I am worrying about this problem.<br><br>Second, as far as I know your friend can get 90% refund within 3 months according to Bel Air's site. So tell her to contact with Bel Air and ask for cancelling the contract. But I do not know when your friend will receive the money back. Maybe 1 month, 3 months or 1 year? God bless your freind and please tell me about results then.<br></div>

I got the same situation. My friend told me they convinced her to wait for them to find another replacement so she can get back 100%. But at that time she could get back 100%  without waiting because it was just 1 week. Now it is late and she has no choice but continue to test in the next 2 months before thinking about withdrawing with 90% left. But I am afraid that she wont withdraw after the next 2 months because they will try to prevent it and make it late for her agian. The problem is she believes in this group because they showed her their last month income was like 12k/month. I doubt it is fake or something?</div>

I am just thinking whether your friend can make a police report about losing the invoices and using that claim to request Bel'Air to reprint the invoice.<br><br>Your friend can seek help from CASE, I believe.

But as I asked if the upline decided to withdraw right after receiving the comission for recruting. So the company cant get the money back from the upline, rite? because the upline is not in the company anymore. He's gone with the money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok I see your question. Answer "NO" when the question ask. Let the company deal with it. The company will pay first.

Because they can claim it for 10% damage from your order that causes to the company. For example, shipping, handling cost, blah blah. But just give it a try!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As far as i know the 10% charge is on admin. In other words, after 14 days, they will charge 10% for the admin duties. Within 14 days they will not charge anything-means full 100% refund...since in 14 days it's difficult to say if this biz works for u.. u can nv get back ur full 100% refund.</div>
