            <div class='col-md body'>Did you realise that in Singapore, unless you get a good degree from a good uni, you can't really climb high? EVERYTHING's got to do with your education.<br><br>Those who had lesser education are often herded to "WISE" and "BEST" programs to upgrade themselves. Fair enough.. we need to train people as much as we can. End result is efficient productivity for the management, higher education for the worker bees.<br><br>Those who have good degrees, needless to say they soar up the ranks and get headhunted or hop from rank to rank upwards. Then they sit up there, making decisions from their smart but inexperienced brains. Mind you, there are some who are damn good (often revered as gods) and some who are clueless (often referred to as a tyrant).<br><br>And then there are US. Yes, we are those who make it past JC and Poly, but NUS/NTU don't think we are fit for their degree programs. For some like me who's parents worked hard 30 years to put me through uni overseas, we have the chance to trancend up to the next level, but only if we try damn hard. So how about those who missed out on the opportunity?<br><br>We can't be promoted to the middle management till like 10+ years of undying dog labour (meaning wether boss is good or not, just wag your damn tail). Our many years of hard work are no challange over a new guy who just graduated with honours in a good uni.<br><br>And when we really want to upgrade ourselves, there's another problem: finally when an overseas uni or local open uni program accepts us (feeling is like striking 4D), our employer would say that the uni is "not reconised". (I'm not going to explain about "Commenwealth Universities" stuff) So where do we go from here?<br><br>It's not easy for us overseas students trying to go back with a degree. Anyone who claims it's easy, please come here and try yourself. We struggle very hard, especially guys who get interrupted by NS. And what to the end of it? "Not reconised" degree.<br><br>Singapore employers, especially government sector, like to make their own "uni list" (usually the most kilat of the kilats). But what they don't realise that whilst they some overseas uni's courses as "under rated", the entire US and some parts of Australia do not reconize NUS/NTU either. (I laughed until peng san when I heard that).<br><br>So, any underachievers out there care to comment on this?<br><br>abaddon2000</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1st of all, nobody in this world is an underachiever. I'm almost in the same shoe as yours. Thou' "try hard", didnt managed 2 get into NTU/NUS. Found out that MOE(Ministry of Education) do not recognize my degree. Sobbed! Sobbed!<br>But I'm happy now, let's b more contented wif wat we have now. Tink on the bright side, pte sectors still 1 us, this is definitely not the end of the world 4 us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey! I am in the same shoes as well.I grad frm Poly and  I apply to the SMU.With an average result, I dun even get shortlisted for the interview. I doubt with a good SAT result, there will be any hope. I heard of somebody with a good SAT result but with an average A level result also did not get shortlisted as well.<br><br>I dun want my parents to work so hard juz to put me thr overseas uni so I started working first. It is not even easy to get loans and bursary for overseas study unlike in the US whereby banks give education loans easily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it really true?<br><br>I've heard some ppl telling me that a degree is very important to find a good job, not to mention a stable one, in the society. But there are also others who tell me that experience is more important. Which is it? Degree or experience?<br><br>And does oversea degree really lose out to local degree? I thought otherwise. But could anyone more in this line pls guide me along?<br><br>I'm in NS now. Will be resuming my studies next year, am really curious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look at it this way: since you don't have a degree or a recognised one, you have greater incentive to forge another path of your own. The potential gain is much higher if you succeed.<br><br>For graduates, their degree is as much a boon as a curse -- They may be so tied down by security and promise of promotion that they stay in paid jobs too long... so long that they have stopped thinking about how to improve themselves to realize their potential to a fuller extent.<br><br>'Forge your own path' and 'screw the paper'.<br><br>PS: Not 'screw the paper' and 'forge your path'. The order is still quite important, realistically speaking...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
