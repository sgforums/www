Thats what MLM is supposedly to be, giving people more returns for their effort, than the usual jobs in corporate world, where the boss earn millions, and workers just get pitiful increment for the millions they created for the boss.<br><br>If MLM cant do this, there is no need to differentiate MLM from other careers path out there.<br><br>If an upline recruited a few people, and each downline garner more personal sales than that single upline, and each downline train his own network to be more productive that the upline entire single network, relative comparing, it follows the downline should earn more percentages of the sales worth as commissions, at a progressive rate.<br><br>Besides, trying to cap downlines commission means two things - capping their motivation as well as potential, as well as acting in a pyramid like. Many of the grouses against MLM is that uplines earn by lazing around and letting their downline do the hard work. Potentially, networks will shift as soon as downlines realise their folly. It will be pyramidlike really, as soon as uplines shift from focusing on products, to just focusing on income earnings.<br><br>Besides, a upline shouldnt worry if a downline overtakes him. The increment of money due to the downline will be realised or not, depending on the compensation plan. In neither cases will the increment, if disallowed, will go to the upline anyway. I will raise an eyebrow if it did.<br><br>The upline should also be happier such increment motivates the downlines, as increase in group sales, increase his monies, even if percentage due is still the same. 10% of $10,000 worth of sales is different from 10% of $1 million  worth of sales.<br><br></div>
