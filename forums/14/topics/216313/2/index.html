In respone to false assertions by xango's attorney that BK had drained monies out of nv, bk's cousel did confirm bk have invested substantial monies over the past 10yrs into the holding company,international expasion &amp; the manufacturing company.This is what owner do when they believe in their business.Maybe when xango steps up &amp; open its own manufacturing plant,they'll have to invest in their business as well.<br>xango's chairman stated that the most recent Dunn&amp;Bradstreet reported that nv lost 90% og its sales. This is another blatant falsehood <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> . Dunn&amp;bradstreet has never,ever reported on our sales.Bk boreyko just check &amp; he invite anyone else to do so.

Mr hollister didn't approach BK's comment about VEMMA'sXANTHONES content equaling 14 bottles of xango, nor is xango saying that NV or VEMMA will not longer be able to sell a mangosteen product..<br>NV's commentary on tne Morinda Litigation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  This isn't my fight, nor would i want to be xango failing down morinda based on what i've learned about this case.

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>TOP SEVEN BENEFITS<br>OF THE XANGO COMPENSATION PLAN<br><br>INTRODUCTION.<br><br>At first glance, the XanGoÂ™ Compensation Plan appears simple.<br><br>IT IS.<br><br>This pay plan can be explained in fifteen minutes and is<br>quickly understood even to newcomers to network marketing.<br><br>At first glance, the XanGoÂ™ Compensation Plan may also appear to some<br>people as simplistic and unexciting.<br><br>IT'S NOT.<br><br>Delving into the components of this plan, one finds undeniable<br>and substantial reasons to find this plan to be genuinely exciting,<br>most lucrative, completely equitable and refreshingly honest.<br><br>Here are seven key reasons why you just have to love this plan.<br><br>1) IT'S SIMPLE AND EASY TO EXPLAIN.<br><br>Although it takes a few minutes to explain, those of us who've<br>worked other plans probably know just how complex a plan can be.<br>But pay plans that leave people with their head spinning is an<br>obstacle. The more people understand, the more confidence they<br>have that the plan can work for them.<br><br>XanGoÂ™'s pay plan is wonderfully and refreshingly very un-complex.<br>Combined with the other easy-to-understand components of our<br>story, this fuels duplication and ignites the growth of<br>our organizations!<br><br>2) XANGO's UNILEVEL IS BUILT RIGHT.<br><br>A well built unilevel allows everyone to be successful. I call it<br>"the pay plan of the people" because part-timers can still<br>potentially get a substantial pay check. Because our product is<br>consumable, income is truly residual.<br><br>Here are some outstanding aspects of XanGoÂ™'s unilevel:<br><br>*THERE IS NO LEG BALANCING! You can literally have all your<br>volume in ONE LEG! Compare that to other unilevels<br>wherein you can not be paid on the vast majority<br>of your sales volume because you are not "balanced"<br>between multiple legs.<br><br>*YOU CAN GO TO THE TOP OF THE PAY PLAN WITH 3 PERSONALLY ENROLLED DISTRIBUTORS. Naturally, you will want to<br>personally sponsor more, but you only need three<br>who duplicate...and if they end up in the same leg,<br>you can still have a great check! (Although this<br>is true, we are still recommending that one attempt<br>to have three distinct legs, as this tends to keep<br>the volume higher up in your pay stream which, in<br>turn, as your organization builds deeper, tends to<br>keep your paycheck higher.)<br><br>*BECAUSE YOU GO TO THE TOP BY HELPING AT LEAST THREE BECOME SUCCESSFUL, THIS PLAN INHERENTLY ENCOURAGES TEAMWORK.<br>We have a saying that "team work makes the dream<br>work." The only way a distributor reaches the top<br>position of premier (or any other title along the<br>way) is by helping their personally sponsored<br>distributors. This fact encourages "stacking"<br>distributors - placing people under people and<br>working closely with one's organization. Contrast<br>this dynamic with other pay plans that mostly<br>reward more and more personal recruiting without<br>helping those already onboard (or worse, offer<br>disincentives to helping others - such as your<br>"getting blocked" from certain bonuses when your<br>own people advance in the pay plan)!<br><br>*REASONABLE MONTHLY QUALIFICATIONS.<br>In the beginning, simply<br>order at least one case of XanGoÂ™ per month and you<br>receive your monthly check. At no achievement level<br>are you required to order more than two per month.<br>That's it. No high pressured sales requirements to<br>recruit half the world every month to be paid<br>either.<br><br>*GET PAID UP TO NINE LEVELS DEEP!<br>As you progress in<br>your achievement titles, you get paid up to nine<br>compressed levels in your organization.<br><br>3) NO REDUCTIONS/RATIOS ON VOLUME.<br><br>In simple English, what this means is that when you spend one hundred<br>dollars, you are credited one hundred dollars for your personal<br>volume. When someone in your organization spends one hundred dollars,<br>a full one hundred dollars is added to your group volume (GV).<br><br>Sounds logical, right? Yet, most nutritional company pay plans<br>usually convert every wholesale dollar spent into a fraction,<br>variously called CV (Commissionable Volume), BV (Bonus or<br>Business Volume), "points" etc. For example: You purchase a product<br>costing you $100 wholesale. The actual credit you end up receiving<br>may only be $50 or $60 in CV, BV, Points etc...and your commission<br>percentage is applied on THIS REDUCED FIGURE.<br><br>Sound confusing? It is!<br><br>The very fact that XanGoÂ™ doesn't play around with numbers like this<br>creates three distinct benefits:<br><br>*First, it KEEPS THINGS CLEAR AND SIMPLE - both for<br>distributors AND PROSPECTS!<br><br>*Second, it TRANSLATES INTO A GREATER PAYOUT THAN<br>THE ORIGINAL PERCENTAGES SUGGEST. Compare these two<br>examples: Example one involves a pay plan that pays<br>5% on the first level, but has a 50% reduced CV.<br>A person on your first level purchases $100. You<br>get paid on $50. 5% of $50 is $2.50, which is what<br>you receive in your check. Example two involves a<br>pay plan that again pays 5% on the first level,<br>but has no reduced CV. That's the XanGoÂ™ plan.<br>A person on your first level purchases $100. Since<br>you get paid 5% on the full $100, your commission is<br>$5.00 - TWICE AS MUCH.<br><br>*The Third Advantage is that it means that it can be<br>up to TWICE AS EASY to qualify for your pay titles<br>based on the same group volume when compared to<br>other plans.<br><br>Compounded with Dynamic Compression, we can begin to see the<br>exciting ways that XanGoÂ™'s unilevel plan can be actually quite<br>lucrative.<br><br>4) DYNAMIC COMPRESSION.<br><br>Dynamic Compression is one of the most dynamic and exciting<br>features of the XanGoÂ™ pay plan.<br><br>This feature alone can potentially increase your check by 10%,<br>20%, even 50% or more in some cases every month.<br><br>Here's how we explain Dynamic Compression...it takes more than<br>a few words, but it's worth the effort...<br><br>Most networkers know how regular compression works.<br><br>An example of normal compression might go something like this: you<br>have a leg with a person on every level down to the tenth. Say, for<br>purposes of this illustration that you hold the achievement title of<br>Premier and are paid through the ninth level. At the close of the<br>month, the computer reads the orders for the month and notices that<br>the person on your third level didn't order, but everyone else did.<br>Therefore, the fourth level person will move up to the third position,<br>the fifth level person will move up to the fourth level position, etc.<br>The net result is that, not only are there no gaps but your tenth<br>level person actually moves up into your pay stream...at least<br>for this particular month.<br><br>That's normal compression.<br><br>XanGoÂ™ has normal compression, as do many other companies.<br><br>But XanGoÂ™ has something that's almost unheard of in our industry:<br>Dynamic Compression.<br><br>Dynamic Compression goes something like this:<br><br>Say you are a Premier and you are entitled to being paid<br>on nine levels. For purposes of illustration, say you have<br>a front line distributor who has people on all of his or her<br>nine levels, but has only qualified themselves to earn on,<br>say, five levels. Normally, in most every other company,<br>your front line distributor would collect a check on what they are<br>qualified for. The volume they could potentially be paid on (but<br>are not - at least at the time of the commission run) which is,<br>in our example, the volume under their fifth level...would NOT be<br>paid on. It would "break" or be "flushed" back to the company,<br>keeping the company profits higher. There's nothing wrong or<br>unethical about this...it's just how it works.<br><br>In Dynamic Compression, there is NO BREAKAGE TO THE COMPANY.<br>Instead, this unpaid commission is actually paid out. The<br>computer continues to search upline for each qualified position<br>to be paid out greatly increasing the depth that you can be paid to.<br><br>Here's an example:<br>We know the payout amounts are as follow:<br>Level 1 = 5%<br>Level 2 = 5%<br>Level 3 = 10%<br>Level 4 = 5%<br>Level 5 = 5%<br>Level 6 = 5%<br>Level 7 = 5%<br>Level 8 = 5%<br>Level 9 = 2%<br>-------------------<br>Total: 47% (with 3% going to the Global Bonus Pool).<br><br>Now, when the computer systems go to figure out how to pay those commissions... it actually looks at the plan from the bottom up. Start at the bottom with the $100, and work your way back UP the list.<br><br>* NOTE: PR = Preferred Rep, gets 3 levels... R=REP, gets 2 levels)<br><br>PREMIER - $2 (2% paid for 9th level)<br>5K - $0<br>PREMIER - $5 (5% paid for 8th level)<br>20K - $5 (5% paid for 7th level)<br>1K - $0<br>20K - $5 (5% paid for 6th level)<br>5K - $0<br>PR - $0<br>R - $0<br>5K - $5 (5% paid for 5th level)<br>1K - $0 (only qualified for 4 levels)<br>1K - $5 (5% paid for 4th level)<br>PR - $10 (10% paid for 3rd level)<br>R - $0 (only qualified to 2 levels)<br>5K - $5 (5% paid for 2nd level)<br>1K - $5 (5% paid for 1st level)<br>PR = Purchases $100<br><br>In this example, you can see that the computer continues to search UP from the purchase until it finds a qualified distributor for each level of paid commissions.<br><br>The PREMIER at top gets $2 on someone on his 16th level. The second PREMIER is getting $5 for someone on his 14th level. Even the 20K is getting paid on his 13th level (when the unilevel just says 7 levels). Do you see the power of dynamic compression! As you qualify for the levels 1K, 5K, 20K and premier... you increase how many levels you get paid on AND how likely you are to get rollup commissions.<br><br>5) XANGO MAINTAINS A 50% PAYOUT.<br><br>Because of Dynamic Compression, "breakage" that usually goes back to<br>the company in other pay plans gets paid to qualified distributors<br>in the XanGoÂ™ pay plan.<br><br>Therefore, the company-wide payout percentage to XanGoÂ™ distributors<br>is always the same.<br><br>In XanGoÂ™'s case, the payout to distributors is 50 cents on the<br>dollar. "Half to the company, half to the distributors."<br><br>This creates stability and completely eliminates the need for the<br>company to change the plan later due to breakage or profitability<br>problems.<br><br>How important is this?<br><br>Those distributors who've been in this industry for a while know<br>about the problem of pay plan changes all too well. A company will<br>have a pay plan that can have a potential payout of 60 or 65% or<br>maybe more. But the fact is, the way the downline organizations<br>are built, a good deal of potential commissions are never paid...<br>at least for a while. Since they are NOT using Dynamic Compression,<br>the unpaid moneys "break back" or are "flushed back" to the company.<br><br>The computer models the company will run for the pay plan depend on<br>this. So, although a plan might POTENTIALLY pay out 65%, it<br>may ACTUALLY only pay out, say, 42% on a company wide basis.<br><br>The problem arises as downline organizations mature and more and<br>more distributors qualify for more and more of the commissions.<br>Eventually, the company might find itself paying out 58% or 60%<br>and realizes that it just can't afford - or simply is not willing -<br>to do so.<br><br>Enter pay plan "revisions," "upgrades," or (my favorite euphemism)<br>"enhancements." Suddenly - sometimes overnight - distributors<br>find themselves required to jump through new hoops and hurdles<br>just to maintain their present checks. The net result is that<br>many distributors do not qualify and their check goes down.<br>(And company profits go up again...which was the goal.)<br>The other unfortunate and sometimes tragic consequence is that<br>distributor upset interferes with normal business, momentum is<br>lost, and some, if not many, distributors quit. Some companies<br>and certainly many hard working dedicated distributors never<br>regain their momentum after these types of pay plan changes.<br><br>A CONSTANT PAYOUT LIKE XANGO'S CAN COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THESE PROBLEMS!<br><br>6) XANGO'S PAY PLAN COMES WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY!<br><br>This may seem self evident, but it is fundamental. A 90% payout<br>on a product no one wants or will buy is not as good as a<br>one percent payout that everyone on the planet wants and will<br>buy. An extreme illustration but it makes the point.<br><br>XanGoÂ™ has an incredible product with mass appeal. The track<br>record of our management team as well as how functional<br>beverages in network marketing have performed over the years<br>indicate that XanGoÂ™ could reach $500 million to $1 billion<br>a year in worldwide sales. And...our timing is impeccable<br>since we are positioning ourselves at the beginning!<br><br>The stature of the company, the mass appeal and value of<br>our product and the growth projections are the CONTEXT<br>that make the XanGoÂ™ compensation plan work! As one<br>distributor who's joined us has said, "With XanGo, I'm<br>trading in my current five figure monthly income<br>(he's earning $50,000 a month right now in another<br>company!) for a six figure one."<br><br>7) XANGO PROVIDES 3 WAYS TO GET PAID: WEEKLY, MONTHLY, AND QUARTERLY.<br><br>*WEEKLY. Earn up to 30% of your personally sponsored person's<br>first order when you are on auto delivery. Earn 15% of<br>your personally sponsored person's personally sponsored<br>people's first order when you are on the 200 auto<br>delivery program. GET PAID WEEKLY.<br><br>*MONTHLY. Earn 5%, 10%, and 2% on various levels up to nine<br>levels deep on your MONTHLY UNILEVEL CHECK. As we<br>saw above, these percentages are sometimes doubled<br>or tripled depending on Dynamic Compression in your<br>organization.<br><br>*QUARTERLY. And as you advance, profit share with the entire<br>company worldwide volume. 3% of net profits is placed into a<br>Global Bonus Pool that is shared amongst the top leaders --<br>based on their volume and level of achievement.<br>GET PAID QUARTERLY.<br><br>*************************************************<br>--TOP SEVEN BENEFITS OF THE XANGO COMPENSATION PLAN-- (SUMMARIZED)<br><br>1) SIMPLE AND EASY TO EXPLAIN = Increased confidence and quicker<br>duplication.<br><br>2) UNILEVEL BUILT RIGHT = Good for both part time and full time<br>distributors/ No leg balancing/ Go to the top with 3/<br>Encourages teamwork and synergy/ Easy monthly qualifications/<br>Get paid up to nine levels deep.<br><br>3) NO REDUCED VOLUMES = A dollar is a dollar/ Simple to understand/<br>Translates into 50-100% greater payout when compared to<br>to other pay plans, than the numbers first suggest.<br><br>4) DYNAMIC COMPRESSION = Commissions that are unqualified for<br>compress up to the next entitled distributor/ Can increase<br>your check by 10%, 20%, or more.<br><br>5) XANGO MAINTAINS A CONSTANT 50% PAYOUT =<br>This means distributors don't have to worry about abrupt or<br>major pay plan changes designed to correct profitability problems<br>that many companies typically experience when the payout is not<br>constant.<br><br>6) XANGO'S PAY PLAN COMES WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY =<br>Because pay plans and payouts are nothing without the<br>context of the company, the management team, the<br>mass appeal and marketability of the product,<br>and the timing and growth possibilities, XanGo<br>provides the most exciting possibility for network<br>marketing success for the foreseeable future.<br>A consumable product translates into truly residual<br>income.<br><br>7) GET PAID IN THREE DISTINCT WAYS =<br>Get weekly upfront money on first orders, a monthly<br>unilevel paycheck and, when you advance to the title of<br>Premier, a quarterly profit sharing check.<br><br>**************************************<br>IT'S GO TIME!<br><br>SUMMARY.<br><br>As you can see, a closer look at the XanGo compensation plan<br>reveals that it has been brilliantly thought out and was powerfully<br>created to accomplish the one thing such pay plans are intended to<br>accomplish:<br><br>To richly reward distributors when they build their business, no<br>matter how small or how large, no matter if they are part time or<br>full time.<br><br>In addition, this pay plan removes the smoke and mirrors we see<br>so often in the network marketing industry. It's honesty and<br>straightforwardness is indeed refreshing.<br><br>Moreover, the XanGo pay plan is proactive in preventing problems<br>or disruptive changes later on.

            <div class='col-md body'>Binary is Two people in width and unlimited depth. It pays on volume cycles, when a fixed amount of volume accumulates in each of the sides a commision is paid.<br><br>My problem with the binary compensation model is three fold:<br><br>1: You are paid on the "Matching Volume" which means the lowest volume leg is the deciding factor. When you get a cheque, there is always a feeling of "Leaving Money on the Table" (not healthy for motivation).<br><br>2: With the explosion of Powerlines using the binary plan it has magnified the fact that when people realize that they have to build there very own leg (powerline) starting from 0. It is a slap in the face, and then a slap in the face for everyone that comes on board. So the fact that the powerline has 100s of members is irrelevent, people feel deceived and that is because they were.<br><br>3: The promised or marketed payout normally does not work mathematically, so read the qualifications carefully, there is normally a clause that states "A maximum of X% will be paid out in Commissions". It may never affect you, but I find it to be deceptive marketing.<br><br>With that said, there are some good honest companies that have done very well with the binary comp plan.<br><br>If you realize what to watch for, and are ready to "balance" your legs, and feel your team would be motivated to do the same, Good Luck.<br><br>Remember I told you, I would not put all my eggs in this basket.<br></div>
