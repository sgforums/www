Bk boreyko,president and ceo of NV and vemma, stated, "you don't have to be a lawyer to understand if they don't have a patent,then they don't have a law suit for infringement. First that xango's patent wold be invalidated because u can't patent fruit juices.Second even assuming their patent was enforceable, NV and vemma'smangosteen product does not infringe on their patent.<br>Rather, xango is frustrated and embarrassed that NV and vemma have produce superiour mangosteen juice into the market place.The independent test result don't lie...vemma contains a full spectrum of natural xanthones derived from mangosteen and pericarp extract...<span style="color: darkred;"></span>In fact, it take 14 bottles of xango to equal the xanthone content of 1 bottle of vemma</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I understand, Xango uses dynamic compression for levels beyond the "physical" 9th generation. For example if your downline is on the 15th level but in between there are some people who achieved the "same" levels (e.g. 5 people are "20k" in a row.), you still can be paid on the 15th level so long as it's still within the 9 generations. That is if you achieved the minimum rank of "Premier".<br><br>In short, you will still be compensated up to 9 levels but the person can be beyond the 9 level.</div>

Only in 12 markets currently, they have already exceed half a billion dollars of turnover.<br><br>From my limited research, the fastest growing MLM company to hit the 1 billion dollar turnover is Nu Skin. And it took them about 14 years to do it. Xango vowed to do it in 7 years.<br><br>I would rate Xango as the iPod of MLM industry. Though not the best product, they will continue to be the leader in the mangosteen juice supplement field. Competitors with better products and compensation plans can never hope to win Xango, much like Coke and Pepsi. The only downfall of Xango is itself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New VisionÂ’s Struggling Business<br>In addition to presenting inaccurate information in its statement, New Vision also fails to disclose the present circumstances of its own business.<br><br>Just three weeks ago in open court, New VisionÂ’s attorney stated that Mr. Boreyko had to funnel $3 million of his own money into the business last year. This fact is in contrast to BoreykoÂ’s recent public statements about his past business success. Based on the most recent Dunn &amp; Bradstreet reports, the 10-year-old New Vision company has lost 90 percent of its sales over the last eight years and continues to trend down.<br><br>New VisionÂ’s attempt at a mangosteen drink was in response to XanGoÂ’s category creation success. Faced with such formidable competition, New Vision has resorted to its unfortunate campaign of misinformation.</div>
