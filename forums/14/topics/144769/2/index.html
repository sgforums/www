If you watch a lousy movie, I am pretty sure you will tell your friends that the movie sucks, period. Will you do the same with your own MLM products? I believe human are always bias therefore, I cant agree with you that you can sell by just sharing of product knowledge, more over those information that you are sharing are the exact information that the MLM companies want you to share. Those to me are most like sales pitch of something.<br><br>I personally feel that most MLM products cant be scientificially proven to work like what they try to promised. and I do believe that most people buy MLM to sell instead of buying them to use. How often to you get repeated buyer who are user themselve for the product alone?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I agree with you, that is why even for our company, any products that we personally either feel too ex or not comfortable, we DO not share at all. We only share those that we know it is really good for them, and worth it.<br><br>And yes, there are many products out there that does not work well. That is why it is very important to choose a company that has its own R&amp;D, manufactures its own products, and provides the best quality at the very best. And my company does just that, and this thus gives me the confidence to be able to share the goodness of the company, without having any doubts. I have to do my own research and analysis and present what I personally think of the products, not what they want me to say etc.<br><br>I personally use some of the products daily, and I just treat them as any normal items that I will use. It is the same for everybody, if someone wants the something, I just sell them lor, then follow-up with them to provide service on the products, whether how they find it etc. It is all part of making our customers feel at home too. If they find it good, they will continue to use the products again.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazelle:</div><div class="quote_body">There is actually a difference between sharing a movie and sharing a MLM products. If you watch a lousy movie, I am pretty sure you will tell your friends that the movie sucks, period. Will you do the same with your own MLM products? I believe human are always bias therefore, I cant agree with you that you can sell by just sharing of product knowledge, more over those information that you are sharing are the exact information that the MLM companies want you to share. Those to me are most like sales pitch of something.<br><br>I personally feel that most MLM products cant be scientificially proven to work like what they try to promised. and I do believe that most people buy MLM to sell instead of buying them to use. How often to you get repeated buyer who are user themselve for the product alone?<br><br></div></blockquote>Some people have this mentallity, I watch this movie which is damn lousy, I will tell people the movie is very good, ask them to go and watch, eventually I am happy cos a lot of others will share my misery. What do this group of people gain, NOTHING.<br><br>Now there is an opportunity for you to have some monetary gains, what will this group of people do? Try as hard as possible to con people in buying products which they themselves do not like it.<br><br>Have you ever eat some food and encounter lousy services.  What do you tell yourself.  Never go back to the stall/shop and tell the whole world how lousy the food/service.<br><br>So ultimately, that will depends on the ethics, trustworthiness of the person who introduce the product to you.  If the main objective is to just earn money from you then they will lose a customer forever.<br><br>If the MLM companies products sucks, how long do you think the can survive in this market. 1-2yrs or 10yrs-20yrs.<br><br>If I company can survive for over 40yrs and their pioneer product is still selling in the market so what do you think?<br><br>I do not know how other MLM works, in our centre the very first thing which we learn is to use the product first, only when you are satisfied with it then you go ahead and share it with your family and friends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Firstly, you have to define the meaning of being expensive. Before one can say a product is truly expensive, has one actually went out to try the products, experience and use it?<br><br>I feel that if none of the above is done, one cannot have the right to say a certain range of products is expensive etc. It is only fair to everybody, from the manufacturer to even the distributors and the customers etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers<br></div>

Quality, it is value for money, is it worth paying a premium or just purely because never mind lah, can use ok liao attitude.<br><br>Why do people buy BMW, Mercedes even though they can buy Toyota, Honda or even Kelisa or Kia.<br><br>The must be some value in the product which they like.<br><br>For Amway's product I can't say it's the best in the market but one of the best.  But if you compare quality with other branded items then I can proudly say yes they are on par or even better.<br><br>I dare to even say their health supplement NUTRILITE is the only global vitamin and mineral brand to grow, harvest and process plants on their own certified organic farms (base on international market research firm Euromonitor Consultancy).  Nutrilite is also awarded Reader Digest Superbrands Asia Gold Award for Vitamins/Health Supplement  2005 voted by consumers.<br><br>As a distributor, it is not convincing if we say how good Amway's product is but if there is report and award it just prove that we do not just say anything without showing proof.<br></div>
