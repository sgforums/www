But I do agree that doing MLM in S'pore is not easy becos of the mindset of most ppl that we had to approach our friends and relative to start with. Many think that they don't feel comfortable earning their $.<br><br>MLM income is not stable and I had ever earned as high as $10K for months before and also as low as $500 to $800 for serveral months as well. It worse usually after festive seasons when downlines are "too high" to work in those months. Then our network suffered.<br><br>We contribute to CPF by banking in the $ ourselves. The company will not contribute for us. We are actually self-employed.<br><br>Yes, I agree that initially I do have the feelings that my friends are avoiding me when I started doing MLM. I never forced someone to join me and soon they realised and understand that staying as friends and doing MLM is a seperate thing, they still keep in contact with me! In fact, some even supported me by buying products from me!<br><br>It's all about how we feel and how we treat our friends.</div>

Hence, i report my company had 100% increase in profit!!!.<br><br>MLM, average USD$ 2000. As u mentioned, 6 billion of sales from 3 million agent,  same for bank account, there are SGD XXXXX amount of money in DBS bank, and there are YYY million of customers, so average savings for singaporeans is SGD ZZZZZ . And conclude, oh singapore are rich ppl. So, averaging doesnt work for certain things.  Because u know, there are millionaire/ billionaire...but is not our money, how could we average it out<br><br>Same applies to MLM, some ppl are high profile people, selling in bulks, thousands , rich to rich ppl connection. These ppl buy for the sake of connection, but those who are not powerful enough, who cares about having " connection " with you.<br><br>Hope u get what i am trying to say. Maths can play tricks, and ppl do know how to use it to con ppl.</div>
