I didn't know that it was MLM but i thought only sales or other thing lah. I go there I kena kpkb by 3 or 4 MLM agents lor...all my friend's "bosses".<br><br>I damn pissed lor. Kena kpkb by some chao ah beng who simply got lucky. Keep saying that I cannot meet life's demands and I will have a hard life in SG unless I have some unconventional means of economic suvival through MLM. Say that I have no achievements cannot depend on a stable job for income(KNS I dun want to reveal my achievements to him only mah)<br><br>All the young people around my age doing MLM now. Army and JC people. Stupid lor. I asked two of my friends how much they pay to join the schemes. 3xxx and 2xxx respectively. NABEI NEED AT LEAST 3 OR 4 YEARS TO REGAIN THAT MONEY LOR IN MLM...unless u are one of the few of the thousands lucky enough.<br><br>Even if you can earn, so what? Super unethical lor. You pay money to peopel who join the scheme earlier...others who join later than u pay you. Goods are not marketed to ordinary consumers....they are sold to future members in the MLM scheme. What are the "goods" in most of these MLM schemes? Educational materials on how to market stuff. chao chee bye.</div></blockquote>hmm brother!!! i think u r rite ... is totally wrong that if goods are onli sold to ppl who join them .... but ar there s company that gt goods which are sold to ppl who din join them cause the product is gd then ppl buy lo... therefore  i think ar in this trade u dun really earn money through recuiting...if u earn money all by through recuiting ar sumthing is wrong liao lor cause it seems that ur product dun have the market lo... then u will keep findin new ppl to join u then in the end no ppl join then u no income liao ...just sharing wat i feel <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
