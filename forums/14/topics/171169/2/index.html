            <div class='col-md body'>Don't trust people from mlm when they tell you that "Money work for you".  In MLM, you need to build hard and work your ass off to succeed.  I do value Michelle's contribution as  she has worked hard in her business to be able to save up. Now she has the option of letting her money work for her.<br><br>Tony pointed out "one billion ways".  I am curious, what is the one billions way? Its damn easy to say it.  What has common sense got to do with this? Who actually brand the other party as "no common sense"?  one billion ways = common sense???? Not to mentioned one billion, just name us one million ways to make money ok. No one in this world can actually name one million ways to make money...NONE. No statistic or record have shown that.  (Not to mentioned 1 billion ways).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why MLM works for some and not the many.<br><br>Reason: The some are genuine, sincere &amp; hardworking people who do not attend to cheat their friends.  The many who did not make are people who are greedy &amp; thinks that they can get instant cash back without working at it.<br><br>Come on, there is no such thing as easy money in this world unless you are rich to begin with.  If you have no money, you will have to work for your money.  When you have enough money to invest &amp; put it into fixed deposit then you can put the money to work for you.<br><br>I have been involved in an MLM company for a year now.  I do not confess that I am very successful at it but I am making good spare income of $500 a month.  I am not hard up to be successful to make thousands but I do enjoy this little windfall every month.  But the joy is to help your friends who need the kind of services &amp; products provided by the company.  In this way, your friends will not run away from you because you will not be associated with an MLM company but a friend who is sincerely, a friend.<br><br>People, don't be greedy and most importantly not to exploit your friends just to have a temporary quick fix.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for people who feel cheated and want a refund. Please refer to the Bel Air topic posting earlier. normally fot at least 60 days refund as stated in MLM act. So if you got in and feel it is wrong, just get a copy of the MLM act from the MTI website throw it at the admin's officer face in the MLM company and demand a refund in accordance with what is stated in the act. Usually 14-30 days from joining to get a full refund. Nothing wrong with MLM with the company is operating within the guidelines, problem is that many of the recruiters do not and end up misrepresenting the income opportunities as well as hiding info like failure rates. As with most MLM companies, you can make money usually  if you are early, God bless those who got in late as you will be climbing a mountain to achieve similar results as people joining early.</div>
