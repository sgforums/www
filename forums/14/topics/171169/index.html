            <div class='col-md body'>Threadstarter I agree totally with you.<br><br>My good friend brought me to shenton way to introduce me to a 'great job' that he has just started doing. I didn't know that it was MLM but i thought only sales or other thing lah. I go there I kena kpkb by 3 or 4 MLM agents lor...all my friend's "bosses".<br><br>I damn pissed lor. Kena kpkb by some chao ah beng who simply got lucky. Keep saying that I cannot meet life's demands and I will have a hard life in SG unless I have some unconventional means of economic suvival through MLM. Say that I have no achievements cannot depend on a stable job for income(KNS I dun want to reveal my achievements to him only mah)<br><br>All the young people around my age doing MLM now. Army and JC people. Stupid lor. I asked two of my friends how much they pay to join the schemes. 3xxx and 2xxx respectively. NABEI NEED AT LEAST 3 OR 4 YEARS TO REGAIN THAT MONEY LOR IN MLM...unless u are one of the few of the thousands lucky enough.<br><br>Even if you can earn, so what? Super unethical lor. You pay money to peopel who join the scheme earlier...others who join later than u pay you. Goods are not marketed to ordinary consumers....they are sold to future members in the MLM scheme. What are the "goods" in most of these MLM schemes? Educational materials on how to market stuff. chao chee bye.</div>

No matter how hard we work throughtout the year the most we can bring home is 1 k per month.(BTW we work for a year.)<br>It is only when we fall sick and think back , we realised we wasted so much time. We left the MLM after that cos we think that is just not the place for us.<br><br>I believe this is the best decision we make in our life.<br><br>Within a year, both of us got a gal friend. (MLM no time)<br>2 nd year my 1st and 2nd bike . (Paid in full using Cash about 14 K)<br>3 nd year My 1st investment in stock. ( At least 30 k cash)<br>4 th year My wedding and my 3rd bike ( 60 +k cash paid in full.)<br>5 th Year My first home cum renovation. (CPF contribute 80+ k and 80 k cash paid in full for my renovation and Audio hifi system )<br>I also think My saving now can get a Japanese car anytime and yes paid in full.<br><br>I believe my friend who quit together with me are doing much better than me.<br>I would never get to  know my wife , get to have a home , support my parents and have that type of luxury if i would stick to MLM.<br><br>After coming across this forum recently I cant help but really like to share my experience.<br>Looking back , I told my friend just 2 days ago how lucky we were.<br>At the same time feel sorry as some of our friends who are still doing MLM.<br>Despite various advice in the hope that they will listen to us and stop wasting their youth.<br>They are still thinking they might make it one of these day and earn big bucks..<br>One thing for sure is that I admire them for their fighting spirit which I lack off.<br>But other than that see for yourself.<br>Are really making big bucks as some of them may claim ?<br><br>Sorry for the broken english cos I am lowly educated.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh Gosh.  Pretty sure most of you are BOYS right??  Please be like one ok.  When I read the thread, I can't imagine a group of guys bitching about what they don't like. ONLY GALS do that!!!!!!<br><br>Simple, if you don't like MLM, than forget about it. Invest your time elsewhere, it will be more productive.<br><br>Well, I can't remember who state "there are a billion ways to make money".... Its always easy to just say it.  But when come to the real offering, there is nothing that those who said it can offer.  Ok, if there are a billion way "name the billion ways"? Have you tried doing all of them? If not, based on what ground do you state that they can make money??  If mlm are a group of people who BULLSHIT!!! Than making a comment of "1 billion ways" warrant the words "BULLSHIT too".<br><br>I have friends who always stopped people from venturing into business and often give advice that it is risky, it is not worth it, it is going to be hard etc....... After making all those comments, they have NO solution at all.  They said business will lose money, business is not for me etc........ If I have listened to them, than I would have been really unhappy now as I hated my job (At that time, my job is on the line for retrenchment).

I always get swarmed and gang up by those kpkb people and for me, I always feel vulnerable. One of the most idiotic MLM company is Cosmestics Laboratories... My friends joined and keep persuading me to join, some even ask me to borrow money from the bank, a few thousands dollars to join, sure can earn back one, what if I can't, then I have a few thousand dollars debts to pay for, and my friends enjoying part of that few thousands I paid to join?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, its definitely a waste of time to vent any anger or opinion here.  I have been invited to attend a number of mlm companies over the last few months.  There  are many of them whom are not professional at all.  I do come acrossed those who were professioanl about it, they stated the facts and thats about it, they do not push you like others.  We are still good friends though I did not joined him in that company.<br><br>Well, probably this site is meant for venting anger and for group of people to cry foul and hugging eaching other.
