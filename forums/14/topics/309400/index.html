                      <div>
                      <p><strong><span class="update">December, 2007</span></strong></p>
                      <p><span class="update"><span class="newsleft"><strong>"If MLM is operating fraudulently, why doesn't the government do something about it?" readers and financial analysts often ask</strong>. </span></span></p>
                      <p><span class="update"><span class="newsleft">Exposés,
                      complaints and lawsuits abound against MLM. The standard business
                      practices of the multi-level marketing industry are in flagrant
                      violation of FTC policies and three federal court rulings that define
                      illegal pyramid sales schemes. A simple business model analysis reveals
                      that the program is an income transfer, not a market-based sales
                      program and that lack of retail sales guarantees a 99% loss rate among
                      investors (salespeople). <br> <br> </span></span><span class="update"><span class="newsleft">An
                      exposé on NBC Dateline (May 7, 2004) brought hidden cameras into
                      Quixtar/Amway recruitment meetings to document deceptive claims and
                      promises and to expose a multi-million dollar 'secret' business.<br> <br> Yet most assume that MLM is generally a viable business. </span></span></p>
                      <p><span class="update"><span class="newsleft">One
                      probable reason for this is the seven-year silence that has prevailed
                      in law enforcement on multi-level marketing, giving the business a new
                      aura of legitimacy. </span></span></p>
                      <p><span class="update"><span class="newsleft">Few
                      people are aware of the powerful political influence of the MLM
                      industry, which might provide this recent immunity. MLM's top priority
                      is not just to curry favoritism and receive income at the public
                      trough, but to <em>literally protect its very existence</em>. Only the tobacco industry has as much at stake in its political lobbying and its public marketing campaign.<br> </span></span></p>
                      <p><span class="update"><span class="newsleft">Recently,
                      the political influence of the Amway Corporation, the oldest, largest
                      and most politically connected MLM, has gained notoriety.<br> </span></span></p>
                      <p><span class="newsleft"><span class="newsleft"><span class="update">-- <a title="Amway.Blackwater Marriage" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15276488">It was revealed</a> that Betsy Prince, sister of Erik Prince, the founder of the
                      politically powerful military contracting firm of Blackwater (recently
                      accused of crimes in Iraq and gaining immunity from law enforcement),
                      is married to Dick DeVos, the son of the founder of Amway. The
                      Prince/DeVos marriage, which links Blackwater and Amway, created what
                      is being called the most politically influential family in the
                      Republican Party. Erik Prince has been a steady contributor to the
                      Republican National Committee, giving more than $200,000 since 1998. He
                      also has supported various conservative candidates, including President
                      Bush, Sens. Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Rick Santorum (R-PA), Rep. Duncan
                      Hunter (R-CA), and indicted former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay
                      (R-TX).</span></span></span></p>

                      The above referenced wife of Dick Devos (sister of Erik Prince), Betsy
                      DeVos, has served as chair of the Michigan Republican Party. In 2000
                      she won special status as a so-called "Pioneer" after raising $100,000
                      for the Bush/Cheney campaign.</span></span></span></p>
                      <p>--<span class="newsleft"><span class="newsleft"><span class="update"> In 2006, Dick DeVos ran unsuccessfully for the governorship of
                      Michigan. Had he won, some analysts think he would have had a shot at
                      running for President!<br> </span></span></span></p>
                      <p><span class="newsleft"><span class="newsleft"><span class="update"> -- Amway founders and top guns have contributed millions to Republican
                      congress members and to President Bush. This was rewarded in 2001 with
                      Pres. Bush's appointment of Timothy Muris, an attorney that worked for
                      Amway, as chairman of the FTC. Muris has since left the FTC and several
                      key Amway protectors in Congress (e.g. Rich Santorum in PA and Tom
                      Delay in TX) were defeated.</span></span></span></p>
                      <p><span class="newsleft">-- As FTC Chairman, </span>Muris
                      appointed David Scheffman as the FTC’s new Chief Economist. Prior to
                      his appointment, during Clinton administration, David Scheffman
                      testified <em>against</em> the FTC and on behalf of the MLM scheme,
                      Equinox International (which was later shut down as part of a
                      settlement). As an expert witness for the pyramid scam, Scheffman
                      argued that the Equinox scheme was legitimate, not a pyramid scheme.
                      His claim was largely based on the assertion that Equinox operated just
                      like Amway. The FTC charged that Equinox was a pyramid scheme fraud.</p>
                      <p><span class="newsleft"><span class="newsleft"><span class="update"> -- According to the consumer watchdog group Common Cause, Amway and
                      affiliated donors made soft money contributions to the Republican
                      National Committee totaling $4,147,000 between January 1, 1991 and June
                      30, 1997<br> <br> -- In 2000, Amway “soft money contributions to the Republican National Party totaled $1,138,500.<br> <br> -- In 2004, the 527 “Progress for America” received money from Amway.
                      “The latest crop of donors includes Amway founders Richard DeVos and
                      Jay Van Andel, who each chipped in $2 million.” (Newsweek, “The Secret
                      Money War,” September 20, 2004.)<br> <br> -- In 1999, the inaugural fundraising event for the Republican Majority
                      Issues Committee (RMIC ) was held aboard the DeVos family yacht. The
                      RMIC, a "527" organization, was founded by Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas).
                      The committee declared its intention to "identify, educate, and
                      mobilize conservative voters in key House races."
                      (http://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/mojo_400/12_devos.html)<br> <br> -- Describing the events at the 2000 Republican Convention in
                      Philadelphia, the New York Times wrote, “For the party’s top
                      underwriters, there will be an array of gold-plated events in
                      Philadelphia, including cocktails with Gen. Colin L. Powell and an
                      evening cruise on the Delaware River aboard the ‘Enterprise,’ the yacht
                      owned by Richard M. DeVos, the Amway founder.<br> <br> -- At the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York insiders were
                      feted aboard Dick and Betsy DeVos’ yacht, as well as Jay Van Andel’s
                      lavish 169- footer.” (Kathleen Gray, Detroit Free Press, 9/2/04)</span></span></span></p>

                      In a 1997 article, nationally syndicated columnist, Molly Ivins,
                      reported that the budget package passed by Congress that year provided
                      a tax break “worth $283 million to one corporation: Amway.” <br> Ivins
                      noted, “The company and its top leaders have contributed at least $4
                      million to the Republican Party during the past four years, so that’s a
                      $4 million investment in campaign contributions with a $283 million
                      payoff for Amway.” <br> “The payoff for Amway was not in the original House or the Senate
                      version of the tax bill,” she wrote. “House Speaker Newt Gingrich
                      intervened at the last minute to help get the special tax break
                      inserted in the bill.”<br> Describing this special tax break, Common Cause reported: “Buried in
                      the 1997 budget and tax deal is Provision C, Section XI. The provision…
                      reads: ‘Modification of passive foreign investment company provisions
                      to eliminate overlap with subpart F and to allow market-to-market
                      election, and to modify asset measurement rule.’ In other words... the
                      provision primarily benefits Amway Corp. and could be worth millions of
                      dollars to (Amway).”</span></span></span><span class="newsleft"><span class="update"><br> </span></span></p>

                      of them earned on average just $27 (£13.53) a year. <a title="Amway on Trial in the UK" href="http://www.pyramidschemealert.org/PSAMain/news/AmwayOnTrialinEngland.html">More…</a></span></p>

                      assert that there is no retail "direct selling" opportunity, only an
                      endless chain recruitment program. The suit was brought by Boies,
                      Schiller and Flexner.</span></p>

                      that Amway is deceiving Indian citizens and causing large-scale
                      financial losses by perpetrating a pyramid scheme.</span></p>
                      <p><span class="update">-- <a href="http://www.pyramidschemealert.org/PSAMain/news/ChinaoutlawsMLM.html">China, the largest market in the world, has effectively shut Amway out of that country.</a> The government of China allowed Amway to gain a licence but strictly
                      prohibited Amway from using its pyramid recruitment pay plan. No Amway
                      distributor can earn money from purchases of others in a downline.
                      Without the false lure of the endless chain, Amway's sales will wither
