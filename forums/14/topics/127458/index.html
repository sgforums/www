I had paid up to 5k. I sign the contract under pressure of the strong sales tactic and now I regreted. I am paying the membership by installments and still have outstanding of 5K to go before I finish paying. Now I decided to terminate but they say contracted stated that I cannot cancel the membership if so I had to pay full amount of the balance. I wonder is there anyway I can cancel the membership. There is an error in the contract which is my address was wrong. Although I had paid in 2 yrs of installments I only found out they got my add wrong and mail all receipts to another address during beginning of the yr. What I want now is to cancel the membership without paying any more money. They told me they normally will win these type of cases if brought to the law. Since their is a fault in the address is there any way I can win? maybe even get back a refund? If yes how much will the legal fees be??</div>

A lot of industries resort to hard-selling tactics.. From insurance to even market stalls that sell vegetables.. I wouldnt say that its illegal, just another selling tactic I guess.. Not really ethical though.. I guess a worse case would be that have anyone of you ever received phone calls from banks asking you to go down for a promotion or something? End up talking about selling insurance.. To me, this is even more unethical, but still legal though..<br><br>At the end of the day, like most people have said, its up to each individual who decides.. Have to be mentally strong to analyze every detail in different kinds of situations, so that in the end its a choice due to your decision instead of being forced.</div>
