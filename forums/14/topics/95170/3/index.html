U haf the right to leave halfway the presentation, jus like one forumnite here. U haf ur right to leave and they cannot force you to stay rite? If they do try to pervent u frm leaving for wadsoeva reason jus persist n threaten them wif police action.<br><br>Refund is gonna be difficult since u haf put in so much money liao. If u put urself in James Phang shoes, wud u gif back $1600 plus in full amount ? Obviously they wud try ways n means to convince u..they will probably says things that seem make sense but obviously doesnt make sense to ur pocket..<br><br>Hope u haf not signed the MOPI or wad eva contract<br><br>Best of Luck!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the thing last until 11pm ah? wah seh! MLM ppl sure work very hard wor!<br><br>Mind you, it could be a tactic and it obviously worked on you. By having the meeting last so long until so late, makes u tired and gives u little energy to consider whether the deal is good or bad and you will tend to take in whatever they say. The trick is never ever to sign a deal or make any promises when you are tired and hungry, you should always make ur decisions, esp important ones that concern money, when u are most awake, fresh and had satisfied your hunger.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I joined NTI for 2 weeks before I realised they were dirty crooks. I opened 4 accounts back then. I felt cheated by the crap expensive stuff, and I even roped in my friends to join, which I regretted. They have this brain washing course, PSC where they use music and forced you to scream to brainwash you entirely. Claims to make you succeed and all that but in the end they just want to mislead you into fighting for more sales.<br><br>So when I went for refund (which thy claimed was possible), this very stuck-up guy called Dylan Mok told me off. He tried to intimidate me by shouting saying it is not possible (while folding his arms defensively) and a lot of unreasonable stuff. I mean, I'm a girl, and i was very polite, why did he have to do that? Seems like he loves intimidating many distributors by folding his arms and frowning at them. I supplied him all the necessary reasons but in the end he just told me off. You should see the way he talks, like he is the farking boss or what.<br><br>Turned out I am not the only one. My friends' appeals were rejected too. This farkface arrogant admin manager called dylan is very scheming, coming up with many excuses to discourage you. If he loses in logic, he tries to dominate by intimidation, raising his volume to scare you. All my friends experienced that. In the end we appealed to the law and they reluctantly gave us back the money. But to those in NTI, I'm saying this - better get your money back before it's too late. You want to see the real side of NTI, just ask for refund and see how their faces change. Please dun be like me, going through so much to get my parents' hard earned money back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guess those who dun believe me can try it for themselves. go for PSC and see how they make you cry using music, special sound effects, prolonged screaming and basically variations of voice which are poorly disguised pyschotherapy. then all come out fighting like mad dogs for sales, die die must close 10, 20 accounts per week to fight for their car fund (which incidentally is only able to support a mitsubishi lancer), wear pins like proud trophies on their collars, walk around in dark suits in a stuck up manner, display their certs and crap and letting people (the lower ones) call you 'Mr So &amp; So' - it all does sound quite attractive for an ego boost doesn't it? Especially young ones who crave recognition, this is a place.<br><br>The shock comes when a year or two later (in my case few weeks) you realised that you have dragged ur friends and family down into throwing their hard earned money for virtually fraud products which can be had for a fraction of the selling price outside, wasted ur time on this endeavour and ultimately betraying of those you loved. dun come flaming saying that you will prove your success and all that to me and that i am a fool and all that, or i am 'negative' becos i did not succeed in the first place. Dun play around with words. Give me proof that the products are backed by authentic certification, proof that the top kids really earn 10000 a month and maybe i yield. Else...please think about the situation you are in and whether is it worth it. Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously, I kinda believe what the mlmers say, the top kids do have a high possibility they are earning around the figure of 5 digits, esp for those companies which have been around for long. for these ppl, they have a couple of very loyal guys working under them recruiting. As long as they continue to recruit, these top guys will get their pay check. It's those who are newly recruited who will find it hard to reach anywhere, imagine u inexperienced, dont have the resources to recruit except ur friends and relatives, plus these days u ask ppl buy mlm products or try recruit them, they siam u like u are insurance agent. Coz many ppl have already been exposed to such things!<br>I do believe that for the top guys, it doesn't matter if the new recruits stay long or not, as long as they come in for say a few weeks, buy a couple of products, then they leave, money is still entering the top guy's pocket. That's why the top guys in mlm are so protective of their mlm concepts, as long as they can recruit, and most recruits will buy a couple of products so they can qualify for a higher commission, the top guys are earning already! It's the bottom guys who will suffer, unless they themselves are quite resourceful and able to get some downlines who are damn loyal to them and carry on recruiting, these new recruits will find it hard to earn back anything.</div>
