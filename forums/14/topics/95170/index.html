            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not an agent nor an ex-agent, but have helped my friends to refund.<br><br>First of all, how many days have you signed up as a member? I know the latest refund grace period is 60 days after we stormed into the office asking for refund. My friends haven't collected nor used the products, they got a 100% refund back.<br><br>2nd, have you collected or used the products? If you have collected and haven't used, you can still ask for refund. That might not be a standardised amount for refund. So you just demand.<br><br>3rd, if you have used or more than 60days, you won't be able to ask for any. Even if you  go to CASE, the terms and conditions have stated 60 days, so CASE is not in position as that's the T&amp;C.  I have friends who asked for refund on the 61st day, no matter what they did, even to CID, nothing could be done.<br><br>As for cancel of the account, we have prepared a document for the members who want to cancel their accounts. It'll be an official document to state that they are out and no longer be responsible to what will happen to the company.  If anyone wants it, I can send to you.<br><br>Rdgs,<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all<br><br>With regards to the ntiparis topic,<br><br>Lately, I seen a surge in numbers of forumnites who posted replies asking for help in getting refunds or how to go about cancelling their accounts from the company.

In legal procedure, every company no matter is MNC, SME or MLM, it's a must.<br><br>3rd, how do you  know that it is not due to inactivity? This will need documents and evidence to prove whether he is active, e.g. he has some people under him, he helped his people, etc.<br><br>From what I know of NTI, only when you hand in your official redrawal notification, the management will need 2 weeks to do what they need to do, before you are officially out of it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Steps to get refund from the Company.<br><br>1. Talk to the company adminstration. Talk to a decision maker, GM, etc. If they refuse, determine on what grounds. Find out if the company is a member of DSAS. (U can also check DSAS's members in their website.)<br><br>2. If they are a member of DSAS, contact DSAS. If not go directly to CASE.<br><br>3. If CASE fails, call the Company manager back, and THREATEN to send a complaint letter to the newpapers. (straits times, business times, streats, today, etc). When I say threaten, I mean do up a letter of complain to show the manager at the spot. Say something like "If I dun get the refund which I am entitled to, this letter goes to the papers", and show him the letter.<br><br>Make sure however the letter is factual and not deflamatory in nature, starting from how you got to know the company. Make sure the name and location of the company are shown. Do NOT censor the name of the company.<br><br>If the manager still refuses to refund, send the letter to the papers. Dun threaten and dun take action. U are just going for your right.<br><br>This industry had already been plagued by black sheep. For this industry to be popular, get rid of the black sheep.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This doesn't work practically.<br><br>If anyone who went there will know well that there's no decision maker. Where can you find a GM there?<br><br>NTIparis is NOT a member of DSAS. Even if the company is, DSAS doesn't take in complaints very much in consideration.<br><br>CASE is a simplified legal board, Without supportive documents, application, contract, even if you paid the fees, it will not do anything. Going to CASE DOES NOT mean you will win. It's like into legal sue matter, you will need everything just like going to a real law case.<br><br>For your information, writing to the media has been done by several people. They are very used to the practice.<br><br>Another thing on the refund, it'll determine very much on what is the ground for refunds.<br><br>My friends who have been trying so many times to get back their refund but no one/ staff even bother to help them. Feeling so helpless and really at their wits' end,  they asked me to help. They are really helpless and I know how those who want to get back their money feel.<br><br>Can everyone who wants to get back your refund, prepare the below:<br>1) application form<br>2) contract ( some has, while some don't)<br>3) product invoice and collection form<br>4) anything else.<br><br>Anyone who doesn't have the above, I'll see what I can offer to help.<br><br>rdgs,<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by airgrinder:</div><div class="quote_body">Steps to get refund from the Company.<br><br>1.

Reading from many posts here, nti seems to change its policy and contract agreements now and then. Different people signed different forms, or do not have receipts for purchases made.

For people without receipts, there are ways to claim and ask for refund, I had done it b4. But we will need to know every situation to know how we can help.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>441 has pointed out the section of the law I regularly referred to when I talked about ntiparis in the other topic.<br><br>Please note that as there is no precedent of any contravention of the amendment, this section, as well as other sections, has not been debated or clarified in the court..yet.<br><br>Lack of specific industrial regulations and standards in MLM allow many scams to exploit this section of the law.<br><br>Let me open this section for debate.<br><br>Take nti for example.<br><br>By right, you are not supposed to purchase anything to join the company, nor do you receive commissions upon your downlines payment of registrations fees. The first action leads to the contravention of this section, while the second action point out the trait of a pyramid scheme.<br><br>When I first entered nti for a presentation, I was asked almost immediately to purchase the products in order to join the company. Many of us have noted this, by referring to the replies in the other thread. Remember that you are always asked to join in for $288, products included?<br><br>This become a norm, join the company, pay 288 bucks, join the company, pay 288 bucks...untill its almost impossible to distinguish 288 bucks as product + registration fees, or registration fees alone...<br><br>Someone told me recently, in nti recent 'trend' in shifting its membership policies and refund agreement, its began to state that $35 is the registration fees.<br><br>All these lead to few questions. Why do I have to purchase the $288 set? Why cant I pay just $35, and choose to purchase or sell any of the products in any combination I choose? Why must I buy even a set of anything together with the registration fees just to join the scheme? And fulfilling these criteria to join the scheme, my upline began to receive commission immediately, based on company policy of members purchasing the 288 bucks set immediately!?<br><br>This is uncannily like frontloading and earning direct from a newbie registration fees as whole.<br><br>Secondly, I stated this once, and I will state this again, a company exist to sell its goods or services Another form is investment, where in simple terms, you invest to provide capital for the company (legally of course). Its like lending people money, and you will receive interest as returns, in investment, its called dividends upon company profits. That company of course use your money in the operation of selling its good or services.<br><br>As many can see, the observation is that nti aggressively recruit. There is really less emphasis on the products. Some agents blatantly said products doesnt matter. I know MLM is also about earning great income, but you DO NOT forgo selling things.<br><br>Going back to the law, nti does not legally break the law. It has goods, it has cleverly differentiate registration fees and product purchase. But it does not resolve the issue of the agents agressive recruitment nor the policy of tying up products purchase with registration fees and participation. It does not hide the fact many agents agressively recruit people, and sales are made thru this recruitement, and the monthly $50 input.<br><br>Remember that aromatheraphy and other stuff nti sell are what we called oestantious good, or luxury good. Being highly priced and without any obvious beneficial value, how are some of the agents able to sell and earn so much, especially when their target market seems to be teens without much money? Some, without batting an eyelid, could tell you that it all comes down to recruitment, not products.<br><br>All these actions lead to one thing. There is a lack of a lot of physical evidence in terms of company written documents, and the existence of good makes it hard to clamp down on nti because of this very section of the law. Unless you got hard evidence that members acquire benefits directly and explicitly from recruitment, you cant go banging on the police door.<br><br>What is substantial is from the observation of nti daily operations, its unofficial policies, marketing techniques and behaviour of agents that may help clamp on nti.<br><br>I remember one thing i read on S888.com (or SMI case, either one) flouting the MLM law, where its stated that they do not legally break the law, but they are running the company in the 'spirit of a pyramid'.<br><br>Essentially, some people boils it down to some black sheeps. But this 'black sheep' is massive in number, with some of the forumnites posting that top leaders are doing this too.<br><br>I am sure companies trying to earn by recruitment are no different from companies with lousy management, who cant make their sheeps behave. Coz the effect is the same at the end of the day - many youths who lost money in the course of hoping to achieve their dreams. Plus the blatant breaking of law by so many people, I am sure the gahmen wont be standing idly by...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i recently joined NTI paris on 17th oct, sunday. i regretted my decision the very next day, it was only then i realise how it was a scheme to pyramid selling. I didnt want to join at first, but my so called "friends" persuaded me saying cant i trust the integrity of him and the others that this was not a scheme? with this i gave in, i paid $611 for opening of 2 accounts. (big mistake)<br><br>company account opening: (slot = per account in the pyramid)<br>1 slot &gt; $300+<br>2 slot &gt; $611<br>3 slot &gt; $800+<br>4 slot &gt; $1000+<br>7 slot &gt; $2000+<br><br>As they were close on monday, i went down to the company on tuesday to try and get an refund. The process of refund was not successful. The so called "incharge" talk to me about why and why i wanted a refund and seems agitated when i still intended on a refund after his 3 hours explaination.<br><br>He say that there was nothing he could do to help and it would be based on the company's management on whether my refund would be approved. After the submission of the refund form, (btw i didnt get my product on sunday when i sign up for this "thing"), they took the product out and said that its the company policy to give the product to the customer after purchase so i have to take home the product. they told me the process of refund would take around 1 week so i took the product and went home. (they say they will call me when the refund cheque is ready)<br><br>1 week past, i called the company. they say my refund is still pending and the process would take within a month(wtf!). disappointment in myself for being so dumb, stupid. i waited another 1 month.<br><br>1 month past, still no calls from them so i called them. reply was: refund still in pending, the manager in charge of refund is not in singapore and will only return around mid-dec. i asked them is the manager the only one with the authority with refund, they say yes, so what can i do?<br>i feel so f*** up now. i am still within the 60 days limit, so i thought what if 60 days past then they can just say the refund not valid coz over 60 days, but the lady replied, its valid coz i made the refund on the 19th of october tuesday but i still think i wouldnt be getting a refund.<br><br>is there anyone who can help me?? i am desperate now. everyday i think about how trust in "friends" would get me in trouble.<br>pls help me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>
