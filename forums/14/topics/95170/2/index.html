            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, heard from DCA he been 'threatened' wtih  defamation suit.<br><br>But its best for him to remain quiet. But doesnt mean i would. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>DCA has been reassured that this threat is an empty one. We talked to few people for legal advices and what i want to say is this.<br><br>U kids in ntiparis pls dont behave as if u know the law. The litigation process is a complex one, and the law perform many tests in order to see whether a defaulting party or a tortfeasor is liable for defamation.<br><br>I really dont understand how a bunch of lawless fools manage to scare another bunch of under 21 teens who dont really understand or even know the law - on MLM, on tort of negligent mistatement and nature of law in sg.<br><br>Indeed the words 'sue' and 'slander' has been misused by people who watch too much Law and Order. If someone says something bad about you, you dont just pounce on him and threaten litigation. There is alot of process even before serving the writ of summons on him. In DCA case, there is a lot of damning points on why he cant be sued, so please do not scare off a teenage guy by using the word 'sue'. Besides this is sg. The law is quite strict on claiming damages for negligence, unlike what you see in American shows..<br><br>DCA posts are one of the most damning arguments against nti. Its sad he is coerced to change his posts. This is to inform the public, yet another strong points scored against nti.<br><br>Btw, to this Desmond guy, pls read up more on law before scaring off DCA.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As to how whether stormax has successfully help those who made claims against nti for refunds, he will tell u more.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NTI is slowly but surely crumbling. Many of their top ppl are leaving due to unkept promises. There are also lots of internal politics within their management in order to gain control of the company And their boss James Phang likes to use old videos of him appearing successful in front of a huge audience in his previously fallen company in NOP to deceive young ppl that he is a very well-respected person. With external n internal problems it's not difficult to understand why they will fall soon. Talk abt suing! They had better protect their own asses first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, many people term NTI as a "corporate cult". To find out more about corporate cults, here's the link:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0814404936/104-4780803-5659919?v=glance" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0814404936/104-4780803-5659919?v=glance</a><br><br>I have also found out that many of the photos they use on their website presentation (e.g. NTI Indonesia building and meeting room) are not theirs. They are simply extracted from other online resources. Some may classify this as plagiarism -- it's open to YOUR interpretation.<br><br>For example, the NTI Indonesia building shown in their Flash presentation has been photoshop'ed. If you parse that presentation and have a close look at that particular photo, you will see that it was a scr*wed up attempt to doctor a photo. If you then use an EXIF information reader (many are available for free on the Net) to dig up the details, you will know that it is really photoshop'ed.<br><br>I have tried posting the photo on photobucket, but my account was attacked with a DDoS attempt to expire my bandwidth (was it by one of those lads?). Tripod doesn't allow me to post photos.<br><br>Well, now the best line of attack will be to gather sufficient proof and get it across to <a href="http://www.aa419.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.aa419.org</a>, which terminates fake banks and monetary institutions with their "Lad Vampire" DDoS tool.

To find out more about corporate cults, here's the link:<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0814404936/104-4780803-5659919?v=glance" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0814404936/104-4780803-5659919?v=glance</a><br><br>I have also found out that many of the photos they use on their website presentation (e.g. NTI Indonesia building and meeting room) are not theirs. They are simply extracted from other online resources. Some may classify this as plagiarism -- it's open to YOUR interpretation.<br><br>For example, the NTI Indonesia building shown in their Flash presentation has been photoshop'ed. If you parse that presentation and have a close look at that particular photo, you will see that it was a scr*wed up attempt to doctor a photo. If you then use an EXIF information reader (many are available for free on the Net) to dig up the details, you will know that it is really photoshop'ed.<br><br>I have tried posting the photo on photobucket, but my account was attacked with a DDoS attempt to expire my bandwidth (was it by one of those lads?). Tripod doesn't allow me to post photos.<br><br>Well, now the best line of attack will be to gather sufficient proof and get it across to <a href="http://www.aa419.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.aa419.org</a>, which terminates fake banks and monetary institutions with their "Lad Vampire" DDoS tool. If you want to see how powerful this anti-scam tool is, visit <a href="http://www.aa419.org/ladvampire.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aa419.org/ladvampire.html</a>.</div></blockquote>Thanks jookhai for contributing useful information to support NTIparis is a cult. Their main brainwashing session is the PSC, all agents beware!</div>

The logo obviously doesn't look natural -- the keystone (trapezoid skewing) is not right! Furthermore, when I go into the advanced properties, you see it there.

After awhile, blinded by the promise of "big money" and "business opportunity" i finally agreed and signed up as a "silver merchant" which requires me to pay $1600++<br>the next morning, i regretted my decision and tried called the manager, and we agreed to meet on later date to discuss abt my refund<br><br>pls if anyone has any tips or can provide any kind of assistance, pls let me know</div>
