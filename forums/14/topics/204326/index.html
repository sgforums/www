            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to share a real account here im sure most of us had been familiar with. It is closely related to MLM actually but I am taking time off to write this article because I feel there is a need for many to know and be aware of the threats that im going to share.<br><br>Due to rising cost of living and expensive lifestyle, im sure many ppl living in spore really wish to live a much better life. Me too, are included. This happens some time back  for me.Being a person actively looking for better opportunities; I was being introduced to go explore a so called international business by a close buddy of mine. Thinking that its something good as I was also trying out some other traditional business myself, I went with him. This company is a familiar name BelÂ’air, most of us would had heard it in the recent NDP2006.<br><br>Well basically the company really has no problem and their product does look interesting and unique to me at time time, but the real horror that im going to disclose is related to the group under Belair Singapore called AAA (Aim, Attitude, Action) located at Hiap Huat House near Bendemeer RD. This group is being set up by a family of sisters, 2 main culprits are called Veronica Loh and Pamela Loh. They hold the rank of Duke in Belair.<br><br>Y do I say itÂ’s a horrific exp?  I will list a few insider things I know to warn everyone off it:<br><br>1. They will dress up in power suits and exec wear showing off to ppl how successful they are but actually almost more than 70% of the ppl inside are all earning nothing.<br><br>2. They will go around shopping malls in suntec, marina, now even orchard hunting for possible victims, particularly those salesgirl and sales man in retail stores. Those ppl inside who have run out of victims on their name list are forced by their uplines to go to these places to Â“make friendsÂ”. Over there, they will try to know ppl out of nothing and get their numbers, they will try to be friendly with you and at the same time showing off all the stuffs they used their very last penny to buy. Then once gotten ur number, they will slowly contact the victims thru sms den phonecalls then eventually ask the person out.<br><br>3.DonÂ’t be fool by any words they said. If your friend is a fellow Â“partnerÂ” in this AAA group, never believe any words he or she says. Because they meant none of them, especially those very touching words. They are all tactics used to make u fall into the trap. This group likes to give empty promises and then uses emotional ways to Â“close caseÂ”.<br><br>4.The uplines are always camping in hotels waiting for their downlines to bring their victims to visit them. If your friend ever called u to go with him to see someone very successful at a hotel. NEVER,EVER go with him or her.<br><br>I will share an account how they close case now:<br><br>When the victim is being targeted, The upline will usually arrange the victim to go visit a very good seminar on Friday, Sat and Monday. They will use the victim soft spot to make sure the victim comes. Upon arriving at Hiap Huat House 4th level, sometimes 3rd. The Â“friendÂ” will bring the victim around the place to know ppl of similar background to the victim n then those ppl will talk a lot of things to the victim.<br>These are all prearranged before the victim arrives.<br><br>What is the purpose of the 3 seminars?<br><br>On Friday, they will talk about life and destiny. This is to hyped up the person to let him or her have a feeling that he or she should makes changes to their lifes. After the talk, they will bring the victims to diff small rooms whereby a speaker will be there to ask ppl to go onstage to share his or her exp. The whole environment is created to be very warming, lively and positive. This is pre arranged as all the partners are required to do that. When the victim go onstage, the speaker already beforehand knew all the potential problems the victim has will start encouraging the person thru many means n smart tactic and sweet words.<br><br>On Saturday, they will talk bout the investment. Before that they will use a set of presentation called the diff mindset of rich and poor to trap the victim first. How is this so? Because no one would say they want to be a poor person. So If u wanna be a rich person, then according to them u must join them in this business. Remember, the investment to join this grp is a whopping $14,000. but they will assure u everything is fine and the victim need not worry about the amt.<br><br>On Saturday, they will also arrange some Marquis (ppl claiming they are the company shareholder and earning 5 fig every mth) to close case. These marquis will use methods called Â“the success modelÂ”. What it is? They claim in AAA, manay ppl succeed by adopting this model.<br><br>1.100% experience of the prdt.  They will ask the victim to cough out $1000 first to buy prdts from them to use n exp it whether the products really got a market.<br><br>2.Fix position. Being aware that most ppl wont have money, tey will act kind and say after paying the $1000, they will help the victim solve the money problem. This is the tricky part. Cause at this point of time, they will start asking the person to loan from friends, relatives and also banks, insurance, ezycash etc.<br><br>3.Lastly enter the system. They will encourage the person to keep coming to attend the seminars. This is actually to make sure the victim keep coming down to the seminars and get influenced.<br><br>Let me warn u that throughout the whole thing, none of the words they say are actually what they meant. Everything is discussed behind the victimÂ’s back and they include what words to say to him/her, how to encourage him/her, how to plan to make sure the person will go raise the money etc.<br><br>In there, there also claim that in fact if u want to join them. U have to be the right person if not they wont let u join them, thus u have to go through an interview before u can join them. This is bullshit. Its just something for them to access the victim and also to make sure they find the right victims who wont give up halfway in order to make sure they wont be wasting extra time.<br><br>Im really sick and tired of these nonsense thatÂ’s y for me I choose to leave because I didnÂ’t want to do things this wat as it is not an ethical manner at all. But many ppl who are inside are still blinded by greed and willing to sacrifices their friends and relatives and make them land in heavy debts. Y? because in my time there, I had see many ppl suffer because they have to pay their debts back. And what do their uplines say? They will claim Belair is a platform for u to succeed, if u cant succeed here, means its your problems. How ironic right? Before u join they are claiming that they will do everything to help u succeed, but after you join and having problems they will then tell u these. Worse still, those that are not doing well will be considered outcast! Yes. This is the very way they operate. So if u are considering joining this so called big family, better take care. I can assure u more than 70% of the ppl are actually not doing as well as they always claim. DonÂ’t be fool by their exp wear, pdas, nice looking specs etc. they are all being bought using their very last cent. Y? because if you donÂ’t buy them, they wont help u to close case.<br><br>Im writing this not because on hatred towards them. This is the very method they are using now. I considered it very unethical n I donÂ’t wish any fellow Singaporean to be trick into this. Look at me now, being promised of a great international business but im now slogging myself off in a part time job to pay my debts and many others are doing that too. If u have the guts to try it out, its up to you. But donÂ’t make your relatives and friends suffer. Worse still, donÂ’t be like them going out to hunt for strangers and land them into debts. Please spare a thought.<br></div>
