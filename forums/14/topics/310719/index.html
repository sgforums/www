              <p>guys... i might seem to be an anti-mlmer here, however.. i am actually quite supportive of this system</p>
              <p>why?<br>1) this is exactly like a business venture.. you need to seek business associates and partners and even more workers to work for u, to sell your product..</p>
              <p>2) you wont lose any money in this business venture.. only your time is involved... so no mattter how much u lose , you wont lose any money</p>
              <p>3) MLMs could help you gain success quickly in a certain extent..</p>
              <p>4) no qualifications involved</p>
              <p>5) so on and so forth...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yes indeed the entire concept of an mlm is very good... but only to a certain extent</p>
              <p>questions to answer to your self when you join an mlm<br>1) how unique are your products?</p>
              <p>2) the reputation of your mlm</p>
              <p>3) has your upline ever tricked you before</p>
              <p>4) is your upline trust worthy?</p>
              <p>5) <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">do they coers you to buy any items?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">6) are they more product oriented or recruitement oriented?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>personally, most mlms i went to would usually tell you their marketting plans first, how sucessful you will be, driving a s200 in 18... then introduce their products to you... after which ask you to <span style="color: #ff0000;">buy one for yourself to try.</span>.</p>
              <p>however the main aim of the mlm is to not let its entrepreneurs get any risks of losign any money... and yet be successful... many mlms break this rule already.</p>
              <p>they are more towards recruting more members, instead of selling their products...</p>
              <p>All compensation plans of the mlms would always be enticing...</p>
              <p>however, do people wonder.. why do you need to buy a product for yourself to proove that its working? if a product is really that good , you dont need to be coerced in order to buy the product for yourself... take panadol as an example.. do you get forced by your boss to eat one pill in order to start selling the product??</p>
              <p>i know that they may claim that they are not forcing you.. however if someone tells you.. u have to sell 1 product before you can start recruiting people.. and keep tellign you that the way to go is to keep recruiting people... would you get one?? why not let you recruit when you are level 1??? thats one of the companies ways of actually forcing you to buy the product for yourself...</p>
              <p>in this process... you would have already lost money by "investing" in the product..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>imagine if your upline tricks you down for your own good... do you really think he really does that for your own good?!?!?! or is it for his own good?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when your upline tell you you can actually sell to others other than your peeers he usually tell you that you go and find people by yourself... EG, clubbing, pubbing and such...</p>
              <p>do you realise that if you follow his way, your reputation will stink???</p>
              <p>they will never tell you to go and knock doors of houses one by one... why?!?! they claim that they are in the higher class in society and would not do such things...</p>
              <p>actually you dont do that as you wont have any difference between a sales man anymore.. knockign doors.. promoting your product from house to house...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why they dont let u tell anyone u have been to the company until you had bought something or given them your personal details??? they are afraid of the external sources who would lead you out of the darkness..</p>
              <p>have you been to a legitimate job which does not allow you to tell others what u work as???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i shall write till here this time.. to be comtinued</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Product must be very good and impressive.</p>
              <p>Ppl tend to join upline(the ppl) rather than a co. ( Not a bad thing if u r gd but ur co. repu is bad )</p>
              <p>Door to door sales is not wrong or 'low-class' . More rejection but its not wrong or demeaning...</p>

              <p>Hi i agree that MLM concepts are very effective and its helps the poor to earn a bit of income without any risk in a smart way. But not everyone can be a millionaire as it still require certain amount of hard work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The main problem I found in MLM is that the compaines do not have a dedicated team to show you how to make their marketing methods work for you, what they do is to provide their marketing plan and leave it all to their distributors to create their own methods of acheiving the marketing plan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus the good ones will always recruit the right way, while the bad ones will recruit the wrong way. That is why you hear about the success and unsuccess stories. All these will cast many doubts to the newbies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently I have came across this website <a href="http://www.syh75.com">www.syh75.com</a> which I think is quite good as it shows how we can create our forutne step-by-step. It gives you the confidence that it will works for everyone as long as you believe in yourself. Same as in whatever we do, you will succeed only if you believe.</p>

              <p>Product is one thing, service is another. I would like to ask Enyouth ppl why do they use trickery. That's the impression I've had of them. From personal experience and from ppl I know, and read about. You don't tend to hear ppl being tricked down. Its always the same few companies, yes, especially EY.</p>
              <p>Also it's ok to say u MIGHT earn big,. BUT once they say u would be "rich", able to "retire early", etc... then something is wrong.</p>

              <p>Hi I think the definition of 'rich' varies from ppl to ppl. There are some full-time housewives who are very satisifed to earn $500 extra/mth just for their kids education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me being able to retire early does not mean earning $1mil/ mth,  having a stable and longstanding income of $4k/mth will do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I do not have to follow others' schedules, i can do what i want. I can bring my kids to/fro school, be with them on every wkends and holidays. Able to bring my parents out. All this can be done anytime and most imptly, my income is stable and longstanding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not looking at a life of a millionaire, in fact this grp of ppl also hv their own problems too....</p>
