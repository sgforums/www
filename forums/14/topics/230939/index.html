(regardless of what i say, there bound to be negative feedbacks)<br><br>how much i earn - Does it concerns you? Will you get a share after i tell you?<br>No right, since the answer is no, than why ask?<br><br>no matter how much i say i earn, is also fake to you people - reason behind why i say this - simple, it's my money, not your money, so my money is fake in your eyes. simple as that.</div>
