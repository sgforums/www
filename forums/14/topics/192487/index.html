            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. Just wanna check with you all. Have any1 here personally went for an interview with the above company stated above? It's like a sales and marketing company where they hire sales people and they offer management training also, as they claim they are also looking for "leaders" to lead a team, for example?<br><br>Is this company a hidden "MLM" company in disguise? Anyone with any experience or knowledge who wanna share? It is also linked to a company called Appco Pte Ltd and Cobragroup.<br><br>Any info will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i read upon some other topics about marketing and i found this similar.<br><br>http://wolfram.org/scam/cydcor.html<br><br>In the end, its still about recruiting and of course doing door to door sales. The above claimed its a scam but it has been working for dunno how many years overseas! So I think if MLM can work in so many countries overseas then this type of companies sure can do so too.<br><br>Just wanna share with you all. Coz there are so many scams out there that you dunno what is right anymore...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on what kind of company. The standard will be a low basic with commission so that the commission takes a large part of the take home salary. That is for a junior sales exec. For a senior sales person, they go by total sales volume and targets with a high basic and little commission. A totally commission based one is not unheard of but its very rare.</div>

My concern is what if a person works really hard for this company for let say a month and he doesn't generate any sales? Does it mean he had just worked for a month without pay?? Illogical right??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, just wanna share what i came across from this company here. VisionX Int'l is a marketing company which do direct sales, for short. They represent a lot of clients around sg and that includes Telecommunications, Charities, etc. Basically, they do door to door sales!! And guess the best part? You are not paid at all if you have no sales! Which means, you are fully commission/performance based. How crap is that? My bro, who is working in the insurance industry, said that only MLM practises that, and from my pov, that's what i think also.<br><br>Just an advice for young poly grads out there. If you think you can succeed in door to door sales, then good. But think again. After u are done with sales, you have to create and form your own team so that they can earn money for you and themselves. (Like duplicating 5 clones of you out from the numerous number of recruits.) If you can do maths, i think u can count how low the probability it is for that. Anyway, the link below is what exactly the company is following. It's a system called ds max. I can't believe this system is out so many years ago and people are still using it. After reading, you all may get a clearer picture.<br><br>http://wolfram.org/scam/ds_max/<br><br>I hope those who come across this or may have came across this company and is going to work for them will find my info useful. Let me be the 1st scapegoat so there wun be more victims in the future...haha</div>
