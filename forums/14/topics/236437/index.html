            <div class='col-md body'>hi there,<br><br>Just few days ago, I had a met up with a foreigner from NHT near Hill Street.<br><br>He claimed to be one of the top distributors with over 10,000 downlines worldwide. I was like, WOW ! I would have retired if I have 10,000 downlines  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>During the 2 hours meeting, he touch alot on the compensation plan, very little on the products. When I asked more about the products, he told me to read from the website, they earned more from recruiting new downlines. Hmm.... it reminds me of something about pyramid sellings from DSAS website. I let him proceed into sharing of compensation plan.<br><br>The compensation plan is using binary system with maintenance required. hmm... it reminds me again of the pyramid selling.<br><br>I asked him how much he is earning now since he is with NHT for 5 years, he claimed to earn $50,000 per month. WOW! Very successful leh !!<br><br>He invited me to open up a BC with him but I declined. I told him I'm with a local company already. After hearing this, he started to comment very bad on the local companies, and I'm very surprised by his actions. I will never imagine someone so successful and 5 years of experience would resort to personal attacks just to recruit me...<br><br>I will never follow these type of leaders. Even though my upline do not earn $50,000 per month, at least my upline's moral values and network marketing practices are better than that leader from "global and established" company.<br><br>I told him that I wont joined him but I dont mind having a friend. Since the appointment had past midnight and there are no more mrt or buses, I offer my ride to send him home. He declined, saying that he prefer to walk to stay fit and healthy. I insisted and eventually he accepted my goodwill.<br><br>I send him to Boon Wah Hotel, somewhere near Little India. I'm surprised that it is a budget hotel. So I asked him why he choose this hotel over those better ones, he replied he prefer to feel our culture and anyway he is not staying in Singapore for long.<br><br>Before I go, I ask him whether he walked back to the hotel every night. His reply was yes. So I asked him again,<br><br>"Why didn't you take cab?"<br><br>His reply,<br><br>"The cabs are very expensive !!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>ops... what happen to the $50,000 per month TOP DISTRIBUTOR from "global and established" company?<br><br>Do anyone here has some experience from NHT before?</div>
