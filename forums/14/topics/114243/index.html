            <div class='col-md body'>1) Mr X gets enticed into joining MLM.<br>He persuades people around him (including YOU) to join him in a new business opportunity,quoting the need to have dual income, need to have entrepreneur spirit, need to change mindset..... He will also quote big and prominent names and corporations and say they are into MLM also...names like Bill Gates, IBM, Microsoft, Nike etc.....<br><br>He also claims that his MLM company is the best, with the best product, best mgmt, best team, best remuneration structure.<br>bankers, lawyers, heart surgeons and 747 pilots have joined this company.<br>top men in this company drives Porsche, lives in 2 bungalows etc....<br><br>He also mentions why things like why work for 40 years and retire for 10years. why not work for 10 years and retire for 40 years.<br><br>2) Mr X stops bothering you, taking it that you are hopeless and stubborn and ignorant.<br>Off he goes on his new "business" venture.<br><br>typical paraniod questions thrown at you in the heat of frustration trying to<br>convince you includes:<br><br>i) pyramid selling? can you explain to me what exactly is pyramid selling and  the difference between pyramid selling and MLM????????<br><br>ii) you not interested then you ask so many questions for what???!!!!!<br>iii) if I answer this question of yours, you agree to buy and join???, then???!!!!<br><br>You will see him approaching people in all scenarios from a wedding banquet, a drinking session, a mahjong session, lunch, Incamp training etc.....<br><br>3) Mr X having been rejected by the numerous people that he approaches, now complains to you, and starts to bad-mouth those who reject him, labelling them as no ambition, kiasi, no entrepreneurship and so on. But notice that he will not mention a slight hint of the MLM business he is involved in to you, even if you ask him.  Vague answers will be given like new way, new business, new concept of selling.<br><br>4) Mr X now having failed considerably to make good on his MLM business, now makes a call to you, asking casually if you are interested in joining his business venture. at most, he will mention the product itself,(magnetic mattress, health food, gold coin) but not the MLM company name itself.<br><br>5) Mr X could have approach his MLM upline trying to refund the product, but this will not be made known to people whom he had approached. Whether the refund is successful or not, only Mr X knows, (I would see this as something being done BACKSTAGE, away from the audience)<br><br>6) Mr X now still stuck, keeps to himself and stop mentioning the business. this is where the embarassment part comes into play. Extreme embarassment meaning he has shown to you so much faith, hope and promise in the thing at the very beginning and now it has failed him entirely and make him so lost. still he presists and refuses to admit its not working, for saving face sake,<br><br>7) so once in a while Mr X unleashes it again,"how would you like to join me in my business."<br>and the name Robert Kiyosaki is probably a standard dish being served in this whole banquet.<br><br>so all the MLMers and future millionaires wannabes? which stage are you in now?<br><br>note that I am not Mr X, rather i have a friend who is like Mr X now, who is in stage 7.<br>anyone else has friends like Mr X?  care to share?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So Mr.X made mistakes. What is he a loser?<br>So he sucks because he couldnt even sell himself and hes trying to sell a business. What is he a failure? Maybe.<br>But at least he tried. He may have failed miserably, but im sure he learnt more about himself and the industry than any typical skeptic ever would. Skeptics never learn. They already "know", now dont they.<br>I'd rather be Mr.X the failure than be someone who's afraid to fail. I believe when you avoid failure you avoid success as well. Maybe Mr.X jumped into a company with a business plan that didnt even suit him. There are so many terrible unethical fools out there using "phone techniques" and watnot, and i'm sure thats why mlm has such a bad reputation in singapore. I was taught "phone techniques" before and i was pretty disgusted. Wats the point of calling someone you know down for a "chat" and later try to sell them something? I know I'D be disgusted. I never did that, it wasnt me, i left that company, but i left with lessons.<br><br>Its sad how people without basic communication skills go into mlm in the lure of money. mlm isnt a get rich quick scheme. Those failures "failed", and dropped out disappointed because thats what they were expecting. They dont say 2-5 years for nothing. Mlm is about building a fish net, (who knows how long it takes for you) instead of catching fish one by one with your bare hands. Thats your paycheck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you're going to succeed, you have to fail.<br><br>Success only comes as we try new things, stretch ourselves and<br>learn from our small failures to experience "big" success.  Here<br>are some keys to failing effectively:<br><br>1. Embrace Failure<br><br>Accept the fact that failure will happen,often,and it will serve<br>to teach you important things you need to do to succeed next<br>time. Most everyone has to deal with the disapproval and<br>disbelief of others (typically friends and family) in their<br>pursuit of success.<br><br>2. Try things<br><br>Once you have accepted the fact that failure is inevitable, just<br>go ahead and try something, anything, and do you best to make it<br>work. If it fails, figure out why (or ask), learn from it and do<br>it better next time.<br><br>3. Figure out why you failed<br><br>Why didn't your plan work? Was it because you needed more<br>information? More funding? More help?  Was it because the product<br>you were trying to promote just can't make money? Figuring out<br>why will help you succeed next time.<br><br>4. Do it again<br><br>This is the hardest part for many of us. Once you have failed it<br>is difficult to still believe enough in yourself and your<br>"eventual" success to get back at it. But if you are going to<br>succeed that is exactly the path you must take.<br><br>Follow these four steps and your failures may just turn into your<br>best successes. I have put together a resource to help you find<br>more success in EVERY area of your life. You'll be surprised how<br>spending a few minutes with this guide can make a significant<br>change in your life.<br>This is not just for MLM, dealing with BGR type of relationship also can. Kena reject can try again also. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have a friend like u said,scarlettfever. He's now currently being shun by friends and whenever he asks anyone out, people will think he's trying to persuade to join. I don't know if he's failed or succeeded but up till now he's pretty low-key about everything and nothing has been in black and white.<br>Yes, MLM is still a form of marketing. But they are the type of marketing firms that create the most hoo-ha but have don't seem to have the substance and financial reports to back it up. The truth is that alot of MLM companies out there are not even registered companies and have many "sure-earn money" that look shady and unclear. So please be careful folks out there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>poor people always look at the negative side of life. cant blame them. they dont choose to look at the successful stories, instead prefer to look at those that failed and keep pointing at it. what can these poor people gain? hmmm... self satisfy or simply cushion themselves that they are better off in this society.<br><br>they dont even dare to compare or dream like a successfully businessman.. they always like to aim at someone who had failed and laugh at their mistakes. but sad to say, those who failed before are more courageous because at least they DARE to try and DARE to fail..compare to the poor who only know how to laugh but when its their turn, they freak out. SAD ...</div>

What is he a loser?<br>So he sucks because he couldnt even sell himself and hes trying to sell a business. What is he a failure? Maybe.<br>But at least he tried. He may have failed miserably, but im sure he learnt more about himself and the industry than any typical skeptic ever would. Skeptics never learn. They already "know", now dont they.<br>I'd rather be Mr.X the failure than be someone who's afraid to fail. I believe when you avoid failure you avoid success as well. Maybe Mr.X jumped into a company with a business plan that didnt even suit him. There are so many terrible unethical fools out there using "phone techniques" and watnot, and i'm sure thats why mlm has such a bad reputation in singapore. I was taught "phone techniques" before and i was pretty disgusted. Wats the point of calling someone you know down for a "chat" and later try to sell them something? I know I'D be disgusted. I never did that, it wasnt me, i left that company, but i left with lessons.<br><br>Its sad how people without basic communication skills go into mlm in the lure of money. mlm isnt a get rich quick scheme. Those failures "failed", and dropped out disappointed because thats what they were expecting. They dont say 2-5 years for nothing. Mlm is about building a fish net, (who knows how long it takes for you) instead of catching fish one by one with your bare hands. Thats your paycheck.</div></blockquote>totally agreed.</div>

No one is going to put you down for failing. You &amp; me have failed tests or exams in school, have failed IPPT, have failed job interviews. no one mocks at you or puts you down for having these failures.<br><br>the thing about these MLMers are that they are very annoyed when ppl try to reason with them, and they become very arrogant when they start to dream of making it rich. they denounced those who don't share their views. (Honeybunz and i love BMW). that explains why when they failed, they become so quiet , and so afraid to let the world knows for fear of being mocked at.<br><br>believe me, there are those who have failed in MLM, and are still stubborn and arrogant, and refused to admit defeat.</div>
