After reading all the threads, it seems like there are no FLP distributors around, so I think I should reply..<br><br>hmmm.. this is gonna be a long one..<br><br>Firstly, I wish to clarify that I have no intent to put any company down, so I'll apologise first if anyone finds this offending.<br><br>Hmmm.. I think that the most the important 4 things behind any company are:<br><br>1) Company<br>2) Product<br>3) Marketing Plan<br>4) Team<br><br>1) Let me touch on Forever Living Products as a company.<br>- FLP is currently in its 27th year of operations.<br>- FLP can be found in over 110 countries world-wide.<br>- FLP is a financially stable private company<br>- Forever Resorts, a sister company, owns more than 50 first class resort properties around the world, in cash.<br>- FLP is the only MLM company in the world that pays bonuses based on retail price (furthur illustration in the mareting plan)<br>- FLP is a 1-line production company. This means that we grow our own aloe vera, we produce our own products and we distribute it ourselves<br>- FLP holds many patents on our aloe vera and bee products, as well as our nutritional supplements<br><br>2) Product<br>- FLP is the world's largest grower, manufacturer and distributor of Aloe Vera, currently controls 92.5% of the world's market.<br>- FLP is the world's largest producer of bee products, ie, honey, pollen, propolis and royal jelly, currently controlling about 60% of the world's supply.<br>- FLP's aloe vera is 100% stabilised<br>- FLP's aloe vera is Halal and Kosher, and is the first company to carry the International Aloe Science Council seal (visit www.iasc.org for details of the council)<br>- FLP's aloe vera products range from aloe vera drinks to aloe vera toothgel and shampoo to aloe vera skin care, aloe vera make-up and aloe vera multi-purpose detergent, to aloe vera veterinary spray<br>- For the complete product range, visit www.foreverliving.com<br>- Uses of products include Fat gain/loss, nutrition, daily use, beauty, detox, anti-aging, water filtration<br><br>3) Marketing Plan (for simplicity, I'll just highlight 5 benefits)<br><br>- Group Volume: everything your business partner does is related to you, to a certain extent that it is also fair to downlines<br><br>- No Reversion: no demotion even if your sales volume drops. most importantly, your level of bonuses don't drop for the rest of your life. (I understand that some companies don't demote distributors, but once their sales volume drops, their % bonus drops. Not for us, our don't drop)<br><br>- No Pass up: once a person is in your network, that person is part of your group and the company will not take them out unfairly<br><br>- 2 months accumulation: you have 2 months to achieve your promotions instead of 1 month<br><br>- Bonus calculation based on Retail price: Simply, you buy a product at $7, sell for $10, earn $3 first. The company pays you the % bonuses using $10. FLP is the ONLY company in the whole world that pays bonuses based on retail price.<br><br>More than 90% of MLM companies use points, so the way to calculate is to find out the average points for the company, usually about 0.5 to 0.6, so means that for a $10 product, the company uses $5-$6 to calculate your commission. FLP uses $10.<br><br>4) Team<br>Take FLP as Ministry of Education. Under MOE got many schools, each school has the same PSLE paper and same 'O' Level papers, but why do parents still wanna queue for "branded" schools? I think the answer is in the school's system. Certain schools have "successful" systems whereby a student has a higher chance of getting better grades. So the same thing in FLP. There are many "systems" or what we call teams, and each team has their own business strategy.<br><br>My team is Forever Jonathan Club. We are the largest, most professional and most money making club in the whole of Singapore and Malaysia. We have the most full-time distributors. I believe it is because of our strategy.<br><br>I hope I manage to make it quite clear, cuz this is a very brief summary. If anyone has any questions pls either email me (pohchuen@gmail.com) or call me at 9189 0275.<br><br>cheers!</div>

There are two different types of certification.<br><br>Aloe raw material and<br><strong>Finished products containing Aloe (must be 15% or more).</strong>"<br><br>strange enough, <strong>if they really claim they have the "world's largest aloe vera plantations", then why is there simply not enough aloe vera content in their so-called wide range of products?</strong> "tou gong jian liao"? or should i say <strong>"trying to cut costs and gain a bigger profit margin by adding a cheaper alternative than aloe vera, and trying to pass it out as the real thing"?</strong><br><br>worse still, when u look into their products range, they did not really mention anything except general stuff. surf our company's website and at least u c pictures of our products. better still, if u want a more detailed description of our products and some known and proven benefits, check out this:<br><br><strong>http://www.aloehealthuk.com/</strong><br><br>NEED I EXPLAIN MORE?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FLP is quite a Flop in sales actually. In year 2004, they made 2.1billion euro of sales in a year but had 7.5million distributors resulting in a yearly buisness volume of 215.38 per distributor. My guess is mostly though self-purchases.<br><br>Compare this to <blockquote>This area of the Marketing Plan is ideally suited to Distributors who wish to earn a few hundred dollars per month.(Normally you work an average of several hours per week. </blockquote> -- taken from their website.<br><br>How's that for misleading publicity?</div>
