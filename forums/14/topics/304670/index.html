            <div class='col-md body'>But the best part i suppose is that people never complain even churches are doing MLM like mass recruitment talks and praise the lord believe in lord acquire networks form eg. Tua Pek Kong, Thai Buddha believers.<br>I do see a similarity but people won't complain when 10% of their salary must be donated to churches for "blessings" and the Pastor is drving a LEXUS. Go and watch southpark and you will know what i mean.<br><br>100members donating 100SGD every month, the chuch is making $10000. Just imagine they have 5000 members? 5000x100 is 500K everymonth, X 12 months is 6MIL. Wow. No wonder CityHarvest can build such a big church.<br><br>Only difference is that no one complain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Afterall, who in the world do not sin.  Only yourself knows about it.  That is why when it touches such issue, there is this overcoming fear.  Then they say, accept God and you will be free from your sin.  Suddenly you find yourself a way out of your guilt.  Do you want to pass out ?<br><br>For MLM, actually there is a product and it is up to the individual upline to pass the information on.  Trouble is, half baked information is being pass at each level and when it come to the last fellow, he knows nut about it.  So he just recruit rather than selling.  All he know is, get new recruit, you get more money.  So some evern went on to use various tactics lor.  Here, you want to quit anytime also can. No consious to haunt you.  Just my two cents worth . . .<br><br></div>
