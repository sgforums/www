              <p>Menergy by LFI is banned in Singapore<br><br>HSA caution against consuming "Menergy M-Essense" Capsules Found to contain undeclared substance<br><br>[url]http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/etc/medialib/hsa_library/corporate/pr20072009.Par.1666.File.tmp/HSAMediaRelease__HSACautionsAgainstConsumingMenergyMEssenceCapsules_121208.pdf[/url]<br><br>THE Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on Friday ordered a recall of 'Menergy MEssence' capsules from the market after it found two undeclared chemical substances used in treatment of male erectile dysfunction.<br><br>The two substances - acetildenafil and acetilacid - were detected by HSA through its ongoing post-market surveillance programme. They were not included in the product label.<br><br>Both substances are chemically similar to sildenafil, a potent prescription drug used for treatment of male erectile dysfunction, which should only be used when prescribed by a doctor, said the HSA in a statement on Friday.<br><br>Consumption of the two substances can potentially cause serious adverse reactions such as heart attack, stroke and severe hypotension, especially in susceptible individuals such as those with heart conditions or who are taking nitrate drugs.<br><br>'While there have not been any cases of adverse reactions relating to the consumption of this product, HSA has ordered a recall of this product from the market as the safety of this product is in question,' said the authority.<br><br>HSA also warned the public not to consume any stocks that they may have. If they have consumed the capsules and feel unwell, they should seek medical advice.<br><br>The capsules are distributed in Singapore by LFI (Singapore) Pte Ltd.<br><br>HSA has ordered the company to suspend sales and to recall the product from the market. It is monitoring the recall to ensure that stocks are being removed from the market as swiftly as possible.<br><br>Said Ms Ruth Lee, HSA's Deputy Director (Enforcement Operations) of the Health Products Regulation Group: 'While HSA conducts ongoing surveillance to check the safety of health products in the market, consumers can play a vital role in safeguarding their own health by being cautious and exercising discretion in the choice of health products they buy'.<br><br>'Anyone who has specific medical concerns should consult a doctor instead of resorting to dubious products touting unproven claims. HSA would also like to take this opportunity to remind members of the public not to purchase health products from unknown and ambiguous Internet sources.'<br><br>For queries on the recalled product, members of the public can call HSA's Enforcement Branch at 6866 3485 (24-hour line) or via e-mail at hsa_is@hsa.gov.sg.</p>

              <p>It not a pity my friend. You should have thank HSA. Else you are just putting poison into your body.</p>
              <p>I tried Men Talk Candy before. It works because it contain poison.</p>
              <p>I think HSA are really stepping up their checks. The best alternative is still xp tongkat ali supreme.</p>
              <p> Read this - http://www.sammyboyforum.com/welcome-fl-dome-2-free-stds-included/99167-free-xp-tongkat-ali-supreme-xp-2-specially-sammyboyforum-members-10.html</p>
              <p>I found it on sammyboyforum and personally I tried it. Very good effects.</p>

              <p>HSA did not say Mentalk contains poison. If it did, I'll probably be dead b now. To say it works because it contains poison is completely baseless &amp; irresponsible, if you have seen the official reports or the quotes from the newpapers.</p>
              <p>It merely mentions that it contains components that might be dangerous to people with certain physical conditions. What exactly it is, I'll have to recall. It is like HSA saying that fatty meat is dangerous because it contains fats because it can cuase obesity in people with not very active lifestyles.</p>
              <p>Anyway I do not know your purpose of advertising or recommending that product here but to be honest, I have seen the advertisment in SBF &amp; quite interest to try it.</p>
              <p>You only have 1 post. My guess is you are a clone.</p>
              <p>Oh well, clone or not. Post responsibilily hor.</p>

              <p>article already said recalled and stop-sell</p>
              <p>now, dun need to haggle over technical terms</p>
              <p>ban, recall, stop sell etc, basically means nobody can sell it on the market, period</p>
              <p>please do not mislead your customers by saying no word ban inside the notice, because at the end of the day, you cant even sell it</p>
              <p>i know mlmers like to play around with such wordings so its better we be aware first</p>
