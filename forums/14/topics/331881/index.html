              <p>Please provide me when the NDO is going on.</p>
              <p>I will personally go down as a spy or send some friends too.</p>
              <p>I will make sure I film it down and report to CASE, Police, CAD, MAS etc...</p>
              <p>I might also slap some of the EmMax agents/lackeys.</p>
              <p>Lee Yong Chew is the number 1 lackey of Jackie Cheat who came out with these stupid ideas of selling paper clips. Alex is the other joker who invented the 'human game' to sell tissue paper at S$50 a piece to tourist, Singaporeans, primarily at area around EmMax or CBD area.</p>
              <p>Daniel (the Sunshine Joker on YouTube who sings with Lee Yong Chew*) and Fidia, a NTI, Sunshine agent, from Kaplan/APMI is now telling agents that they are from "Singapore Young Entrepreneur" and that they are participating in a 'Apprentice' reality show; with games to raise money for charity.</p>
              <p>Miss Fidia, this is directed to you. I did not misquote you, did I? Pity that you still choose to be blinded by the EGA scammers.</p>
              <p>Fidia remnd me of the current state that Sabrina is in... Sabrinified Productions eh? Using your parents names to sell policies... Wonderful teachings by BRM Daniel... Oh, why delete all Sunshine Empire records from your Blog? Guilt? Shame? Or scandals? You seem nice in person.</p>
              <p>Irene Rexless, where are you? Long time no see? Still cheating people in Malaysia for EmMax? How is our dear BWW NetWork and Yuan Jie? Still selling EmMax hard to feed Jackie Hoo and Ken Lee's gambling addictions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(* Lee Yong Chew's fake name he uses to scam victims is Ken Lee, BRM, Division J.A.B, since NOP, NTI, Sunshine Empire, EmMax. Still doing research on this lackey. Amazing life story... Joanne See Hui Jing, I pity you. How you were cheated by him, youth, money, everything. Better make a police report. The cheating case goes beyond Sunshine Empire.)</p>
              <p>Would like to thank all those who have Emailed me with information. Thank You.</p>

              <p>Flashback:</p>
              <p>During the Sunshine Empire 1st Anniversary Celebration (the
                                      final and only one) held in Genting Highlands in 2007, James Phang
                                      and Jackie Hoo was being held up in detention and assisting in
                                      investigation by the Commercials Affairs Department [CAD] of
                                      Singapore. Their passports were held by the police and could not
                                      escape.</p>
              <p>David Phang (brother of James Phang and accomplice) announced in
                                      the Sunshine Empire Concert (held in "Arena of Stars", Genting
                                      Highlands) that he was busy in Singapore as his mother was sick and
                                      resting in hospotal.</p>
              <p><strong>This is a lie, publicity stunt and
                                      cover-up.</strong></p>
              <p>The instructions from Jackie Hoo to all BRMs such as Lee Yong
                                      Chew (Fake Name used to scam people = Ken Lee), Rick, Yuan Jie
                                      (David), Mei Qi, Alex Au etc, was to safeguard this information of
                                      James Phang being locked up by the police.</p>
              <p>Top priority was to ensure confidence of GP investors in the
                                      Taipei and TaiChung Wireless project (now both proven to be
                                      non-existent) and not to upset the Sunshine Empire Agents outside
                                      of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The secondary priority was to shift attention of CAD, MAS
                                      (Monetary Authority of Singapore) to investigate other MLM
                                      companies such as EnYouth, Long Far and CosLab. Jackie's rationale
                                      was EnYouth was most similar to NTI; LongFar and Coslab's products
                                      and marketing plans was most similar to Sunshine Empire's
                                      unauthorised and unregulated investment schemes (Gold Prime, Silver
                                      Prime, Bronze Prime, EmPin). Agents were told to call CAD,
                                      MediaCorp to report the alleged crimes of these companies.</p>
              <p>This was also the time that the internationl GP or EmPin was
                                      formulated to save Sunshine Empire Singapore. (Later on, EmPin's
                                      pay out proved to be worst than any other GP, SP or BP. Now EmPin
                                      is a defunct product and investors are still waiting for a
                                      refund)</p>
              <p>One month later, James Phang's mother really died. Agents,
                                      Managers, Downlines were all expected to attend the wake and
                                      funeral to prove their loyalty to James Phang and
                                      <strong>attendance was taken</strong>. It is a EGA tradition to
                                      make even a wake/funeral to be a business related function. Small
                                      division meeting were even held during the wake to boost sales in
                                      order to compensate James Phang's lost.</p>
