            <div class='col-md body'>hmm where are those swisscash agents now?<br><br>as early as last october, warning bells have already been rung<br><br><blockquote><strong>In Malaysia, about 40 investors are believed to have fallen prey to the scam. According to reports, eight men are helping police in their investigations into alleged cheating of about RM20 million ($8.7 million) through the Swiss Cash fund, in October last year. The Swiss Embassy and Central Bank in Malaysia have both issued warnings to investors about the scheme.</strong></blockquote>and for those who invested in schemes/projects/investments not regulated by MAS, another warning bell<br><br><blockquote><strong>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has confirmed that Swiss Cash or Swiss Mutual Fund is included in the MAS' Investor Alert List (IAL). This is a list of companies or individuals that may be conducting activities not regulated by the MAS.<br>.<br>The list can be found at www.moneysense.gov.sg/check_our_list/Consumer_Portal_IAL.html.<br>.<br>By giving Singaporean investors the false impression that they are operating in Singapore or by sometimes using names similar to entities regulated by the MAS, these companies are able to attract Singapore consumers, the MAS' website said.<br>.<br>Consumers who deal with firms that are not regulated by the MAS will not get recourse to compensation if they lose money on their investments, the central bank said.<br><br>It added that the promotion of the fund seems to work via agents on a multi-level marketing or MLM system, which appears to closely resemble a pyramid scheme.<br></strong></blockquote></div>
