There is a tremendous amount of good and useful information, but unfortunately the Internet is also a breeding place of a lot of misleading sometimes even fraudulent information. It is therefore always wise to do some research.<br><br>The Swiss Mutual Fund (1948 ) and or Swiss Cash are not registered companies in Switzerland. Until proof of the contrary, the Embassy doubts that the remarks about these funds and their historic links to Switzerland as outlined on their original website are genuine. The original website is indeed registered in the USA and the contact telephone number is from New Jersey (USA).<br><br>It is obvious that this company uses the denomination Â“SwissÂ” in an illegal and fraudulent way to attract customers.<br><br>Moreover, the promotion of the fund seems to work via agents on a MLM system which appears to be close to a Pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are illegal in Switzerland.<br><br>The Embassy does therefore not recommend these funds as an investment opportunity.<br><br><a href="http://www.swisscash.biz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.swisscash.biz/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.eda.admin.ch/kualalumpur_emb/e/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eda.admin.ch/kualalumpur_emb/e/home.html</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beware of SwissCash, they are operated by some people who used to be high up in NTI but left NTI to participate in SwissCash. As stated in the above post, there is nothing Swiss about SwissCash and they use almost all forms of MLM, from pyramid to binary to attract inflow of money.<br><br>If the above poster is indeed from the Swiss Embassy, please take some action against this company for misrepresentation and for fraudulent claims persuant to the MLM Act (Admendment Yr. 2000). The name of your country's position as a financial centre is being tarnished by this potentially illegal company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahahaha,<br>KitKen,<br><br>I think you get the wrong idea, I not saying swisscash cannot make money,<br>it's just that the swiss embassy/bank/UBS does not recognise it, meaning it is a typical money game, which ppl in the later stage will lose money and the money they lose will be in large amounts...<br>I'm sure you joined early n gotten back your yield, but please dun re-invest or you will throw away all your profits...<br><br>For all involved, I only can say: Swisscash is fraud and whether u make $$ or not doesn't matter!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People can claim all they want. The Police has no power to recognise any institution as a legal investment unit. Therefore you are lying through your teeth and we here don't approve of shameless liars like you. I'd advise you to quit promoting your forums and scams and leave.</div>
