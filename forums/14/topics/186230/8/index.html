            <div class='col-md body'>I would say the mastermind who started this SwissCash MLM must be quite a genius. Sadly, a genius who uses his brain to prey on the greedy and desperate.  It would be interesting to know how the whole operation work, how he gets the money, how much he made, how he pays off back to investors, who created and manage the website? The saga is probably at it's end stage for this fictitious company but I doubt very much about the police's or interpol ability to catch the mastermind.<br><br>I reported this SwissCash to CAD since abt 5-6 mths ago and it easy to see that even our CAD are quite loss at how even to check if this thing was fake. Our CAD officers and probably also our Malaysian police are also less bothered about making a more thorough investigations as I believe then there were still few victims or even none who have yet to report it.<br><br>With some monitoring, I observed the mastermind was constantly covering up his loopholes. At first, his website was only looking real. Swisscash website was hosted under fictitious names and contacts. There was also no feedback system. Then it changed. Website was revamped and a feedback system was created to make it more believable for the victims. Then he started putting in more realistic site registration names and contacts but which actually led to nowhere or anything related to this company. I guess it was an effort to put away the suspicious techies like me.<br><br>I also believe the mastermind is using largely the internet forums in each the country that he is targeting to advertise this Swisscash. He is probably among the many forumers who promote the scheme and at the same time puts in some "convincing theories" to rebut the truth. At the same time, he educates his investor on how to convince and draw other investors.<br><br>Fellow Singaporeans, MLM/ponzie schemes are almost all totally fake. Don't be a fool and also make others a fool.<br><br>Just my two cents<br><br></div>
