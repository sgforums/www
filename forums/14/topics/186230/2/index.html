Wonder how this fella got my mail add....<br><br>hello, my name is shawn, how are u? i am from KL, anyway there is a investment plan i would like to share with you... plz take some time to listen to me, i am not running scams or trying to cheat you, i am currently involve with offshore investment called eswissfund, if you are familiar with swishcash then eswissfund is similar but the returns are faster and better!<br><br>eswissfund is a new company only started about 2 months ago! now this is a simple plan, no hassles and certainly no cheating, you basically invest in usd dollars and then after 16 months, you will get a profit of 6 times of what you invest, for example if you invest 1k usd, your profit after 16 months will be 6k plus usd, so it is a 600% return<br><br>now unlike swishcash where it takes about 8 months to get your capital back, eswissfund you will definately get your capital back in 3 months, then after that it will be profits until the 16 months is up! this is how it works, after u invest, it can be 100usd, 500usd, or 1k usd, you can put as much as you want, there is no limit... after you invest, the next day you will start receiving your interest, yes this is a daily interest plan, company will pay you interest 5 days a week until 16 months, if you think this is too good to be true then by all means you can take out your interest everyday, like i said, we are not in the business to cheat ppl, this is how it works!<br><br>100usd- 1.2 % daily for 5 days<br><br>500usd- 1.5 % daily for 5 days<br><br>1k above-1.7% daily for 5 days<br><br>As you can see it is recommended you invest 1k and above, or less if you want, company will pay you interest daily of 1.7 percent, this means that by 3 months, you will get back your initial capital, after that is it profit until the 16 months expires, if you are paranoid that you will lose money then by all means take out your interest every day, for further info go to www.eswissfund.com, you can also sponser anyone to invest and you will make a one time 10% commission from him. Plz write me or call me if you are interested in making money, it doesnt matter where you are, this is a global investment plan, hope to hear from u, thx<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Hi all,<br><br>Just want to warn everyone here that SwissCash is just another pyramid scam in the market today, using the binary system...<br><br>It was started by a few "old-birds" (BB, J.Wong, etc) in MLM, you know, those so-called MLM "pioneers" who made their money by scamming endless numbers of people over the past 6-7 years. They have been around since MLM started in Singapore...<br><br>Swisscash is a success now mainly because these guys have quite a few people under them who are always ready and willing to make money in scams like this, so their "market penetraton" is quite high. The money will keep rolling until it explodes one day. Of course the initial batch of people have made back their return of investment, since the game is still rolling... but the truth is nobody knows when this game will come to an end. I heard that they even went to Indonesia to attract businessman to "invest", so perhaps the game can "tahan" for awhile longer.<br><br>Just a warning to all of you guys... money don't grow on trees... don't let your greed overtake your common sense. </span></strong></div>

There is a tremendous amount of good and useful information, but unfortunately the Internet is also a breeding place of a lot of misleading sometimes even fraudulent information. It is therefore always wise to do some research.<br><br>The Swiss Mutual Fund (1948 ) and or Swiss Cash are not registered companies in Switzerland. Until proof of the contrary, the Embassy doubts that the remarks about these funds and their historic links to Switzerland as outlined on their original website are genuine. The original website is indeed registered in the USA and the contact telephone number is from New Jersey (USA).<br><br>It is obvious that this company uses the denomination Â“SwissÂ” in an illegal and fraudulent way to attract customers.<br><br>Moreover, the promotion of the fund seems to work via agents on a MLM system which appears to be close to a Pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are illegal in Switzerland.<br><br>The Embassy does therefore not recommend these funds as an investment opportunity.<br><br><a href="http://www.swisscash.biz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.swisscash.biz/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.eda.admin.ch/kualalumpur_emb/e/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eda.admin.ch/kualalumpur_emb/e/home.html</a><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>bingo<br><br>at least u bother to check out the background<br><br>congrats<br><br>it is definately a pyramid scam<br><br>the island it operates on is on a island which u see in the movie 'Priates of the Carribean' in one of those islands.<br><br>this island basically is catered for those company without backing, little captial needed to start up, their website may look good with new york stock exchange, but its just a gimmick<br><br>the island that they operate on is a lawless island, all scam, if you wanna join,   or wondering if you have some offers which are similar, and aren't sure, let me help you check on its background etc.<br><br>so i see they have change plan already is it?<br><br>last time its 3 plans<br><br>plan a<br><br>invest USD 1000, 10 monts returns = 200%<br><br>plan b<br><br>invest USD 1000 15 months returns = 300%<br><br>plan c<br><br>invest USD 1000 30 months returns 1000%<br><br>so whats the new plan now?<br><br>if you need a explaination on why its a pyramid, let me know via mail, i can explain to you in detail. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Facts about SwissCash<br><br>- Commissioner of Security and Future(SFC) in Hong Kong has listed the website SwissCash as a fake or scam website.<br><br>- The alleged Michael Mansfield who is the Chief Financial Officer is just a name in registering the domain name on 8 June 06. Before this SwissCash registered the website on proxy.<br><br>- The webmaster of SwissCash site registered the domain name in USA and have once used an email on host 202.189.48.230, an ISP in Malaysia, Nasion.com<br><br>- Host Nasion.com shares the site with 4 other websites which one of them has a link with SwissCash which is emobile2u.com. The website emobile2u.com was registered on 12 June 05, same date with swissmutualfund.biz.<br><br>- The registrant of emobile4u.com which is a PONZI scheme on the net is also the same person who registered empiredreams.com. Another ponzi scheme link with SwissCash.<br><br>- It has closest link with the registrant of the web, Kelvin Choo for emobile and Richard Santiago for empiredreams whom both uses the same email, domain_house@yahoo.com.<br><br>- Empiredreams website which was registered on 16 August 03 also has link with Swisscash through ELIXIR DYNAMIC which has once a base in Malaysia and attracted lots of Malaysians before this.<br><br>- Claiming that Swiss Mutual Fund has been popular since 1948 but they are only known after their website was registered on 2005. No other information abt it in the internet except their own website.<br><br>- More to its scam is their copyright. They claim COPYRIGHT 2003 - 2005 but only registered on 2005 and not 2003.<br><br>- The telephone number for both empire2u and empiredreams are the same. 60322871871. But the number is unuseable.</div>
