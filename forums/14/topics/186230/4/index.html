There is a tremendous amount of good and useful information, but unfortunately the Internet is also a breeding place of a lot of misleading sometimes even fraudulent information. It is therefore always wise to do some research.<br><br>The Swiss Mutual Fund (1948 ) and or Swiss Cash are not registered companies in Switzerland. Until proof of the contrary, the Embassy doubts that the remarks about these funds and their historic links to Switzerland as outlined on their original website are genuine. The original website is indeed registered in the USA and the contact telephone number is from New Jersey (USA).<br><br>It is obvious that this company uses the denomination Â“SwissÂ” in an illegal and fraudulent way to attract customers.<br><br>Moreover, the promotion of the fund seems to work via agents on a MLM system which appears to be close to a Pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are illegal in Switzerland.<br><br>The Embassy does therefore not recommend these funds as an investment opportunity.<br><br><a href="http://www.swisscash.biz/" rel="nofollow">http://www.swisscash.biz/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.eda.admin.ch/kualalumpur_emb/e/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eda.admin.ch/kualalumpur_emb/e/home.html</a><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Swisscash has got nothing to do with lovely country Switzerland, as such is also true for SwissGarden Hotel, swiss rool cakes etc. As my knowledge and experience is concerned Swisscash make payment to its investor on time.

SwissCash can sue the Embassy or seek clarification with it if they think the Embassy is defaming them.<br><br>On top of that, you guys choose a very misleading name.<br><br>Risk? So what if people drop dead in their sleep? It got nothing to do with joining a business scheme. Poor use of analogy!<br><br></div>
