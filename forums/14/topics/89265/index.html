            <div class='col-md body'>Does it work?<br><br>Here is my write up..<br><br><blockquote><br>IÂ’m new to this forum and new to this industry too. However, I have something to share with all and I hope that IÂ’m not violating any ground rules here. Gee , IÂ’m gonna Â“shamelesslyÂ” promote an alternative to increase your pocket money.<br><br>I was spending time aimlessly surfing the net when my brother introduced this website to me and I signed up almost instantly, awaiting for my next commission to be cashed in.<br><br>Here are some of the Â“selling points Â” (which I think there are, at least in my opinion) of the website:<br><br>1. Ever wonder why people are so hesitant to sign up MLM packages despite the business opportunity being lucrative and seemingly feasible?<br><br>Could it be:<br><br>A. afraid  of meeting strangers to share with them how wonderful the products are? I mean after all, this is why I chose not to be in the frontline sales, door2door sales.<br><br>B. the thought of Â“capitalizingÂ” the relationship with your loved ones, friends and relatives negating the lucrative MLM packages?<br><br>C. much time and effort has been invested and nothing has been sowed after reaping. I can feel that too, I often experience disappointment  after spending 2-3 hours of persuading/coaxing/indulging in self-pity and all I get is a Sorry BUT NO!<br><br>D. the idea of having to purchase the companyÂ’s products (which u donÂ’t need) beforehand as part of the membership. This is very irritating especially you have the Â“maintenanceÂ” criteria to fulfill. Pondering hard enough, chances are if you donÂ’t like the products , no one else will.<br><br>E. High membership fees to promote exclusiveness (by acting as a barrier of entry but most importantly it is a barrier to exit. You are trapped. You wonÂ’t and canÂ’t leave when you donÂ’t make enough.)<br><br>Therefore, what this website offers?<br><br>A. a total approach of online MLM. You donÂ’t have to meet strangers to explain anything. Everything is instructional via online Â– from compensation plans to products to future prospect. WhatÂ’s best is that itÂ’s internationally linked. No geographical barriers, no language barrier (thatÂ’s if you understand english), no barrier of entry (because the membership is only US$7) and no barrier of exit (free if you have 3 downlines). Anybody, everybody and somebody can joinÂ…<br><br>B. if you donÂ’t like the idea of capitalizing the relationship with your loved ones, friends and relatives. Then donÂ’t. Internet is a humongous virtual reality so there are a lot of people which you can source for. Maintaining healthy relationships with like-minded people is the key to success for MLM companies, and NOT jeopardizing your relationships with your loved ones, friends and relatives.<br><br>(Until here, are you buying this idea??)<br><br>C. time and effort have been invested but nothing in return. Frustrated? Fret not, all you have to do is to email this information and everything is done. 1 hour a day keeps your $$ rolling in. If you are a net savvy person, this is definitely to your advantage. No gimmicks! No frills!<br><br>D. ItÂ’s good to know that you do not have to buy any product from the company in order to start joining. All you need is US$7. How this compensation plan works is explained in detailed in the website.<br><br>E. High membership/maintenance fees? Definitely NOTÂ…Â…. US$7/mth and no hidden costs!<br><br>How it works?<br><br>In layman terms, the MLM company compensation plan is simple. Sign up as a member for just US$7 /month and the membership is ONLY free when you manage to get 3 downlines within the FIRST month. (THIS IS IMPORTANT~!) In other words, you keep paying until you get 3 downlines.<br><br>But wait a moment, your job does not just end there! You have to keep recruiting people to be your downlines before you can start earning cashed in commission.<br><br>What then are your strategies?<br><br>Stop reading if you are not really interested! DonÂ’t waste your time, baby. Do something more constructive then. For those really keen, log on to this website at <a href="http://www.bigbucks.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigbucks.cjb.net</a> (my marketing tool.) See the left panel of the website and you will see LINKS, click on The $7 Plan.<br><br>Then it will link you to the website with my referral ID. Read in details, sign up and agree to the terms and conditions (yada yada   ) and wella ~ you are part of the company.<br><br>Strategies wise will depend on individual. If you are proficient in web designing, thatÂ’s your advantage. Do up a website (something like mine) or even better than mine and ALWAYS remember to include the URL with your referral ID.<br><br>Start introducing to your friends and wait for $$ to roll in.<br><br>As part of an incentive to sign up under me, I will share with you some of my marketing tools and strategies once I have done up my manual and will email to my downlines.<br><br>Good luck and I hope to see you soon.<br><br>I can be contacted at jack@|nospam|acgcompanies.com.sg.

            <div class='col-md body'>Scratching the surface, it may seem to be a well-disguised pyramid selling. However, I don't think so.<br><br>This is more like an affliate program rather than blatant pyramid selling whereby you get paid for introducing people to the products/services.<br><br>Firstly, no $$ after gettting 3 downlines.. hmm.. does pyramid selling offer that?<br><br>Pyramid memberships are always very high, namely exclusiveness and compensation.<br><br>This online MLM is still the traditional matrix prototype. It just that you don't have to pay to stock the products. If your friends are interested, then you can advise them to sign up as a associate of the MLM company and through this MLM company, you can help them order the health products for them.<br><br>Put it this way.. this $7 company is a pure MLM company which source for quality health products and they have decided to joint venture with Liberty Health. Whereas most "MLM" companies set up in Singapore are NOT pure "MLM" companies. They are more like pharmarceutical/ health biotechnology companies using the "MLM" way to distribute their products, cutting all "middle-man" (National Distributor, Regional Distributor and Wholesale Distributors) costs.<br><br>I guess the main worry about this $7 plan company is about the Internet security.. How secure it is etc... I tried using debit card and so far not much of problem..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My dear friend, yes US$7 (SG$12) may seem to be a small amount.<br><br>Yes, you don't need to pay after getting 3 downlines.<br><br>Ever heard of this advice that people give?<br><br>"if its too good to be true, then its not"<br><br>I hope you did a bit of analysis, in the first place why is there a need for the 7 dollars?<br><br>The money is used to fund this "company" so they they can buy products for its members.<br><br>Your LHN membership (if you qualify) is obviously going to be placed under the owner of this 7 bucks plan. which incidentally happens to be Don Garlick &amp; Associates.<br><br>If you do a simple check on them you will find them registered in the States as a LLC AND they have other sites that does the same thing..<br><br>So basically 7 bucks is a way for them to generate revenue and distributors which all fall under them..<br><br>If there is anyone who is going to earn 5K to 10K US$ a month it will be them.<br><br>and one last spanner into your works my friend.<br><br>Did you check if Liberty products are already in Singapore or they have been pre-approved by HSA for import?<br><br>cheap and free doesn't always mean good.</div>

Of cos you need to check out the company to make sure it's okay and not some fraud.<br><br>Why I said so becos I know of people who are highly educated and already successful in their career doing mlm as an extra source of income. People like doctors, managers and even the VP of a company are just some of those that do not fall under the caterogary u mention<br><br>Why they involve in mlm? All because they believe in the mlm system. Not everyone will make it big to earn millions from mlm just like in traditional biz where only 1/10 succeed but to earn extra few hundreds to thousands /mth is not a problem if you work hard. FYI, my up-up- upline happens to be the boss of a company,  a millionaire. Despite him being a millionaire, he still takes some time out from his own biz every wk to do mlm. Becos he said he doesnt mind earning extra money and helping out others at the same time.<br></div>
