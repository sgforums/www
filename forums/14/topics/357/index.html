            <div class='col-md body'>this depends on yourself, whether are u in any financial needs or can you endure of spending your twenties in the SAF.The contract now is ten years. As a regular you will have your financial independant with a monthly income.I am a regular in air force. We have a irregular working time.(this will depends on the flying schedule for the day)Sometimes we need to work longer.Sometimes very very early in the morning. But u can still squeeze in time for your part-time studies. But if they required your service,work comes first. The second line job(aircraft servicing)is more regular at least u know the working time(either 8 to 5 or 4 to .....)depending on the number of unserviciable aircraft for the day.<br>i hope this will help u to decide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup,now the contract is 10 years,but the benefits are you get your rank faster and also your pay rise will be more,the downside to SAF is there are lotsa restriction and rules to follow,also best to get a scholarship and sign on as officer as officers on scholarship tend to rise faster than the rest of officers provided you done nothing seriously wrong,for specialist side,10 year i think includes a warrant officer if you continue after the 10 years.But think carefully as once you put the pen to paper,it is very difficult to back out and break your contract,heheeh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>It's take a second to look at my makan,a minute to finish my burger and a lifetime to enjoy all the food i want <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Diablo 2 rockzzzzzz <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
