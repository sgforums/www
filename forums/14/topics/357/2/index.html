            <div class='col-md body'>Of course I would strongly encourage anyone to sign on, only if they like the job. That's the key. No point signing on and regretting and fretting about it.<br><br>If your concern is about remuneration, I'm sure SAF will pay sufficiently well with their SAVER scheme. Moreover, during times of recession, what better alternatives do you have? In Taiwan, the enlistment numbers increased tremendously because of the economic problem.<br><br>But then again, it really depends which vocation you are in and how fit you are. Combat and technical vocations are among the highest. If you are highly unfit, don't sign on unless you intend to stay stagnant in your ranks.<br><br>These are the few things that you need to pay attention to, if you are intending to sign on with SAF</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi<br>i was an nsf army officer who has ORDed.<br>i wanted to sign on but was denied a contract due to 'reasons only for those with need to know'. probably my color.<br>anyway, i am one of those few ppl who really loved the army. my point is, it is very easy to hate the army and life as an army regular. and theres nothing wrong with hating army life coz i oso know that its rigid, regimental, tough, etc....<br>but there are those ppl who can take that kind of life and even find it rewarding. money is not a motivating factor for these ppl so if you're in it for the money i can say you will regret. my best advise is to do your ns first and see for yourself if you are the kind who love it. one sure way to tell is at the end of your bmt, do you feel like going thru even tougher stuff like commandos or guards or maybe armour. if yes, then you're probably the type.<br>also, it is against military law to be employed either during ns or as a regular.<br>and a career as an officer ends when you are 45 yrs old with rank of lieutenant-colonel or colonel if you are outstanding.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main thing is to go thru your BMT phase first then decide loe..but then..once you have made your decision..then dun regret and just do what you can loe...i also thought of signing on with the ARMY before my BMT days...and thought that tough training were glorious and etc etc...but once i got into BMT...perceptions start to change and looking at the way the SAF works.,.it will really make you think twice abt signong on loe..and yes...you will be able to study overseas when you have signed on..but its just the matter that are you on a award basis or on no-pay study leave..whats more..SAF also has study loans for you as a regular officer...well whatever it is..make up your mind and never regret...just my $0.02 worth.. :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's 4 more months to ord! And as some of my frens say, you really feel like signing on as you come closer to ording...<br>cos when you think back upon your ns days, you cant help recalling all the fun you have had with you platoon mates, men, and commanders....<br>All the shit that you have endured really seems insignificant, compared to all the fun and camaradie that you experience in this 2.5 years...<br>haha... but still i wont sign on.<br>For those who are considering to sign on,<br>My advice would be to go thru bmt first, then experience your 2.5 years of nsf life. then only can you really decide whether the army is your cup of tea.<br>Well ... all i can say is that the pay is resonable. sign on as an officer, and you can earn $8,000++ per month as a LTC. i think you can earn ard $6,000++ as a MWO.<br>If you love your ns life, then sign on, the pay is an additional bonus.<br>your duty hours suck though.. you gotta commit your 24 hours/day to the army...</div>

Ok ok...<br>First class or not, a CPT has to take ard 3-4 years minimum, and they are usually the scholars of SAF. If you belong to the self-motivated lot, sorry but you have to wait for min. of 6 years, i think. There is no hard facts for these as they are all 'performance' based kindda thing.<br><br>To LTC? I think this is a pretty long wait.. timeline also not sure cos i think you need to fulfil something, either thru academic course or military courses. In short, if you grab your chance well, you will move up fast enough. Salary scale, sorry, can't advice that....<br><br></div>
