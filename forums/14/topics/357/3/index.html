            <div class='col-md body'>Big organisations all suck. But we do learn from them, don't we?<br><br>After all SAF is so big, admin lapse is unavoidable. Furthermore, most of the active ppl are NSFs who just blurblur come out of studies trying to run the show. Who you wanna blame? Blame SAF for wat? We are running the show? If anyone wanna blame also blame the little population we have. But our SAF is not bad liao la. At least got some credibility (which foreigners know but we dun... hahaha). If we go other countries and experience also see they got plenty of lapses...much worse than us. So serve it. Complain as much la.. after all you still LANLAN serve 2.5 years. PPL give u so much money liao can complain less lah huh? And life also constantly improving in NS. If all young men all dun like NS and refuses to do NSF to the extent all of us kanna DB, nobody to help out in defense, then wanna make ppl think we are good also cannot. At least ppl think we are good now.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess in that case, you'd have to get women to do NS too. Lately, like the previous poster has mentioned, men have become all gu-niang. Women nowadays, if you observe their behavior are very into the male trend. They smoke, they ride bikes, they curse and swear, they have short hair, yada, yada, yada...<br>What I'm saying is, if NS is so important to the country, the women should play a part in it too shouldn't they? After all, it is also their country! Forget cooking (which they can't seem to do nowadays anyway), forget cleaning (which they get maids to do), forget taking care of babies (again the maids do this), look towards NS for women...duty, honor, country!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>----------------------<br>I've ORDed, so.....<br>My 2 cents worth :<br><br>Go into NS first. During BMT, see how screwed up the SAF is. Despite all the grand talk about ideals, pride and all, the people running the show are more concerned for their personal gain and promotion.<br><br>Though its an iron rice bowl, not everybody can take the life. Think first, then think again... then tear the contract into 2 pieces.<br>----------------------------<br><br>I totally agree with that, before i went in the Army. I thought this is great, idealistic , pride and all the stuff. But after i am in it. IT"S TOTALLY different, all that is in the toilet bowl..<br>Nobody have that Grand Passion or idealism you see in the T.v commerical. IT's all about the $$$ and how fast you climb.<br><br>Never, Never, Never, Never Sign on For money.I could'nt stress enough. If you do that, yes.. you will have slightly more cash. But you loose another a more valueable item that perhaps cost even more money to break to get, that is FREEDOM.<br><br>------------------<br>~~~```` run..while you can ''''''~~~~~~~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the SAF really portray its image very well to the public and that Singaporean can really sleep well knowing that the sky, land and sea is well protected. Ask any regular who serve the organisation before or still in-service, less those officers( all talk no action) and they think otherwise.This system is been established since S'pore become and not a single man can change it..Screw those God wannabe and pity those native minds.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>$$$ Yes that's a BIG factor for many who signed on. But more importantly is whether you have the interest in being part of SAF. The $$$ are just incentives.<br><br>In my opinion, diploma holders should go for specialists. They will be the high flyers of the NCOs. If they sign on as officers instead, they will most probably be farmers... A sad thing but thats the fact. There are already so many LSA holders taking up key appts. A diploma holder will have to really perform outstandingly.<br><br>I've seen many junior dip officers performing well but becos they r dip holders, they cant progress faster than a degree holder. Its the same...A LSA holder will NEVER fly past a SAFOS. Thats how the system works.<br><br>Above are my personal views.
