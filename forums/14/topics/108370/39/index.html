            <div class='col-md body'>Decantre<br><br>Firstly, I am confused by your stand as you said<br><br><blockquote>Unless they read sgforums on a regular basis, checking for customer complaints.</blockquote>So do you know as a distributor, are you a customer or representative of the company? What legal rights do you have to represent the company with regards to Agency Laws? (You said you are an AGENT of NTI but do you know you are not legally an AGENT as you are not a legal representative of the company?) Do you have the same rights as a consumer or is it a pure B2B transaction with regards to you selling the concept of NTI?<br><br>Secondly, regarding the actions being taken against NTI you will know soon enough. Previously most forumers here have just made predictions and guesses regarding the fate of NTI. This time, we have taken action and these will bear fruit soon. Perhaps you'd like to ask Jacky if CAD was investigating NTI right now? BTW, if CID was investigating, it will be extremely unpleasant, just be glad its CAD. If I am that someone you are saying paraphrasing old posts, you do need to re-read all the 39 pages. In the past two months, more concrete information and positive action has come out than the past two years combined.<br><br>Do you really want paper examples of brainwashing in NTI? It simply shows you are one of the bottom feeders. I have a document from NTI showing how brainwashing is done! On top of that, it shows all the techniques that you can find from all the pressure selling/brainwashing books. You might want to get it from your upline's upline's upline to help improve your sales.<br><br>Whats with silly analogies to sidestep questions? Is it one of the Core Skills in MLM? It gets so irritating when nonsensical analogies pop up, perhaps its a better way of presenting a flawed argument as it induces the reader to come up with his/her own interpretation.<br><br>I can say that I strongly believe that although most MLMs are pretty much by-the-book, <strong>NTI is not one of them</strong>. You want to see a successful MLM that has no complaints? Check www.skyquestcom.com they sell educational/motivational materials and seminars etc. They rank as Singapore's Fastest Growing Online Companies. If NTI is aiming to go into e-biz, it is so far off that the end cannot be see. Its been two years already and so far has it even reached top 500 internet buisnesses in Asia? Skyquest is also around two years old. The people behind it are true success stories, unlike those in NTI. I am not associated with the company in any way but during my research, this company is one of the few MLMs that actually have positive publicity.</div>

Especially when you could conclude that one of my posts was 'you have based your point on the fact that nti has never been caught.' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Didn't Eiken mentioned that he was compiling a list of people with complaints against NTI? Surely he or you would have included evidence of NTI brainwashing their agents in that list, because that's a big issue, isn't it? And please don't let it be the usual stuff about how someone was brought down to NTI and told about how good and how successful he can be if only he join the company.<br><br>New religious movements (NRM)use brainwashing methods like 1)isolation from others for weeks, 2) humilation and public confessions for breaking of small rules, 3) sleep deprivation, 4) small rewards for any form of cooperation, among others.<br><br>Can you prove that NTI is using these methods? Are there any first-person testimonials? Can you?<br><br>And if you mean a subtler form of brainwashing, then, well, Singaporeans aren't living under a fucking rock.

Why are you asking the agents as opposed to the management?<br><br>Because the agents can't answer that. What do you expect us to reply, "I will ask my director to release the documents to prove you wrong!"?<br><br>I can only see one reason for your asking: so that less experienced agents will be tempted to avoid the question or be shown not being able to answer altogether. Score one for the anti-NTI camp! They can't release the documents because they are hiding something, nyeah people I told you so.<br><br>Ask the correct people.<br><br>And since we are on the topic, I do have to admit that comparing Coke and Pepsi was off. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I forgot that as a public company Coke have to release their reports.<br><br>But there you go. They are required by law to do so because they are publicly owned.

So that they don't have to release audit reports that will be available to their competitors?<br><br><blockquote>So do you know as a distributor, are you a customer or representative of the company?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey people! I'm back, what have I missed?<br><br><blockquote>If I got a dollar for everytime you edit your post once I post mine, I'd be richer than your boss by now. You have been vacillating so much in your arguments you can power a 40 watt lightbulb. I really don't know how to reply to someone who posts, then reads, then edits then reedits then reposts. I mean if we can all go back in time and change the things we said and did, there wouldn't be a need for a Court or a judiciary.</blockquote>Ooh, smooth comeback. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I like that comment about the lightbulb. It's so cute. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>I really don't know how to reply to someone who posts, then reads, then edits then reedits then reposts.</blockquote>Perhaps I can suggest: 1) saving a screenshot of her post, 2) then posting your reply, 3) and then if the person changes her post, 4) you could show the screenshot of the first post as completely seal-proof evidence that she has edited her post?<br><br>Now, have I edited my posts? Yes, I have. It's actually kind of embarrassing, but  I realised that after I posted, the posts are so damn <span style="font-style: italic;">long</span> that they have to be linked to another page. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>So I would edit my post to make it shorter. I don't want you to be deprived from the absolute sarcasm of my posts, you see. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Contents-wise, I can only remember adding this part:<br><br><blockquote>If you want to see what true 'intolerable' personal attacks are about, I suggest you visit the message boards of any actor. Trust me, if my posts were 'intolerable', those inside are a thousand times worst.<br><br>By the way, if that was 'emotional ramblings', I fear for your reaction when you encounter a real hysterical girl. :s </blockquote>Because I have a feeling you rather misunderstood the meaning of emotional ramblings, and the use of the word 'intolerable'. Of course, this is from my opinion, and it could be different from yours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Maybe you have a lower tolerance threshold?<br><br>But actually, I'm actually kind of scared that I have hurt your feelings unintentionally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> For you to call it an intolerable personal attack.<br><br>Is it possible for you to show me where have I made intolerable personal attacks in my posts?<br><br>I would <span style="font-style: italic;">love</span> to go back and edit my posts so that it doesn't personally attack you anymore. (with your permission, of course, and screenshots so that everyone can see I do not edit more than that.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Moving on, I'm sure that you still have doubts, whether those are the only stuff I have edited. No worries! I'm sure that a man like you would have already have evidence of such transgressions.<br><br>Surely in your next post you will inform all and sundry about the text I have altered, the stands I have changed!<br><br>I look forward to such a post.<br><br><blockquote>It is out of pure goodwill that we are here to educate the public about good practices and to make people like you aware of the potential pitfalls that lie ahead of you. It is advice that you can choose to take or not but what you as a person who believes in NTI can do is to show us the evidence that the company is good and is above board.</blockquote>It's very assuring that there are such selfless, benevolent individuals out there who would do that, with no ulterior motives and motivations.<br><br>I feel fortunate that altruism still exists in Singapore.<br><br>Undoubtably the future of MLM is bright, under your wise and impartial guidance and advice. Eikei, continue doing what you will. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It's an important duty to have - to educate the public.<br><br>If I may just suggest something?<br><br>Instead of only directing your energies at countering girls who can light up 40 watt lightbulbs, girls who are prone to emotional ramblings, and girls who  post intolerable personal attacks, you would look beyond this forum, and do something more than just winning debates with NTI agents virtually. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>*pause*<br><br>I notice that for my last few posts, you have countered my entries by dismissing my character, and my behaviour, instead of the points I have raised.<br><br>So friend, what's next? Are you going to dismiss me next by commenting that I appear to be raving? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Let me help you by citing some examples you can use:<br><br>1) You could say that you are too sleepy (wait, you already did that)<br>2) That I have reduced myself to emotional ramblings, and as such is impossible to answer (check.)<br>3) That I change my arguments too much (check)<br>4) That I appear to be raving mad and so you will not answer a madman.<br>5) You could find out who I am in the company, dig up some dirt and then voila! Expose my identity and dirty laundry online.<br>6) My posts are too long to read properly.<br>7) My posts are so sarcastic they make your eyes burn<br>8 ) I am too immature to argue with you, silly girl that I am.<br>9) I am too silly to argue with you.<br>10) I do not produce evidence, so therefore you shall not deign to reply.<br>11) I am jumping to conclusions, so you see no need to reply.<br>12) I'm wildly imaginative, and therefore you see no need to reply too.<br>13) I argue like a petulant child, so therefore you see no need to reply (again, check.)<br><br>I'm sure that you can think of more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I look forward to seeing how you dismiss me next. By the way, it's really smart of you to use that. By attempting to bring down someone's credibility, you are able to dismiss that person's entire argument in one fell swoop. Excellent!<br><br>PS: By the way, I screenshoted this post. In case you need the evidence that I alter my contents, feel free to ask me.</div>
