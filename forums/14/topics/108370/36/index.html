            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all<br><br>I happened to bum into this forum today and thought I'll share my bad experience with NTI and to clear information which I thought were inaccurate about Alan Mok.  I am not speaking up for him but he was a close friend of mine since 2000 and it was NTI that busted our friendship.  I joined NTI in early 2005 and this was the one and only time that Alan approached me to join him though I knew he was doing MLM actively for many years.  Being very skeptical, it was friendship and trust that made me joined NTI and yes, I regretted joining but moving on I take this as a lesson.  I had a few downlines which are my good friends of course.  Obviously they did not succeed and we all gave up in less than 2 months as the so-called presenters were in our opinion disorganised and unprofessional, on some occasions they were either late for our appointments or simply forgot to turn up.  It was a waste of energy and time on our part as we have our own full-time careers to focus on.  Fortunately, I have not lost these friends who supported me.  As for Alan, our friendship was strained because of this incident and obviously today, we totally lost touch.  It was only through this forum that I learnt about him and realised that his profile was removed from NTI's website.  Yes, he possesses a double degree and whether or not JP got him a BMW, he did own a 5-series BMW.  Passionate, committed to his job, creative in ideas, street-smart and results oriented, he probably excel well in the hospitality industry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for those out there who are considering about joining MLM, my advise to you is take time to consider carefully.  There are other very established MLMs like Amway and though I swear not to join another MLM, I am using Amway's product which is very good.  Remember, the choice is yours, no one can force you to join a MLM, take your time to ask around, find out more about the company and most importantly do not join merely because of friendship <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
