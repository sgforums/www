            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, what did I missed? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>I notice that for my last few posts, you have countered my entries by dismissing my character, and my behaviour, instead of the points I have raised.<br><br>So friend, what's next? Are you going to dismiss me next by commenting that I appear to be raving? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Let me help you by citing some examples you can use:<br><br>1) You could say that you are too sleepy (wait, you already did that)<br>2) That I have reduced myself to emotional ramblings, and as such is impossible to answer (check.)<br>3) That I change my arguments too much (check)<br>4) That I appear to be raving mad and so you will not answer a madman.<br>5) You could find out who I am in the company, dig up some dirt and then voila! Expose my identity and dirty laundry online.<br>6) My posts are too long to read properly.<br>7) My posts are so sarcastic they make your eyes burn<br>8 ) I am too immature to argue with you, silly girl that I am.<br>9) I am too silly to argue with you.<br>10) I do not produce evidence, so therefore you shall not deign to reply.<br>11) I am jumping to conclusions, so you see no need to reply.<br>12) I'm wildly imaginative, and therefore you see no need to reply too.<br>13) I argue like a petulant child, so therefore you see no need to reply (again, check.)<br><br>I'm sure that you can think of more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I look forward to seeing how you dismiss me next. By the way, it's really smart of you to use that. By attempting to bring down someone's credibility, you are able to dismiss that person's entire argument in one fell swoop. Excellent!<br><br>PS: By the way, I screenshoted this post. In case you need the evidence that I alter my contents, feel free to ask me.</blockquote>Posted on Page 39.<br><br>And bingo, I was proven correct!<br><br><blockquote>Decantre is such an incessant nag, everyline would be combative and if I were to stoop to her level, quoting her everyline, this topic will reach 100 pages soon and <strong>nothing constructive</strong> will be featured about NTI anymore.</blockquote>By the way, when was anything constructive featured about NTI from you? Enlighten me please, the great and mighty Eikei.<br><br><blockquote>NLP is just a broad term for any method that has a strong end in mind.</blockquote>Really, Eikei? But I guess I must trust you, because you are the foremost expert on everything under the sun. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0566083892/sr=8-1/qid=1149706552/ref=sr_1_1/102-7557707-8234540?%5Fencoding=UTF8" rel="nofollow">NLP Handbook</a>, <a href="http://www.nlpu.com/whatnlp.htm" rel="nofollow">NLPU</a>,<a href="http://www.nlpacademy.co.uk/WhatisNLP.asp" rel="nofollow">NLP Academy</a> were all wrong.<br><br>Your one sentence alone already showed your complete lack of understanding of what NLP is all about.<br><br>Seriously, I know you are an expert when it comes to network marketing and all that legal jargon, but don't act as if you know everything.<br><br>NLP is not a broad term. It's a specific science (some say it's pseudo-science, some say it's just an art of talking, but's it's definitely not what you say it is.)<br><br>PS: I like being a nag. I like posting long posts. So? Get over it, man. It's getting old.<br><br>If you want to continue attacking my ways instead of answering very valid questions, let's boogie.<br><br>You see, people expect me to duck from questions, to do stupid stuff in this forum. (in fact, if I do so, it actually strengthen your anti-NTI stand, that we are idiots and whatever.)<br><br>You, on the other hand, people expect you to be the expert. People listen to your words. It makes you look foolish if you are the one who dodge questions left, right, and center. And do you realise that you already sound damn stupid to a lot of people now?<br><br>Of course it seems not the case because this thread is chock-full of NTI condemners and they would side with you. But guess what? There's a world of people outside who are reading this thread. And you sound like you are running away from the question.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really have to agree that your long thesis is a complete and through personal attack on me which I will not respond here as it is against the spirit of this thread. Have you been asked to come here by your company to clear the thread and make the recent Faux Pas by your fellow NTI people disappear into the depths of the topic?<br><br>I shall give you a Honorary Title: NTI Page Clearer.<br><br>Everytime you come in, you will post long and tedious entries that do not do anything constructive and you always come in when one of your silly NTI agents get exposed on the forums. This allows people to forget what they have just done and be facinated with your vagrant foolishness. We were just exposing Yadoking as a failed attempt to pretent to be Anti-NTI and also have concluded our discussion about why the 22nd floor has disappeared when you come in. Also, all the NTI and EGA threads are terribly hot now so perhaps you would like to clear the pages there too.<br><br>If you said that I have not made any constructive arguments about NTI, I suggest you read the whole topic again. Anyway I have anonymous people and others who email me or PM me for information regarding NTI and alot of others who have told me how my posts have helped them understand the company more. I'm very glad everytime someone reads what I write, they walk away enriched and their money protected with their sound knowledge.</div>

We need to indentify who is who first. Where is this person standing affects his post's credibility a lot. For example, I joined NTI before I know how they function and therefore I can condemn. You didn't join and you condemn, it just doesn't seemed quite right as you are ignorant about it.<br>Furthermore, you are an agent you will definately defend against it even you know we are right. In contrast, if someone who is really not an NTI agent defend for NTI, it makes a different.<br><br>2. I know jp is trying hard to create some coy and make a living from it. You, me, everyone needs a living. Just that his way are simply too perfidious.<br><br>3. Please classified your "people" down here. It is either non-gullible, wise, smart, matured, experienced or far sighted people can distinguish the true sight of this coy.<br>NTI like to target young adult and blind/brainwash them using their dreams and future. They need people like us to admonish them.<br>Note: if all of us has a good judgement, we won't be chatting here. No one is perfect.<br><br>4. This is a Singapore popular forum, we can arouse the mass about our view. Many delegator and/or authority are seeing this forum too. Something which is execrate by so many people definately is very wrong.<br>One of the reason CAD checks on NTI might be due to the forum too. Don't look down its potential.<br><br>5. They will deal with it, but not now. Right now, we can help out a little by providing facts. At the same time, let people see the coin in 2 sides.<br><br>Lastly, we aren't complaining  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers dude!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I might not be from NTI or any other MLM but I sure know alot about them by going to their stuff, interviewing victims and researching on these companies. In the case of NTI, I probably know more about it than most high level managers as all they know is how to present their plans and to con more people. We all have our sources from within NTI and when it comes to how much their managers and directors are earning, I think its almost common knowledge for those in the know.

            <div class='col-md body'>Eikei, Eikei, Eikei, I really admire your way of always bravely trying to pull down my credibility and always getting shot down by me in return. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It's a sign of sound courage and steely determination, and I really admire you for that.<br><br>Now I like posting thesis, you have a problem with that?<br><br>And because I think it's cute that you always give such big reactions to my posts, I will again post a <strong>long thesis</strong> on 'A Study of Eikei's Bulls.hitology'.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Eikei:</div><div class="quote_body">I really have to agree that your long thesis is a complete and through personal attack on me which I will not respond here as it is against the spirit of this thread. [/quote]<br><br>Against the spirit of this thread? Where in every page there is someone yabbering about NTI and people posting various personal attacks on its management? I don't see you not bothering to respond to them.<br><br>It's so funny to see you attempting to be self-righteous and all morally upright when you sound like a pompous dude.<br><br>The sad thing is, you probably think that you are right all the while.<br><br>___<br><br>If my posts are your definitions of personal attacks, you must be emotionally very fragile. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> No worries Eikei, some people were born weak. It's nothing to be ashamed of.<br><br>So far you still have not shown the document that you claim is an evidence of NTI's brainwashing. I guess when the push came to shove, you had no balls to do it.<br><br>It's ok Eikei, some men were born without balls too.<br>____<br><br>Now, <strong>that</strong> is example of when I personally attack someone.<br><br>I could be meaner, but I don't want to hurt your feelings too badly, Eikei. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Also, I don't think it's necessary to snoop to your level and attack people's character in order to sound smart.<br><br>It is also against the spirit of this thread, huh Eikei?<br><br><blockquote><strong>I shall give you a Honorary Title: NTI Page Clearer. </strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>Such a mouthful. Do you work in the advertising sector, Eikei? If you are, what a lousy display of skills. A name must be <span style="font-style: italic;">catchy</span>, must be <span style="font-style: italic;">easily remembered</span>.<br><br>Why not Old Grandma? Naggy-Nag? NTI Nag?

So don't blame me for shooting you down.<br><br>I joined the forums in May.<br><br>This thread is how many years old?<br><br>I have less than 50 posts - even adding the fact that I post long thesis, how many NTI agents could I possible have defended? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The first time I posted, it was regarding a forumer called weijian who questioned the payout of LPS.<br><br>Now, that guy was definitely not an NTI agent anymore, and he was definitely not defending NTI, so... I 'always come in when one of your silly NTI agents get exposed on the forums'?<br><br>Whatever, man. Your logic is starting to baffle me.<br><br>You are spectacular at jumping to conclusions, Eikei. If, perhaps, you can 'jump' a bit more carefully and check your facts about the things you posted, you won't sound like a pompous idiot all the time.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>We were just exposing Yadoking as a failed attempt to pretent to be Anti-NTI and also have concluded our discussion about why the 22nd floor has disappeared when you come in. Also, all the NTI and EGA threads are terribly hot now so perhaps you would like to clear the pages there too.</blockquote>LOL Eikei!<br><br>If I remember correctly, I posted wrongly in the other thread? You saw the message when I stated that I posted wrongly too.<br><br>If I wanted to help Yadoking, I wouldn't have addressed NLP. The whole issue about NLP was in this thread, and you know it too.<br><br>My post was meant to be here. But you replied straightaway (so alert), so I replied you there.<br><br>Now, if you didn't want me to clear the page, maybe you could have just replied in this thread.<br><br>But to conclude that I was sent to divert attention from the topic at hand is absurd, because I <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">posted wrongly</span></strong> in that thread in the first place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>(By the way, you really don't know a hoot about NLP.

And I don't have to answer myself to you. In fact, with every post you typed, my respect for you dips ever the lower. You are starting to remind me of George Bush.<br><br>You are really showing a talent at jumping to conclusions left, right and center. Who knows, maybe after I post this post, you are going to jump to conclusions that I have a conspiracy with Fifa's organisers to fix the match between Germany and Costa Rica?<br><br>It would not be a departure from normal.<br><br><blockquote><strong>If you said that I have not made any constructive arguments about NTI, I suggest you read the whole topic again. Anyway I have anonymous people and others who email me or PM me for information regarding NTI and alot of others who have told me how my posts have helped them understand the company more. I'm very glad everytime someone reads what I write, they walk away enriched and their money protected with their sound knowledge.</strong></blockquote>I read. Yep, still nothing constructive. Heavily biased, and very vague.<br><br>You can do a good career in the public relations industry, drumming up publicity for events. Mystery works, isn't it?<br><br>I'm very glad that you play such an important role in so many people's life. Crusader of the innocents, protecting Singaporeans from rogue MLM companies like NTI.<br><br>Be proud of your calling, Eikei. Every night, after work, you sit in front of your computer and keep a vigil, thinking that your actions mean something in the long run.<br><br>Know that one day when you pass away, you can tell your grandchildren, "One of the greatest things I ever did in my youth was to convince lots of people not to join this really baaaad company - and I did it all online!"<br><br><img src="http://i5.tinypic.com/1254yyu.jpg"><br><br>I feel like I must return the favor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So embarrassing, you know, when someone gives you a present and you don't have anything for them.<br><br>You honoured me with the title of NTI Page Clearer; I hereby bestow you with the esteemed title of 'Captain Crusade'.<br><br>And yes, it's pointless, it's stupid, I have nothing better to do with my time, I admit. I'm waiting for the damn World Cup match to start.<br><br>Hey, just to help you out: if you want to insult me in the next post, do mention that my Photoshop skills suck.<br><br>Like I said before, I don't really care about what you say about me. But I'm sensitive about my Photoshop skills. Really sensitive. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>To conclude my thesis:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Eikei:<strong><br>I really have to agree that your long thesis is a complete and through personal attack on me which I will not respond here as it is against the spirit of this thread.</strong> </blockquote>Of course, because these two posts are LONG, COMPLETE and <strong>THOROUGH</strong> PERSONAL ATTACKS on you, and because it's against the spirit of this thread, am I wrong to think that you will not reply?<br><br>It's what you stated, anyway.<br><br>I don't know why I like aggravating you so much. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Perhaps its the fact that I can feel your blustering anger from the posts you generate, and I find it amusing?<br><br>Anyway, relax. I will not reply you with long thesises (joy!) any more. Your arguments are built on hearsay and common gossip, and I find it hard not to laugh when talking to a guy who wholeheartedly believes that brainwashing can happen so easily.</div>

I think you are mistaken lar... NTI become smaller is to benefit you and me.<br>Why? Lemme explain slowly to you,<br>-It closed down because the rent actually can gives us a higher pay rate.<br>-We are not targeting chinatown, we are targeting china, so don't bother opening a branch in chinatown right?<br>-Yes, office should become bigger, like out NTIIndonesia, the whole building. But hor, that time fire bring down the whole building, so we cease our plan there first, "WE WILL BE BACK!" (must say this like damn confident). But bro, you think hor, this is not jp business leh, it is yours, so jp closed them down and want U to build it up.<br>Furthermore, we are not relying on office anymore, we can do OPP anywhere, anytime.<br>-Many black sheep actually bring down the 1st shenton way already lar. Therefore we are moving to a new place soon. Now is just looking around and get the paperwork settled. We will provide you a more confortable place one bro.<br><br>You see what is a question and answer (Q&amp;A). We ask you answer, you ask we answer. From your answer, we then debate on its base and credibility. Answering question is not by posting my uncle pic so simple.
