            <div class='col-md body'>How can I possibly be the land lord itself? I just a visitor who visit the club twice a week, my relative is a ex member of this first club name mornington country club and I knew of this place for 2 years and above. As for Ron Lee, if he nickname as big canno guy.... well I dunno him quite well but it no big deal as long he dun drag me in MLM if we are really close.<br><br>I don't believe MLM or Network will bring me to a success path, with hard work, ability, experience, passion and team work or people that believe me will take me to a new stage of my life.When the right time arrive, I will get hold of it and be my own boss no matter what price it will take. But of course it not MLM hahaha.<br><br>Tell me guys, if someone out there insult you with words like money is your name. Will you feel angry?</div>
