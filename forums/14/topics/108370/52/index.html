How is it possible for anybody to be able to make a complete evaluation of a stranger based on 1 forum post? I did however, point out that you fear too much, didn't I? Forgot to mention that the way you write is very awkward.. Reads as though you are writing an FAQ in a help file. For your benefit, I was referring to your mediocre mastery of language and your whimpiness, which were clearly evident in your writing style and the nature of the concerns that you raised when I mentioned "major flaws".<br><br>It is great to know that you have a "desire to improve n learn". But reading self-improvement guides is a passive activity. You may learn some pointers but you need to practise them in order to truly master these soft skills. At NTI, we afford you many opportunities to practise these skills on fellow trainees. Your speaking prowess will be dramatically improved through interaction with peers with different personalities. It is not convenient for me to divulge too much information about our training methods as these are regarded as trade secrets that makes NTI stand out among other centres that purport to offer such training. As mentioned earlier, since you have already paid for the education package, may I humbly suggest again that you take some time off your schedule to attend the courses? You will be converted. And very soon, you will be out there roping your friends into the company just like me because you want them all to benefit from it!<br><br>Cheers<br>NTI<br></span></strong><br>[/b]</blockquote>Wow!

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I have my fair share of MLM a.k.a Pyramid System. I take you all back to 1995-1997 remember No.1 Products. I was quite young at that time and worked part time at a supermarket store earning a few hundred per week.<br><br>One of my idiot friend got me into listern to No.1 product and say about their magnatic bed have improve health functinos and stuff and count myself lucky I bought one thinking it would be good for my mom for health reason. Lucky that was during CNY and they had a rebate lucky draw and I got the $1888 draw and the bed cost was $1280 so lucky me got a bed and $600. (Suckers lost a bed and $600 to me).Being inmuture and easily psychoed I thought I got a good deal. They even gave me a cheapo members card.<br><br>Soon after I got called up for NS and stuff. 2 years down the road when I ORD my officer called me up trying to sell me another bed another company this time round I've got my experience with me and being firm in my decision. No mean No and more over I've one bed already why would I need to buy another one.<br><br>A few months ago I too had another friend that joined BEL AIR and made it... He asked me and brought me to the commonwealth place to listern I find it a baloni and BS. The speaker was a ex-DJ. No doubt his presentation was great but once bitten twice shy. So out of friendship and goodwill i got the cheapest lamp and a liquid... its still full and the lamp is unused.<br><br>Now my brother-in-law is sucked into NTI. Selling women's undergarment (Lu Mi Mi ) which by the way was sold by No.1 Products about a decade ago and where is No.1 product? Gone!!! can't be found anywhere. All these young people have no idea what business is about. Have not even step into working live and want to teach people twice their age about business. My dear brother-in-law... wake up and smell the coffee... have soemone to pay for your university fees go and study and get a good honors grade  don't waste your time at NTI playing know it all and selling undergarment to old women and neglecting your studies. I have to work and pay for my own university studies and study part time so difficult and tired.<br><br>Sorry that was personal... Anyway don't admire the people having office there they are at the top of the food chain. You are at the bottom and always will be. You are working so hard so that these people can fuel their car they drive... sleep on the bed and house they buy.<br><br>Based on their model you need to have at least 20 to 30 generations of downlinks and them to have thier own to be able to have an office there and make those flowery speeches. Think how many people you need to lure into the same boat you sit in and you might not know when the boat may sink<br><br>MLM or Pyramid System companies will always be around. These companies work only on one expect of human nature "GREED" as Money is the root of all evil.<br><br>Think about it, all of these MLM companies be it NTI, No.1 Products, BEL AIR, Amway, always promise a high pay without working just recruit peoplr will do. Nice car. Nice house. Frequent Holidays to the listerners. How many of the people asking you to join have them? Why are they always so eager to "help" you succeed? Cause if you don't join they can't afford their Car...House...Holiday...or their monthly expenses.<br><br>I work in a 8am to 530pm job earning about $3500... I own a car... have platinum cards offer to me by banks but I rejected I only need one for emergencys.<br><br>When I sit down to these people at these talks and psycho session I ask them a few questions<br>1. How long have you been doing this? (some say: 1 year or so)<br>2. Have you achieve a car yet? (Some reply: not yet but I'm getting there)<br>3. I own a car does it mean i'm more successful than you? (Common Replies: Blank Blank try to talk about something else).<br>4. Is your earnings taxable? (Common replies : Blank again)<br>5. If not taxable then in future how I apply for Credit Card? (Replies: Blank Blank again)<br><br>You people that are in MLM Companies and thinking of joining. Listen up: The only way to success is by hard work and a bit of luck. By asking people to invest 14k or 10k or what ever amount pls don't make real investers laugh...<br><br>If you really want to succeed<br>1. Saving 1/10 of your every monthly pay for a year or two.<br>2. Ask people that really succeed to help you invest. ( This is the difficult part so luck play a part to know such people and by saying that I don't mean Jackie "NTI boss" or other MLM boss. I mean those SME bosses you should look at them)<br>3. If not put your savings in bank that money goes in easily and take out very hard.<br>4. Don't be hasty in investing ask for 2nd or 3rd or 4th opinion as many as pos from people in the industry you intend to invest. (E.G. you are not going to as a pork seller if today's fish are fresh and nice right)<br>5. Don't regret if you invest wrongly but you must remember your mistake and learn from it and don't repeat it again.<br>6. But in any case if your investment does come out right make your investment's children(returns) make more childrens and make all these children create more children and make all your children(returns) work for you and in time to come 4-5yrs you will made it.<br><br>Be smart, stay cool you all .<br><br>Cheers<br>IronBandit</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi... i've been reading forum postings on NTI..<br><br>i almost became a victim of NTI too.<br><br>like others, i was also told that NTI is supported by MOE. and guess what?<br><br>i have sent an email to related authorities. shan't reveal any details here, but it's based on my personal experience with NTI. moreover, if it is not true that they are supported by MOE, perhaps MOE might take action for misrepresentation?<br><br>and if they are really supported by MOE, i really hope that we will get a good explanation for this.<br><br>the chances of getting a response should be reasonably high... as it's not my first time writing letters to MPs..they're quite nice people. haha!<br><br>will post again when i receive the reply. till then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
