While it makes sense for an MLM company to import goods that are unqiue, it doesn't make sense for them to sell goods that are way over the market price.<br><br>The same watch/document bag that NTI sells can be bought at for less than half the price. NTI claims that the bags/watches/pens are of a limited edition and hence the high selling price, which is nonsense since even brands like LV don't go for that much. (i.e. their document bag sells for about 3200 Mall points, which is the rough equivalent of SGD$2800, give or take a hundred.)<br><br>The customers are not getting the discounts they want, and the suppliers are not getting the customer base they deserve. I rest my case.</div>
