            <div class='col-md body'>Laurence82, I did answer your question about the income of NTI agents. Too lazy to retype, so:<br><br><blockquote>I understand your point.<br><br>Unfortunately I have to ask you: why are you asking me that?<br><br>Or for that matter, why are you asking so many NTI agents who posted here, that.<br><br>Obviously the decision to release such a document lies with the management themselves. Why are you asking the agents as opposed to the management?<br><br>Because the agents can't answer that. What do you expect us to reply, "I will ask my director to release the documents to prove you wrong!"?<br><br>I can only see one reason for your asking: so that less experienced agents will be tempted to avoid the question or be shown not being able to answer altogether. Score one for the anti-NTI camp! They can't release the documents because they are hiding something, nyeah people I told you so.<br><br>Ask the correct people.<br></blockquote>I'm not dismissing the importance of your question, laurence. Like I said before - legal documents and evidence always count for a lot more than words. But yeah, read my reply. If you think this is an attempt to 'sidestep', so be it. I'm not NTI's spokesperson for goodness' sake.<br><br>By the way, thanks for asking me questons instead of attacking my character, as Eikei did. I realise my past few long thesis were off-the-cuff reactions to Eikei's posts, and that kind of defeats the purpose of my coming to this thread in the first place.<br><br>As for the question about EPI's office and all that jazz, read the above quoted text again.<br><br>The official reason given is answer enough for me, but since the forumers in this thread seems to scoff at it, *shrug* No point arguing with you over that. If you want a better explanation (if there is one in the first place), then ask the management. Didn't someone apparently knows two BRMs in the company?<br><br>By the way Wei Li, when have I ever mentioned you in my posts? Don't elevate your importance. Maybe one year later, when you, Eikei and Laurence become the Holy Trinity of the Anti-NTI cult, I will deign to reply to your posts. Other than that, no.<br><br>Meanwhile, I am making a cup of hot chocolate and reading NTI's oh-so-motivational notes, insanely grinning from ear to ear about the bright future I am going to have because I joined NTI.<br><br>Or whatever. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If that is the image you have of NTI agents, I wouldn't want to break your dreams, would I?<br><br>Bye guys, happy NTI bashing! (though why Amway was suddenly dragged into the equation, I have no idea).<br><br>I'm off to join my friends in town to watch the World Cup.<br><br>Oops, I mean going to NTI to happily brainwash more people and to be brainwashed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They really have problems understanding the concept of TOPIC. The thread is about NTI. If you wish to be so obsessed about my identity, you can go back to your NTI bosses and I'm sure they will have an idea who I am. Heck, if they are decent enough, they will tell you I'm not from Amway or any other MLM.</div>

Too lazy to retype, so:<br><br>I'm not dismissing the importance of your question, laurence. Like I said before - legal documents and evidence always count for a lot more than words. But yeah, read my reply. If you think this is an attempt to 'sidestep', so be it. I'm not NTI's spokesperson for goodness' sake.<br><br>By the way, thanks for asking me questons instead of attacking my character, as Eikei did. I realise my past few long thesis were off-the-cuff reactions to Eikei's posts, and that kind of defeats the purpose of my coming to this thread in the first place.<br><br>As for the question about EPI's office and all that jazz, read the above quoted text again.<br><br>The official reason given is answer enough for me, but since the forumers in this thread seems to scoff at it, *shrug* No point arguing with you over that. If you want a better explanation (if there is one in the first place), then ask the management. Didn't someone apparently knows two BRMs in the company?<br><br>By the way Wei Li, when have I ever mentioned you in my posts? Don't elevate your importance. Maybe one year later, when you, Eikei and Laurence become the Holy Trinity of the Anti-NTI cult, I will deign to reply to your posts. Other than that, no.<br><br>Meanwhile, I am making a cup of hot chocolate and reading NTI's oh-so-motivational notes, insanely grinning from ear to ear about the bright future I am going to have because I joined NTI.<br><br>Or whatever. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If that is the image you have of NTI agents, I wouldn't want to break your dreams, would I?<br><br>Bye guys, happy NTI bashing!

One day one fellow met the great philosopher and said, "Do youknow what I just heard about your friend?".<br><br>"Hold on a minute," Socrates replied. "Before telling me anything I'dlike you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test."."Triple filter?". "That's right," Socrates continued. "Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you're going to say.That's why I call it the triplefilter test.<br><br>The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?" "No," the man said, "actually I justheard about it and...". "All right," said Socrates. "So you don't knowif it's true or not.<br><br>Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?" . "No, on the contrary...". "So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him, but you're not certain it's true.<br><br>You may still pass the test though, because there's one filter left:the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my friendgoing to be useful to me?" "No, not really."<br><br>"Well," concluded Socrates, "if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?" This is why Socrates was a great philosopher &amp; held in such high esteem. Friend,use this triple filter each time u hear loose talk about any of "your near &amp; dear friends."<br><br>ppl who post here are not even someone dat is near nor dear y listen and accept...</div>
