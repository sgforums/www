            <div class='col-md body'>Oh gosh.....did i mention they cant be blamed?omg tats my bad.<br><br>wat i really mean is that the agents who was referred in to NTI by their upline but these upline did not tell them about the previous failure (my mistake to say achivement <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ). So these agents know nothing more of their company previous track records and start  introduce people into the company due to watsoever reason.<br>In layman term,<br>1. upline keep information about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">something</span> ( bad things of course or else why they zip their mouth for?)<br><br>2.agents trust their upline, joined company.<br><br>3.these agents become active and introduce more people.<br><br>What do we have here?A vicious cycle.....<br><br>So what i mention in the earlier post tat agents cant be blame is those agent in 2. However, we can also agrue that its the agents responsible to research in depth about the company ur working for, unless you are in some reputable company.

            <div class='col-md body'>oic.....but i tot the current NTI is a company tat train people to become businessman? From what i know, they are also helping Emcom to find investor.<br>I dont know about them selling products. I am wondering if the 18 phrases of the Emcom things end, what will the NTI agents be doing? Are they going to just invite people to join them base on their courses? Maybe a new project is going to come out, but if not, i wonder how the company going to survive as they have to pay rebates for their agents. If i am not wrong, a basic bronze merchant is about $280? The company have to give commission to agents, internal "ding dong" stuff, leeching of money from upline. Maybe most of the money use to mantain NTI is from EGA .( just my guessing)<br></div>

Than why do the Leaders still hide those facts and carry on with the un-ethical methods which they are doing.<br><br>NTI agents 'invite people based on using people's greediness to attract them into NTI. Why NOP agents hardly nor even want to talk about it, is because they have seen so much examples that they give up in trying to explain online or for MOST they DON'T even come and help. Because people are attracted to GREED = $$ / S11 (put them together and you will get $) that they refuse to listen to advice which is why many NOP agents hardly explain.<br><br>Even i'm getting sick of trying to explain whatever shit stuff James Phang and his 'loyal' agents (i say their 'legal' financial [mlm] loan sharks).<br><br>A company that doesn't have a product nor black and white contract (this will be given if you invest in insurances/bonds but why didn't NTI give it? - THINK!!) transcation when there's cash involved is deem as a PYRAMID SCHEME which is BANNED IN SINGAPORE and WORLDWIDE!!<br><br>NTI is just using the products they have in NTI as a mask to cover the pyramid scheme that they doing.<br><br>AND NTI IS A MLM COMPANY in case you don't know.

Do u tell ur client the records of Mr James Phang or those failed projects when u are presenting the Emcom project? For me, neither my agent (my friend) nor the presenter tell me any of those things. ( which will aid me in making sound decision ) Moreover, most of the client are either friends or family of the agents. I feel tat the agent should let them know the track records of the company and their previous achievements.Of course, if the agents or the presenter themself dont know those things, they cant be blamed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>I know that its the responsibility of the investor to research these info in depth. But for some of the clients, they are not amateur investor and they invested mostly because they trust the agent tat they have done much research in the project. ( and of course, high returns)<br><br>Secondly, with regards to the capital protection plan, i wana know if the client will be able to recieve the [b]promised </strong>sum of money even though the project failed right? ( for me SP is 3.6k) Tat is wat my agent told me. I know that for the second point, i have posted in another topic, but i think this thread is quite active right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> [/b]</blockquote>Hi naivekid do i have a good reputation here ?  Anyway most of the time we do not mentioned past failure about the company to investors.  But if they were to ask we would tell them too.  No hiding just its not concern about the current deal.<br><br>For the guranteed return, i guess yours is 150% right, you will get them back from sunshine even if emcom's project failed.  Its all written in the agreement.</div>
