            <div class='col-md body'>Are you stupid enough to actually believe that is Jackie Hoo,<br><br>But than again you're an active forumer, the highest level a forumer can go too..<br><br>Agree with noodle man...<br><br>Just because we voice out in the forum doesn't make us a forumer, Just because you stepped into NTI before, it doesn't makes you an nti agent either.<br><br>But than again, since meeting only a few of the many agents, makes you to assume than THE WHOLE nti community are conman, I can assume you do think about masturbating with your cousin picture in the toilet like one of the posts?<br><br>Well, of cause not, we are grown up people, We ain't primary school kids anymore, I still suggest you go down and have a look, instead of thinking all day and still probably "laughing" to yourself, thinking we are all idiots, You may be missing something.<br><br>NTI may or may not be a good place for making money, gaining experience, making friends and learning for people like us, but its worth a try, Its definitely better than sitting in front of a computer complaining, dotaing and chatting. I've seen a quite a number of success stories this month too.<br><br>Lets be mature and don't focus on personal attacks, we can have a friendly Q&amp;A here, I'll try my best to answer, but than again, most questions would be better solved by making a trip down and understanding more <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

I'm using another account now because of what i did in the past and therefore my account got suspended. Well, why it got suspended was because i tried to advertise an online survey that could help make money here. i didn't know it was wrong at that time. but well learnt my lesson. =)<br><br>that's just a little bit about my that naughty past, anyway i've been observing this forum for a year now, as a guest. anyone can view forum right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>why i ended up here? that's because one of my "friend" tried to get me to join NTI. I went down at 8 plus and it took me 3 hours to get out. I was supposed to attend some talk and she emphasized to me why i needed to come down because it's by some very influential speaker and stuff. my goodness, i was even being targeted at during the talk, because i was sitting right at the front so i became one of the speaker's 'specimen'.<br><br>It was such a turn off, the way he spoke. It didn't take me long to conclude that that guy standing on the stage was an idiot and that him being an 'influential' speaker? i felt i could do an even better job. but anyway after the talk, i met one of my primary schoolmate, when i look at him, he still looked the same. and he claims he's doing very well now. but i knew him, from primary school, he wasn't a very smart student, he wasn't very well-behaved, i asked myself, "does this company really have the ability to give chances to people and let them change for the better?" i looked around the 1st floor office, it was in a complete mess.<br><br>there's so many people sitting around, i didn't have my lunch and dinner before that, i couldn't stand it. i asked my friend if i could leave so i can eat my dinner, she asked me to wait because they wanted someone else to speak to me. i kept on pressing that i wanted to leave and finally she gave in, asked me to talk to this manager for awhile and he tried to get me to join, explaining to me all the stuff, placing the form in front of me. i filled it up but stopped short at signing, i asked "do i have to sign?".<br>they told me it's just for reference, so i was like, damn it i want to leave, i'm not going to sign this and you can have my particulars. i told them that i was going to sign up for some silver membership thing but i need to consider first and that i'll drop by again. finally i managed to leave the place.<br><br>i was doing a project at that time and was in partnership with a boss of a shop in bugis. i was supposed to meet him to get promotional materials from him and when i did, i talked to him for awhile and he told me that all this MLM stuff are not worth joining. he said he is someone who jumps at any money making opportunity but he'll never take up MLM.<br><br>I came home, switched on my com, did a little search on NTI and found their website, the moment i got in, i laughed, it was techno music playing. i was thinking, wtf? corporate website and background music is techno? that was one hell of an experience, then i moved on to my next search, a forum, this forum. i through most of the thread and i realised how it's actually like in NTI.<br><br>i'm not going to jump into conclusion on how bad NTI is because i've never beeen in it like some forum members here, but i can at least think logically, in MLM is like a pyramid, the top is made up of few people, but they get the most, the bottom, they cannibalise. i asked myself, do i really want to be part of this cannibalism? do i want to be like my 'friend'? drag other of my friends into this cannibalism? No. I want to keep my friends, and save the money. Even if i'm going to miss out on money making opportunity, it's better than losing my friends. and therefore i chose not to join.<br><br>today, i still have my money, my time, my friends. and i'm proud of that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>this post is on 20 aug 06..<br>just a few back.<br>someone have go down to NTI and find it not wrong to join..<br>so now jonzibonzi want us go down to NTI..<br>and post some thing like this again...<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=108370&amp;page=50" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=108370&amp;page=50</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Insurance was illegal in the past? So i believe laurence you don't have any policies on you?<br><br>You have to understand that NTI was a pretty new company than. And new companies do screw up now and than. Believe you read many biographys of mill/billionaires.<br><br>In every career/industry, there will be black sheeps, people who reject and the people who failed.<br><br>And if you only choose to learn from this people, you may become like this people. What for look at so many ways of why it won't work. Why don't look at the many ways it can work?<br><br>But anyway from what my senses tell me, you are too prejudice againts the Old NTI, any neutral bystander reading this forum can definitely tell it.<br><br>I won't be posting as often anymore, as it'll be as pointless as talking to a cow. I would rather spend more time reading books and building my business, even if i fail this business, i believe i am the real source of whatever failure i may face.<br><br>I hope that we all may be mature in tackling problems, if there are anymore underhand agents of the company, do feel free to report it via feedback form or call up NTI, i believe the company will do something about these agents.<br><br>P.S The D_teo J_hoo are all imposters <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
