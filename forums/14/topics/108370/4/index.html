            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I've been victimised by this company and I want to get my full refund. It's been about 3 months since I joined them and I have yet to receive the products.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I'm not trying to promote this freaking company, i don't even have the intention, but i'm telling my experiences with them.<br><br>And yes, I do agree that the people there have been brain-washed. I'm not really an active member since I rarely go there and I do not have any downlines. being persuaded by my friend and the people there, as they said I am new and need to know things before I get started on my 'work', I took time to go there. But when I did come down, I saw that most of the people there are just walking around, or having presentations, talking with other uplines/downlines, having 'groupings', basically just pretending to be busy. During my days there, my upline gave me this 'distibutor's guide' which consists of the rules of NTI, their programmes, the abc technique, the feedback form, the B push, etc.<br><br>When I especially found out about the abc technique and the feedback form, I was disgusted. All along the presenter knew what I was like and hit on my weaknessess. I felt cheated from then on, and I kept thinking about it. I had alot of doubts, such as why are NTI's price of their products so expensive? And so they answered me, 'How much is a can of coke? Do you know how much is its manufactured price? Do you feel exploited?'<br><br>And I wanted to clear them with my upline. What I don't like was, he kept praising the people directly above him, talked about how good NTI was, the consequences of not having a downline, that NTI wasn't all about recuitment, that the people in NTI are here to help you,that he has seen people changed for the better, and told me to start earning money. I wasn't surprised by his answer as he come down to the company nearly almost everyday. I guessed he too was brain-washed. He couldn't see it, kept praising the company and refuse to listen to me when i told him i felt cheated.<br><br>The reason why I didn't want to have any downlines is that I don't want to do any dirty work, which is recuiting people. I told this to my another upline, and she told me that I must build my network first. She didn't let me win the argument. nobody in NTI would let you win anyway. They're good at twisting with words. When i told her about what I thought NTI was all about recuitment, she said she used to be in my shoes. She said NTI wasn't all about signing up new people, but also on enriching. Because I was new and all, she said I should attend this 'BES' (Business Education System) which is for beginners. She also urged me to come down more often. I have better things to do than to hang around and listen to people who are full of themselves.<br><br>Recently, NTI has changed their plans. I'm not really sure of their new one, but their single account is no longer $288. They have 3 types, namely the bronze merchant, silver merchant and the gold merchant. They have another one called the empire merchant, whereby if you belong to either bronze, silver or gold, you had to top up some money to get to the 'empire merchant' status to earn their so called benefits they have. They also have volcanic crystals as their new product.<br><br>But whatever plans they have, please stay away from this company. They also have this program, called 'BIP' (Business Introduction Program) which is the same as presentations, but is conducted for the masses. They will set the atmostphere high to encourage people to join them. This falls on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Please I repeat, do not be lured by any 'lobangs' they tell you about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I believe the products should sell by itself if it is good by itself. It should attract<br>people naturally instead of being throw about like shit. Anyway, good products always speak by itself. I saw these Asayo brand mentioned by you guys above the tread. Really not too sure what does it do. Probably seems like health products to me(got bottled displayed). The worst part is i saw someone selling the product like in pushcart pattern except theirs are displayed on a table. Every single day i walk passed that area after work and found that their business is in a terrible state. When i mean terrible, i actually meant really got no customer and no one is actually approaching .<br><br>This has proven that people who had actually used their products is totally and utterly not convinced it works. And we guys know that bad words do spread very fast. It just a fact that good products will prove by itself. I personally feel that health proucts bussiness is had to do because the products really need to do miracle in some ways. Do you know that before those big health company actually sell their products. They actually promote it free for a perios of time. This is because they are confident that it works and its a good way of advertisement.<br><br>regards<br>jinsen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wayne123:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi everyone, I've been victimised by this company and I want to get my full refund. It's been about 3 months since I joined them and I have yet to receive the products.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I'm not trying to promote this freaking company, i don't even have the intention, but i'm telling my experiences with them.<br><br>And yes, I do agree that the people there have been brain-washed. I'm not really an active member since I rarely go there and I do not have any downlines. being persuaded by my friend and the people there, as they said I am new and need to know things before I get started on my 'work', I took time to go there. But when I did come down, I saw that most of the people there are just walking around, or having presentations, talking with other uplines/downlines, having 'groupings', basically just pretending to be busy. During my days there, my upline gave me this 'distibutor's guide' which consists of the rules of NTI, their programmes, the abc technique, the feedback form, the B push, etc.<br><br>When I especially found out about the abc technique and the feedback form, I was disgusted. All along the presenter knew what I was like and hit on my weaknessess. I felt cheated from then on, and I kept thinking about it. I had alot of doubts, such as why are NTI's price of their products so expensive? And so they answered me, 'How much is a can of coke? Do you know how much is its manufactured price? Do you feel exploited?'<br><br>And I wanted to clear them with my upline. What I don't like was, he kept praising the people directly above him, talked about how good NTI was, the consequences of not having a downline, that NTI wasn't all about recuitment, that the people in NTI are here to help you,that he has seen people changed for the better, and told me to start earning money. I wasn't surprised by his answer as he come down to the company nearly almost everyday. I guessed he too was brain-washed. He couldn't see it, kept praising the company and refuse to listen to me when i told him i felt cheated.<br><br>The reason why I didn't want to have any downlines is that I don't want to do any dirty work, which is recuiting people. I told this to my another upline, and she told me that I must build my network first. She didn't let me win the argument. nobody in NTI would let you win anyway. They're good at twisting with words. When i told her about what I thought NTI was all about recuitment, she said she used to be in my shoes. She said NTI wasn't all about signing up new people, but also on enriching. Because I was new and all, she said I should attend this 'BES' (Business Education System) which is for beginners. She also urged me to come down more often. I have better things to do than to hang around and listen to people who are full of themselves.<br><br>Recently, NTI has changed their plans. I'm not really sure of their new one, but their single account is no longer $288. They have 3 types, namely the bronze merchant, silver merchant and the gold merchant. They have another one called the empire merchant, whereby if you belong to either bronze, silver or gold, you had to top up some money to get to the 'empire merchant' status to earn their so called benefits they have. They also have volcanic crystals as their new product.<br><br>But whatever plans they have, please stay away from this company. They also have this program, called 'BIP' (Business Introduction Program) which is the same as presentations, but is conducted for the masses. They will set the atmostphere high to encourage people to join them. This falls on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Please I repeat, do not be lured by any 'lobangs' they tell you about. </div></blockquote>btw, pls beware of another coy named "Coslab". I think that James Phuang is also involved in this coy, bcos the top guys in this coy are from NOP as well just like NTI. BEWARE!</div>
