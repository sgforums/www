            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I went down there yesterday with a friend of mine. My sole purpose was to check out the opportunity, as told by a friend who's in there. As I was burnt but not disgruntled from my previous network marketing experience, I was open to what they had to say.<br><br>Please note: I'm not bad-mouthing the company here, but rather I hope to provide an objective view.<br><br>My advice: Don't join. Look for a more reputable company. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Throughout the 2 hour sales pitch, there was hardly any mention of the product at all. According to http://www.dsa.org/selling/pyramid.htm, we should be wary of companies that force their plans of us. To me, it reeked of a pyramid scam. Unfortunately, many of my friends are in this company as well.<br><br>Furthermore, according to my friend's upline, everyone in the place is below the age of 25. Personally, I feel uncomfortable if a network marketing company does not have experienced networkers of a matured age leading the company.<br><br>In addition, towards the end there was this indirect but constant pressure proposed by my friend to sign up on the spot. I don't know about networkers here, but in my previous company, all we did was present the opportunity. If you're interested, sign up with us. If you're not, no problem. We just give you our name card for future contacts.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I myself, is not a supporter of MLM or NTI-paris. I've been down to their office at Raffles Place with my friend a few days back and from what i've heard from one of their presenters, i can concur that it was too good to be true. Figures of up to $100K/year for a person who has just joined the company is a childish make-believe and scam to con an unknowing teenager or ill-knowlegded individual to "invest" funds into creating accounts that would generate profits once you start getting DOWNLINES.<br>According to them, they are using a new system called the BINARY system instead of the old system where it was shaped like a pyramid and a single upline could get as many direct downlines as he/she wants. But with the new binary system, it would seem "FAIR" to the people lower down on the downline, as a single upline can only have 2 direct downlines. They trick people into thinking that they would earn more money if they open more accounts and if they work hard to find downlines for themselves and their direct downlines.<br>My advice to all those people who haven't been in in this MLM company : analyse the situation clearly and don't get cheated into believing money is so easily earned. if that is so, why would people still want to get educational certs to get better jobs in the market. Wouldnt our society be a useless one then? if their business was so profitable already, why would they still want to find new members? are their pockets so deep that they wanna donate money? well hope you guys who are confused about MLM will think for yourself.<br><br></div>
