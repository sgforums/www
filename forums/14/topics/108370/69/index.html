Its only less than one year old, same goes to AGM, EOGMs and finanical report.  The cost for the infrastucture, R&amp;D as well as marketing costs we won't know of it.  Do pte ltd company disclose that ?  Maybe they will do that after listed.<br><br>Emcom has the ISP approval from Taiwan to operate and build their internet infrastruture.  I have a copy of that.  Bluegine is not doing the project in Taiwan, only the CEO has become the COO of Emcom to help out in the building of the infrastructure.  Emcom's technology partner, Taiyee has build tamshui town and gao xiong successfully, they are the partner of WeMax the company building wireless infrastructure in gao xiong.<br><br>COO of emcom does not means he is in the board of directors.  Anyway i thought only listed company have board of directors ?  Anyway emcom has already aquire bluegine, you guys can find in biznet, therefore there wun be any conflict.<br><br>Anyway about the moving funds issue i wun know about it, its too high management issues <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Hope i answers your questions and clear your doubts, and do let me know if you have any questions.</div>

No point investing in the company nor the plan.</div>

Thats the company choosen by TaiChung Govt to build the wireless infrasture with them.  Emcom's is a private project not aided by Govt funds.  For another private wireless project in GaoXiong you can refer to wemax.net.tw<br><br>2.  I think i answered both of your questions right ?  Anyway we are not affiliate to APTG or Govt for the project.<br><br>If its private project where would they have agreement with govt to share with you ?  If they have then they are lying.</div>
