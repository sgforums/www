            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>NTI is not pure mlm. Network marketing n mlm is not totally the same too.<br>i study business law too. but maybe not as comprehensive as u.NTI have products. n there r more n more. furthermore. most mlm companies products are expensive. cuz they need to pay distributors income. for example VE. how much their mattress cost? u should know alot more den me. </blockquote>No no, i am not interested in VE. Why use this analogy? Basic idea of MLM is to sell products cheaper and directly, eliminating intermediaries, as claimed by many MLMers. now you are telling people the price is higher other than the reason of good quality. U mean, people are paying for agents income, products are priced more expensive even tho some competitors are selling it cheaper? Then  why dont sell at it retail shops right? economies of scale and all that...goodness....<br><br>MLM and NM not the same? Meaning there can be no focus on products in NM? Thats hogwash. Its akin to pyramid scheme.<br><br><blockquote>training .. ppl are paid for training programs. </blockquote>consumers are paying for training programs? u just said its for agents income<br><br><blockquote>agents are paid through commission in MLM.. and will increase in percentage when do more sales. NTI do not treat agents as pure consumers.. instead biz partners. thats the difference. </blockquote>meaning there is no consumers base? all biz partner are buying the products themselves? that is a disguised pyramid. can u see the big hole in this? self survival when agents themselves buy more, contributing to uplines income, not thru pure selling....<br><br>and in better, its front loading....<br><br>keep on trying, u are beginning to describe a disguised pyramid scheme<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I have no objection for anyone who want to join any networking company.  I will only object and discourage if an individual did not do enough research before joining.  Must find out and understand the negative and positive part of it.<br><br>In addition, people in any networking company will tell you it is easy to make $$$$$.  If you join the business because you think it is easy money, than I think you deserve to fail and be cheated. Reason is that you cheat yourself first by believing that it is an easy making $$$ machine.  They can't cheat you if you are not overwhelmed my greed with no work.  Do the business when you have done your research and prepare to work hard and be responsible to your people.</div>
