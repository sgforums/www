I read in other forums their preview do not have much support, therefore very hard for them to start their seminar. alot of these bo liao seminars one la. mostly bluff ppl, seminars normally shouldn't be so ex.<br><br>I dont know how true or how good are their seminar. but many ppl who attended the preview are quite skeptical or probably they charge too much so alot of ppl dont want to go</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the top dogs at nti don't earn 10k. they would be lucky to get even 2 to 3k a month. Why i know? The one who brought me in is still in nti, close to their 'leaders'. And they loved showing accounts to everyone from their 'genealogy' From what my friend found out, they only had around 20-30 accounts a week. That will mean around 3k max for their TOP leaders.<br><br>anyway my friend is disgruntled with the way nti is operating. He might decide to move his guys away to another mlm.

            <div class='col-md body'>hello every1!<br>i'd like to thx all of u for telling mi abt all the bad stuff regarding this company. Recently i went to the coy with a friend of mine whose oredi in this ntiparis. A mentor (teenager)  who is younger than mi, and still studiying in poly (he showed me his student pass)  is the 1 presenting all biz opportunity to mi. I find it kinda funni becuz he didn't even introduce to me the products of his company. Dressed in suit with shiny leather shoe, he keep on telling mi about how his uplines are doing well in this company. he explained to me all the stuff regarding BM (bronze merchant), SM (silver merchant) and GM (gold merchant). But he didn't tell me the cost till the end of his presentation. for BM ($350), SM ($1700), GM (3500). I feel the ppl there seems very desperate in finding new recruitments. Luckily i able to get out of tt place without being one of them(I told them currently im still broke and left my nets at hm). But, all the good opportunities they were saying keep running on my mind. that's why i do my research on the net. i was looking for anithing regarding ntiparis. thank god i seen this forum 1st be4 the ntiparis website. its good to knoe ya ppl!

            <div class='col-md body'>it's a trend or I would call it a passing phrase, at least she's young... go in get cheated, come out wiser.. even though I'll say it's stupid to join in the first place. but at least she's not getting cheated when she's like mid twenties to earlier thirties, when u are getting married, starting family and need to use alot of money. sighzz... let her gek seh abit la... silver merchant... what the.... merchants in babylon days were mainly slaves who go into business with their masters and sharing the profits with their masters until they are able to buy their way to freedom. So silver merchant would be considered middle class slaves lor.. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... but honestly, true what!</div>
