One day one fellow met the great philosopher and said, "Do youknow what I just heard about your friend?".<br><br>"Hold on a minute," Socrates replied. "Before telling me anything I'dlike you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test."."Triple filter?". "That's right," Socrates continued. "Before you talk to me about my friend, it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what you're going to say.That's why I call it the triplefilter test.<br><br>The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?" "No," the man said, "actually I justheard about it and...". "All right," said Socrates. "So you don't knowif it's true or not.<br><br>Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good?" . "No, on the contrary...". "So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me something bad about him, but you're not certain it's true.<br><br>You may still pass the test though, because there's one filter left:the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about my friendgoing to be useful to me?" "No, not really."<br><br>"Well," concluded Socrates, "if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful, why tell it to me at all?" This is why Socrates was a great philosopher &amp; held in such high esteem.
