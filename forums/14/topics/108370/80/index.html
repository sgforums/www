The issue is, there MUST not be any monetary benefits and commissions on recruitment. It is ILLEGAL and deemed as pyramid. Sales of products and services legally is approved for commissions and over-riding payouts.<br><br>The crux is, the presentations given to the reporter and to the members of the public clearly presents the case of monetary returns upon recruitment. There are already 15 cases reported to CASE within 1 year. Isn't 15 cases against the same company spells something's wrong?</div>
