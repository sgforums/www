            <div class='col-md body'>it's nice to read widely. but readers beware.... many books out there may not be entirely true with the things written and it's up to the readers discretion. There have been many so called gurus who have written books, got very famous, and later discredited. In the mist, alot of ppl who believed in them and did what they advocate got into trouble. some books are designed to make it a very good read for the readers but are filled with alot of misleding informations. plus it doesnt mean that if that book is on best seller means what it teaches are true. it just meant that people enjoy reading them. I have read many business and finance related books. Personally, I've read 8 of Robert Kiyosaki's books, they are very popular with MLMers as RK is an advocater of MLM. However they offer very little financial knowledge to the average readers, except that it's good to be rich and being rich feels good and mlm is one of the ways to get rich.<br><br>Let me recommend you guys a couple of books I feel are good reads.<br><br>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Morningstar's The Five Rules of Successful Stock Investing</span><br>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Intelligent Investor </span>(All time classic for whoever is interested in business)<br>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Richest Man In Babylon </span>(Good for beginners interested in Money)<br>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Lexus and The Olive Tree </span>(Bascially about globalisation and how it affects the global economy)<br>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The New Buffettology </span>(A peek into some of the investment methods of the world 2nd richest man)<br>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Smartest Guys In The Room: The Amazing Rise And Scandalous Fall of Enron</span> (This is about the company that revoluntionise the energy industry and how it eventually went down with its accounting frauds)<br></div>

Your first statement is yet to be tested?<br><br>I just bring to our attention that before we first register, there are Rules, Policies and Disclaimers at the registration panel, which is there for a purpose.  It is to warn us.  It is for us to note that if the Local Authorities so demand, all details can be released.<br><br>If you do not notice that people are carted away do not mean that it did not happen or will not happen.  I sincerely hope that no body had been carted away.  It is good to know that no body had been carted away.  This shows that majority of the Â“usersÂ” are reasonable and keep within the OB markers, and also many thanks to the good works by the mods.<br><br>Hope we all make this place a nice place for all to enjoy (and exchange our thoughts/opinions), learn from each other mistakes, and become wiser.<br></div>
