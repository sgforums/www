            <div class='col-md body'>I am already confuse and blur ... got some questions to ask ... help me out ...thanks<br><br>NIT is a pte ltd company?<br><br>Private Limited partnership having no more than 35 limited partners, and thus able to avoid SEC registration.<br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br><br>1)They are "selling" shares now right? The what plan to get return every month. If you have their company shares, you are their partner right? How can a pte ltd company be selling shares?<br><br>2)This is personal question. When a pte ltd company went bust ... their bosses/partners (less 35) will not be sue to compensate the money they owe with their own assets. Means when company bust, they can just ran away without paying a single cents. Am i right?<br><br>Sorry ... english anyhow .. lol<br><br></div>

I'll try to answer your question to the best of my knowledge as they are my concerns and I've question them before.<br><br>Firstly, the product they are selling here is the E-MALL points. When you pay to sign up as their members, you will be given E-MALL points as the so call "product" for you to redeem items online.

So this is the product question.<br><br>Then after you become their memeber, you will be given the chance to participate in the "Joint-Partnership" programme with Emcom, whereby you can invest your money into this joint partnership, and you'll be getting your returns as shown in the table. Other details have been mentioned by LEGACY before thus I shall not include further.<br><br>Yes, you are right to say that without Emcom, the company might not be attracting so much sales BUT! Isn't that how successful companies all started out? Or say how companies who have failed so many times but just needed ONE good potential product, project, chance, whatever you call them to succeed? And this is what I see in this project to Sunshine Empire, a chance for them to succeed.<br><br>To correct some misunderstanding, incentives from Sunshine WILL NOT STOP even when the project starts giving dividends. It will continue to run till the stated guarenteed returns it given, and at the same time, you will be getting the project returns.<br><br>Lastly, its not all about NTI now, its about Sun Shine Empire or EGA. I am not from NTI, but from another alliance under Sunshine who is marketing this product also. And my crowd there is definately not youngster who are below 21, if age is any matters.<br><br>Regarding the concern with NTI past skeletons brought up by Laurence, I do not feel that they will be swept into the closet but i do pray that with the success of Emcom, such underlying issues will be resolve by the comapny in time.<br><br>If you have any more concerns, do raise them as I'll try to answer them to the best of my knowledge.

Just a contractual promise which isnt valid by law?<br>Or maybe it is, but in all scenarios, if a company goes bust, banks take the meat, followed by charges etc etc..

If im a shareholder, same applies.<br>If im neither of those and still join cos of the incentives, im just a lazy person.<br>Ive met up with some of those "savvy, business-inclined, well-rewarded" "Partners", and i am so unimpressed..<br>None of them knows what they are talking about, noone can provide satisfactory or logical answers..<br><br>sad<br></div>
