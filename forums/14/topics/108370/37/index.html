            <div class='col-md body'>The MLM act after the Year 2000 Revision has made prosecution via the MLM act virtually impossible. As such we will focus our efforts in prosecuting them on other grounds. As for the MLM act, we will need to propose suitable admendments to allow for flexibility in prosecution but that will take some time and effort in pooling legal resources and getting the support of Ministry of Trade and Industry. CAD is merely the executor of this act and hence has not much power other than for preliminary investigations so a multi-pronged approach to this case must be done to achieve the desired effect.</div>
