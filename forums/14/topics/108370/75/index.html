Can you just reply and say YOU DON'T KNOW, neither do I want to know, if you want to interview, ASK MY BOSS because he tells me to do what than i do what, i didn't put in any effort at all. If you give this type of reply in work outside, YOU'LL BE SACKED IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT FAIL!!<br><br>If you don't even bother to know the company's background, than do you have any pride that you are working in a company and are you proud of it? You don't even know what services or products you boss/the company can offers to you, the potential of the corporation that you're working in. How can you convice a Experienced Investor to come in and join you when you KNOW NOTHING?<br><br>The other thing is - If James Phang's other companies are really that good, he will surely show off to his agents de lor. Lumimi is an example; besides that, no other companies under him is something which he is proud of so he hide it up. If he is really that good, sure got videos of his achievements etc..but why didn't he show them? (if there's good stuff, he sure will show off by having them shown to agents during his training lessons 100% chop!)<br>IS HE (JAMES PHANG) really doing well OR are the companies on the verge of closing?<br><br>You are better of being a normal worker. Don't work in MLM, if you aren't going to change.<br><br>MLM is also a business, but you are not putting in the effort that it is needed by businessmen/businesswomen.<br><br>Advice for you - IF you want to work or EXCEL in MLM, make sure you know what you are doing.<br></div></blockquote>Frankly i think the one who does not know what he is doing or saying is you.  Did i say i dunno anything about the company ?<br><br>If you ask me about Emcom, Sunshine, NTI of cos i know, but you are asking whether i know about the other company in the Group, why would i want to know in the first place.  I do not work in the group.<br><br>I know you are still in the working mindset but please wake up from your own perception can ?  I would really take note if you are giving me good advice, but funny ones you can keep it.<br><br>All the news you have is all outdated do you know that ?  The company is developing so rapidly and from a past networker you want to give comments about its future ?<br><br>Anyway my advice is please update yourself with more info of the companies you wishes to talk about before giving such comments.<br><br>Anyway even if you have been to company before, in what standing do you have to give comments on what james phang will do and not to do ?<br><br>Anyway from the start til now you are only talking about general stuff which is not depth at all, anyway i think if i take your advice i really can't excel in MLM.<br><br><blockquote>everyone goes through the same educating system in NTI, there's no difference in courses offered in there.<br><br>What course did you attend?<br>NDO or PSC or OTHERS? </blockquote>Are you really a newbie in NTI last time?  Those are courses offered by companies only.  I am talking about group training.<br><br><blockquote>Hey - WAKE UP YOUR IDEA LEH<br>NTI - Training Company<br>Training means not MLM? - BUT WHY do they still have this Binary Network Marketing Compensation Plan? Training- how true is that?<br>What is training company in your dictionary and in NTI's Dictionary?<br>Training company, what's the facilities that helps agents to train? Are there lots of tables and chairs, everyday have lessons and classes ma?<br><br>Or are NTI agents everyday sitting on tables drawing circles and telling about the investment plan?</blockquote>Thats why i say you only have outdated news for NTI.  The com plan we have now is all in Sunshine Empire, and of cos our accounts are all transfer over.  NTI has enterprise development training as well as courses that teaches on public speaking.<br><br>Sunshine and NTI is in the same office of cos you will see people doing presentation in the office.<br><br>Lastly the conclusion is things that i did not mentioned does not means i do not know, and get more updated news of the companies before repling, please.</div>

The guranteed returns or profit sharing will be given back and stop til the percent is given back, eg 100%, 200% and 300% not STOP when service starts.<br><br>Emcom returns will be given when they start operation and from the subscription of Internet and VOIP profits.<br><br><blockquote><br>meaning to say, all these while, nti has being using the money invested by INVESTORS and dividing it among nti agents accordingly!! just 50% of the amount that investors invested in.<br></blockquote>Its only part of it.  Sunshine Empire still have products revenue.  What we have is the sales revenue of Sunshine not the investment revenue.<br><br><blockquote><br>so when the city is ready and gives money, than NTI will use the project dividends to support other operations and spend on upkeep (of rental of HUB HUB office) + pay for NTI incentives (not part of emcom anymore in future [example new yr hong bao incentive, genting trip]). This is the reason why the leaders say when the city start having payment, than NTI side of contribution will stop. (they just put it by saying nicely only, but the fact is they greedy for money, for their income of maintainence is high, with poor products that can't attract ppl, so they use ecmom to attract people and to use their money to pay off the upkeeps etc.</blockquote></div></blockquote>Emcom's Taichung project is only part of the business in EGA.  They still have others.  Anyway we will have new projects coming up when taichung is done.<br><br>Hai, why can't you talk more facts about the project, rather just your own perception ?<br><br>You are giving everyone the wrong information !</div>

Its a common tactic for major fund transfer from one company to the other for investment purposes or daily operations. Its often very difficult ot track all these money if there is no one monitoring it. For Sunshine to be able to reimburse everyone and protect all investors interests. They must have at least 200 million Sing dollars in Bank Gurantees that cannot be touched (like a deposit).

You can only get back whatever that is left in the company, provided you have a legitimate claim against the company and register yourself as one of the creditors.

There is no escape from punishment if they are caught with evidence from a properly set up Corporate Governance system.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow after a long break, i missed so many posts already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Thks for all the post, this place is getting better than a flamming ground hahaz.<br><br>Btw, i think its fair for earlier investor to get more return from investment.At phase 1, there is virtually nothing or little evidence to prove that Emcom exist .Over the phases, more things are built and thus, more reliable. So its not fair to link these decreasing trend of compensation % as a PYRAMID SCHEME STRUCTURE.<br><br>The new Emcom agreement is being draft by Singapore lawyer ( tats wat my agent told me). However, from wat i have read, i find out tat stuff like Company Covenants is being left out ( correct me if i am wrong <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> ). Why have they left out this terms in the new Affiliates agreement?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, i just recalled that there are another 2 projects which James Phang had failed previously which I didn't mentioned earlier. I've <span style="color: red;">highlighted it in Red</span><br><br>1 - Pai Du Mei Yuan Bao (if I didn't spell wrongly)<br><br>2 - Lumimi<br><br>3 - Foot Massage Machines<br><br>4- <span style="color: red;">Multi-Pure Water Filtration System </span>[pour coke inside, pure colorless water will flow out] Â– Filter (cost $200 each; correct me if i'm wrong with the numbers) to change once a year. But when the agentsÂ’ relatives want to buy filter from NOP, they stopped distributing, than NOP gave lots of excuses. If they were to order from supplier, it will cost $300- $400 (including air transportation charges) thus with this incident, many agents lost their relativesÂ’ trust, and their reputation have being lost forever.<br><br>5 - Crystals<br><br>6- Columbarium/aka Urns for the dead (if you are alert, can see part of this project during his video time at the start of his training courses $25. Usually at Furama Hotel -not sure if he changed hotel yet)<br><br>7- Magical Kingdom Investment - signing up lots of investors to invest in Indonesia ($5000 per lot)<br><br>8- Credit Cards<br><br>9 - Skin Care products first followed by<br><br>10 - Aroma-therapy<br><br>11 - <span style="color: red;">Acquiring of ARTRISTY Cosmetic Product Distributorship</span>. [top 4th product in USA now you can find them in Amway]<br><br>They openly declare that NTI will get the distributorship in 1 of the training classes.<br><br>But when they failed to clinched that distributorship, they kept their mouth shut. And never ever once spoke of it again.<br><br>12 - Feng Shui Crystals which is James Phang's Brother's products<br><br>13 EM2U aka E Mall To You (Copy e-bay) which ended up as failed project<br><br>14 - Empire Group Alliance [Started to have CHINA DREAM &amp; merge his different companies together due to NTI's reputation dropping so EGA was formed with the new logo of the Lion's Head; BUT not all companies are inside EGA - this is when Lumimi comes in and join NTI as another of their products]<br><br>15 - Life Time Profit Sharing (LPS) than lay low for a few months<br><br>16- Morington Cresent Country Club aka THE Haunted Country Club [which lasted not long - why it closed = management didn't check when the lease will expire, didn't do a lot of ground-work(research) than rent the whole country club. In the end, the owner tells NTI, hey my lease is up, and you have to get out!]<br>And so with that, NTI suffered a HUGE Loss as well as for those people who invested in the country club project.<br><br>17-  Wireless Project Â–Emcom - 50/50 spilt profits between the developer of the wireless &amp; James Phang [so the amount that investors are paying now, half goes to NTI for paying GP,SP, BP according to ranks]<br><br>why I stress 50/50 spilt, because this project was actually launched 2 yrs back. which is when the developer of the wireless back than has got no capital to set up the wireless, so he sign up with a partner, he only gets 30% of profits whereas partner only pumps capital gets 70% so he (developer du lan cannot do anything) while the investor partner guai lan (sit and wait for profits) but this didn't last long so the project failed 2 yrs back.<br></div>
