Pardon me if I am wrong.<br><br>-----------------------------------------<br>The reporter went to this company as per directed by some of the listeners. She went to the office. At the front found the company name and some of the "subsidiaries" which may hint that the company has a big operation. As she walked, she found many connected offices. After going further into the office, she arrived at a huge hall with alot of senior citizens and a few youngsters.<br><br>Then she approached one of the staff how to join as a member. The staff replied that they already have 10000 and increasing. The reporter asked if she wanted to join, how do go about doing it. The staff replied that you need to join as a Bronze Merchant. He then suggested a better way to start, which is to join as a Silver Merchant. By joining as a BM, you will then have a total of 3 Business Centres and 300 mall points which can be used to exchange for some products. The BM costs $280 and the SM costs $1000+. By getting more people to join you, you can then get a chance to promote to become one of the Company's manager.<br><br>To the reporter, she is still unsure how does the company operates, except for the fact that the company will provide you with the Business Centres to operate. Then she approached C@SE to enquire on the number of complaints that operate similarly as the company which she visited. According to C@SE, there has been 15 reports from Jan 2006 till June 2007.<br><br>2 of those who reported were interviewed by the reporter. *Will skip this part, too lengthy*<br><br>The reporter went to interview one lawyer on regards to the MLM Law. The lawyer pointed out the Amendment to the MLM Act. Obtaining a commission from recruitment is considered illegal. The maximum sentence is $200000 or 15 years jail or both.<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br>I hope this would be good enough for those who missed the radio report.<br><br></div>
