The word should not be used here.  Here we are exchanging ideas and idea is always conflicting between people..  Therefore it look like argueing.. you present your point and think your is right.  So does the other people here.  We got to respect each other point of view.  Trouble is many a times, we cannot even agree on what to agree or disagree..  some cannot take it and resort of vulgarities and name calling, that one I agree should be stopped.

            <div class='col-md body'>to vapour: I think you had better wake up. I joined NTI before you, but luckily I came to my senses once I looked beyond the surface. All that motivation, all those talk by james phang, all the high ranking managers - all part of a ploy to fool you. Please check and come back with evidence that nti is really what you proclaim, a saint company.<br><br>The top RSDs or BDMs are earning nothing. everything is for show, don't you get it? I asked their lost distributors (who were their friends) abt them, they still have many debts outside. U really want to know how much they earn? Go and ask them to let you view their acc. The no. of accounts will tell you. It may seem like a lot, but NTI has been around for 2 years, and if they really earn 10k a month, the accounts should be near infinite. See how many accs they got in for the last mth, do your calculations and the truth will be revealed.<br><br>Stop taking what they say as the words of the bible. You are smart enough to judge for yourself. If they say something, like I earn $10000 a month, or whatever, prove it. Please use your time to do more constructive stuff instead of hanging in this place and convincing people to use very very expensive products. OK?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm also one of the ppl who asked for refunds.<br><br>I was lured in on the 9 june and i went down for a refund on the 12 june. I went down with two of my friends. We went there without notifing my upline and we sit there for about a few hours to see the place, while waiting for my upline to return to the office. Up til today the application is still in processing, while the application to join was processed at god's speed.<br><br><strong>Nti didn't cheat us, they just trick us.</strong>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by leddy:</div><div class="quote_body">No i'm not. Just using my Common sense</div></blockquote>You see, by posting such iresponsible remarks about them, do you think it's fair to the company? That's why alot of people have negative thoughts too.<br><br>Why don't the those who are waiting for the refund, just call up the company to check again rather than "complaining" here?<br><br>I know when I say this, people will say that I am trying to cover up again, BUT people out there, please use your logical sense. There are some here who just want to add salt to the wound!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To the people out there, you should go to CASE immediately if they fail to refund you. They may be dragging so that once it passed the stipulated timeframe, you may not be eligible for any refunds at all.<br><br>As for Ms Prickly Heat, do you think they will entertain these pple who wants refund? If yes, they will not even be posting their comments here.<br><br>To all, my advise is not to join this co. If you are targetting to earn as much as their management, like desmond or jackie?, Join Mac or even KFC. Thye may pay you even higher.hahahahaha<br><br>Only Mr James is earning your $ through his well-designed scams. i personally was cheated more than $10k<br><br></div>
