            <div class='col-md body'>wad a lot of bull<br><br>What does he mean by saying 'it's the ONLY Network Marketing company in the world that offers such great opportunity for anyone who wants to be successful'?<br><br>Great opportunity? Perhaps...but by saying it's the ONLY company, you know he's bullshi|tting...<br><br>So wad it has an 'advanced IT infrastructure'? An IT infrastructure means nothing if it can't lower costs for customers, nor increase convenience for the consumers. Has anyone joined or bought something online? I seriously doubt it. And lastly, and most importantly, it's products. It's unbelievable somebody can talk about how good their company is without talking about their range of products, and the success of their brand name(cos they never had a good brand name anyway) at all...<br><br>Anyway, anyone who's in business, or know business well enough will know that great technology doesn't guarantee results. You can have a breakthru technology with disastrous results because of various reasons(inpracticalites, high costs, difficulty in implementation, existing technology which are much cheaper yet does its purpose well enough, etc)...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi nti agents, maybe I am your nemesis, a challenge to you or even a friend to you.<br>But! If you should see this post, you should see what nti really are. I bet you not gonna believe whatever I said, it is natural, or else there wonÂ’t be a word like brainwashed. Think about it, if you really meant to be successful whatever you do will also be successful. It is fated. Does bill gates trained in nti before? And is he successful? You all just like to compare between outside business and business in nti, why not compare a normal sweeperÂ’s monthly pay with your monthly pay. Or are you too naÃ¯ve to thinks that those people on top are going to give in their seats to you? In 2 years time, you will Â… In 1 years time, you will Â… in 1 and a Â½ year time you will Â… time really tells BUT what makes you think by that time people will join you guys and what makes you think you are better than people even in your own company? Quit before it is too late people. Just like smoking or some drug, the more you into it, the more you suffers, the more you can get rid of it.<br><br>Hi anyone who come internet of find sources about nti, I hope my post will reflects something about nti and hope you will never get connect with it.<br><br>To those ex nti agents, never brood about your cheated money or you can never earn it back. To be more practical, you should think of how to revenge, how to prevent more people like you get cheated. Let your anger be converted into enthusiasm and get rid of nti legally. Never lose your cool, dude.<br></div>
