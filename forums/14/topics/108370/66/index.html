Gee, we are so way behind Korea and Japan in optic cable connection, and US already have their www2 long time ago. Like other government agencies, IDA is very heavily involved in telecommunication in Singapore, so pardoned me if i may show thorough disdain with regards to 'recognition for their technology'<br><br>What tech in fact you are talking about?
