            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wayne123:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi everyone, I've been victimised by this company and I want to get my full refund. It's been about 3 months since I joined them and I have yet to receive the products.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I'm not trying to promote this freaking company, i don't even have the intention, but i'm telling my experiences with them.<br><br>And yes, I do agree that the people there have been brain-washed. I'm not really an active member since I rarely go there and I do not have any downlines. being persuaded by my friend and the people there, as they said I am new and need to know things before I get started on my 'work', I took time to go there. But when I did come down, I saw that most of the people there are just walking around, or having presentations, talking with other uplines/downlines, having 'groupings', basically just pretending to be busy. During my days there, my upline gave me this 'distibutor's guide' which consists of the rules of NTI, their programmes, the abc technique, the feedback form, the B push, etc.<br><br>When I especially found out about the abc technique and the feedback form, I was disgusted. All along the presenter knew what I was like and hit on my weaknessess. I felt cheated from then on, and I kept thinking about it. I had alot of doubts, such as why are NTI's price of their products so expensive? And so they answered me, 'How much is a can of coke? Do you know how much is its manufactured price? Do you feel exploited?'<br><br>And I wanted to clear them with my upline. What I don't like was, he kept praising the people directly above him, talked about how good NTI was, the consequences of not having a downline, that NTI wasn't all about recuitment, that the people in NTI are here to help you,that he has seen people changed for the better, and told me to start earning money. I wasn't surprised by his answer as he come down to the company nearly almost everyday. I guessed he too was brain-washed. He couldn't see it, kept praising the company and refuse to listen to me when i told him i felt cheated.<br><br>The reason why I didn't want to have any downlines is that I don't want to do any dirty work, which is recuiting people. I told this to my another upline, and she told me that I must build my network first. She didn't let me win the argument. nobody in NTI would let you win anyway. They're good at twisting with words. When i told her about what I thought NTI was all about recuitment, she said she used to be in my shoes. She said NTI wasn't all about signing up new people, but also on enriching. Because I was new and all, she said I should attend this 'BES' (Business Education System) which is for beginners. She also urged me to come down more often. I have better things to do than to hang around and listen to people who are full of themselves.<br><br>Recently, NTI has changed their plans. I'm not really sure of their new one, but their single account is no longer $288. They have 3 types, namely the bronze merchant, silver merchant and the gold merchant. They have another one called the empire merchant, whereby if you belong to either bronze, silver or gold, you had to top up some money to get to the 'empire merchant' status to earn their so called benefits they have. They also have volcanic crystals as their new product.<br><br>But whatever plans they have, please stay away from this company. They also have this program, called 'BIP' (Business Introduction Program) which is the same as presentations, but is conducted for the masses. They will set the atmostphere high to encourage people to join them. This falls on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Please I repeat, do not be lured by any 'lobangs' they tell you about. </div></blockquote>Actually for those from NTI trying to press you from going down, all these are actually learnt from the so called lessons mentioned in the above quote. Quite stupid I should say, everybody monkey see monkey do.<br><br>Maybe you can say I'm crazy, I treat the money I gave to NTI as charity.<br><br>I joined as I trusted my friend. Now I don't trust him anymore. He don't look rich either. Lucky I never listen to him take up gold merchant.<br><br>Lol.. I paid the money and do nothing. All because after paying, I realise that maybe I shouldn't work for them so I see how they operate. True enough, I'm disappointed. After like 2 months of zero results and inactivity, my account was closed. In the beginning they were still so enthusastic about me.. Those despos.<br><br>Now I've learnt something, never trust anybody.<br><br>I also agree with some posts about "no life".. they actually wanted me to spend so much time in their office.. I got much better things to do man...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yoz everyone. I'm joining this thread.<br><br>From what i know they seem to be changing plans by end of October. They are raising their prices also. I heard it from a friend in NTI few days ago but i wasnt listening seriously as I dont believe on their theory.<br><br>Also a few a weeks ago, this particular friend invited me to his company, saying he had a surprise for me. On the way to the company, he talked about the books that he read recently and said how he became a changed man. He also talked about his life objectives and then asked me what i like (his question revolves around what car will you like) and he gave this feedback to his superior.<br><br>Upon reaching this company, I found out that 3 of my former classmates are also there.(Surprised!)Then they will invite me to sit (table with 4 chairs with me in the "hot seat")<br><br><strong>The Plan</strong> (it was the old plan they introduced me to):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">BM $300      - 2 downlines<br>SM $1850    - 10 downlines , carfund<br>GM $3000+  - forget howmany downlines, carfund, shareholder<br>(notsure whether i got this correct - afterall its been a few weeks liao)</span><br><br>As the presenter continued to speak, my classmates and friends will one by one come over and speak with me and also sit besides me. Then a more senior manager came over again and repeated the system again. The atmosphere was tense and after 2 or 3 hours, i felt tired so i signed the forms, but Not paying a cent to the plan as i only bought $20 .(They were shocked that I had only $20, but how much do they think i'll bring?)The only thing i paid was $5 for a ticket. (my friends sponsored me some $)<br><br>On the way home, I felt very uneasy. Its not just the $ that I might have to invest but something seemed fishy. How can you earn so much money easily? It made me suffer in my thoughts for 4 days and the conclusion was that it doesnt seemed right. So I told my parents about it and the first impression they can think of is pyramid marketing. So in the end i did not go nor pay but I'm sad to see so many of my pals in it.<br><br>(Not related to this thread)<br><br>Also, this particular friend seemed to be blinded by $ liao that he would sell <strong>!burned!</strong> licsenced anime and sell to people at a (cough) much higher price. I really feel sad. What about morals?</div>

Ur presence in the line help him in to bring in More $$$.. they JUS DON CARE about you.. even though u are soo willing to learn..<br><br>Young Ppl nowadays got the entrenpreurial spirit in them, they thought invest liao.. they can be next Bill gates.. $$$ always come with hardwork.. not waiting for $$ to drop.. Ppl must learn thru the hard way, den they will be able to know hw to appreciate the things they EARNED by their sweat ! No Pain No Gain.! u think mr lee kuan yew or lee jia chen, becoming overnite successful chap.. they take great pain and criticism to get where u are.. the respect they hav now cannot be measured.. Not a few hours or mths of talk cock sesson makes u a million dollar, time to mature and do more practical things in Life NOW.!<br><br>NTi personnel always promised u DREAMS and HOPE... and do u know their DREAMS and HOPE also depends on u.. Once they get u in, do they still care wat the fuck u are.. the company also like money vaccuum cleaner, they jus SUCK.. i MEt a Good MLM company, even though i didnt work for years..they still send me their newletter once a while to update me about their products and company updates.. for NTI.. no good news about the advancement or management but i heard alot of ROTTEN News from them<br><br>WARNING to all young innocents..! TIme to wake up lah! Go back to ur books and stop dreaming rich! Nothing is this world is EASY, You hav worked For it !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Update : From what i extracted from my friend in NTi, this is the "advantages" of working there...........<br><br>Point 1 - The expand faster than other mlm's<br><br>Point 2 - The payment schemes are better<br><br>Point 3 - The "enrichment" courses are better<br><br>Point 4 - They sell every thing; they dont do sales<br><br>(I do care about his feelings but i feel that this must be exposed to everyone)<br><br>This is todays log. From what i see, this seems to have nothing to do with even MLM lor. No coherent marketing plan...</div>
