            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, this i think is the longest thread for any given topic i've seen. I've read a few pages and groused through the rest. I've interacted with people in NTi before.<br><br>I just wish to contribute my view. First of all, even though i find several aspects of NTi rather suspect, i'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I must say how they revamped and presented their business plan was quite ingenious. It is definitely very different from what i was exposed to. Indeed, i was quite impressed by what they have to offer. I was almost tempted to join them. But i resisted and went to do my research. My research turned up a lot of question which the person i spoke to couldn't answer. They referred me to someone presumably more experienced but this particular manager couldn't answer my questions as well. That made me very suspicious. But maybe it could be due to the fact that there is too many aspect in their business. I won't reflect these questions in here to give NTi the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>There are a lot of unhappiness in every industry with every company. Not just in Network Marketing. But i must agree that MLM has a very bad reputation in Singapore, if not globally. For example, i'm sure some of you are aware that Google is the new bad boy in the corporate world. They are undercutting and recruiting the best talents the top Universities have to offer. They are becoming the next Microsoft and could even surpass Microsoft. Definitely a force to be reckon with. Arrogance begets arrogance. Maybe some guy in Google offended someone.<br><br>Anyway, what was exchanged in this forum was very informative. My attention was brought here by a friend who was from a MLM company. My views are quite neutral. I don't think Network Marketing is a bad business plan on the whole. I did a bit of research on this industry. But i think there are really a lot of people who are abusing this system to their own benefit. So much so, i don't know who's the real mcCoy anymore. So it's better to be safe than sorry.<br><br>Hmm, does anyone has anything to add?<br><br></div>

You may be just inexperience not stupid.  You do not have to feel bad about your friends because you are just sharing something that you thought was beneficial to them that unfortunately turnout badly.  Nobody can guarantee success in any business venture, there is always risk of negative returns.<br><br>Take it easy.</div>

He will also quote big and prominent names and corporations and say they are into MLM also...names like Bill Gates, IBM, Microsoft, Nike etc.....<br><br>He also claims that his MLM company is the best, with the best product, best mgmt, best team, best remuneration structure.<br>bankers, lawyers, heart surgeons and 747 pilots have joined this company.<br>top men in this company drives Porsche, lives in 2 bungalows etc....<br><br>He also mentions why things like why work for 40 years and retire for 10years. why not work for 10 years and retire for 40 years.<br><br>2) Mr X stops bothering you, taking it that you are hopeless and stubborn and ignorant.<br>Off he goes on his new "business" venture.<br><br>typical paraniod questions thrown at you in the heat of frustration trying to<br>convince you includes:<br><br>i) pyramid selling? can you explain to me what exactly is pyramid selling and the difference between pyramid selling and MLM????????<br><br>ii) you not interested then you ask so many questions for what???!!!!!<br>iii) if I answer this question of yours, you agree to buy and join???, then???!!!!<br><br>You will see him approaching people in all scenarios from a wedding banquet, a drinking session, a mahjong session, lunch, Incamp training etc.....<br><br>3) Mr X having been rejected by the numerous people that he approaches, now complains to you, and starts to bad-mouth those who reject him, labelling them as no ambition, kiasi, no entrepreneurship and so on. But notice that he will not mention a slight hint of the MLM business he is involved in to you, even if you ask him. Vague answers will be given like new way, new business, new concept of selling.<br><br>4) Mr X now having failed considerably to make good on his MLM business, now makes a call to you, asking casually if you are interested in joining his business venture. at most, he will mention the product itself,(magnetic mattress, health food, gold coin) but not the MLM company name itself.<br><br>5) Mr X could have approach his MLM upline trying to refund the product, but this will not be made known to people whom he had approached. Whether the refund is successful or not, only Mr X knows, (I would see this as something being done BACKSTAGE, away from the audience)<br><br>6) Mr X now still stuck, keeps to himself and stop mentioning the business. this is where the embarassment part comes into play. Extreme embarassment meaning he has shown to you so much faith, hope and promise in the thing at the very beginning and now it has failed him entirely and make him so lost. still he presists and refuses to admit its not working, for saving face sake,<br><br>7) so once in a while Mr X unleashes it again,"how would you like to join me in my business." and the name Robert Kiyosaki is probably a standard dish being served in this whole banquet. </span></div>
