In fact one of my cousin use to be in NOP and I know how they were like. Hence I did not join them in the past. Neither do I agree with how some of the people in NTI works to get youngster to join through some means of "not so nice" method IMHO. In fact i just heard a guy from the same company, but belong to the NTI group talking like that to a young prospect recently. And I am disgusted. But being personally in the company, Sunshine Empire, not NTI, and knowing the people there, let me learnt that the company has its black sheeps... but not all are black. There are many good sheeps around like the group i'm with.<br><br>Anyway just for your updates.. Emcom has just came up with this Emcall callback service and I am lucky enough to personally experinece it!

But that is not how Sunshine works. They money you put in is to buy our Mall points, not invest. When you buy our Mall points, then the company is free to use your money to do whatever kind of investments they want.  We have being questioned by officials from SC and MAS before and nothing has happened because our business model is not illegal! I know people is going to ask how am I going to prove that we have being questioned... if you ask me.. i seriously dunno how to show you the proof unless someone has friends in these departments.<br><br>And for god sake, I have just tried to access 80% of the websites listed above and what a joke! Either they are gone... or they are a truely invesment money game website, or a network marketing webpage from overseas talking about ways to make you earn money and no product. Please someone please go and try out all websites above and let me know which website is like SUNSHINE EMPIRE, who has a proper webpage, with physical offices address in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, etc etc.. for the SC and MAS people to visit somemore.. easy to find us.<br><br>And if we really are doing something illegal, don't you think something should have already happen to us by now? Since we are doing it so publicly, then I guess we would have easily being checked and folded up if there were something wrong with us.  Again, some ppl is going to say this is not a good point to fight as it is viewed from another angle.  Hence I think readers here, please make your own perception. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, the people still cannot accept network marketing as a form of business. This is due to the fact that network marketing has a troubled past and its business model can easily be manipulated by people with bad intention. About 30-40 years ago, most people in Singapore also thought that insurance and franchise are also scams. This is also because of the bad image being portrayed by those con men. Today insurance and franchise are accepted as well as being popular with Singaporeans. This is because of regulations as well as education by the authorities. I believe in about 20 years time, mlm will be accepted as another form of business after the authorities have cleared the grey areas.<br><br>MLM is already part and parcel of the American society. As of NTI Paris, all I can say is that what they are doing is not deemed ethical by top network marketers in the US. In US, people openly tell their friends that they are in MLM to sell products. They have nothing to hide unlike NTI Paris which use underhand tactics to lure people to come and then hard-sell them. For a true understanding of network marketing, I recommend you guys to read Network Marketing for Dummies by Zig Ziglar.<br><br>By the way, how do you make the links in your website click able? Thanks.</div>
