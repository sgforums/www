NTI is not the one building the wireless network you know? They do not even have a single person who have that expertise. Supposedly they are cooperating with the company in Taiwan but you gotta think, a project like making the whole of Taiwan wireless, why on earth would a company capable of doing that cooperate with a MLM company of all companies to get people to invest in it? And furthermore what you are investing in I can say all the projected profits are not even realised yet.<br><br>Again, open your eyes and take a look at the QUALITY of the people there before you throw your money away. I said this before in an earlier post. What on earth would a bunch of KIDS know about wireless technology. If you really want to invest in this so badly, I would recommend waiting until they are PUBLICLY LISTED and then I don't mind spending $100,000.00 even to buy their shares in an IPO what. Otherwise what they are showing people now is just an empty shell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please look at ChannelNewsAsia for this story:<br><br>All Singaporeans to enjoy free wireless broadband access in public areas for 2 years<br>By Asha Popatlal, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 10 October 2006 2035 hrs<br><br>SINGAPORE: From January next year, all Singaporeans will get to enjoy free wireless Internet in public areas for two years.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shared this and other initiatives at a dinner marking 25 years of infocomm achievements.<br><br>Mr Lee also painted a vision where IT businesses can grow and jobs created as Singaporeans get wired island-wide.<br><br>To make sure no one is left behind, he said money is going to be pumped in to help three groups - needy students, the disabled and the elderly get onto this IT journey.<br><br>For many Singaporeans, whether at work or play, their lifestyle - from using cell phones to instant messaging - is already digital.<br><br>The government wants to take one step further and make it all mobile.<br><br>So, from January 2007, it will be rolling out wireless broadband Internet in all public spaces, called Wireless@SG, for free, for the first two years.<br><br>Premium and higher access speeds will also be immediately available - but this will come at a fee.<br><br>"Thereafter, access is expected to remain highly affordable. So, with just your laptop or PDA, you can enjoy high speed connection to the Internet, send out instant messages and check emails and even make VOIP (voice-over-IP) calls," said Mr Lee.<br><br>Singaporeans will be able to surf all over downtown, major town centres, recreational areas like East Coast Park, and maybe even at libraries and fast food outlets.<br><br>Three operators - iCELL network, QMax Communications and SingTel - have been appointed to do this.<br><br>They will carve out the island into three areas, and complete their deployment by end-September next year.<br><br>The government hopes this will grow the broadband market from the current 50,000 users to about 250,000 users in two years.<br><br>Business-wise, a new office has been created to drive R&amp;D in the field of Interactive and Digital Media, one of three new areas of development for the Singapore economy.<br><br>The aim is to create 10,000 more new jobs by 2015 and contribute $10m to the economy, up from the $3.8m contributed in 2003.<br><br>It will target niche areas like creating games, which is already a multi-million dollar industry, within an Asian context,<br><br>"It was a leap of faith into the unknown when we took the infocomm plunge in 1981. The lesson from the last 25 years is that we must continue to track closely the changes around us and respond promptly when opportunities emerge. By the time a trend becomes obvious to everyone, we may have already missed the train," said Mr Lee.<br><br>Mr Lee noted that many global IT companies are already here whilst opportunities are now opening up in the region.<br><br>He said IDA will support promising local enterprises to grow globally and to build capabilities to deliver large-scale projects.<br><br>As Singaporeans race forward on the IT journey, Mr Lee says special interest groups must not be left behind.<br><br>At least 14 percent of households still do not have computers.<br><br>Under an enhanced programme, at least 10,000 needy families with school-going children can look forward to getting a brand new computer for less than $300, bundled with three years of unlimited broadband access.<br><br>This programme will be co-funded by the IDA that will come up with $12m while industry partners will contribute another $19m.<br><br>Special Infocomm Accessibility Centres will be set up to train the disabled, and senior citizens will get help to click their way through the IT maze. - CNA /dt<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So is NTI or the Taiwan company one of the operators? If not, Where the fark got space left for them to stand in SG? So maybe like that NTI gotta shift operations to Taiwan permanantly then. Then how will SG investors get their money?</div>

I got a friend throw over 10,000 SGD into their so called china dream last time until now haven even got a fart back yet. Then the NTI pple ask her to throw more money convert into the investment for the wireless thing, luckily she never do it. Sooo stupid, those NTI people, telling her to either throw more money in OR ELSE can only get back around 3,000 plus. That means if she dun throw more money in she will lose 7000 plus. So she opted out, wanted nothing to do with the whole thing already. Then you know what those people in NTI tell her? have to collect back the 3000 in SIX MONTH INSTALLMENTS<br><br>COME ON LAR!!! 3,000 only, not 300,000 you know! really like KIDS owing each other money you know!
