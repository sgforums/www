Try to read the post by sampanboi and see where M.T.I fit in:<br><br>Below are quotes from a report done by someone named Jon M. Taylor<br>it can be found in <a href="http://www.pyramidschemealert.org" rel="nofollow">www.pyramidschemealert.org </a><br><br>"One of the most problematical of business models is multi-level or network marketing (MLM ). Many MLM programs show all the effects and characteristics of a pyramid scheme, but the MLM industry has nonetheless been allowed to continue and flourish. Though considered benign by many, its insidious and corrupting influence and the financial and social harm suffered by participants is considerable. <strong>Unfortunately, victims of these programs seldom complain, blaming themselves for their failures</strong>.<br><br>This problem is compounded by limited resources available to enforcement agencies, faced with a profusion of both naked pyramid schemes (wherein no products are offered) and product-based pyramid schemes (PPS's), operating as MLM's. They are now appearing by the hundreds on the internet, and established MLM companies are expanding into overseas markets.<br><br>Due to inadequate definitions of what constitutes a pyramid scheme, insufficient resources, and/or lack of prosecutorial will in enforcement of existing statutes, enforcement agencies often wind up catching the minnows, but letting the sharks go free. <strong>The consequences are enormous -- millions of MLM participants are being bilked out of billions of dollars each year</strong>."<br><br>"The key to predicting potential harm to victims of a PPS is to determine the degree of leverage of the compensation system. Once a highly leveraged PPS is identified by its compensation system, the prognosis is certain: Inordinate emphasis on recruiting will follow, and only a few at the top of the pyramid will profit at the expense of the investments in product purchases by those in their downline -- most of whom lose money. In other words, <strong>emphasis on recruiting is just one of the effects, not the cause, of the problems with PPS's</strong>.<br><br>MLM recruiters should be required to disclose average net payout to distributors (total payout less purchases) from the company by percentiles. This would reveal extreme payout patterns typical of pyramid schemes. Significant resale of products at retail prices should not be assumed, as <strong>MLM products are seldom priced competitively</strong>."<br></div>

You mean mlm is the only way to salvation in today's economy? Perhaps you are used to using such hard selling tactics to pursuade ppl to join you. When you recruit, do you ever care for the person you recruit, if he or she has any chance of succeeding in mlm? or are u more concerned in recruit him/her and encourage them to buy the products to promote, thus you earning money? with such high rate in failures in mlm, it's no wonder that the recruiters are more concerned with their pockets than what they preach of helping ppl to get rich.</div>
