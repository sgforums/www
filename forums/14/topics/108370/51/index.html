It is always good to hear both side of the dicussion so that a more informed decision is arrived.<br>Personally, i bear no grudges against you and have no clue of your identity.However,i do feel an obligation to respond to your post since it was directed to me. I believe this is basic communicaiton courtesy akin to how pple are expected to establish a 2 way communicaiton in a conversation.<br>So, let go through your points one by one.Your post are in bold.<br><br>1)[b]Dear owner of an overused nick, my replies are in blue.</strong><br>I believe that every individual should be treated with respect, especially when we do not hold personal grudges nor connections/relations. I think you would accredit yourself better not to start off an conversaiton by pinpointing at my username with the term "overused". It is akin to making fun/insulting a person birthname,an act void of basic courtesy and respect for an individual.Furthermore, i believe my nickname does not come as offensive since it does not constitute of pronfanities neither does it target any particular organization/grp/race/individual.<br><br>2)<strong>I pity you. It seems to me that you have not learnt anything from NTI yet- still the little boy that your mama knew.</strong><br>Once again, your post is void of basic manners and respect for an individual. While it may be true that i have not learn anything from nti, it is not right to labelled me as little boy nor bring my mum into this subject. She is an innocent third party.<br><br>3)<strong>I cannot comprehend your fear of incurring additional charges and involvement in NTI. At NTI, we seek to provide you with high quality education- skills that you can never hope to learn from any of your geeky school textbooks. </strong><br>Fear is a very personal issue. Some pple fear roaches while some have a phobia of swimming. I think that it is only normal to have doubts abt sth that has been given a bad rep. Also, formal education integrate us into society by providing us with knowledge and skills such as basic linguistics and writting. Pls do not undermine its importance by dimissing school textbks as geeky. We should be more appreciative of what formal educaiton has given us. Even Robert Kiyosaki agreed in his bks that it is impt in life to get a formal education.<br><br>4)  <strong>The skills that you will learn from these courses will benefit you throughout your life, and reap you profits many times the cost of the course. You will remember this as the best decision that you have ever made in your life.<br></strong><br>While it is gd to see that you have much confidence in the quality of nti courses. The value that one can reap out of learning differs from individual to individual. It is a huge ASSUMPTION to claim that attending nti courses would be the best decision made in my life.<br><br>5)<strong>Don't you want to change your life? Rather than attending seminars by Donald Trump and the like (which you apparently are not sophisticated enough to benefit from), we are offering you with a very affordable and viable way to improve yourself.</strong><br>Once again, an personal attack on me claiming that i am not sophisticated.<br><br>6)<strong>As observed from your forum post above, you seem to lack self-confidence but refuse to let NTI help you. You fear too much. Please seek help even if you decide to quit NTI eventually. </strong><br>Accurate observation. I am a person who do really fear too much and is low on self confidence. I thank you for giving me sound advice here. I do need to build up on my confidence level.<br><br>7)<strong>I can fill up several pages about the value and usefulness of NTI training but it would be futile since you appear to have already made up your mind about NTI</strong>.<br>If you can really provide us with solid evidence on the usefulness of NTI training, pls seriously do so. I believe it would be very helpful in clearing up the negative connotations that associate with nti here. This would serve nti well in the long run too as new pple that come to this forum would at least get alternative exposure to nti operations/success backed by hard evidence. They would be able to make more informed decision regarding nti.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <strong>Hopefully, it will also correct some of the major flaws that you currently manifest because no amount of reading of self-improvement guides in your closet can substitute for the training provided by NTI. </strong><br>I would appreciate it very much if you spell out my major flaws in specific terms instead of making such a general comment. Also, reading self-improvement guides only reflect that i have a desire to improve n learn. My takeaway from these guides depend on my own learning curve and practical applicaiton frequency.<br>Once again, gd to see that you all have confidence in the course quality. You can highlight nti strengths further by telling us where is nti superior compared to self-improvement guides using specific examples.<br><br>To pple who have spend their time reading my post, i would like to say a big thank you.All comments, questions and suggesitons are welcomed.( Senseless flaming is an exception).Good Day.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;">Such a long post.. But unfortunately, it is rather barren in terms of content. The bulk of your post is about how upset you are about my appraisal of you. You are disgruntled about my observations based on your forum post, and you responded by adopting the metholodical approach of quoting my post, followed by lamenting that I am berating you unfairly. You simply have no idea how wearisome it is for me to read through your pathetic whining. </span></strong><br><blockquote><br>I would appreciate it very much if you spell out my major flaws in specific terms instead of making such a general comment.<br></blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><strong><br>You amuse me with your naivety. How is it possible for anybody to be able to make a complete evaluation of a stranger based on 1 forum post? I did however, point out that you fear too much, didn't I? Forgot to mention that the way you write is very awkward.. Reads as though you are writing an FAQ in a help file. For your benefit, I was referring to your mediocre mastery of language and your whimpiness, which were clearly evident in your writing style and the nature of the concerns that you raised when I mentioned "major flaws".<br><br>It is great to know that you have a "desire to improve n learn". But reading self-improvement guides is a passive activity. You may learn some pointers but you need to practise them in order to truly master these soft skills. At NTI, we afford you many opportunities to practise these skills on fellow trainees. Your speaking prowess will be dramatically improved through interaction with peers with different personalities. It is not convenient for me to divulge too much information about our training methods as these are regarded as trade secrets that makes NTI stand out among other centres that purport to offer such training. As mentioned earlier, since you have already paid for the education package, may I humbly suggest again that you take some time off your schedule to attend the courses? You will be converted. And very soon, you will be out there roping your friends into the company just like me because you want them all to benefit from it!<br><br>Cheers<br>NTI<br></strong></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey people, i'm not exactly new in SgForum. I'm using another account now because of what i did in the past and therefore my account got suspended. Well, why it got suspended was because i tried to advertise an online survey that could help make money here. i didn't know it was wrong at that time. but well learnt my lesson. =)<br><br>that's just a little bit about my that naughty past, anyway i've been observing this forum for a year now, as a guest. anyone can view forum right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>why i ended up here? that's because one of my "friend" tried to get me to join NTI. I went down at 8 plus and it took me 3 hours to get out. I was supposed to attend some talk and she emphasized to me why i needed to come down because it's by some very influential speaker and stuff. my goodness, i was even being targeted at during the talk, because i was sitting right at the front so i became one of the speaker's 'specimen'.<br><br>It was such a turn off, the way he spoke. It didn't take me long to conclude that that guy standing on the stage was an idiot and that him being an 'influential' speaker? i felt i could do an even better job. but anyway after the talk, i met one of my primary schoolmate, when i look at him, he still looked the same. and he claims he's doing very well now. but i knew him, from primary school, he wasn't a very smart student, he wasn't very well-behaved, i asked myself, "does this company really have the ability to give chances to people and let them change for the better?" i looked around the 1st floor office, it was in a complete mess.<br><br>there's so many people sitting around, i didn't have my lunch and dinner before that, i couldn't stand it. i asked my friend if i could leave so i can eat my dinner, she asked me to wait because they wanted someone else to speak to me. i kept on pressing that i wanted to leave and finally she gave in, asked me to talk to this manager for awhile and he tried to get me to join, explaining to me all the stuff, placing the form in front of me. i filled it up but stopped short at signing, i asked "do i have to sign?".<br>they told me it's just for reference, so i was like, damn it i want to leave, i'm not going to sign this and you can have my particulars. i told them that i was going to sign up for some silver membership thing but i need to consider first and that i'll drop by again. finally i managed to leave the place.<br><br>i was doing a project at that time and was in partnership with a boss of a shop in bugis. i was supposed to meet him to get promotional materials from him and when i did, i talked to him for awhile and he told me that all this MLM stuff are not worth joining. he said he is someone who jumps at any money making opportunity but he'll never take up MLM.<br><br>I came home, switched on my com, did a little search on NTI and found their website, the moment i got in, i laughed, it was techno music playing. i was thinking, wtf? corporate website and background music is techno? that was one hell of an experience, then i moved on to my next search, a forum, this forum. i through most of the thread and i realised how it's actually like in NTI.<br><br>i'm not going to jump into conclusion on how bad NTI is because i've never beeen in it like some forum members here, but i can at least think logically, in MLM is like a pyramid, the top is made up of few people, but they get the most, the bottom, they cannibalise. i asked myself, do i really want to be part of this cannibalism? do i want to be like my 'friend'? drag other of my friends into this cannibalism? No. I want to keep my friends, and save the money. Even if i'm going to miss out on money making opportunity, it's better than losing my friends. and therefore i chose not to join.<br><br>today, i still have my money, my time, my friends. and i'm proud of that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
