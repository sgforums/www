            <div class='col-md body'>NLP is just a broad term for any method that has a strong end in mind. The problem with NLP is that it promises very quick results, sometimes the effect runs out very quickly and the enthusiasm will fade, leaving most of those who were programmed a little lost, disoriented and disillusioned. Hahaha to use the term NLP to describe NTI's tactics are a tad bit high class though.<br><br>There isn't anything to shoot her back with, she has not said anything substantial or anything new that has not been rebutted before.</div>

His previous old BMW 3 series was taken over by one of his Key-Man, Yuanjie.<br><br>There is another RSD called, Desmond Teo, is driving some pathetic cheapo car which doesnt belong to him. Haiz. Why Desmond's partner, Jackie, dont give him the BMW? How can a RSD drive such a cheapo car and his downline, Yuanjie is driving BMW? I think this guy, Desmond, is really a loser.</div></blockquote>Lol.<br><br>Nicely put! I think their partner relation going to end soon. Desmond sure jealous Jackie and Jackie is selfish against Desmon.<br><br>There is a chinese saying, one hill can't accomodate 2 Tigers.<br>One of them must go down, and that is Desmond.<br><br>Let them have internal wars, dog fight dog.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Desmond has always been some sort of "promoted" RSD as he has no shares in the company and NTI is really Jackie's creation, not Desmond's so I think Desmond will be quiet and listen to Jackie's commands until a time he has developed enough "skills" to move on and start his own. The only reason Yuan Jie is influential is because at one time he had one of the most downlines amongst all of them. But I'm very sure he's regretting the car now haha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats why I say that those people who join NTI for "education" are indeed very silly. First, pay a huge sum of money then pay like a few hundred dollars each time the company forces you to attend a seminar. Its like paying to be somebody's salesman hahaha I think work for charity is even better, at least you don't pay to work, you do something meaningful and some charities even give you lunch/dinner vouchers.</div>
