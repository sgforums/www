It is young. Barely 1 year old. This alone would result in it not being given the rights to do the wireless project in S'pore. Look at Icell, Qmax and Singtel. They are all much older and established. Plus Icell is by Creative, Qmax by Keppel Bank and Singtel no need to mention is very established here. This made sense when they were chosen instead of a young budding company like Emcom even though it may have the capability and technology to undertake the project.<br><br></div>

NTI is not the one building the wireless network you know? They do not even have a single person who have that expertise. Supposedly they are cooperating with the company in Taiwan but you gotta think, a project like making the whole of Taiwan wireless, why on earth would a company capable of doing that cooperate with a MLM company of all companies to get people to invest in it? And furthermore what you are investing in I can say all the projected profits are not even realised yet.<br><br>Again, open your eyes and take a look at the QUALITY of the people there before you throw your money away. I said this before in an earlier post. What on earth would a bunch of KIDS know about wireless technology. If you really want to invest in this so badly, I would recommend waiting until they are PUBLICLY LISTED and then I don't mind spending $100,000.00 even to buy their shares in an IPO what. Otherwise what they are showing people now is just an empty shell. </div></blockquote>This is how Tayee technology company works. It cooperates with different companies to build cities wireless in different projects. Why it wants to cooperate with an MlM company, no one really knows unless they are the people in Tayee Tech. Tayee tech previously worked with Wemax (I think) to make Gao Shiung wireless.<br><br>http://www.wemax.net.tw/<br><br>The Tayee technology is also used by another company, not Emcom to make a small town called Dan Shui Xiao Zhen Wireless.<br><br>Anyway, another thing I was displeased with was TELESCOPE's disguided thinking that youths aka KIDS do not know much about IT. From my point of view, which is a youth's point of view, we are pretty much IT savvy. Adobe, html, programming, DOTA, being online Pirates, hackers, exploiters of the net, dreamweaver etc. I would say youths are generally GOOD at IT, perhaps sometimes better than adults since our generation started using a computer since primary 2. Many can't live without the PC man. Take a survey and check how many email/friendster/youtube/IMVU/MSN addicts are there among youths and you'll be shocked.<br><br>Back to the investment thingy. To people in NTI, it is known as the partnership programme. It is something that Sunshine Empire, a marketing company with a history of 28years came up with. This partnership programme aims to promote the Emcom project and it is not something that Emcom came up with. And totally unrelated to Tayee tech, the company that is the one really building the project.<br><br>Sunshine Empire has a long history of 28years but it only came into the picture now because of Emcom and the relationship they have because of Sunshine Empire's role as a marketing company. Sunshine Empire has a KL branch. Next time when I get the address, I could put it up to let you people go visit it when you are touring KL.<br><br>I heard there are many companies under Empire Group Alliance and NTI is just one of the company. I find it strange that you people show more interest in NTI than all the other companies that JP set up which could be more successful than NTI like Sunshine Empire.<br><br>I read about the Magic Kingdom from this forum and went to ask an NTI fren about it. From what my fren said, this Magic Kingdom is simply a failed venture.  Sounds reasonable since there's always failures in business. Many businesses have failed for various of reasons. The one given here was, the contractors in charge of building the Magic Kingdom ran away with all the money for the project. That's how the business failed. So this is all that I know. I hope it helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by perceptionsperceptions:</div><div class="quote_body">This is how Tayee technology company works. It cooperates with different companies to build cities wireless in different projects. Why it wants to cooperate with an MlM company, no one really knows unless they are the people in Tayee Tech. Tayee tech previously worked with Wemax (I think) to make Gao Shiung wireless.<br><br>http://www.wemax.net.tw/<br><br>The Tayee technology is also used by another company, not Emcom to make a small town called Dan Shui Xiao Zhen Wireless.<br><br>Anyway, another thing I was displeased with was TELESCOPE's disguided thinking that youths aka KIDS do not know much about IT. From my point of view, which is a youth's point of view, we are pretty much IT savvy. Adobe, html, programming, DOTA, being online Pirates, hackers, exploiters of the net, dreamweaver etc. I would say youths are generally GOOD at IT, perhaps sometimes better than adults since our generation started using a computer since primary 2. Many can't live without the PC man. Take a survey and check how many email/friendster/youtube/IMVU/MSN addicts are there among youths and you'll be shocked.<br><br>Back to the investment thingy. To people in NTI, it is known as the partnership programme. It is something that Sunshine Empire, a marketing company with a history of 28years came up with. This partnership programme aims to promote the Emcom project and it is not something that Emcom came up with. And totally unrelated to Tayee tech, the company that is the one really building the project.<br><br>Sunshine Empire has a long history of 28years but it only came into the picture now because of Emcom and the relationship they have because of Sunshine Empire's role as a marketing company. Sunshine Empire has a KL branch. Next time when I get the address, I could put it up to let you people go visit it when you are touring KL.<br><br>I heard there are many companies under Empire Group Alliance and NTI is just one of the company. I find it strange that you people show more interest in NTI than all the other companies that JP set up which could be more successful than NTI like Sunshine Empire.<br><br>I read about the Magic Kingdom from this forum and went to ask an NTI fren about it. From what my fren said, this Magic Kingdom is simply a failed venture.  Sounds reasonable since there's always failures in business. Many businesses have failed for various of reasons. The one given here was, the contractors in charge of building the Magic Kingdom ran away with all the money for the project. That's how the business failed. So this is all that I know. I hope it helps.</div></blockquote>Dumb Kid. When you make more money than me then come and talk lah. Otherwise don't regurgitate all the nonsense they feed you. Sunshine Empire 28 years old? You must be living in another dimension. The shell company just started THIS YEAR. Remember to tell us when your great leader pulls out the rug from under you.<br><br>Another thing, you kids may be IT savvy, but when it comes to streetsmarts you kids are nothing. You are just being used to fulfill an empty shell company that will be shut down once they cannot deliver on their promises. Is it that difficult to see?</div>

The reasons given by nti were not contractors issues, but SARS and recession. The investors found out only when they asked the building management (if i am not wrong)<br><br>As for whether the issues has been settled, no verified news.<br><br>The focus was on nti in the beginning. There might be other companies, and yes, nti  is a failure compared to other companies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

It is young. Barely 1 year old. This alone would result in it not being given the rights to do the wireless project in S'pore. Look at Icell, Qmax and Singtel. They are all much older and established. Plus Icell is by Creative, Qmax by Keppel Bank and Singtel no need to mention is very established here. This made sense when they were chosen instead of a young budding company like Emcom even though it may have the capability and technology to undertake the project.<br><br></div></blockquote>Strangely, isnt it Blueengine, not Emcom which is the one bidding for the local wireless?

Some people can grow till 80 yet lose out to some kid in terms of streetwiseness. Look at King Lear. Being of a certain age does not prove they are of certain capability.
