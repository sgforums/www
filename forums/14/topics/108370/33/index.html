            <div class='col-md body'>One of the reason why i think they've failed or sales volume is down is due to becoz they can't keep their words and can't deliver what they've promised n like to twist their words....In sales, if you can't meet the "requirements" above, tendency for you to fail is CONFIRM.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
