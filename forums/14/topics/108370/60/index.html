            <div class='col-md body'>Than i shall not waste any more time on people like you, Just a piece of advice, Grow up, you ain't the secondary school kid playing online games and online forums acting like an adult anymore.<br><br>From the start you were already extremely prejudice againts NTI, when you got nothing to shoot, you start shooting puncuation and my english.. Told you any neutral bystander would be able to tell it.<br><br>Anyway Jia you Laurence, You have been thinking of ways why the industry, ESPECIALLY NTI won't succeed, But people spend 3 years thinking HOW to succeed, Thats why they are driving their BMWs Merc's WRXs and whatever, But you are a lousy SBS Transporter.<br><br>This is not personal attack, i'm just giving advice, Perhaps foruming for this few years have lowered your intellect to a primary school kid, thinking this are all personal attacks.<br><br>Cheers dude, If i leave nti, i will definitely post here too, Its not a confirmed failture when i try, but at least i did try out, I feel its better than placing yourself in front of a moniter "laughing" to yourself and condamning the whole world out there.<br><br>Console yourself that their cars and cash are fake, are dirty (Sour Grapes). I believe you will enjoy doing that, you have been enjoying it for 3 years now i see. Anyway good luck, Lets hope that NTI will fail so you can post in your 100000 Posts "i told you so" Or PRAY AND PRAY HARD</div>
