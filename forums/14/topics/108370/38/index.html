It is obvious that you didn't call the police and you are trying to stop people from calling. And NO, they do not have a clean record just for you information, using their FOCUS system, the police will easily be able to retrieve info regarding this company and add you to the complain/victim list that they are compiling against this company.<br><br>NTI must be real desperate to stop people from filing complaints about them.</div>

The last payout he had was in the beginning of May. I don't know what you were trying to imply? And perhaps calling the NTI office to check with Ms 'Clarise' and Ms Ivy would be better instead of asking them here.

I guess I'm not going to be welcomed here, seeing as how this thread is strongly anti-NTI and I'm an agent in it. And you know, why bother to step into a place when people dislike the likes of people like me? But I have some stuff to share, actually, and yes I set up an account just to post this.<br><br>(no, don't get me wrong. i don't have time to surf forums one. im after all, busy doing my NTI stuff and trying to 'bring up nti'. but i do occasionally find time to surf the net, check email, check websites and even more rarely, breath.)<br><br>One year back, in March 2005 I was asked by my colleague in Takashimaya to join this company in Raffles Place.<br><br>When I was making my decision I decide to go online and search, and sgforums came up. And I read this other thread about NTI (the one where they misspelt NTI as MIT, and if I remember correctly, you guys said Mr Desmond and Mr Jackie were good actors? Or something like that. And how they only exploit young people?).<br><br>And I actually made up my mind to ask for a refund, seeing as how there was all these negative press about it.<br><br>But eventually I didn't. Not because my upline 'psycho' me not to. I didn't even tell anyone I read sgforums.<br><br>I think it was because of what one of the guys said in that thread? Something like 'once you put money in and you can't get refund back...' so I thought since I won't be able to get my refund, then I stay, earn back my capital, and leave lorh.<br><br>So in a way, I have to thank sgforums. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If it weren't for that post, I would have left NTI long ago.<br><br>I guess there will be a dozens people out there now who think that I must have been brainwashed by NTI.<br><br>Well, that's when I think you guys can do better in explaining that.

Don't tell me you guys are the sort also to believe that Katie Holmes was 'brainwashed' by Tom Cruise to have the baby Suri.<br><br>One year ago when I browsed the forums, the issues that came up regularly was 1) NTI is an illegal pyramid scheme; 2) NTI will not last longer than six months; 3) police/CAD will be launching a crackdown on NTI very soon.<br><br>One year later when I decide to revisit this site at the request of my friend, the issues that came up regularly are 1) NTI is an legalised scam; 2) NTI will not last longer than 2 years; 3) CAD/CID will be launching a crackdown on NTI very soon - <strong>oh please!</strong> Find something else to pick on can? Reading the thread became so montonous after a while. I had the vague impression that someone simply paraphased some old posts.<br><br>Some of you might have bad impressions about NTI. I'm not trying to change anyone's point of view. If anything, this is probably a one-off post. Someone out there joined NTI and she didn't die, her friends didn't leave her, her parents and her are still talking, the world didnt collapse, nor did her life sank to new lows.</div>

However, fact does remain that brainwashing (to the point that you seem to be suggesting) remains a controversial and hotly debated question still.<br><br>In any case, I seriously doubt that NTI uses brainwashing. Perhaps you could show us some examples of brainwashing tactics that was deployed by the management? Evidence and paper documents are always the final word, isn't it?<br><br><blockquote>but one disturbing thing, you have based your point on the fact that nti has never been caught</blockquote>Perhaps you have misunderstood my post. My whole point actually, was to share my personal experience and to point out that the questions surrounding NTI now has been debated before. How did you link it to the fact that NTI has never been caught before?<br><br><blockquote>i put forward one question to you - can you prove absolutely, that no prosecution is a proof of legality and ethics, ever in the legal history of singapore? we need absolute, not what ifs</blockquote>It's like asking someone to prove that a student who has never, ever failed a math exam before, is a proof that he is a mathematical genius.<br><br>[Damn, she's sidestepping the question! ]<br><br>No, I can't prove that. If I could, I would be doing my law thesis right now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> But hey, excellent example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_question" rel="nofollow">leading question</a>. =)<br><br>Of course, companies like Adobe Systems has never been prosecuted before too. Does that mean they have unreasonable work ethics? I don't think so.<br><br><blockquote>and if these werent brainwashing that attract large groups of people to your company, mayhap its due to the success of your company?</blockquote>Now this is a tad contradicting. I thought someone mentioned earlier that NTI is going to collapse soon? Or perhaps you were being sarcastic? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>then its not too much to ask you to prove that there are large but not total success stories in your company, by requesting your company to release an audited annual report stating the median, mean and mode income of the agents in your company as required in section two line 5 of the MLM Exclusion Order, which was pointed out by another forumer in another thread?</blockquote>Requesting NTI to release a report... for the benefit of its detractors? That's like Coke releasing its internal report to Pepsi and braying, "HERE; we are legal; we are making profits."<br><br>Now being the small agent I am in NTI, I doubt I have the power to ask for that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Of course, you are welcome to try.</div>

Even if he doesnt represent the whole of  nti, the battle is lost.<br><br>Put it this way, lets just separate, for simplicity sake, everyone into nti and the masses, some include potential agents for the company. Everyone has many choices including choosing your company, other MLM companies or simply doing a job. Your company, has only an aim, to gain profitability. And the only way is to gain through encouraging potential agents or customers.<br><br>And if you read all the success stories of successful people, whose companies live on today, they have few main philosophies, which include earning the trust of each customer and the public. I think they understood the rationale totally, and it serve them well.<br><br>Some companies I came across, went so far as to set up some sort of discplinary boards for expelling errant distributors. You have now one bad weed. No point just explaining about it, coz the harm is being done. Rather, think of how you can deal with errant agents.<br><br></div>
