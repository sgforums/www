            <div class='col-md body'>LOL. Just stay away from ANY MLM. I go down also act want to join and know chio bu. Biggest companies in MLM such as Amway and tupperware disclose their average distributor income less than $90/month despite having billions of sales profit yearly. MLM plan only designed for the one big boss to earn quick cash on other ppl's greed and ignorance. Thats why u see only young ppl in the company.<br><br>U do Retailing in SG cannot earn already due to small market, STILL THINK MLM CAN EARN BIG?<br><br>Normally MLM in sg all open 1 yr+ then wind up or change name to hide their bad mouth past. They always say to recruit, "Give the company 3 months to see results". He is confident 99% of the time newcomer leave during that time. So mlm is like downlines keep changing.<br><br>I can give 50 reason why MLM will LOSE money. But so long to write, just read this 2 passage from head to tail and u understand.<br><br>http://www.quatloos.com/mlm/mlm.htm<br><br>http://www.vandruff.com/mlm.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by IronBandit:</div><div class="quote_body">I have my fair share of MLM a.k.a Pyramid System. I take you all back to 1995-1997 remember No.1 Products. I was quite young at that time and worked part time at a supermarket store earning a few hundred per week.<br><br>One of my idiot friend got me into listern to No.1 product and say about their magnatic bed have improve health functinos and stuff and count myself lucky I bought one thinking it would be good for my mom for health reason. Lucky that was during CNY and they had a rebate lucky draw and I got the $1888 draw and the bed cost was $1280 so lucky me got a bed and $600. (Suckers lost a bed and $600 to me).Being inmuture and easily psychoed I thought I got a good deal. They even gave me a cheapo members card.<br><br>Soon after I got called up for NS and stuff. 2 years down the road when I ORD my officer called me up trying to sell me another bed another company this time round I've got my experience with me and being firm in my decision. No mean No and more over I've one bed already why would I need to buy another one.<br><br>A few months ago I too had another friend that joined BEL AIR and made it... He asked me and brought me to the commonwealth place to listern I find it a baloni and BS. The speaker was a ex-DJ. No doubt his presentation was great but once bitten twice shy. So out of friendship and goodwill i got the cheapest lamp and a liquid... its still full and the lamp is unused.<br><br>Now my brother-in-law is sucked into NTI. Selling women's undergarment (Lu Mi Mi ) which by the way was sold by No.1 Products about a decade ago and where is No.1 product? Gone!!! can't be found anywhere. All these young people have no idea what business is about. Have not even step into working live and want to teach people twice their age about business. My dear brother-in-law... wake up and smell the coffee... have soemone to pay for your university fees go and study and get a good honors grade  don't waste your time at NTI playing know it all and selling undergarment to old women and neglecting your studies. I have to work and pay for my own university studies and study part time so difficult and tired.<br><br>Sorry that was personal... Anyway don't admire the people having office there they are at the top of the food chain. You are at the bottom and always will be. You are working so hard so that these people can fuel their car they drive... sleep on the bed and house they buy.<br><br>Based on their model you need to have at least 20 to 30 generations of downlinks and them to have thier own to be able to have an office there and make those flowery speeches. Think how many people you need to lure into the same boat you sit in and you might not know when the boat may sink<br><br>MLM or Pyramid System companies will always be around. These companies work only on one expect of human nature "GREED" as Money is the root of all evil.<br><br>Think about it, all of these MLM companies be it NTI, No.1 Products, BEL AIR, Amway, always promise a high pay without working just recruit peoplr will do. Nice car. Nice house. Frequent Holidays to the listerners. How many of the people asking you to join have them? Why are they always so eager to "help" you succeed? Cause if you don't join they can't afford their Car...House...Holiday...or their monthly expenses.<br><br>I work in a 8am to 530pm job earning about $3500... I own a car... have platinum cards offer to me by banks but I rejected I only need one for emergencys.<br><br>When I sit down to these people at these talks and psycho session I ask them a few questions<br>1. How long have you been doing this? (some say: 1 year or so)<br>2. Have you achieve a car yet? (Some reply: not yet but I'm getting there)<br>3. I own a car does it mean i'm more successful than you? (Common Replies: Blank Blank try to talk about something else).<br>4. Is your earnings taxable? (Common replies : Blank again)<br>5. If not taxable then in future how I apply for Credit Card? (Replies: Blank Blank again)<br><br>You people that are in MLM Companies and thinking of joining. Listen up: The only way to success is by hard work and a bit of luck. By asking people to invest 14k or 10k or what ever amount pls don't make real investers laugh...<br><br>If you really want to succeed<br>1. Saving 1/10 of your every monthly pay for a year or two.<br>2. Ask people that really succeed to help you invest. ( This is the difficult part so luck play a part to know such people and by saying that I don't mean Jackie "NTI boss" or other MLM boss. I mean those SME bosses you should look at them)<br>3. If not put your savings in bank that money goes in easily and take out very hard.<br>4. Don't be hasty in investing ask for 2nd or 3rd or 4th opinion as many as pos from people in the industry you intend to invest. (E.G. you are not going to as a pork seller if today's fish are fresh and nice right)<br>5. Don't regret if you invest wrongly but you must remember your mistake and learn from it and don't repeat it again.<br>6. But in any case if your investment does come out right make your investment's children(returns) make more childrens and make all these children create more children and make all your children(returns) work for you and in time to come 4-5yrs you will made it.<br><br>Be smart, stay cool you all .<br><br>Cheers<br>IronBandit </div></blockquote>Seems like those in MLM told you about easy work just recruiting is really sucky ~<br><br>Well last time those who invited me to MLM talk all say need to work hard and only hard work will pay.<br><br>Anyway you really had your point as a working professional, but think again not everyone can earn $3500 like you say ~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, Skill Development Fund is solely on its own. Subsidies members on upgrading courses..but do you see any older people upgrading themselves in NTI? Ha... Most of the members are teens... not even in the workforce... So what if NTI is supported by SDF? The target market for NTI is still the weak, desperate, and ignorant (sums up to the young).<br><br>It's useless to tell people not to flame..cos we all know that those die-hard, stoic members will surely defend... so, I'm prepared to get flamed already.
