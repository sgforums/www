            <div class='col-md body'>Hello guys, first timer here. I am posting to seek opinions in dealing with nti but let me give you some backgrd info first.<br><br>I was asked by a fren to go down for some "entreprenership sharing" session this july. Turned up to be a recruiting session and i opened a bronze acct on the spot(pressured). I had no prior knowledge of mlm and nti then.

Under this restructuring taking effect in august, "old" members like me have their BC replaced with an education package priced over 1k SGD. The deal is that members are not allowed to recruit/develop a network unless they have finished the education package and is cleared by a BRM.<br><br>From what i have gather in the forum, refunding is pretty much a lost clause. I am personally inclined that nti operations are not so "transparent" and i have no wish to be an integral part of nti. I need advice on 3 apsects:<br><br>1) I am contemplating to finish up the education package to pick up sth then say goodbye to nti forever. Get my money value back. However, i am afraid of incurring additonal charges and involvement in nti. Should i forego my money and just cut ties completely?<br><br>2) I do not wish to lost my fren who i have deep respect for. Should i get him to read the forum or leave him as it is? He joined this may but is quite a stoic follower...<br><br>3) Anybody was in the old nti courses/training before? Were they of any use/value?( Both negative n positive examples are welcomed) This would faciliate me in making a decision in apsect 1. Lastly, any particular individual/ scheme/ pothole i should be on the watchout for?<br><br>To pple who have spend their time reading my post, i would like to say a big thank you.All comments, questions and suggesitons are welcomed.( Senseless flaming is an exception).<br></div>

It seems to me that you have not learnt anything from NTI yet- still the little boy that your mama knew.<br><br>I cannot comprehend your fear of incurring additional charges and involvement in NTI. At NTI, we seek to provide you with high quality education- skills that you can never hope to learn from any of your geeky school textbooks. Most of our excellent training programmes are included in the education package that you have signed up for. However, some of our best ones come with additional costs- which I assure you, are reasonable- in order to maintain the quality of the courses. The skills that you will learn from these courses will benefit you throughout your life, and reap you profits many times the cost of the course. You will remember this as the best decision that you have ever made in your life. Don't you want to change your life? Rather than attending seminars by Donald Trump and the like (which you apparently are not sophisticated enough to benefit from), we are offering you with a very affordable and viable way to improve yourself.<br><br>Otherwise if you still are not convinced, or think that our premium courses are not applicable to you, you can simply attend only the courses already included in your education package though you will be missing out a lot. But still, there is no cause for fear in incurring additional charges right? Surely you are capable of turning people down if what they are offering do not appeal to you, I hope. </strong></span><br><br>2) I do not wish to lost my fren who i have deep respect for.

He joined this may but is quite a stoic follower...<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong><br>I disagree with your description of your friend as a Â“stoicÂ” follower. At NTI, we are all highly motivated individuals who seek to make the best of our lives. Your friend is very wise in choosing NTI, but you on the other hand, are the indifferent one. As observed from your forum post above, you seem to lack self-confidence but refuse to let NTI help you. You fear too much. Please seek help even if you decide to quit NTI eventually.<br><br>Anyway, by all means, get your friend to read the forum. I am sure that he will further enlighten you as to why all the malicious comments written about NTI Paris are bullshit. </strong></span><br><br>3) Anybody was in the old nti courses/training before?

All you want is for other forum users to echo your opinion that NTI is Â“evilÂ” because you perceive that this will make you feel better. Also, you apparently have a closed mind, but still "ask for advice" so that if anything goes wrong, it will not be your fault.<br><br>I think it is best that you attend the courses and find out for yourself the benefits since you have already paid for it. Hopefully, it will also correct some of the major flaws that you currently manifest because no amount of reading of self-improvement guides in your closet can substitute for the training provided by NTI. </strong></span><br><br>To pple who have spend their time reading my post, i would like to say a big thank you.All comments, questions and suggesitons are welcomed.( Senseless flaming is an exception).<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong><br>Cheers<br>NTI</strong></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear NTI RULEZ,<br>I would like to thank you for spending your time reading my post in detail n spontaneously responding to it. It is always good to hear both side of the dicussion so that a more informed decision is arrived.<br>Personally, i bear no grudges against you and have no clue of your identity.However,i do feel an obligation to respond to your post since it was directed to me. I believe this is basic communicaiton courtesy akin to how pple are expected to establish a 2 way communicaiton in a conversation.<br>So, let go through your points one by one.Your post are in bold.<br><br>1)<strong>Dear owner of an overused nick, my replies are in blue.</strong><br>I believe that every individual should be treated with respect, especially when we do not hold personal grudges nor connections/relations. I think you would accredit yourself better not to start off an conversaiton by pinpointing at my username with the term "overused". It is akin to making fun/insulting a person birthname,an act void of basic courtesy and respect for an individual.Furthermore, i believe my nickname does not come as offensive since it does not constitute of pronfanities neither does it target any particular organization/grp/race/individual.<br><br>2)<strong>I pity you. It seems to me that you have not learnt anything from NTI yet- still the little boy that your mama knew.</strong><br>Once again, your post is void of basic manners and respect for an individual. While it may be true that i have not learn anything from nti, it is not right to labelled me as little boy nor bring my mum into this subject. She is an innocent third party.<br><br>3)<strong>I cannot comprehend your fear of incurring additional charges and involvement in NTI. At NTI, we seek to provide you with high quality education- skills that you can never hope to learn from any of your geeky school textbooks. </strong><br>Fear is a very personal issue. Some pple fear roaches while some have a phobia of swimming. I think that it is only normal to have doubts abt sth that has been given a bad rep. Also, formal education integrate us into society by providing us with knowledge and skills such as basic linguistics and writting. Pls do not undermine its importance by dimissing school textbks as geeky. We should be more appreciative of what formal educaiton has given us. Even Robert Kiyosaki agreed in his bks that it is impt in life to get a formal education.<br><br>4)  <strong>The skills that you will learn from these courses will benefit you throughout your life, and reap you profits many times the cost of the course. You will remember this as the best decision that you have ever made in your life.<br></strong><br>While it is gd to see that you have much confidence in the quality of nti courses. The value that one can reap out of learning differs from individual to individual. It is a huge ASSUMPTION to claim that attending nti courses would be the best decision made in my life.<br><br>5)<strong>Don't you want to change your life? Rather than attending seminars by Donald Trump and the like (which you apparently are not sophisticated enough to benefit from), we are offering you with a very affordable and viable way to improve yourself.</strong><br>Once again, an personal attack on me claiming that i am not sophisticated.<br><br>6)<strong>As observed from your forum post above, you seem to lack self-confidence but refuse to let NTI help you. You fear too much. Please seek help even if you decide to quit NTI eventually. </strong><br>Accurate observation. I am a person who do really fear too much and is low on self confidence. I thank you for giving me sound advice here. I do need to build up on my confidence level.<br><br>7)<strong>I can fill up several pages about the value and usefulness of NTI training but it would be futile since you appear to have already made up your mind about NTI</strong>.<br>If you can really provide us with solid evidence on the usefulness of NTI training, pls seriously do so. I believe it would be very helpful in clearing up the negative connotations that associate with nti here. This would serve nti well in the long run too as new pple that come to this forum would at least get alternative exposure to nti operations/success backed by hard evidence. They would be able to make more informed decision regarding nti.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <strong>Hopefully, it will also correct some of the major flaws that you currently manifest because no amount of reading of self-improvement guides in your closet can substitute for the training provided by NTI. </strong><br>I would appreciate it very much if you spell out my major flaws in specific terms instead of making such a general comment. Also, reading self-improvement guides only reflect that i have a desire to improve n learn. My takeaway from these guides depend on my own learning curve and practical applicaiton frequency.<br>Once again, gd to see that you all have confidence in the course quality. You can highlight nti strengths further by telling us where is nti superior compared to self-improvement guides using specific examples.<br><br>To pple who have spend their time reading my post, i would like to say a big thank you.All comments, questions and suggesitons are welcomed.( Senseless flaming is an exception).Good Day.<br><br></div>
