And you THINK (Ya...u THINK) it's better to explain face to face...but the problem is you din even try to explain here n you THINK by showing up can explain better??? So..."BETTER" 's the word which you've used...so, you're comparing in between things...So, how you know by explaining here is not better than explaining in face to face?<br><br>Perphaps you've no clear understanding of our point of views/stand....Question shld not be why are we avoiding NTI, it shld be "Why shld we face NTI? "<br><br>Back to basic,<br>1) What's the purpose of going down?<br><br>2) Why shld we go down?<br><br>3) You,as a salesperson, are asking us to go down all the way to Shenton just to hear ur explainations instead of going out for sales? Do not try to contradict yourself or anyone else.<br><br>4) You, as a salesperson, are actualli challenging ppl to go down to Shenton way to hear your explainations? Don't be childish...for what i believe, you're not the one who're going to do the explainations and someone else(above you) is going to do it...becoz you've shown what quality you've as a salesperson here, you do not have the confidence n knowledge to explain here...therefore, required ppl to go down to Shenton way, just in case, if any one of you can't deal, an "experienced" colleague's just a stone throw away...

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm former a manager in NTI and i'm very disgusted by the way the company run everything. i feel guilty after cheating my friends to invest so much money into this company... i'm too naive previously... i thought the company is really teaching me to be a businessman..but after i found out the truth.. they are simply using me and my friends to help them earn money. those sweet talks and motivations are simply trying to make me and my friends to fight harder for them. the RSDs are not making alot of money as what the company have projected to us. its all a setup to paint nice picture to lure youngster like us into believing and invested our savings into them. i really feel cheated after finding out the truth.. please, dont follow my footsteps. i feel very sad to lose my friends who are trying hard to get me out of NTI.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
