            <div class='col-md body'>Probably most people who have read/viewed this forum (the 20k+ views, not necessarily those who have posted a reply), sifted through it, and gone through it with a <strong>neutra</strong>l perspective, like me, and are here for one reason:<br><br>They have probably heard of NTI through "word of mouth", heard the 101 reasons why it would work for them, paused to think before expending any commitment/capital, and still have 101 questions in their minds about any possible loopholes, fineprint, or hidden clauses that NTI might have. I've read through practically the whole thread, and what really is valuable are the various experiences had by those who made their experiences heard,<br>and not the flaming, the degratory remarks, etc. (although it's the action that catches the eye, they do not provide any real value).<br><br>I've come to realise those who really do well in NTI belong to 2 categories, either those who are good at talking (salespeople who can twist perspectives to make even the ugliest person sound like the most beautiful) and those who really believe in the system (and have thus been brainwash certified).<br><br>I do not think that NTI is a complete failure, I believe it can work, but it really isn't for everyone, especially me.<br><br>I got to know NTI through a friend, and he was really good at talking me into NTI, he talked about networkingpeoplenetworking, and that I could learn business much easier with NTI. The only reason why I bothered listening<br>was because 1. he was a friend &amp; 2. I had an interest in doing business.<br><br>But I am far from convinced because NTI is a system whereby, if you don't get people into it, it won't work for you. And I could not be bothered to spend so much time convincing others to join NTI, like he did me.<br>If I was really so good at talking, I'd have joined an insurance company or gone to do sales, but I don't have a knack for such things.<br><br>So, he has invited more people to try to convince me, and yes, I'm still sitting on the fence. I hope that those who have had <strong>good or bad experiences </strong>with NTI as managers especially, could come forth and share, to better inform people like me who have clouds of uncertainty hovering above.<br><br>Yes, nothing is guaranteed, no $$/returns are ever guaranteed for those who do not truly believe in something, and even if they do, it doesn't necessarily mean returns as well. There's always 2 sides to a coin...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put it this way, if you feel that you can sleep easy making money by trading in your relationship with friends, being branded as a "fool", "idiot" or simply a bloody sheep by believing that you can strike it rich by following a SYSTEM, by all means go ahead, no one is stopping you. Just remember, your reputation sticks. People will shun you, look down on you and treat you like the pariah of the society for your mere involvement. The question is can you handle it?<br><br>For those looking to become "somebody" or become successful, one word of advice, The only common trait amongst all the successful individuals is that they all do things differently. There is no handbook that guarantees you success.  I never believed that doing what everyone else is doing can bring you success. What's the definition of success? Having loads of cash? Maybe by following the system blindly like herded sheep will get you somewhere. But let's face it, the only time you are going to appear in the papers is between sports and money sections if your entire career's going to be MLM-centric. There are options, it's simply a matter of what you are comfortable doing. Success is not measured by cash it's measured by respect. Oh, of course, at the end of the day, you can just hug your sorry self to sleep saying that everyone else is jealous of your new found wealth.<br><br>Any self respecting entrepreneur will turn his nose up on the low life peddlers doing MLM</div>
