Which means there is always a mountain higher than another!!  Thanks for your generousity for giving me a treat.  Once I gather my facts, I intend to publicize to the Government body as well as the Media.  What I need to do is to copy this website and a writeout, then direct to the particular Government dept to nail them down. Next, I will copy to the Media, Lee Hsieng Loong, Goh Geok Tong or even LKY.  If the particular Government dept is not going to anything, then Media, Lee Hsieng Loong, Goh Geok Tong and LKY is going to ensure that someone head is going to be chop.  So, I make sure they are in deep deep deep trouble!!!  Just like the recent NKF incident, when people complaint, no one is border to care about it.  When it is exploded, then they realised is their mistake to overlook the issue. Likewise, for this case, if there is no one trying to bring them to the Law.  They think they are dream maker. However, I need someone to tell me which is the best Government dept is going to handle this?  Any input from anybody.....</div>

Once I gather my facts, I intend to publicize to the Government body as well as the Media.  What I need to do is to copy this website and a writeout, then direct to the particular Government dept to nail them down. Next, I will copy to the Media, Lee Hsieng Loong, Goh Geok Tong or even LKY.  If the particular Government dept is not going to anything, then Media, Lee Hsieng Loong, Goh Geok Tong and LKY is going to ensure that someone head is going to be chop.  So, I make sure they are in deep deep deep trouble!!!  Just like the recent NKF incident, when people complaint, no one is border to care about it.  When it is exploded, then they realised is their mistake to overlook the issue. Likewise, for this case, if there is no one trying to bring them to the Law.  They think they are dream maker. However, I need someone to tell me which is the best Government dept is going to handle this?  Any input from anybody.....</div></blockquote>hum... ok but how r u going to copy to lee hsieng loong, goh coek tong or lky??? u canot nehow hapi hapi write to them wan meh??? i mean of coz if got ways to bring them down go ahead... but juz dun cause ne prob for the other companies who r innocent... i feel that it unfair for them... ya...
