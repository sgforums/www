Just like NKF,<br>when someone already reported the case, and just because no one want to be named, resulted such an ugly consequences, then the Government admitted is their wrong to intervene the situation.  Exactly, what is going to nti paris as well, until something really happen, then the Government would be alerted, is already too late to blame the Laws and Regulation.  What a pity, still happen in our Society.  Unless someone is willing to sacrifice and pin them down....Otherwise, is a waste of time, just putting up this forum for nothing, talk n talk, just does't make the situation better.  And they are just<br>laughing away with all the hard earned money from the innocent investors.<br>I would appreciate, if you could contribute your knowledge on this matter.<br></div>
