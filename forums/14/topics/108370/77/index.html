That's why I make it a point to find out answer MYSELF from only people near or from the top management.  Rest assure that when my money is at stake, I'll do my share of homework, maybe not as detailed but won't be too far from it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Instead of questioning whether I've done my homework and asking those general questions, why not you just directly raise any points or concern you have towards the project? I may not have all the answers and you maybe able to raise some points which some of us "partners" have not looked into. If you have not been getting your answers, probably you have been looking at the wrong places?  Have you went down for the presentation before? So far we conduct presentations twice a day to people from all sorts of profession at my side and I'm sure the top management there can answer your queries.<br><br>I am from CGM, think i used the wrong word "alliance" up there as we are more of a division under EGA. I do not know if NTI still use those physco tatics to voodoo people into joining them, but I'm sure people in CGM do not do that. We are much smaller group in comparison to NTI and so far I do not know of any punster over our side. Youngster we do have a few, but learning and good attitude is what I see in them.<br><br>Ok, to the insurance and contractual issue, why not you get a copy of the contract or you meet up with me to pass you one, you got any problems with the contract, I'll raise them to give you an answer as best as possible. Insurance wise, which investment that you join, after the company go burst, you'll still get back money and stuffs one? Please share with us here, I thinkI'm quite interested in that sort of company. Since this is call an investment, as in all investments, certain percentage of risks are invovled. Like what I told a financial planner recently, Financial companies are able to give GUARUNTEE returns is because they are established enuough to ABSORB the risk level, not that there is no risk.  If you study financial polices long enough, do you see last time when AIA, Hong Leong, Prudential started out giving GUARUNTEE returns?? All are projected returns only.<br><br>What shares move up without fail? Well, like everyone know, they are not listed, so this is the investment plans that they are offering to the public to invest. The share price goes up with each phase is because as the phase goes, more progress and concret evidence can be seen to prove the credibility of the project, hence they do not need to offer as high a returns as before, and that is to reward those people who believe in the project earlier as compared to those who wait till more things are concret before investing. Opportunity time cost. This is not like our SGX stock market investment, please do not compare.  As for the illogical part, doesn't it make sense that when your comapny expands to more countries, have more members and investors, making more sales, project progress is going on smoothly, the price of your share will rise? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> There maybe alot of financial factors affecting a share price in a stock market, but I stress again, this is an investment project/plan, not a stock market.<br><br>Last but not least, I think it all boils down to personal risk apppetite and investment habits/strategy. I am fine with people feeling not comfortable to take certain risk to join such a project, but not ok with people who tries to condemn it without fully understand the whole thing. The problem here is, whatever we say and write here will have a certain influence over many others hence I feel its only right that we clarify all doubts.<br><br>P.S: I join this project not because I like how NTI works or the people there. I see the project a rare opportunity in an up rising technology revolution and I'm seeing more future development plans from EGA.<br><br>Cheers~!<br></div>

For example, the businessmen who are involved, their credibility, or more importantly their existence. Why would numbers be a significant factor, given large ponzi schemes can cripple a country? Quality over superficial quantity please.<br><br>By discussing in this forum as an NTI investor, you should readily present your case here. If you could not, please refrain from starting discussions. The spirit of discussions is not 'doing it your way only'. If you wish people to hear only when you present live, there is no reason to be here and start a thread to discuss.<br><br>Who is using the NKF to topple the whole boat? If you ask this question, clearly you agreeing with me that your earlier argument is moot. The presence of large number of businessmen mirrors the fact NKF has a board of directors who are equally like those businessmen you mentioned, experienced in the business world. If you use the logic that a large presence of businessmen give a clue to credibility, clearly your argument fails because examples like NKF prove otherwise. Simply said, its not a good logic.<br><br>Do not use keep using a logic that will fail you. If you use specific examples, for example, a group of ex-CAD officers that are hired to monitor your business activities, that is added advantage. Not just a mundane wishy washy reason like a bunch of businessman will surely means your business has some credibility.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am new but this topic seems to be very interesting.<br><br>There is many loop holes behind this investment strategy. By the way, investment scheme required trust company to ensure that the investment is done in a correct manner and also gurantee that the money will be returned but not the initial capital.<br><br>The lack of transperency in investment product seems to be dangerous. Somehow, lots of ppl would say, "no risk no gain". Well, if this happen to be a con job then ppl would say that, " I did not point the gun on your head". Very funny ya....<br><br>In order to secure such aspect, we need to identify the license issued by the government in order for this company to operate in such manner. However, if there is no license required, investing in such company seems to be dangerous. The need of corporate governance is important to ensure the investor's safe returns.<br><br>If there is enough capital generated from other sources of income from one business, why do we need investors to pour in fund. The company has such capabilities to be listed as well. Securing such a large multi million dollar contract can easily get loan from banks. Why private investor when you are able to be join the equity market with many funds pumping in.<br><br>As yourself this question, u may be the front liner in the company and may have already gain the returns. A succesful pyramid scheme always have such advantage for the first mover. Together when all of you have already build such a large network already, who will be the losers at the other end. Those late movers or last to come into this investment scheme. By then, the money will start to absorb and vanish in thin air. It's a pte ltd and nothing is liable if the company bankrupt.<br><br>Swiss cash is already one lesson, there are many more to come but in the end is just the cover lines. Ppl also made money from swiss cash but those who came in late has been con already.<br><br>Please anwer me...i got lot to ask. By the way, I work in Malaysia and deal with the Securities Commission. I know all rules and regulations behind the investment scheme...<br><br></div>

Or vice verus.<br><br>Why not just post here to everybody what you exatly found on the web?

Cos I already have that copy of ACRA which is gotten by paying and have been showing it to anybody I talk to. So I don't understand where the problem is?  Either maybe you can enlighten me? Or vice verus.<br><br>Why not just post here to everybody what you exatly found on the web? Instead of wasting time showing to one person at a time, if shown here I think more people will get to know faster <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway "Save your explaination" is not really a good way to shove away all that information I just shared.  Maybe we can have a nice forum talk base on what we know then to just "Save my explaination"?   I'm standing pretty neutral here cos if there is something which you can convince me then I'll stand by your facts.<br><br>Cheers~!</div></blockquote>the copy of ACRA that you have on hand, is what i have already..<br><br>but what you lack of, is the different type of partners searched in ACRA, your version (the one with the shares one right?)  is only what the management team leave inside the whatever web-site which i got from long ago..which i can't recall...<br><br>nice forum chat...save the trouble, meet up and discuss better..<br><br>saves time, and can clear any doubts and queries one shot rather than waiting for replies..<br><br>ideally like what i shared in another nti thread...<br><br>i offered to meet the other agent in the other nti thread to show him the article on Ponzi Scam Detailed Details..<br><br>Inside it clearly explains what's ponzi scams..which are 90%-almost 100% similar to the scheme and practise that your company is doing currently..<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></span> I'm not here to tee-down your company...but if you want to know more..perhaps you can search the net for more details on ponzi scheme and search more details on your companies' partners rather than depending on what the management pass down to you all..<br><br>if you want, than meet up..<br><br>anybody else are also welcomed..<br>but for nti agents, if it's in a group, subjected to individual basis..coz all too closed up, too defendsive..<br><br>other than that, anybody else from other mlm companies/newbies who wants to know more, are more than welcomed to meet up and i'll share whatever i know with you all..<br><br>don't trust me, trust the facts..</div>
