Customers arent charity donors, they want to know they are paying for products, not to people.<br><br>Already people complain the justification for low price brought by eliminating marketing intermediaries is negated by the need to increase price to pay the levels of distributors. Distributors are stupid if they tell customers this, and its a big marketing no no.<br><br>I would have expect distributors to tell customers that other similar products are no up to standard, fake ones, etc etc but its totally blew my mind off when ranters such as iamnotfailurelikeu insist on having the right to charge their customers more when people can get it for half price.<br><br></div>
