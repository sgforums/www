What is ur definition of right?<br><br>Also, knowing very well the teens are rebellious, proud, not following the right way, what has nti ever done to improve its image?

The only thing i can see from nti is the strategy of character assasination and massive flaming.<br><br>Two things. It point to mismanagement or loss of control on the part of the management.

Please do not suggest any untruth in his story till you and other neutral parties go down there and check. Your company might take legal actions if it wants to, and then post the news here for us to see.<br><br>i mentioned tt i believe in what he say.<br><br>Number two, people argued why MLM is a cheaper alternative to retailing because it eliminate few marketing intermediaries. Thats when product is the focus, and dont make me pull out the section of the law whereby it said income earned in MLM should be based on product seling.<br><br>NTI is not pure mlm. Network marketing n mlm is not totally the same too.<br>i study business law too. but maybe not as comprehensive as u.NTI have products. n there r more n more. furthermore. most mlm companies products are expensive. cuz they need to pay distributors income. for example VE. how much their mattress cost? u should know alot more den me.<br><br>Now, by your last sentence, the retailer is now offering the same products at cheaper price because there is nuthing else along with it. Meaning nti price the products higher because nti do more than products. So what is this extra pricing comes from?<br><br>training .. ppl are paid for training programs.<br><br>Now dont tell me its becos to pay agents along the levels, because that will sound stupid to consumers. Why would they pay extra to finance ur agents in the network?<br><br>That also defeat the basic purpose of MLM, which is to sell products cheaper.<br><br>agents are paid through commission in MLM.. and will increase in percentage when do more sales. NTI do not treat agents as pure consumers.. instead biz partners. thats the difference.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
