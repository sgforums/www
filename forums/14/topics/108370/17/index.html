All those people who give up and complain that NTI is too difficult, scam, etc. You may have a problem with NTI but not with the NM industry right? So have all you guys found another reputable company with leaders to guide you to success to try again? If so, that all my blessings and encouragement to you. If not, then why are you spending so much time in here bellyaching about things?<br><br>There are 3 types of people in this world. People who make things happen, people who watch things happen, and people who go, "what happened?"<br><br>Everybody I have ever recruited into NTI, even if some of them have given up on me or NTI, I also never give up on them. I continue to gain experience so that one day when they need their business accounts or another opportunity again, I can say to them, "here, I've kept your account for you all this time. Part of your network is already built for you."<br><br>I know NTI and people in NTI are not perfect, but instead of whining about things, I want to be someone who makes things happen in NTI, we can change, improve and become better. Because I have ownership of my own business in NTI and it's my responsibility, not James Phangs, not Garry, Desmond or Jackie's responsibility that I make it. Even if I don't make it in NTI, it's not because these people have not helped me, it's because of myself. And with this attitude, I can go to any company in Singapore and I will make it.<br><br>And how I developed this self belief? Through my experience in NTI.<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>
