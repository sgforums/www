            <div class='col-md body'>quote:<br><br>&lt;<br>For those looking to become "somebody" or become successful, one word of advice, The only common trait amongst all the successful individuals is that they all do things differently. There is no handbook that guarantees you success. I never believed that doing what everyone else is doing can bring you success. What's the definition of success? Having loads of cash? Maybe by following the system blindly like herded sheep will get you somewhere. But let's face it, the only time you are going to appear in the papers is between sports and money sections if your entire career's going to be MLM-centric. There are options, it's simply a matter of what you are comfortable doing. Success is not measured by cash it's measured by respect. Oh, of course, at the end of the day, you can just hug your sorry self to sleep saying that everyone else is jealous of your new found wealth.<br><br>Any self respecting entrepreneur will turn his nose up on the low life peddlers doing MLM<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>the_king has probably expressed out some of my thoughts.......though the last sentence nt reallie true??..........well anyway right here i tink it is best if we tell our frenz (who r nt in nti yet, those in nti r "brain washed?", luckily my frenz who r in nti r nt reallie my gd or best frenz, HENG ar!)) abt these nti stuff n tell dem to be careful........do research throughly b4 taking any actions or throw money in..........<br><br>as fer the money part, do u noe dat some pple can reallie give up friendship fer money de lor......surprising right? but den it is the true reality.........as fer the definition of success i agree totally with the_king......n i rmb dat time when i visited nti n the pple dere explain the concept of binary plan, how easy to make money n blah blah blah........dey say " do u wan to succeed in life??......." yeah the concept dey probably trying to put across is dat having money = sucessful.........yeah i agree some famous pple when dey r sucessful, dey hav lots of money.......but rmb, their sucess wasnt easy....look at pple like bill gates, sim wong hoo.....dey hav come a long way n even den, nt many pple r as sucessful as dem even if dey hav equal or more passion den bill gates or sim wong hoo.......<br><br>my conclusion is, tell ur frenz abt it..........advice dem or warn dem such a thing is going arnd n spreading.....dun reallie tell dem nt to do it or wad but den ask dem to judge it fer demselves whether is it right or wrong to do it.....<br><br>&gt;.&lt; juz my two cents worth of view........... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
