            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone,<br><br>I just wanted to share this news for the Vemma lovers. Vemma is in the prestigious " The PhysicianÂ’s Desk Reference (PDRÂ®) " for the second year !<br><br>I don't know if you guys know what it means, but it certainly shows to anyone that this got to be taken seriously.<br><br>What else do you need to be successful in Network Marketing than a good product and a serious company ? Ok, a good comp. plan as well, I agree. Vemma has that as well, but first, first, above all, should come the product.<br>My humble point of view is that the best MLM company with a bad product is just a scam.<br>Now we have the proof, and plus many doctors testimonies, that the product rocks !<br><br>Does the comp. plan works ?<br>Well, you should see what's happening in Europe here. Europe is not known for being a great lover of MLM (a small 2 to 3 % of the economy, perhaps even less) or Food supplement (Europeans still believe their food has enough nutriments) . Yet, Vemma has reached 2 millions revenue in just 2 months after pre-launch ! And the pre-launch was mostly done in Holland, which is a very small country.<br><br>But you know what made me finally believe in this product ? Even so I am working in the alternative health medecine, and even so I can read fantastic articles which make me yawn about Mangosteen, my mother won't fail me ! She got out of depression and lack of energy just after one month of use. Isn't it beautiful ? I have tried all kind of things with her, which most of the time she won't do. But drinking this juice is one of the thing she could do. And here she is, regaining energy.<br>If you don't want to take it for you, give it to your mum !<br><br>Here is the full article about the PDR:<br><br>"The PhysicianÂ’s Desk Reference (PDRÂ®) is a prestigious series of professional, unbiased reference books designed for medical doctors of all specialties. Vemma is proud to announce its appearance in the 2007 Edition of the PDR for Nonprescription Drugs, Dietary Supplements, and Herbs.<br><br>For healthcare professionals seeking up-to-date, credible information about reliable, safe, and healthy supplements that really do their job, the PDR is the most trusted source. Hundreds of thousands of doctors everywhere refer to this volume again and again. This is the second time Vemma has been included in the PDR, and your downline and customers need to know about it!<br><br>The PDR for Nonprescription Drugs, Dietary Supplements, and Herbs can be purchased directly from the publisher at 1-800-678-5689 or PDRbookstore.com. Put it to work at your next Vemma presentation or discussion! "<br><br>To all of you in Vemma: don't listen negativity about this product from frustrated entrepreneurs. I wish you a full Success !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Mat<br><br></div>
