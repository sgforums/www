            <div class='col-md body'>flame is the word<br><br>its getting boring, going thru circuitous route to answer some questions, attacking the integrity of the person instead of arguing against the facts, i mean, it still confound me to find people still employ this strategy<br><br>besides those points, some people dont know what they are saying, for example<br><br>A: Hey, isnt this a pyramid scheme?<br><br>B: Gahmen also pyramid what...<br><br>A: Hey, your business plan look unstable. Are you sure your company can survive?<br><br>B: Do you think Microsoft is going to be around for the next ten years?<br><br>These are some of the nonsensical responses to questions i been hearing abt.<br><br>By the way, many noobs who label me as anti MLMer dont really know me. I do support MLM as a business, and i do talk to <strong>older more experienced</strong>, note the bold, MLMers in this forum, and we do concur on a lot of things, including how lax is the regulations in sg is.<br><br>Remarkably, i do find distributors from medium to bigger sized companies, including Amway, Herbalife, Bel Air etc more mature and more logical to talk to. Its just abt business plan, products and regulations in sg, and also how is it like to do MLM in Malaysia for example.<br><br>Note the difference between the tone of these distributors in this forum, compared to coys like DW, AMH, nti which attracts youngsters mostly, engaging in shady business, going thru mergers and renaming, and worst, coys like asayo which relocate itself from time to time.<br><br>Note the tone of these distributors, its always politics, its always flaming, its always talks abt moral courage and backstabbing<br><br>Buay sian one meh?<br><br></div>
