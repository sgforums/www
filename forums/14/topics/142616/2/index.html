I donÂ’t need to come up with any flawless answers, just those that are relevant to the topic I started and relevent to my own experience in NTI. *chuckles<br><br>And I definitely donÂ’t need anyone to help me out in replying anything. Feel free to bombard away with your questions, maybe we can both learn something in the process.<br><br>So many people have claimed to have negative experiences in NTI, but I have been here for almost 2 years, and my experience has been very positive. Why is that?</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Good day to you, Neutend, thanks for response. Sorry for the late reply, many things to settle today at NTI!<br><br><blockquote><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><br>If you can hold thus long, hold it long, we won't hold againist you. If you have the ability to clear the air, i suppose you can closed us online already. Furthermore, too many people get disgusted in NTI already, so how do you guys clear you air inside? You have conquered the outer space, but not inner space, remember this.<br>------------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>I would like to clarify, my intention is not to get into an argument with anyone in this forum, rather, I am seeking a reconciliation in mindsets. I Definitely do not need to Â‘closeÂ’ anyone online as well. I would just like to ask, who are all the people who claim to be disgusted with NTI and where are they? And what caused these feelings to be so prevalent in this forum?<br><br><blockquote><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br><br>That was a long time okay though, but how you get your positive feelings? Must be heavily physco in the PSC.<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>Define for me, if you will. What do you mean by Â‘psychoÂ’? Have you personally attended the PSC course conducted by my company? How did you feel PsychoÂ’ed? Can you compare it to attending Anthony Robbins Seminars or Neuro Linguistic Programming? IsnÂ’t it true that every organization be it a school or a church or even corporate organizations have their own culture and training courses? So if I attend a training course conducted by a company and leave it feeling more positive than before I went in have I been PsychoÂ’ed?<br><br><blockquote><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Yup, there are ups and downs in the company, because your company is not taking the whole 1st shenton way, it is merely 1st and 22nd floor. Why can you last for so long? All because you are close to the tops, where they have high ablities of brainwashing you, try not to hang around with them for serveral months, you will get a totally different feelings.<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>Again, a need to clarify. Have any of the agents from NTI ever falsely given to you the impression that we took up the entire building? We started in July 2003 in the corner office on the 1st floor and renovations on our 22nd floor office was completed in Nov the same year. Yes, we have premises on the 1st and 22nd floor, who told you we have the whole building?<br>How do you define Â‘close to the topÂ’? Do you mean to say that if I have a close working relationship with the leaders of my company I am Â‘close to the topÂ’? So are you saying there is a group of elitist people at Â‘the topÂ’ of the organizational structure to begin with and no one else can join them? Funny, because I started at the bottom and worked my way up from a normal agent to a high level manager today.<br><br>How do you define Â‘brainwashingÂ’? How do you feel I have been Â‘brainwashedÂ’? Can you elaborate on that?<br><br>If I start or join a business today, then abandon my business partners halfway and Â‘not hang around with them for several monthsÂ’, definitely they will feel differently about me as well, lol.<br><br><blockquote><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Sorry, manager in nti is nothing. MacDonald floor manager's pay is even higher than you, or rather, i open one company myself and give myself a president + CEO, would it be nice? Status really so important? Secondly, yup, you shouldn't be proud of your earning because even RSDs also not earning much, how can you be earning much, this is common sense! Last but not least, your so called benefits is what? Merely scamming and cheating skills, where can you applied in the society? Only NTI.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>So how much is a macdonalds floor manager paid? Because I have downlines who quit the exact jobs you talk about to concentrate on building NTIÂ’s business network full time. So how do you know how much my companyÂ’s Regional Sales Directors are earning? Very strange, since I have a record of every cent I ever earned in NTI.<br><br>Again, I have to ask you to clarify, what scamming or cheating skills do you think I have, or have been used on you? So how much have you been Â‘scammedÂ’ or Â‘cheatedÂ’ by people in my company? Can you clarify, instead of making sweeping statements, since you donÂ’t even know me in person?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>You are a weak person from what you have written. You know you will have your falls and never get it back, but only you choose not to believe it. There is no as a result, no result at all in NTI, just look at your downlines, how many of them have come and go and why? They have found their world is not just NTI, rather never were NTI. Preserverance is the jinx to failure? It depends, if you clutch onto something which has no result, release it, better for and me.<br>-------------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>Of course I am weak, imperfect, and prone to making mistakes. The last I checked, I am a human being, just like everyone else. Have you never made a mistake or had a positive response to making one in your life? People learn from making mistakes, and not from giving up after the first try.<br><br>My strength comes from making more mistakes than anyone else, learning from them, moving on and not repeating them. My mistakes made me stronger, tougher, able to handle objections and rejections. I am where I am in NTI today because I made more mistakes than most other people and hopefully I will continue to make mistakes so I can learn from them. And that is something I have learned to apply to my personal life, not just NTI.<br><br>Definitely I have seen many downlines come and go. IsnÂ’t that a natural attrition progress that is in every organization? LetÂ’s not just talk about NTI. What can a person achieve in life if everything he tries and fails he gives up? How many times did you try to build up your business network in NTI before deciding to Â‘release itÂ’?<br><br>So are you saying that people should only persevere at things that they can succeed at the first time?<br><br>Again, I would ask you to clarify. If there are absolutely NO people in NTI who have a good result, why is our membership growing and our sales increasing everyday?<br><br>Oh, because we are good at scamming.<br><br>Come on, friend. Do you think the average Singaporean is really so dense?<br><br><blockquote><br>-------------------------------------------------------<br><br>You mean even scamming also have professionlism? Best in Technology, best in products, ... ..., Yes! best in education, you are trained scammer, unlike those online low grades scammers, you people worked as a team. A team to analysis your virus (prospect) and find a way to cure them, using whatever means, like injection?<br>-----------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>So we in NTI have perfected scamming into an art form? So may I ask again, how much have you been scammed by people in NTI? A thousand? Two? Or three thousand and above? The process of market segmentation, effective business presentation and closing of sales are scamming techniques?<br><br><blockquote><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br>You definately can hold, you are trained remember? A trained lackey/dog/beast. Who never once thinks for others, only for your own-selfish-self. You can lie to us but not to others, when you closed a prospect, you will be happy not because he joined you, is becasue you can earn money at the same time prove you are great at scamming/presenting. Have you really thought "YES! I have helped that guy to step on his road to success", let me help you answer, no.<br>-----------------------------------------------------<br></blockquote>My friend, I donÂ’t earn THAT much even when you join me, and I think itÂ’s not very nice to call people names. Why this hostility and animosity towards people in my company? Did you really get burnt financially so badly or did the person who recruited you really not help you at all? If I can earn money so easily by scamming or presenting, doesnÂ’t it make more sense for me to go read the Singapore Tattler and scam one of our millionaires before running off somewhere? That way, I only need to do it ONCE and I can retire already, lol. How many people like you must I scam before I can retire?<br><br>And please, donÂ’t put words in my mouth. My answer is definitely Â‘YESÂ’, I have helped my downlines. I have sacrificed my time and put in effort to help them to succeed, not just in making presentations on their behalf, but also in training them in proper business etiquette, confidence building and communication skills.<br><br>Regards</div>

Life can get more valuable striving than waiting....<br><br>"While one keep reading this forum, the other has learnt enough thru the trial and errors in MLM and make it to the TOP!"<br><br>PS: Mr Adminstrator, I really hope for the day this forum is for ppl who are networkers now sharing experiences and insights than many interesting characters who claim they have left the industry sharing their angers.<br><br>Goodnight, the understood and the misunderstood... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

So is this a fact? Or just another rumour to confuse the public? You can check my profile. I can say I'm not a "clone". I joined  sgforums way back more than 2 yrs ago, and I'm a regular reader of many topics, not only this. Just very disappointed at the way this particular forum has turned out to be.

Instead of wasting so much time and energy shooting each other, when I can see most of the things being said are purely emotional and personal insults, and this does not help anybody in any way. Like I said, nothing personal. Cheers!</div>

The very fact that I am in here shows that I am concerned with the number of claims that have been made. I never said that these people were lying. I said that due to the fact that everyone in this forum is using an alternate avatar or persona, it is very easy for anyone to create an account and claim that they were cheated by NTI, right? If there are really so many cases, why have they not come forward to the relevant people or authorities to claim their damages? DoesnÂ’t Singapore have a very fair system of representation for consumers? If NTI really cheated these people of their hard earned money, why have none of them come to NTI to claim their money? Even members of Raffles Town Club can also bring suit against the club when they feel the benefits of the membership were misrepresented.<br><br>And since when did NTI ever ask people to invest in a Batam resort?<br><br>I would never presume to brush off anyone, after all, everyone deserves a fair chance and itÂ’s my belief that anyone can succeed in any networking company in the MLM industry provided you are willing to put in the effort to learn and not give up the moment you hit your first obstacle.

Firstly, may I ask which manager presented to you the idea that it is purely recruitment and not product sales that generates the income for our agents? It is a function of our business plan, that a consumer of NTI products may also take part in our business plan to become not just a comsumer but also a networker, so in essence, when there are more people in your sales team, your income of course rises accordingly. But hear this, once and for all. PRODUCT SALES are the only thing that GENERATES PROFITS and COMMISIONS for our agents.<br><br>(Just stating a point. Not meaning to shout.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Therefore product sales have always been an intergral part of our business plan. It doesn't take much training or explanations to make a product salesman, but it does take some explanation for a new member to understand our business plan, network compensation scheme and percentages of payout.<br><br>NTI earn money because NTI is selling products lor. So simple. The business plan is something extra, because I can just sell you a product and treat you as a customer and leave it at that. But the plan is included as a function of our business so that product consumers and customers can also get benefits from helping us retail our products. Accordingly, if you were purely a customer of NTI and just use our products, you would get benefits as and when you have repeat sales as well.<br><br>No one can guarantee you that a certain company will not close down or meet with difficulties. Even large, established coporations with decades of history may fold up overnight. After all, it only took the actions of one person to break Barings Bank, WorldCom and Enron just to list a few examples.<br><br>What we CAN do is to present to you the road we have travelled as a company and the planning we have for the future, you have to have your own discretion and judge for yourself whether NTI, or VE, or Amway, or Coslab, or any other other company is suitable for you.<br><br>Thanks for your concern and enquiry on the LPS function of our business plan. I am glad to announce that details for the LPS portion of the plan has been finalised and will be starting soon.<br><br>The rest, I would just like to state that time will prove everything.<br><br>regards</div>

Thats to me, brushing off people by suggesting they are clone nicks.<br><br>And two, you guys play on the weakness of your victims, You guys forgot, most of your charges are younglings, not full fledged adults. I have talked to some of these people, and we had peeps going around trying to get their money back. But oh well, to you, its prolly just another claim.<br><br>You forgot that you are a corporation that can use its resources to stamp people down, One good example? Look at the amount of legal threats you guys just dump into this forum. And gosh, most of these people are afraid. Do you realise, among the so many corporate governance issue, only NKF saga was the only one people responded strongly to?<br><br>So dont give me again, this why no people go complain kind of thing.<br><br>You dont check the history of your president do u? I posted on article last year from ST, where his former company NOP International made sales out of resort membership for a resort that wasnt built. I had nti agents coming in to claim his past didnt matter, he change for the better yada yada<br><br>Guess what? That incident was last year, when nti is alredi in operation. I had to spend some time laughing on that too.<br><br>Seriously, some of the stuff u said are repeated, and were already argued over. Let just give you some credit. You post more coherently, but otherwise, you are not clearing doubts.<br><br>Just a note: If you claim the victims are clones, be mindful of the supposed lackeys of yours who posted here.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>I never claim that anyone is false. I just said, if there is a claim, pls verify it instead of shouting in here, "help, help, I've been scammed!"<br><br>And seriously, young people are not as stupid as you make them out to be, ok? I have downlines from all five polytechnics as well as even NUS and NTU. As an additional clause you have to be 18 anyway before you are allowed to sign up as a NTI distributor.<br>---------------------<br>I just sidetrack for a moment ar, cos I can't resist. Who on earth uses the word "Younglings"?! Who talks like that? Oh my GAWD, "Younglings"!, hahaha! I can't believe you used that word. I've only heard that word once in my life in a badly scripted movie! "Younglings"!, Wahahaha I can't tahan! ROFL! "Yes, Master Kenobi, I will teach the younglings the ways of the force, please excuse my Jedi Mind Tricks!!" Ha ha ha ha ha!!!<br><br>(hee hee hee)<br>---------------------<br>Please lar, bro. There are no conspiracy theories lar. What happened to NOP in the past, seriously, I also dunno all the details. But hasn't that issue been settled a long time ago? Since Mr. James Phang is still alright, no one has litigated or brought suit against him, the people who bought the memberships for the club that was not built were refunded also, right?<br><br>And besides, which entrepreneur or businessman in the world have never suffered setbacks or business failures or failed ventures? Are you saying that If I or you or James Phang ever failed even once in our lives, we should go hide in a cave and never try again?<br><br>And please lar, I don't have 'lackeys', or 'dogs', or whatever terms you guys have for people in NTI. Such name calling only shows a lack of maturity. All my guys are people who know how to think, not the mindless "Sales Zombies" or brainwashed masses you make them out to be, ok?<br><br></div>
