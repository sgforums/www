All I am saying is that if there is a claim, it should be made through the proper channels.<br><br>What I cannot condone is people who lack the maturity to do so. Some people will not just complain about NTI, but about any MLM or NM company they come accross when they do not make money at it. Some people are actually those who think that NTI is a place that you can make a quick buck, but when the opposite is true they will complain about the amount of effort they need to put in. Then they push the responsibility from themselves by blaming everything under the sun except themselves. With such an attitude these people will find that they will find it hard to achieve anything noteworthy even if they join another company.<br><br>What have you done for your downlines today?</div>

The image of the company is something that all agents and managers are responsible for. Definitely we want to cultivate a professional image, just as we want to build a successful and productive network. No company in the world will intentionally set out to destroy it's own brand name and image. However, it is a function of this industry that there definitely will be a certain percentage of attrition, meaning that there will always be people who come and go. Some of these people will be content to remain as customers, whereas other people will react extremely negatively. In every business, not just in MLM or NM industry, there will always be a percentage of success and failure.<br><br>It is precisely because of the open concept of NM that sometimes invites con artists or people who out to make a quick buck. NM does not discriminate against age, sex, religion or educational qualifications. Anyone with a few hundred or thousand dollars can take part. That is why in the past there have been pyramid schemes or illegal lotteries, which of course generated large amounts of negative publicity, the fallout of which can still be felt today.<br><br>The 95% to 5% percent example holds true in every business and every industry and every new startup in singapore, not just MLM or NTI. Of course, we in NTI want to strive to have a more global vision of our business, to make NTI part of the global 5%, where every agent can put in honest effort, persevere and achieve a good result, be it personal growth or financial gain. I will also continue to strive to make NTI a better place for everyone to be in.<br><br>I hope that answers your question satisfactorily. I look forward to any more of your questions.<br><br>Trust me, July 2003.<br><br>Regards</div>

Coming from a person who claims to be from NTI and yet you do not even know our RSD Mr Garry Tan as well. You do not even know the sacrifices this man has made for his downlines. I assure you, this man has done more for me and his downlines than you ever will. When I started out as a normal agent in NTI, Mr Garry took me under his wing and not only supported me by teaching me a lot of things, he even made the effort to make presentations on my behalf, even when my appointments were sometimes late at night. When we finished late, he would even send me home. Have anyone ever done that for you? He has made 3 am presentations for his downlines who wanted to introduce their friends working on night shifts. Even when a downline requested that he speak to a relative living in JB, he went. Have you ever done that for anyone?<br><br>This is the practice we pass down to our downlines in Mr Garry's Organisation. Unconditional support for all our new downlines. From what I can see you do not even know Mr Garry in person. You do not even know his life's story. And you do not even know what he went through in his personal life and the challenges he surmounted in order to have the results he has today.<br><br>I am not blowing his trumpet. I have known him for nearly ten years. I have seen him in his ups and downs.

I am pleased to share that more than 100 of our hardworking distributors, agents, managers and even investors in our network will be heading to Genting on a 3 day, 2 night all expenses paid trip to Genting Highlands from the 23rd to 25th of this month. At the same time we will also be celebrating our 2nd year anniversary with a grand dinner there!<br><br>So if this weekend anyone wants to come to NTI please be informed that we will be taking a break for this weekend, contrary to the popular belief that we have scammed a lot of money and run off, lol.<br><br>So if anyone of you in this forum are also making a trip up to Genting around the same time, please note that if you see any of our guys in coats in the casino we are not casino manager ok? Please don't ask us where the toilets are!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I will try to take some pictures and share them when I get back, so see you at the top!</div>

I am who I say I am, and if you donÂ’t believe me, thatÂ’s ok. After all, IÂ’m sure not everyone in this forum believes you are who you portray yourself to be as well, right?<br><br>So together with everything you see nowadays on the internet, just take it with a pinch of salt!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>Read your paragraph five. When you started, you gave the impression you wanted to give objective answers. When i reached para 5, you were already insinuating nti reputation suffers thru backstabbing and flaming, and that you taught your downlines not to flame other companies.<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>I was merely stating that through the postings in this forum, I have seen many posts that claim to be from NTI managers, ex agents, even general members of the public that claim to have been scammed in one way or the other by representatives of NTI. How many of these posts are actually substantiated that is what I would like to know. Like what you said above, Laurence. 20,000 posts in sgforums notwithstanding, what if I were to say that I donÂ’t agree with what you claim yourself to be as well? Can this statement also be applied to say, a person that comes in and claims to have been scammed by my company?<br><br>My company stands on its merits, marketing plan, products and technology. Those are our selling points. In 2 years, I have never once had to criticize other networking companiesÂ’ plans products or agents in order to close my sales. I am disturbed by the fact that many postings in here are more of the flaming variety, many of which are not proven or substantiated.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I am sorry to break your bubbles, but in fact, none of the nti agents that came up to post left us with a good impression, eg, Ms Heat.<br><br>To worsen it, your first post was like many other agents, which like to harp on stuff like backstabbing, flaming and stuff like these. The only exception is, I can read your post.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>IsnÂ’t it a fact that many people have flamed my agents, company, practices etc? To the extent where I have seen some postings that actually talk about having sex with animals or personal attacks. What is the point of that? I mean, letÂ’s just put things in perspective. There is no need to call names.<br><br>Well then, I will have to work extra hard in order to restore the reputation of my company, wonÂ’t I?<br></div></blockquote>You can fool some people all the time, you can fool all people some of the time<br><br>But you cant fool all people at all time<br><br>Unless you change the operations, the fundamentals of your business, and the behaviour of even your top managers, you cant just rely on managing publicity at all.<br><br>By the way, check the original thread, the one wrongly named MIT. The forumers were having largely friendly debate till some of your agents came in, and that was as early as last year January, creating all animal nicks and flaming forumers, without even defending nti.<br><br>Look at your Ms Heat, who barged in. When the argument begins, all she can do, without even saying anything, is to claim all are false claims and that whatever she said, we said its false.<br><br>Hello?? There is not even points to build on in the first place<br><br>Sheesh...<br><br></div>

What I am asking for is not a gag order, just verification of the claims that were made, because there IS a standard of operation in place for the refund of any money gained if NTI agents misrepresented the company. I mean, if really NTI or representatives of NTI cheated anyone, there are proper channels to go to to seek redress, like I said, the law in Singapore heavily favours the consumers as long as they can prove they were unfairly treated.<br><br>I did not go through most of the original threads because I did not like to see discussions degenerate into flame wars. Who started it? Pointing fingers will not help. neither will incohorent, impotent ranting in a public forum.<br><br>It will not help me make my company a better place, neither will it help those people who feel they have been unfairly treated.<br><br>It also helps if people can see both sides of the story and be willing to accept a different POV. How can I have a discussion with anyone if I am only prepared to accept a single point of view, mine?<br><br>And what's up with all the name calling? Is that necessary?<br><br>regards</div></blockquote>i am afraid thats not the case I have been seeing. DSAS and CASe are powerless, and dont use CAD on me. Many commodities trading scams of past have escaped CAD, plus the thorough documentation needed.<br><br>You dont realise why NKF dares to put forward three libel suits against three persons and won, do you? Even though its only proven in the last week that those guys are right after all. Its called bullying, and those three guys have never the chance to investigate NKF thoroughly altho they know abt it. Lack of resources is one thing.<br><br>Perhaps you dont use legal threats to put gag order on anyone, but how you know your guys in other networks dont? Again, let me reiterate, you can again brush it off as another false claims, but doesnt affect me, you guys already had these guys money, so i guess, there is no responsiblity towards customers or ex agents, doesnt it?<br><br>I guess you are already at the top or is there during the early formation of nti. I guess, like other pyramids schemes, the top or the pioneers are the only one who earns. Lucky you.<br><br></div>

My company has refunded people money, what tightfisted refund policy are you talking about?<br><br>Case in point. My company has ever refunded people money AND taken back products from distributors who appealed for refund due to compassionate grounds that he needed the money he used to start the business for a family emergency. That is on record.<br><br>If anything, my company has a way too lenient refund policy. For example's sake, if today you were to buy a handphone from M1 or a laptop from Apple, can you go back to M1 or Apple the next day and ask for a refund based on the fact that 'your mum needs an operation and you need the cash'?<br><br>They would just ask you one question:<br><br>"Is the product sold to you defective in any way?"<br><br>and then show you the door.</div></blockquote>Again, I did say before, disguised pyramids do have products, but as cover up. You dont read what the rest said do you? The focus on selling was not there, and when i was there last time, products selling was not even on the presentation. The recruitment fee of 288 bucks was tied up closely with a set of products, unlike other MLM companies, where registration fee is fixed, and the quantity of products are not fixed, and varies. In the original thread, there were even questions on the products. One guy could get it from Taiwan at half the price. Its strange, because not only the reg fee tied up with the products, you had guys telling peeps how much they earn from the 288, which is based on recruitment. Resales? 50 bucks only each mth. If you do go explore the usual MLM companies, this amt is puny. The only enhancement is get rick quick thru your binary system. The combination of all these factors, make a stange business.<br><br>Abt the refunds, you had ur cases, I had mine. i got PMs and emails telling me otherwise, I had to open a thread to ask for help. Unfortunately, you also have a bunch of people who dont get their money back. Doesnt help for you to cover your eyes.<br><br>No four figure sum? The articles in the ST forum clearly point to this. They were asked to open nth times of 288 bucks account, and they stated they had paid over 1000 bucks worth of accounts.<br><br>If your company focused on products selling, I believe one account, just like other MLM companies will suffice. But instead, you had guys telling these people open four five accounts will enable them to earn money faster, and I explained it in detail in the ORIGINAL thread, go read.<br><br></div>

You are also more liable because now you are attracting people in, to earn a income.<br><br>Its foolish to think you can claim all these, without showing even a shred of evidence. Its even worse, when the evidence you shown, apparently arent convincing enough.<br><br>The issue of corporate governance is so huge nowadays, they even have to open up seminars on business ethics on managers. The Government have their auditors general, who will audit and investigate for wastages. The opening session of Parliament this week deals not only on issue of NKF transparency, but also on wastages in the various government arms.<br><br>Most companies have external auditors who come in to check the company, and if you are ignorant, they dont check on accounts solely. Efficiency of business operations are some of their concerns. Then, certified audited report are sent to AGMs and other stakeholders.<br><br>Pls dont think corporate transparency is not an issue. NKF have the public as their stakeholders ,and they neglected the public thinking the public dont have the right to their internal operations and decision making. See the riot they caused?
