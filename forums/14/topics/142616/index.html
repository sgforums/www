            <div class='col-md body'>Good day to all of you in this forum.<br><br>I have read, with passing interest, some of the topics that have been discussed in this forum, and I have not felt compelled to join in the discussion until now, when I find there is a need to clear the air. Too many people i feel IMHO are getting too emotional when it comes to my company. Firstly, allow me to make several statements :<br><br>1. I am a member of NTIparis. I have been here since the company started in July 2003. I was NOT a 'founding' member of NTI, as I joined in September 2003, 2 months after they started operations at No. 1, Shenton Way. Before joining NTI, I was a total newbie to the MLM business as the last time I stepped into this industry, I did not have a positive experience as well.<br><br>2. Therefore, I consider myself uniquely qualified to speak when it comes to answering questions about my company and it's practices, since I have been here almost from the beginning and have experienced the ups and downs of my network building as well as the differenct changes in NTI that we have gone through together.<br><br>3. I am VERY proud to be in NTIparis, not just because I am currently holding a high lvl manager's position after 1 year and 10 months of effort, neither is it because I have earned a lot of money in this company. It is because of the other intangible benefits I have gained in terms of experience and learning that I have found invaluable to my personal development, since for most of my working adult life before I joined NTI, I made my money only from the 'E' or employees quadrant.<br><br>4. Therefore I have sat on both sides of the fence before and I know what it is like. I have had good times and bad times at NTI as well. Even, I have also had periods of times when I had no sales and no income. But through it all, I was fortunate to have a system of support in my network who encouraged me to persevere and not to give up. As a result, I am where I am today.<br><br>5. I would like to have a discussion with all the members of this forum, to clear the air about my company, because the practice I duplicate to my downlines is not to spend time flaming other companes, because what we should be doing is to increase the level of professionalism of our industry as well as to reduce the amount of infighting and backstabbing among different companies that have caused our collective reputations to suffer.<br><br>6. And yes, I CAN hold my own in a proper conversation with correct grammatical usage and spelling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Once again, good day to all of you here and I look forward to participating in this forum.<br><br>Regards<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Good day to all of you in this forum.</blockquote>Okay, first you should be clear about you purpose and target audience, opening a new topic with the same issue? I do not really see any neccessay of it.<br><br><blockquote>I have read, with passing interest, some of the topics that have been discussed in this forum, and I have not felt compelled to join in the discussion until now, when I find there is a need to clear the air. Too many people i feel IMHO are getting too emotional when it comes to my company. Firstly, allow me to make several statements :</blockquote>If you can hold thus long, hold it long, we won't hold againist you. If you have the ability to clear the air, i suppose you can closed us online already. Furthermore, too many people get disgusted in NTI already, so how do you guys clear you air inside? You have conquered the outer space, but not inner space, remember this.<br><br><blockquote>1. I am a member of NTIparis. I have been here since the company started in July 2003. I was NOT a 'founding' member of NTI, as I joined in September 2003, 2 months after they started operations at No. 1, Shenton Way. Before joining NTI, I was a total newbie to the MLM business as the last time I stepped into this industry, I did not have a positive experience as well.</blockquote>That was a long time okay though, but how you get your positive feelings? Must be heavily physco in the PSC.<br><br><blockquote>2. Therefore, I consider myself uniquely qualified to speak when it comes to answering questions about my company and it's practices, since I have been here almost from the beginning and have experienced the ups and downs of my network building as well as the differenct changes in NTI that we have gone through together.</blockquote>Yup, there are ups and downs in the company, because your company is not taking the whole 1st shenton way, it is merely 1st and 22nd floor. Why can you last for so long? All because you are close to the tops, where they have high ablities of brainwashing you, try not to hang around with them for serveral months, you will get a totally different feelings.<br><br><blockquote>3. I am VERY proud to be in NTIparis, not just because I am currently holding a high lvl manager's position after 1 year and 10 months of effort, neither is it because I have earned a lot of money in this company. It is because of the other intangible benefits I have gained in terms of experience and learning that I have found invaluable to my personal development, since for most of my working adult life before I joined NTI, I made my money only from the 'E' or employees quadrant.</blockquote>Sorry, manager in nti is nothing. MacDonald floor manager's pay is even higher than you, or rather, i open one company myself and give myself a president + CEO, would it be nice? Status really so important? Secondly, yup, you shouldn't be proud of your earning because even RSDs also not earning much, how can you be earning much, this is common sense! Last but not least, your so called benefits is what? Merely scamming and cheating skills, where can you applied in the society? Only NTI.<br><br><blockquote>4. Therefore I have sat on both sides of the fence before and I know what it is like. I have had good times and bad times at NTI as well. Even, I have also had periods of times when I had no sales and no income. But through it all, I was fortunate to have a system of support in my network who encouraged me to persevere and not to give up. As a result, I am where I am today.</blockquote>You are a weak person from what you have written. You know you will have your falls and never get it back, but only you choose not to believe it. There is no as a result, no result at all in NTI, just look at your downlines, how many of them have come and go and why? They have found their world is not just NTI, rather never were NTI. Preserverance is the jinx to failure? It depends, if you clutch onto something which has no result, release it, better for and me.<br><br><blockquote>5. I would like to have a discussion with all the members of this forum, to clear the air about my company, because the practice I duplicate to my downlines is not to spend time flaming other companes, because what we should be doing is to increase the level of professionalism of our industry as well as to reduce the amount of infighting and backstabbing among different companies that have caused our collective reputations to suffer.</blockquote>You mean even scamming also have professionlism? Best in Technology, best in products, ... ..., Yes! best in education, you are trained scammer, unlike  those online low grades scammers, you people worked as a team. A team to analysis your virus (prospect) and find a way to cure them, using whatever means, like injection?<br><br><blockquote>6. And yes, I CAN hold my own in a proper conversation with correct grammatical usage and spelling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></blockquote>You definately can hold, you are trained remember? A trained lackey/dog/beast. Who never once thinks for others, only for your own-selfish-self. You can lie to us but not to others, when you closed a prospect, you will be happy not because he joined you, is becasue you can earn money at the same time prove you are great at scamming/presenting. Have you really thought "YES! I have helped that guy to step on his road  to success", let me help you answer, no.<br><br><blockquote>Once again, good day to all of you here and I look forward to participating in this forum.</blockquote>Look like we got a educated dog to join us, welcome anyway.<br><br><blockquote>Regards</blockquote>Regards back</div>

Of course, different companies, different institutions, you will definitely learn more and more things. Care to share what you have learnt since leaving NTI?

How many of these posts are actually substantiated that is what I would like to know. Like what you said above, Laurence. 20,000 posts in sgforums notwithstanding, what if I were to say that I donÂ’t agree with what you claim yourself to be as well? Can this statement also be applied to say, a person that comes in and claims to have been scammed by my company?<br><br>My company stands on its merits, marketing plan, products and technology.

The proper business practice is to call and make an appointment with a confirmed time and date as well as location. If there are any last minute changes, it is only polite to inform in calling and not in a 3 am posting in this forum. One may not be logged on 24/7 in this forum to catch all the latest updates. Anyway, isnÂ’t it an easier and less convoluted process to just call?<br><br>It may be due to the fact that you are living in a different time zone that caused the first miscommunication.

The very fact that I am in here shows that I am concerned with the number of claims that have been made. I never said that these people were lying. I said that due to the fact that everyone in this forum is using an alternate avatar or persona, it is very easy for anyone to create an account and claim that they were cheated by NTI, right? If there are really so many cases, why have they not come forward to the relevant people or authorities to claim their damages? DoesnÂ’t Singapore have a very fair system of representation for consumers? If NTI really cheated these people of their hard earned money, why have none of them come to NTI to claim their money? Even members of Raffles Town Club can also bring suit against the club when they feel the benefits of the membership were misrepresented.<br><br>And since when did NTI ever ask people to invest in a Batam resort?<br><br>I would never presume to brush off anyone, after all, everyone deserves a fair chance and itÂ’s my belief that anyone can succeed in any networking company in the MLM industry provided you are willing to put in the effort to learn and not give up the moment you hit your first obstacle. LetÂ’s put things in perspective, thereÂ’s no need for any angst.<br><br>regards</div>

Nonetheless, I do the best I can. If I really am cheating people, I wouldnÂ’t even bother to come clear the air in here, for isnÂ’t there a sucker born every minute? Like I asked in my previous post, friend, of course Singaporeans are not gullible! ThatÂ’s why our sales and membership are still increasing! SoÂ…can you answer me, NTI has been around for 2 years now, and our sales and memberships are still increasing. Is that because people in Singapore are stupid, or not?<br><br>Your simplistic example above seems to denote that 5% of the people in NTI have the Â‘brainsÂ’, and the remaining 95% are the Â‘zombiesÂ’.
