The very fact that I am in here shows that I am concerned with the number of claims that have been made. I never said that these people were lying. I said that due to the fact that everyone in this forum is using an alternate avatar or persona, it is very easy for anyone to create an account and claim that they were cheated by NTI, right? If there are really so many cases, why have they not come forward to the relevant people or authorities to claim their damages? DoesnÂ’t Singapore have a very fair system of representation for consumers? If NTI really cheated these people of their hard earned money, why have none of them come to NTI to claim their money? Even members of Raffles Town Club can also bring suit against the club when they feel the benefits of the membership were misrepresented.<br><br>And since when did NTI ever ask people to invest in a Batam resort?<br><br>I would never presume to brush off anyone, after all, everyone deserves a fair chance and itÂ’s my belief that anyone can succeed in any networking company in the MLM industry provided you are willing to put in the effort to learn and not give up the moment you hit your first obstacle. LetÂ’s put things in perspective, thereÂ’s no need for any angst.<br><br>regards </div></blockquote>If not so many people get cheated, why so many people posting? so are you implementing some bo liao people have serveral nick and post online to flame? well, look at other mlm company, why they have so little disgrunted people? okay, think about it again, what did they do to deserve such respect, what their plan is, what products they are selling and what is their injections? compare to your own company. look at your profile and the worksheet yourself. Are those materials made to scam people? Every points there is to brainwash people and force them to find market. what complete your form within one month and get free custom make shirt?<br><br>Because your all are using such schemes who treat people like childish kids and such a untidy made worksheets, people feel more about being scammed by you.<br><br>Anyway, what is called cheating? cheating is to deceive by trickery; swindle. If law can solve such problems, there is no more cheating already. it should be called robbing!</div>

Like I asked in my previous post, friend, of course Singaporeans are not gullible! ThatÂ’s why our sales and membership are still increasing! SoÂ…can you answer me, NTI has been around for 2 years now, and our sales and memberships are still increasing.

So how do you know how much my companyÂ’s Regional Sales Directors are earning? Very strange, since I have a record of every cent I ever earned in NTI. </blockquote>Erm, i am not compare mac donald president's earning with your RSD earnings, not to insult the mac donald's president earnings, because it would be more than a earth to sky between both president's earning. Now, we should talk about you downline earning who have quit mac donald<br><br><blockquote>Again, I have to ask you to clarify, what scamming or cheating skills do you think I have, or have been used on you? So how much have you been Â‘scammedÂ’ or Â‘cheatedÂ’ by people in my company?

The process of Market segmentation, sales presentation and art of closing the sale by analyzing the wants and need of your potential prospects as well as finding out more information about your potential customers, these are all STANDARD business practises that are not unique to NTI, but to every company in the world thats sells or distributes products or services.

Since you are allowed to go home after the business presentation to consider before joining, then who forced you or scammed you into joining? You scammed yourself? Or you cheated yourself into thinking that NTI is a place where you can make a quick buck? And when it turns out that my company needs people who put in good honest effort, that was too much for you?<br><br>And so you are here, in a place where no one can see your face, hiding behind an online persona, jealous of other peoples successes where you have failed, claiming that there is a problem with NTI, with NTI's management, NTI's Boss, NTI's Practices, NTI's products, NTI's Technology, etc.<br><br>In fact, everything about NTI is a problem but there are no problems with you, right?<br><br>Maybe I should reccommend another book to you, "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie. It might do wonders for your personal development. In it, Dale Carnegie states quite clearly, it is a FACT of human nature, that they will NEVER blame themselves for their failures. Just like how you demonstrated quite clearly.<br><br>I have never seen, and if human nature holds to be true, I will never see, a person in this forum who will say, "I failed at NTI and it was my own fault. Because I did not put in the necessary effort but I expected a more than full time result."<br><br>Come on friend. Stop blaming other people for your failures. One School with the Same teachers and the Same principal and the Same test papers and the same system of education will always produce students who score As and Students who score Es. Students who score As will do so because they worked their asses off and studied hard for their tests and assignments. Students who scored Es will do so because they spent their time slacking off and not studying. They will also spend a large amount of time bellyaching about the school being lousy, teachers being lousy, the entire education system is fraught with problems but they themselves have no problems.<br><br>Is the problem with NTI or does the problem lie with you? If the problem is with NTI then why do we have so many people who score As here?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by IamfromNTI:</div><div class="quote_body">Good day to you, thanks for your questions. Firstly, may I ask which manager presented to you the idea that it is purely recruitment and not product sales that generates the income for our agents? It is a function of our business plan, that a consumer of NTI products may also take part in our business plan to become not just a comsumer but also a networker, so in essence, when there are more people in your sales team, your income of course rises accordingly. But hear this, once and for all. PRODUCT SALES are the only thing that GENERATES PROFITS and COMMISIONS for our agents.<br><br>(Just stating a point. Not meaning to shout.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Therefore product sales have always been an intergral part of our business plan. It doesn't take much training or explanations to make a product salesman, but it does take some explanation for a new member to understand our business plan, network compensation scheme and percentages of payout.<br><br>NTI earn money because NTI is selling products lor. So simple. The business plan is something extra, because I can just sell you a product and treat you as a customer and leave it at that. But the plan is included as a function of our business so that product consumers and customers can also get benefits from helping us retail our products. Accordingly, if you were purely a customer of NTI and just use our products, you would get benefits as and when you have repeat sales as well.<br><br>No one can guarantee you that a certain company will not close down or meet with difficulties. Even large, established coporations with decades of history may fold up overnight. After all, it only took the actions of one person to break Barings Bank, WorldCom and Enron just to list a few examples.<br><br>What we CAN do is to present to you the road we have travelled as a company and the planning we have for the future, you have to have your own discretion and judge for yourself whether NTI, or VE, or Amway, or Coslab, or any other other company is suitable for you.<br><br>Thanks for your concern and enquiry on the LPS function of our business plan. I am glad to announce that details for the LPS portion of the plan has been finalised and will be starting soon.<br><br>The rest, I would just like to state that time will prove everything.<br><br>regards</div></blockquote>as i had said, i mean it <strong>SEEMS</strong> to focus on just recruitment and i did not said that the manager presented that it is purely recruitment. but the main doubt is i believe most of the presentation of plans only mention about how to earn by introducing a A and B friends. and it do not mention anything about the products at all. even those if they do mention about those product, i think it only a very brief introduction on them. furthermore, i believe most of nti agents do not have much knowledge on nti products. as it seems that nti do not conduct any sessions to teach their agents about the products. so is products just a "tool" and the plan is the focus?<br><br>i think that nti should increase on their focus on products as well. as i felt that a good mlm company is one that have good biz plan and good products. so nti should really like include product introduction into their training and they really have to increase the way the products is packaged. the boxes that contain the aromatherapy do not even have any design and even name of the product at all.<br><br>anyway. i trying to maintain a neutral stand toward nti. all i wanted is just to cleared the doubt i had.</div>

I have also observed the need for more training so that our agents will be more confident to discuss our company products.<br><br>It will take some time for all the agents in NTI to reach a certain standard but we are in the process of increasing our professionalism now by standardizing our training methods and training content.<br><br>Probably you have not come to NTI for quite a while, because now our packaging for our products is quite well done already.

            <div class='col-md body'>lol. so the packaging improved? i didnt realised. cos i got my products one or two mths ago. and at that time, the aromathrapy thingy was put in blue or purple boxes with no design or name at all. good to know that nti had improved on this.<br><br>and the next time i hoped nti will improved will be presentation of plan. they should mention a bit more about product in their presentation and explained to the prospects the diff between recuritment and nti ways of doing bis. cos i believed most of the people will think nti is jus doing recruitment. it be good to cleared the doubt to the prospects.</div>

Coming from a person who claims to be from NTI and yet you do not even know our RSD Mr Garry Tan as well. You do not even know the sacrifices this man has made for his downlines. I assure you, this man has done more for me and his downlines than you ever will. When I started out as a normal agent in NTI, Mr Garry took me under his wing and not only supported me by teaching me a lot of things, he even made the effort to make presentations on my behalf, even when my appointments were sometimes late at night. When we finished late, he would even send me home. Have anyone ever done that for you? He has made 3 am presentations for his downlines who wanted to introduce their friends working on night shifts. Even when a downline requested that he speak to a relative living in JB, he went. Have you ever done that for anyone?<br><br>This is the practice we pass down to our downlines in Mr Garry's Organisation. Unconditional support for all our new downlines. From what I can see you do not even know Mr Garry in person. You do not even know his life's story. And you do not even know what he went through in his personal life and the challenges he surmounted in order to have the results he has today.<br><br>I am not blowing his trumpet. I have known him for nearly ten years. I have seen him in his ups and downs. I KNOW him and would trust him a thousand times more than any of the faceless individuals in here who do not even have the courage to back up their statements and only hide behind a veil of annonimity to criticise.<br><br>regards</div>
