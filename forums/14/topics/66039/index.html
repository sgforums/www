            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, after reading all the threads on MLM in this forum, I keep asking myself why people want to join MLM?<br><br>I've personally joined a couple of them for a short period of time and understand how the "Leaders" psycho the newbies to work for passive incomes, which in turn make these leaders more money lah.<br><br>Ok brief reason why i joined MLM companies:<br>I used to work as a sales person in an exhibition, my then boss was a real good one, he was willing to teach what he knows to us staffs. At the end of the exhibiton, he advised me to join a good MLM company to learn how to communicate with people because all successful businessmen relied on "partners" to make them rich. So i listened to him and got myself into my first MLM company, which was a direct selling one. What i learned was how to sell a product. And how to treat your customers as your friend and not your enemy, no use pressurizing the sh-it out of them to buy from you, talk to them the way you would like to be talked to, I'm sure no one likes the feeling of being pressurized to buy something (Looks at <strong>AMH</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ).<br><br>Now my personal opinion on all these MLM thing is that don't join a MLM company for life, instead if you really have to be involved in the MLM industry, start one your own. Because no matter how much money you are earning as a member of the company, it's always the "LONG TOU LAO DA" or the owner of the company that earns the most. No matter how hard you work, your BOSS is always going to earn the most.<br><br>Just my humble opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Basically the idea of bringing your friends down to that COFFEESHOP which serves digusting food before informing them is a good idea, but this move is executed poorly by the members of AMH lah...<br>Reason is:<br>I wasn't given the option to back out by my friend, I wasn't <strong>asked </strong> whether i wanted to go up and take a look... instead, i <strong>told</strong> to go up and take a look.<br><br>After listening to all the sh-it, I was <strong>told</strong> to buy the "dilam" so that i can start recruiting members immediatly. I realised something wrong liao, and said to him that i'll like to sell the "dilam" but not buy the dilam. Then he said everyone in the company buy the "dilam" first then go out sell/recruit, I counter back by saying: "I don't like to do things the normal way, I like to create my own way." Then I think his attitude change liao, immediatly give me the application form to join the company, I signed and left (Have to give him face mah)... But i didn't buy the "dilam"... untill today, he still never call me... hahahaha.<br><br>So where does the problem lies? I think that the problem lies in the company's system, it's a system that breeds greed. Everyone has greed, including me myself. But when greed grows to a higher level, people succumb to it's power. Just like those at AMH, they have reached a level where even friendship ranks second. I have a simple equation of greed, "GREED= <strong>FEAR</strong> OF NO MONEY".

Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies. Jus take a look at the newspaper for the past one month, alot of articles is focusing on NETWORK MARKETING, and they also teaches us how to prevent from bad companies. if u wan to know, read the straits times forum on MLM and chinese lianhezhaobao on last sunday 18/01/04.<br><br>Most imptly, its not the money that counts. Some need money as their motivation, some need cars as their motivation, some need to sit down relax doing nothing to get money.. but there are some here to know more new friends, some here to learn the skills tat a real networker can attain eg public speaking and communication skills, and some here to gain general knowledge since it is an industry with people from all works of life.<br><br>jus my 3 cents worth of comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, edwinSSM.<br><br>Very good remarks, I would say so myself. I have the very same thoughts, when I was asked to listen to presentation with the feeling of being obligated to join and to purchase an RO Water system. I would say I have nothing good to say about any MLM company and many I joined out of obligation or just to get them off my back, just completely not interest in selling.<br><br>It was until 7 months back, I was again approach to a presentation, only after running out of excuses (believe me, this guy is a very persistant), I went. The whole business concept change my negative impression of MLM. I hate selling products but this company have products but we only have to promote the business. I understand some business are not meant for some people, not everyone will be successful.<br><br>I believe that you have not seen the right MLM company or timing is not right.
