My friend's sadly one of the examples I could give. He seem a very humble guy on the outside because he's friendly towards people, helpful and cheerful always.

But it seem to me that Multi-level marketing has been over-emphasising on achieving cars, etc that makes people overambitious and hence show the true colours of mankind. That we can do everything to all extents to achieve what we want.<br><br>And there are higher-level managers who would try to "encourage" or force their downlines to sell stuff to let them earn more money when they were previously good to them when they train them.

That's bullcrap. Politics will exist anywhere, from school to work to business. It's how you deal with it.<br><br>Greed- As long as the desire for more money exists, there will be greed. I won't say it's bad to be greedy for money. After, it's only human to want more as part of the Maslow Hierachy of needs. As long as you don't take the greed too far and impose on others, that's fine.<br><br>Overloading- that's a flaw of the company or distributors promoting overloading.<br><br>Relationship issues- This depends on your people skills and level of maturity with people.

Does money paid<br>Insurance people focus more on products which I believe works because they are covering a basic risk factor. And they encourage savings which helps in financial education. People are so concerned about money but they do not want to learn about money. Investment-linked products? This depends on the agent himself if he is proficient in his skills and knowledge in recommending different types of investment schemes. The main interest is in the consumer, not his pockets. Again, when we hear news of agents hard-selling, is it  because the industry is at fault or is the agent at fault here? Is he displaying a quality level of Professionalism and workrate here?<br><br>doko</div>

All these people are just ur regular sales person you see in every departmental store... they are not doing business. They have absolutely no business training at all!</div></blockquote>How do you train in business. School and education institution only teach you how to do biz, the training are most unlikely to be in schools. They teach you how to do it, not train you... Schools are more theory than practise... In the biz world, practical overcome theories...<br><br>Some youngsters do mature, not all but some... You can't say all below 18 are kids and not suitable in biz. Sir Richard Branson was a CEO when he was 17. So, is he a kid... Definitely not, he's a billionaire now... Since you can start young, why not? But I do admit that most of those youngsters do act big... But not all... So, it's very unfair to say all below 18 are kids and shouldn't have an enterpreneur mindset.<br><br><blockquote>Seeing yourself as you want to be is the key to personal growth. </blockquote><blockquote>The world's best reformers are those who begin on themselves</blockquote></div>

But not too young... i believe 16 and above is reasonable coz they already started thinking for themselves... Maybe not all, but at least some of them do...

Strangely, if labour would be limited because education is paramount, why should they be allowed to do business (as if MLM is a seriously a 100% business). From many perspectives, its double standards, it hampers business demand for labour which the govenrment would not dare to stand by and do nothing.<br><br>So far, from experience, it seems a signficant number of young MLMers cannot handle it. We should also factor in the fact that due to societal change, we are facing increasing pre marital issues, teenage crimes and all that.<br><br>Note also, if you do study law, you will appreciate the fact the law prevents, rather than expound some affirmative action. ie, the law would not tell you to be a good citizen, pick up litter and so on, but its a preventive measure, fro example, not to kill, not to litter, not to steal.<br><br>Once you understand this perspective, you will understand that the law and regulations is a net that will not allow bad apples to go through, and if they have to do that, they do it across the board.<br><br>So this thing about unfair and all that, will have to be put off till they are of age.<br>I kind of agree if there is a law that prevent below 18 or so to get into MLM schemes, prevent the rotten apples from coming out.<br><br></div>
