Since I can't let you look in another view, or you choose not to look.<br><br>Whether it is a poor analogy is not up to us to determine, its for those who read this to determine themselve, same as whether they understand what i mean in my replies and why i use those examples too.<br><br>Evidence shows that alot people indeed make money in MLM (I never say millions), and of cos alot never make money, but why people just mention about how people in MLM failed and not succeed?  Anyway i guess most people just choose to look things in their own view and angle.<br><br>Anyway i usually don't say this to too much people esp teen as they wun really understand all these theroies too.  I was just thinking that lau is quite knowledgable in such matters, thats why i share with you my thoughts and views.<br><br>Since you think that what we are talking is not suitable to use for MLM then we should not continue with it.<br><br>Still the same conclusion, lets wait and see will MLM ends or last.<br><br>Lastly no flaming here please.</div>

MLM, like any sales line, is all about experience. But it's about experience in dealing with people and the pay plans, how you play the game to succeed in this business.<br><br>However, I think the correct word should be used for criticism. Criticisms don't arise for nothing. MLM has been very heavily criticised, bordering on the thin line between selling products and pure recruitment and/or front-loading.<br><br>Take note: MLM has been officially in existence for over 60 years since its inception in the US. A university has even designed a course for MLM wannabes. I believe more than enough study and analysis has been done. Till today, MLM is still under the trouble of the law. What we see today is just a variation of different pay plans and how the game is played. But the essential model is still there. You still need people under your downline to build your business.<br><br>What the MLMers failed to realise is how to address those criticisms. People don't criticise for nothing. And those criticisms are not answered which pissed people off. That's what people with Ph D are for. They are analysing the model and criticising it. If MLMers can give solid answers with substantial evidence to back up their statements, they can blow those critics off.<br><br>Furthermore, people see MLM as the ideal alternative career path to a good life. But do we know what happens behind closed doors? Who created those top dogs in the company? Did the company pay those leaders and groom them to create an image of success to attract people? After all, MLM is about marketing a brand or company. MLMs thrive on distributorships.<br><br>I know there are people who are being artificially groomed. They have let out their secrets.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree<br><br>which is why I said MLM must evolve to achieve at the very least the reputation of insurance companies, which used to have image and fundamental issues MLM is facing now<br><br>In reality, i do not foresee any system, be it economic systems like capitalism or communism, or micro ones like MLM could resolve (note: not eliminate) social issues like the harsh corporate working environment, low pay, income disparity etc in the society. I mean currently, unless somebody is innovative enough.<br><br>They claim, but somehow they cannot resolve or tend to neglect human aspect in systems. You can never have a system, say its perfect and blame human fallibility when its under criticisms.

They are the ones who are dissatisfied that MLM can do what it claim to do. The things is that researchers sometimes come up with models or stats which are very compelling and practical. Even businessmen inadvertently create models themselves, such as Motorola with its Six Sigma program and being copied or adapted by others, or the latest Blue Ocean Strategy created by the peeps at Insead.<br><br>People always mistake these as academic, but they are simply tools used by entrepeneurs. So what MLMers need to do is to show compelling evidence that they are right.<br><br>In the context of this forum, i dont expect people to throw urls to show support for or against MLM, but for the love of god its annoying when they get wishy washy, philosophical about MLM<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its only propaganda for the uplines to totally brainwash their downlines, because ultimately, you want to wash your hands off selling the products yourself and still keep money rolling in. By brain-washing the downlines they also prevent them from backing out.<br><br>In fact, the recent increase of teenage multi-level marketers only means one thing. i.e increase of income for the uplines<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because seduced by the thought of being an upline ( yep, Venture Era )<br><br>1 , 3 , 5 , 7 then 9<br><br>are the numbers needed to earn each promotion and once the first sales, you get to get downlines.<br><br>The adverse effect on these teenagers is that, how many people are willing to spend almost S$2000 to buy water? Which we have been drinking for ALL of our lives without having any problem with it.<br><br>These teenagers, therefore, turn to their own family members and from then on, they realise they have no other clients, hence stuck in between the company ladder.<br><br>Who are you, a 16 year old to advise me, a 50 year old on health?<br><br>However, they implemented a 21 years-old age restriction, where the last batch of downlines were my friends, who have backed out after my reality check with them<br></div>
