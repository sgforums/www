            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone.<br><br>Who knows. We can never predict our future. Who knows we may be gone the next day so treasure our time well.<br><br>No doubt, I do agree that multi-level marketing can either mould a person into someone better or into someone who's more rotten, but it shall depend on the mindset a person has. Whether he's there solely for money, to learn, or to benefit others out from it. But still I believe that there are other better alternatives out there to learn than venturing yourself into multi-level marketing.<br><br>Yes. Multi-level Marketing can indeed show a person's true colours. My friend's sadly one of the examples I could give. He seem a very humble guy on the outside because he's friendly towards people, helpful and cheerful always. However deep down inside, he has that overambitious mentality that he wants to achieve more $$$ by trying to convince people to buy his products vigorously so that he can reach his marketing manager position by end of the year, etc.<br><br>Everyone have ambitions, be it good or bad. But it seem to me that Multi-level marketing has been over-emphasising on achieving cars, etc that makes people overambitious and hence show the true colours of mankind. That we can do everything to all extents to achieve what we want.<br><br>And there are higher-level managers who would try to "encourage" or force their downlines to sell stuff to let them earn more money when they were previously good to them when they train them. So isnt that true colours exposed?</div>
