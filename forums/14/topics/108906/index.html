            <div class='col-md body'>I remembered seeing Astral Mag being accepted into DSAS membership. Here's the company's DSAS membership link :<br><br><a href="http://www.astralmag.com/dsas.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astralmag.com/dsas.htm</a><br><br>Then just a few days ago, I was checking the DSAS members &amp; Astral Mag is no longer there....<br><br><a href="http://www.dsas.org.sg/dsas/Html/afterlogin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsas.org.sg/dsas/Html/afterlogin.htm</a><br><br>Does it mean DSAS has found problems with Astral Mag &amp; withdrew its membership?<br><br>I been to Astral Mag's office sometime back in August 2004 &amp; it felt like a cult group....one thing I hated is the stupid salesman who keep on emphasising health &amp; wealth in his sales pitch...as well as this girl who said education is not important..come on if education is not important, then how come the government is emphasising so strongly on education?</div>

AMH is well known for hard pressure selling and preying on many teens, making them sell 1000++ worth of useless mattress, causing hardships in many ways for many of them.<br><br>I was disappointed when coys like AMH manage to get into DSAS. And DSAS is powerless org like CASE.</div>
