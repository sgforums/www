            <div class='col-md body'>ALAN MOK RSD:<br><br>Graduated Graduated from Switzerland and United Kingdom with two bachelor degree, I thought that my future will soar from then onwards, only to realize that is not true. It was then that I find that success does not depend on my academic qualification. It was only when I met my international president, Mr James Phang which had since ignited my desires and faith that I found myself once again that life is exciting. His vision and philosophy had so much impact on me that I climb up to the position of RSD.<br><br>Never in my slightest thought that I could be driving a BMW 5 series today. Never had I think that I could be earning 5 figure income in such short period of time. I want to thank our International President for setting up Niutrend International which created a lot of opportunities for young people who aspire to be entrepreneur. I also want to thank my family for giving me support all this while and also all my downlines for their belief in me.<br><br>Niutrend International is the only Network Marketing company in the world that offers such great opportunity for anyone who wants to be successful. The IT infrastructure is so advanced that it will create a new leading trend and trend setter in this industry. The culture and educational activities have also help a lot people to have exponential growth in their life.<br><br>JACKIE HOO RSD:<br><br>Like many typical teenagers, I always have a dream that one day I would be able to achieve big things, thus since I was in my secondary years, I already was trying out all kind of jobs from waiter to setting up pasar malam stalls. But I don't seem to have any idea of how to strike it up from a nobody to a SOMEBODY . My life changed during my NS days when I got to know about Network Marketing because I finally found a perfect platform for me to build my dreams.<br>With a new-found passion and the valuable guidance by our International President Mr. James Phang, I put in all my efforts into this business which not only can bring financial freedom and accelerated personal development. Life never became the same again as especially during my NUS days; I had to learn to manage both studies and career together.<br><br>Fortunately in NTI, there was an effective and easy-to-learn system for everyone whether you are partime or fulltime. Together with lots of guidance and support from the company and wonderful friends I found there, I've became a director within a year and bought my first car.<br><br>It is true that this route had been a rough and tough one, but for anyone who is sick of being that little figure all their life, NTI is probably the best opportunity for you to grow BIG!!!<br><br>GARRY TAN RSD:<br><br>With the unstable economic situation in the world, many people feel lost and frustrated. This is how I felt 8 years ago, and that was how I ended up with signing on as a naval specialist during my Polytechnic studies. Just like any other youngsters, I was full of dreams and passion when I finished my studies. But when I stepped into the big organization, I found that things are not what I expected. As I strived hard in my career, I found that there is no potential advancement. Whatever I do, I will do my best, but in the end, it was my superiors who claimed the credits. When you are an employee, it is just about you and your job. You do not have the opportunity to reflect on yourself and develop into a better person. For me, I used to be fixed into a certain category and I lacked the skills to communicate with people on a higher level of authority. Therefore I started to seek for a better opportunity for my future.<br><br>Under miraculous opportunity, I got to know about this marvelous Network Marketing Company, Niutrend International Pte Ltd , through our International President Mr James Phang. If you wish to succeed in network marketing, you cannot just rely on one person's efforts. Whether or not a group is formed depends on how big you want your success to be. Before our group is formed, we have already implanted the central idea of Â“ selfless contribution for the group, sincerity to help associates succeed Â”, because Â“selflessnessÂ” and Â“sincerityÂ” are the very cornerstones for the formation of a group. I strived to learn and took every setback as a step forward. With my persistence and hard work, I gained valuable experience as I built up my network.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Check out the above lies.

            <div class='col-md body'>If u wan to compare the size of the company, of cos it will lose to belair ... but the aromatherpy wise is the same ... i think nti is more to promote their products by using their marketing plan, rather than purely selling products ... becos most are young pple, thats why sometimes they will act very harsh towards their customer (&amp; frens), but i guess its just becos of their training is not enough ... U guys should not compare 2 diff mlm companys when u dunno much abt them ... becos they are working under diff system, mgt as well as products ... i guess some black sheep in NTI indeed went very extreme to do their biz ... but frankly not everyone in it is the same ...<br><br>As for the IT, i think is the real-time online system, which will let u get ur commission straight after ur transaction is done ... the commission is calculated in daily, weekly and monthly basis ... And all transaction can be done online ... even if u nv go down to the office in shenton way ... as long as they delivery the products to u ...<br><br>But franky they really concentrate too much in promoting the plan rather than products .. which is why so many pple joining it, ended quiting without earning any cents ... their products training is oso not much ... hai ... wat a pity ...</div>

By the way, if u guys been noticing all those nti agents in this forum, except for short para from iluvnti which say, but not describe, that nti do sell products, 99% of their post (except for the flaming ones) concentrate on murky description of great network marketing plans and systems. And NONE describe whats all this 'investment opportunity' abt.<br><br>Even the notorious AMH do emphasise products selling, and will even boast the quality and effectiveness of their products. nti?<br><br>And i disagree with what legacyman said abt nti focusing on marketing plan rather than quality products. So its safe to say nti products arent comparable with other companies, and they rely on marketing plan - ie, get rich quick scheme - to cover this weakness?<br><br>Well, you may say that i am old in thinking, but i do subscribe to the fact quality products last, not marketing plan.
