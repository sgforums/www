            <div class='col-md body'>Hi sanctuary, great to see u ard.<br><br>While its great you place emphasis on legality here, bear in mind a great number of people here, besides the MLM haters, are ex agents or vicitms of a few companies.<br><br>Already they are quite dissatisfied with certain matters, i think if there is a sole emphasis on just to what extent the words of these people are legal, i think marketing as a subject has failed.<br><br>I was hoping these companies would come up to give point to point rebuttal on why these things are not what people perceived.<br><br>I see big threads like on AMH or DW that have quite a lot of agitated ex agents.<br><br>But if you notice, many agents that came up to defend has not done much to appease the other side. The point is to win these people over, not standin around accusing the ex agents of backstabbing and such.<br><br>Its like stabbing oneself in the foot. Seriously, MLM industry has gain negative reactions since the changes to the MLM Act made five years ago, and i dont see any improvement in the industry to try to win people over.<br><br></div>

They only 1) flame. 2) dislike people talking about nti, but never provides valid points to defend it. 3) chit chat and insults others.<br><br>frankly speaking if you gals continue like this, not only it won't help your company, it will even worsen it's reputation. why? because they thought nti beg some low level thinking people to post something here. where there is no more clever chap anymore. we always thought nti has a good educational system, but it teaches something worst than kindergarden. so for you own company sake, cease lar.. hor? or post something useful please</div>
