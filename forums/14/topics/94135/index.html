(unless you chose to sell the pre-paid cards).  So I guess that if I tell others how good something is, I don't mind getting rewarded for it right ?  I'm happily using the service myself.  I get good service and most of all I get the itemised billing every month without extra charge.  A plus to service added value.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Sebbie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh.  1 more thing.  You get extra 5% off your total bill every month too.<br><br><strong>Let me give a scenario for a corporate company.</strong><br><br>If your company spends S$1200 on local phone calls on air-time alone.<br><br>1200 / 0.1575 that about 7619 minutes.<br><br>Now if your company is using the callback service at 5cents per minute Taking the same number of minutes.<br><br>7619 x 0.05 = $380.95 - 5% off total bill = $19.05<br>Actual amount payable is $361.9<br><br>Savings of $838.1 or about 69% savings.<br><br><strong>At another angle.  If you count the minutes you talk on your mobile actual outgoing against using the callback service.</strong><br><br>Without callback<br>60 minutes x 0.1575= $9.45<br>30 minutes x 0.1575= $4.73<br>15 minutes x 0.1575= $2.36<br><br>With Callback<br>60 minutes x 0.05 = $3.00<br>30 minutes x 0.05 = $1.50<br>15 minutes x 0.05 = $0.75<br><br>Actual per minute minus 5% is really 4.25cents per minute.

Most people that might use, could have already used FutureTel service by now.</blockquote>I'm working on a website (replicatable) for my team to help my members to grow.  I understand that there are already FutureTel members and many are either not working or not using the services.  The time it started until now, they have been marketing mainly IDD.  Only recently they launch their callback service.  In all these years (3 almost) they have about 5,000 members.  So the market is still there.  Not everyone use IDD but for local callback there will be.<br><br><blockquote><br>Also, according to your statement, we only earn based on their usage.

In my calculation above, you can see the savings even if you call for 15 minutes. How many '15 minutes' in a month of call does one make ? You're never too sure right ?<br>Furthermore, with no subscriptions, no maintenance, signing up won't hurt your pocket.  If they don't want to use, don't use.  There's no penalty for not using.  Coupled with my personal strategy of making the whole thing viral through my website. I am positive that we can get the numbers.<br><br><blockquote>With so many callback MLM businesses out there competing, unless your commissions are relatively attractive, else I can't really convince myself to sign up with you.<br><br>A monthly maintenance is still important for a constant monthly income. IMHO.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </blockquote>In any MLM, one has to be consistent and persever.  Yes, there's no upfront money to earn as you're earning from the usage only. You'd need also to understand the compensation plan fully in order to strategise and profit.<br><br>FutureTel is long term and they are much bigger then either WABS or OSMS, at least close to YTC networks to some respect.  They hold the technology and capability. And besides, they are also coming up with an international plan but not just yet.  Just like other mlm plans example tupperware, k-link etc they don't have maintenance, these are a mix of direct selling, party plan and MLM selling.   Tupperware for one, has been around for decades and they have many fervent supporters.  I would rather join a stable company with the technology and vision that is long term not just hit and run.<br>In my past experience with the other callback MLM, my team achieved over 2000 members (one of the biggest group) I see many dropouts and I ask one of the leaders in that team what the reasons are.  He said the reasons are:-<br><br>1.  No callback (technical problem)<br>2.  Inconvenience to topping up time and time again. (will exist as long as it is prepaid)<br>3.  Top up must either go to the office or bother someone to buy cards.<br>4.  Too much time wasted for too little rewards.<br><br>Plus a host of other inconvenences.  For FutureTel, it's 'set and forget' only use first pay later.  Why not ?<br><br>If you need to understand the compensation plan better, I can share it with you over coffee ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Sebbie<br><br></div>

You can go through the entire flow of the sign-up process and generate the form.   Print out and see if all is fine and if you really want to join, just go on further by faxing it over to the number listed on the 'instructions' button together with the photo copy of IC. No fax ? then, mail it to the address can also.<br><br>I would be turning on the rotator co-op script which let's everyone have a good chance of getting sign-ups at their replicated website.
