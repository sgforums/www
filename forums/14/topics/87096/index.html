            <div class='col-md body'>I refer to the letter, Â“DW Group &amp; Eastwing Group Â–My ExperienceÂ”, posted on 04/07/2004 22:19:58. Firstly, I would like to tell everyone that the latter who posted that might be someone I knew, and I find this latter stupid, very contradicting and selfish. IÂ’ll explain why I say so, IÂ’ll not accuse anyone without any solid evidence and logic thinking. First, this latter is stupid becos she cannot differentiate MLM and network marketing. Ppl always have the wrong thinking that ppl up there earns more and ppl below like us have to work like mad to earn that little money. WRONG!!! IÂ’ve seen ppl below them earn more than them, doesnÂ’t mean they donÂ’t see it means itÂ’s not happening. Some months, I do earn more than my mangers. ThatÂ’s the difference. And IÂ’ve seen my ex-boss (Boss of Eastwing Group) work through the nights, worrying not for himself but for others. But what does he get in return? Is ppl like these who jus tarnish their reputation. Yes, they do have cars, so? Ppl in network marketing can have savings, canÂ’t they? They think theyÂ’re suffering and being cheating so theyÂ’re blinded by it, not seeing how the boss is going through. She doesnÂ’t know the truth and chose to take the easy way out that is to Â“blameÂ”. Why? I donÂ’t know. She mentioned Â“I got cheated by the companyÂ”, which is not true. That fact is I was once working for DW-KCG kum Eastwing Group. Though I wasnÂ’t the management ppl there, but I enjoyed my time there. They had never cheated me with anything. What the latter was referring to was the stocks. I admit that there was a bit delay of stocks, but new companies do meet up with their problem, donÂ’t they? But these ppl are selfish enough to blame it all on them. But have they spare a though for those in charge? These ppl are entrepreneurs and for what I know, what they want is to do a honest business. Nobody likes to owe any stock, do they? Problems and crisis in a new company is unavoidable, but these simple minded idiots just donÂ’t understand to the extent that ppl in the ppl have to wait for the matter to settle first then they can stop avoiding those idiots whoÂ’re pushing the stocks like mad dogs.  Next, I think she is contradicting. First she claims that magnetotherapy is Â“an infamous health wise mattressÂ”, and then she mentioned Â“itÂ’s not a scam itÂ’s rather established in other countriesÂ”. From my experience, magnetotherapy is a proven health product in Singapore and some countries out there. It is called the Â“alternate healingÂ”. This is different from medicine, itÂ’s for ppl who somehow cannot take medication or have no time for therapyÂ…this is for them. And that idiot is right for once, it is not a scam. A contradicting person like this, who cannot set her mind straight, how can she even type those things out?!?!?! ItÂ’s very sad to read that latter mention Â“IÂ’m glad I do not possess such surviving skillsÂ”. Poor thing, then you should stay at home to let your parents feed you till youÂ’re old. Cos regardless where you are working, a normal corporate or network marketing company, you DO need such skills. The latter also mentioned they taught us Â“if u canÂ’t convince then confuse otherwise control then conÂ” NOT TRUE!!! What my boss taught me when I was still in KCG was that he said Â“Learn to convince a person honestlyÂ”, weÂ’re not a company that cheatsÂ”Â…I was with the company quite awhile but now im not longer with them not becos of them that I left but was for some personal reasons. My time there was fun and fulfilling. They taught me many things. And when I have problems, theyÂ’ll tide it over with me which I felt very grateful. Though now im working in a normal company that pays me monthly, so what? IÂ’m not happy there, in fact im always missing the ppl in Eastwing. Being paid doesnÂ’t mean happiness. ThereÂ’re ppl who jus wants the money, but thereÂ’re ppl who donÂ’t only jus go for moneyÂ…they go for more, which is like a more challenging things, interest is one. We cannot blame these ppl for going into networking. Frankly speaking, ppl hate networking becos they always being approach to buy, but come on which company doesnÂ’t raise the price to earn money? Does a fried kway teow cos us $3Â….noÂ…..the cost price is not even a dollar, but hey they need to survive. No company sells their product at cost price, unless they really hope to collapse. The high tech sleeping system is expensive becos the production of it is very costlyÂ…Â…thatÂ’s y!!! And not forgetting the medical magnets which are very costly also. I decided to post this letter becos after I read what is posted by the latter I was furious. Though IÂ’m not longer in the company doesnÂ’t mean I can accuse them. What is right is right, wrong is wrong. The things that were mentioned by that latter were 80% false. If im not wrong whoÂ’re these ppl, I can tell u (whoÂ’s reading this) that these ppl donÂ’t have a right character. They only think of themselves. In fact they think very highly of themselves. To me, though im not a high educated person, I think these ppl are jus junks. Being hourly paid or monthly paid to me is nothing. I could have earned more in eastwing. But still I respect those who prefer routine jobs. But why cant these ppl with routine jobs respect ppl in networking? Ppl in Eastwing Group are ppl whoÂ’re kind hearted, they dare to take risk that not everyone care. And the best thing is that they possess very good skills in sales (no cheating, honest business, remember?). Last but not least, I still respect the management team in Eastwing Group. I salute the boss of this company. So ppl out there, please donÂ’t malign them anymore.</div>
