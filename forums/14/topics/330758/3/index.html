              <p>register an account. It's free. On the left side would be where u post your news. Then a reporter will call u the next working day, talk to him/her about it, and the news would be up in few hours.</p>

              <p>the crucial thing is to get a copy of the "contract" there are other people's name on it. if you can contact these people, than together you have a case. if  the people don't exist, than got a possible fraud case (intention to mislead), especially if the handwriting turn out to be cheryl's.</p>
              <p>make a police report so the police have your side of the story, than use the police report to get the contract. STOMP will just post your story, can't do much to help you.</p>

              <p>Same thing happened to my friend before. Can't remember which mlm though, the one at meridien. Anyways he also signed the contract before he turned 18. Checked it out with a lawyer my dad knows and he said if you are under 18 when you sign the contract, it is considered void.</p>
              <p>So don't worry and take this as a lesson not to blindly sign things and not to trust what people say. If VE keeps bugging you just ignore them, nothing much they can do to you.</p>

              <p>I was called by this lady to come down for job interview for a
              company named venture. To my surprise, it was not a job that I
              thought it was. I was told on the phone that it would be conducting
              surveys on the streets. The lady who called me was super friendly.
              It was freaky. Then she started to intro some water products and
              her business plans. It doesnt look like any kind of business to me.
              I wanted to leave, but she persistently insisted that I go for
              their seminar or talk. Being a person that easily gives in to
              people, I went ahead. The event was like 3 hours! I wasted my time
              there. after the event she asked to sign some stuff. I declined,
              but she insisted that it was just an attendance sheet of
              prove for her superior that she is doing her job. The lights
              were dim and having bad eye sight didnt help me either. I pitied
              her so I signed anyways.</p>
              <p>A few days later, this lady called me again and said that it was
              compulsory for me to come down for training and start my business.
              I was like hell! Since when did I signed up for this kind of shit!
              I went to their place in eunos and she showed me the paper that
              i've signed and sayed that since I attended the seminar and signed
              the attendence sheet which was actually an agreement for
              membership, I am obliged to join the company and it is a must for
              me to sell one mattress thingy or one big water thingy in one week.
              The attendence sheet was in a table with other people's name. I am
              not sure if the other names are real or not.</p>
              <p>Is there anyone here who could help me? Can I report to the
              authorities? Is the so called contract considered as valid?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>compulsory for u to start the business -</strong></span> goes to show that the last document which you sign previously was something which they already had in mind to force you to go through their standard negative education of sales.</p>
