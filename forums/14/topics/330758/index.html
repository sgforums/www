              <p>I was called by this lady to come down for job interview for a company named venture. To my surprise, it was not a job that I thought it was. I was told on the phone that it would be conducting surveys on the streets. The lady who called me was super friendly. It was freaky. Then she started to intro some water products and her business plans. It doesnt look like any kind of business to me. I wanted to leave, but she persistently insisted that I go for their seminar or talk. Being a person that easily gives in to people, I went ahead. The event was like 3 hours! I wasted my time there. after the event she asked to sign some stuff. I declined, but she insisted that it was just an attendance sheet of prove for her superior that she is doing her job. The lights were dim and having bad eye sight didnt help me either. I pitied her so I signed anyways.</p>
              <p>A few days later, this lady called me again and said that it was compulsory for me to come down for training and start my business. I was like hell! Since when did I signed up for this kind of shit! I went to their place in eunos and she showed me the paper that i've signed and sayed that since I attended the seminar and signed the attendence sheet which was actually an agreement for membership, I am obliged to join the company and it is a must for me to sell one mattress thingy or one big water thingy in one week. The attendence sheet was in a table with other people's name. I am not sure if the other names are real or not.</p>
              <p>Is there anyone here who could help me? Can I report to the authorities? Is the so called contract considered as valid?</p>

              <p>Can they file a civil suit towards me if i don't obey the contract?</p>
              <p>If I say no to the police, wouldn't that be an offence as it would be making a false statement?</p>
              <p>Couldn't I just tell them that the lady told me one thing and in the end it's another thing? Wouldn't this be considered as cheating? No case?</p>
