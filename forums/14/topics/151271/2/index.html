Scroll up to what I said and that's my reply.<br><br>I'm sorry to say your friends did not upgrade their skills and banks retrenchment is part and parcel of the business world.

You know it's like trying to talk to a smoker about the bad health effects of smoking but the smoker still chooses to smoke. Sad to say that's what I am getting the impression from your posts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It been some time since I last seen a topic worth replying. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well I will like to voice out a few of my optional especially to Cepat.<br><br>1.  I throughly agree the path to a better and successful life lie in upgrading oneself.  However, upgrading doe not necessary mean getting a degree or master or even a PhD.  It does not necessary mean learning new skills.  Upgrading oneself mean more.  It also mean a change in mindset, the way you think and look, a change in lifestyle and many more.  Simply example, you can be a PhD, but ur attitude suck, you cant get along well and work with the rest of the people in the company, then you need to upgrade ur attitude.<br><br>2.  I hope you do understand that I am not saying paper qualification is not important.  It does in giving you a good start, but it does not guarantee a smooth sail in your career or life.  They are many more factors that will determine your success in career and life.  You and I both know that it isnt just as simple and as easy as that.<br><br>3.  If you are currently working maybe you shall ask your supervisior what paper qualification your boss had.  Or ask many more other successful business men/women what their paper qualification are.  From some sucessful business friends and partner I know of many arent even a degree holder and yet many degree holders are working for them.<br><br>4.  Well I believe we have our fair share of meeting unethical businessmen and salemen in our life before.  Some of them are even from well know companies.  That only show us one thing, in any companies and any fields there will always be unethical people doing unethical things.  But it may not be the companies fault.  The main problem lie in these unethical people themselves.  Come on we even have unethical degree employees dont we?<br><br>5.  To round thing up, it doesnt matter whether you are an employee, a businessman or a MLMer.  What really matter is you, yourself.  If success in career and life is so simple and easy like what others have say just get a PhD or just join MLM, then we wont have the 20% of the people is earning 80% of the money rule.  Getting a PhD or join a MLM Company is just one of the step you had taken.  They both lead to the same place but the path there wont be easy and are you ready to walk there with a mindset ready to handle all the problems, failures and storm ahead of you.<br><br>Regards</div>
