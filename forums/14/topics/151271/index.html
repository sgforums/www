            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like so many negative feedback about people who failed in MLM /  even  people in the forum challenging and threatening others in the forum when someone has a different view. ItÂ’s always someone else to blame for someoneÂ’s failure or when someone lost money or that  the industry wont work...etc,etc ... Instead of continuing the rather lengthy threads in some of the topics here, I decided to start a new one, just to state my opinion which may or may not be interesting to some of you... here it goes....<br><br>Has anyone read the latest issue of the free LIFESTYLE magazine given out by NTUC in most housing estate?<br>It featured a Singapore elderly Indian  couple who bought a Beer-made-at-home franchise called High Hops (Page-30)<br>All in they incurred  $150,000 for the business<br>They may make it big from now  or if they fail and give up may they lose everything.<br>If they lost everything who do you think they will blame? If it didÂ’nt work for them, does it mean franchising doesÂ’nt work?  I like the sub-heading when they said Â“ if it works, it works, if it doesnÂ’t, it would have been an adventure for usÂ” Â…. And that summarises the true spirit of enterprise and calculated risk<br>So what difference is this adventure and calculated risk in this franchise and MLM?<br>So, the point is always ask ourself  Â“If something didnÂ’t work, Is it an individual problem or an industry problem?Â”<br><br>Can you now see the similarity with the topic of MLM in this thread. Many complain about someone losing money and all blame it on the 3 letter word , MLM before taking  a good look at the mirror first.<br><br>Seriously, IMO, if you want to really know every aspect of MLM to succeed, go to the US and Canada (where MLM is a recognised profession, talk to the top networkers and see the world through their eyes.<br>And then you will know what it takes to make MLM  a noble profession.<br><br>The trouble I see in the various posting here are people who failed in MLM yet dare to teach others MLM wisdom, or even dare to tell others to get a job instead... etc etc.<br>This forum should be dedicated to people who want to make a success of MLM as an alternative profession to other trades as a means for a better income or a better quality life. No doubt there will be black sheep and good sheeps... thats another topic but lets all learn the good things to be successful and share.<br>If MLM is not for you, please put your time to better use at other forum topics, not here.<br><br>MLM has been in Singapore only 5 years and what many of you understand MLM from "hearsay", "gossips" and what you read in the internet and books. Talk to successful people not only from Singapore but in US, Canada and  Australia or other leading countries (why only listen to those who failed) if you want to do a proper due diligence of the profession and business. Only then will you know what to look for and decide for yourself if there's a match to what the business requires of you and whether you have the qualities for it.<br>If your friend who failed, doesnÂ’t mean the entire MLM is a scam; maybe he didnÂ’t have those qualities to do well BUT there are other people with those qualities who has the capacity to do very well in MLM,  So donÂ’t kill opportunitiesÂ…. Rather, do your due diligence carefully.<br>With or without your participation, the industry that is thriving for the last 40 years in the US will last for the next 40 years in other countries as well.... cheers to all</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But by saying these, u are ignoring cleverly disguised scams that make distinctions between real MLM and pyramid schemes blur<br><br>Not forgetting there are many badly mismanaged companies that dont really bother abt ethical selling<br><br>But the MLM industry in SG has everything to lose, despite the conditions in US or Canada, if it does not work to eradicate scams and emphasise more on ethics in business, or even sought to improve its image.<br><br>We can blame consumers and ex agents all we want,if they really do not work hard to achieve their targets and blame on the companies, but they have other choices to go to if they cant make it in MLM, but the company will suffer losses.<br><br>I think, on this point, both are mutualy dependent on each other. I think this is the view point we must look if we wish to discuss whose fault it is.<br><br></div>

In my opinion, do a thorough due diligence- and not rush to join just because it's a friend. Lots of questions to ask, trouble is MLM has too short a history in Singapore and many Singaporeans are not asking the right questions.<br>Just today, I got a big flyer stuck on my car windscreen with the Headline that says " xxx (name of company) guarantees you earn $5000 monthly income in 30 days! $10000 in 90 days ! Now if a gullible guy who reads such a promise believes it and don't ask the right string of questions on how this income realistically can sustain... people will be in hot-soup ! When I called to enquire all they say is its some water product and the initial stocks costs $20,000....<br>The only solution is caveat emptor, the need to have more educated would-be prospective networkers. Lets hear from networkers with several years international experience -please show me how to smell promises that can never be kept like this "xxx-water's income guarantee"</div>

In my opinion (just my opinion), monthly maintenance is not stocking up of products. So far most of the companies with maintenance round up to a couple of hundred dollars every month. Stock up is buying thousand or ten of thousands right on the first day.  Stocking up products doesn't automatically means that the company is 'unethical', the problem is they didn't consider the ability of the new prospect to market those products.  Traditional businessman love this concept, 'buy stocks with huge discount, sell it away at higher profits'.  However, normal folks with no biz experience may not be able to do that.<br><br>Some people felt that spending or selling couple of hundred of dollars of products every month is tough or not quite right.  My suggestion is for them to think through what is their objective in joining an MLM business.  If their purpose is to make money (big or small doesn't matter) or monthly income then they must have monthly sales.  If they're just users, then they can choose to buy product anytime they want to without commiting on monthly maintenance.<br><br>I run my MLM biz as a biz and I expect my distributors to do the same.  I invest time on those who are commited to the biz and not to those that just want to 'TRY'.  My distributors also have the same expectation of me so is it leverage in both direction.  Most MLM company (including mine) will ask people to set goals and they usually set big goals (big car, big house, long holiday ...).  Whatever the goals maybe, it takes constant time &amp; constant effort.<br><br>We can succeed in MLM with full-time or part-time but never as a 'Pastime'.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Yup, I believe monthly sales is important in doing a business. What I personally feel, however, is that one should be rewarded even up to every dollar he sell, meaning for that month, whether u sell a few thousand or even 10 dollars, you will still be given some rewards too instead of having to meet a minimum quota before getting rewards. For example, for the next 2 months, I can sell $200 worth like say in $50 1st month and $150 second month and get the same bonuses. However for those with a minimum quota of $100 per month lets say, now you can't get the 1st month bonus and the only way is to top up $50 with products at the end of the month or do not get the bonus at all..only get the $150 one. My company doesn't encourage the above system of keeping products especially as we have a 3 months full-money back guarantee system and only when customers want the product then we get from the warehouse etc.<br><br>I also agree that doing the business is not about trying. In order to be true to yourself, shld really put in effort to do the business, thus no matter what the result will be, you know you have done your very best in the business.<br><br>cheers<br><br></div>

I'm just hitting at the truth and reality of MLMs and the truth always hurts, just that some people prefer to hear honey coated words while ignoring the truth. Sorry I don't beat about the bush but go directly to the point.<br><br>Education is more than for knowledge's sake. It's a life long learning that can help one to upgrade continuously and pick up new skills. As long as one can study and afford to pay for the fees to obtain their degree, Master's or PhD, why not? Don't forget that there is an immense pride once a person obtain their educational qualification.<br><br>The only way to ensure job security is to continously upgrade one's skills. One is never old to learn, I believe strongly in lifelong earning. Just as most MLMs will say if you try hard you will succeed, similarly if you continuously upgrade your skills, you will not worry about job retrenchments as you have the skills that your employer wants.<br><br>Sorry, what has winning the world cup or playing soccer to do with this?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">See???

There is always insecurity in having a backup plan for MLMs, because in the first place, MLMs don't necessarily mean a permanent lifelong residual income as sooner or later the number of downlines will dwindle.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">And wats wrong with recognition????

It only fuels the greed in everyone, come on, who doesn't want that nice looking BMW in the photos they put up on the walls. Everyone will try to achieve the car target by unscrupously targeting their relatives and friends and trying to hardsell to them the benefits of using their products. Striking fear into others is really a despicable act that should be punishable by law. The only end result is a loss of face within the family (bad news spread fast) and loss of friends as everyone will avoid the MLM salesperson.<br><br>Yes, all kinds of sales job require effort to sell, we just can't sit down and shake legs and wait for the sales to come. It all depends on what one is selling and whether there is any demand for it. If there's a lot of people interested in buying the product, then the salesperson will not have to put in so much effort in promoting the product. Then the sales will come in and that means greater commission for the salesperson.<br><br>The only difference is that the true sales people who sell proper products which people need will be the ones who succeed and not those who try to sell products which people don't need. Why should I spend so expensively on a health product sold by a MLM company when the same similar product can be bought cheaper at a retail shop like Guardian or Watson?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Please understand that MLM is a business that allows normal ppl to have a chance to earn astronomical income with proper amount of effort and hardwork....

MLMers only tell you its possible within a short time if the right attitude and effort is put in.....<br></div></blockquote>Finally, you're saying that MLM is a business that allows normal people to have a chance to earn astronomical income with proper amount of effort and hardwork. Well anyone with the right capital and business logic can also achieve that but look at the real situation, how many people can actually succeed in starting a new business? There's bound to be failures as not everyone has that elusive business acumen. Do you actually own the business as you're just representing an existing company? How much control do you actually have in running your own business?<br><br>How do you know that these people actually earn 10K a month? Have they shown you their bank account or salary cheque? Will they even bother to show you how much they earn every month? The truth is they can't show you they earn that amount every month as the business is not constant and dependent on the number of downlines they have. If there's not enough downlines then they cannot even sustain that amount every month.<br><br>Yah all MLMers will tell you it's possible within a short time if the right attitude and effort is put in....Come on what can they tell us to help us to achieve success? What is the key to their success? So far I have been to many MLM presentations and all I see is their supposed success is to follow their proven formula eg binary pattern and through purchasing their seminar CDs/tapes/books. But I'm not told how to actually achieve success.<br><br>Perhaps more effort should have been done on the MLMers rather than just telling the individual that they can succeed if they put in the right attitude and effort. I have never seen any MLMer say that rejection is the first step to success, as being rejected will spur the individual to try to work harder to improve his/her selling skills without having to resort to the dreaded hardselling techniques of striking fear into others.<br><br>For other sales job like insurance and property, the rejection part is emphasized strongly so that people will not have false expectations and be misled to think they never try hard enough. Hope you don't think I have no understanding of how the MLM industry work,  husky1609.</div>

Anyway I stand by the same principle that as long as one continues to upgrade oneself, then one will not worry about being retrenched unless one makes mistake at work which may lead to possible retrenchments.<br><br>You will only see results if you do business in the proper manner and not just by cheating others. I'm sorry to say all MLMers are blinded by greed. You have to many "Ifs" in your second paragraph, which shows the uncertainties you are trying to promote. Similarly I can also say that if you don't try hard in MLM to get as many downlines, then you will also fail..isn't it the same kind of logic?<br><br>If you look closely at some local MLMs, one (am) has been a discharged bankrupt three times before he found some limited success, while the other two (paris and dw) have been the subject of long posts in this forum. If they are really very honourable then would there have been the subject of so many countless complaints by people who claim they have been cheated and not being able to get their money back.<br><br>MLM in theory sounds good but in practice the quality of products is questionable and the only thing that remains constant is the high price charged for that product which has reputedly more benefits than negative effects.<br><br>MLMs do not go by the normal economics principles and can only achieve success through word of mouth, while normal business rely on advertising and promotions to achieve their sales. It all depends on what you define as a scam in the first place. As long as products are overly priced when they can be bought cheaper elsewhere through normal retail shops, I would consider that as a scam (cheating).<br><br>Insurance can never be a scam as it is governed by the Financial Act from the MAS, while MLM is only governed by the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Act. MLMs if they obtain their earnings through recruiting people will be pyramid and illegal in Singapore, so it's highly probable that all MLMs are prone to scams as they may disguise pyramid activities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I agree that there are many MLM companies out there. I had actually had friends that are selling products that are $2k and above. Think about it, how many people actually have the skills and ability to purchase these products? How many people can actually have the heart to part with that hard earned savings and buy that product just to give face to their friend?<br><br>I am definately not that kind. I had a friend that actually resort to cheating their own friends, lies like their mother are in hospital and her father need $2k to help recoup a failing business. How many people will believe that? These so called MLM companies are definatly fraud, or they simply don't care about their distributors. They make their distributors loose friends. They just give promises that the more you sell the higher you go and there is also targets and goals you have to meet.<br><br>That is why I had misunderstadings that all MLM comapny are bad. Until someone introduced me to a well established american MLM comapny, that had consumable products like household items that are of good quality and affordable prices. Yes those products have similar items in the retail market, but after see-ing with our own eyes, the product demos with retail items, you know that the products are value for money.<br><br>I had seen real people who are successful in the MLM I joined, the company gave me confidence with the many years they had in the market. I felt that I had nothing to use. I had only joined for 2 months and the culture had been very encouraging. If things don't work out, I can even get a full refund of the money I put in to join the business.<br><br>Working in a conventional job can offer you with a reasonable pay, but what will happen to you if you lose tha ability to work one day? My only parent is recently retrenched and I just graduated from poly and I had to support my family.<br>Even if you upgrade you skills consistantly, how old do you want to work until? Unless we all start planning for retirement now, the government is encouraging us to work until 65 or even later. How sad can that be?<br><br>A good MLM company can actually be even better that buying a very good insurance, if you make the right start.<br><br>Many people had misconceptions of MLM, due to the bad sheeps in the market. Yes there are bad sheeps, maybe those are the only you had come acrossed. But there are also MLM that had helped support a widowed mother to buy new shoes for her kids to go school.<br><br>Many people out there need jobs but they do not have qualification, thus thay can only settle with low paying jobs, and work long hours. They do not have time to spend with their kids, as they try their best to support the family only to find their kids led astray by bad company. Sounds familar from true files? Remember the case where many teenagers had an innocent girl captive for days and they were prosecuted? What did the judge said to their mother?<br><br>The concept of MLM is actually very good, with the correct marketing plan and reward system. They offer freedom to live freely at your own pace. And work as a family. Let us not be baised due to the bad examples we had seen, like i once did. Open yourself to more. For when you will find joy when you see other people you had helped succeed in the business.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>The above post is written by my downline who actually was shocked when she saw the comments being made.<br><br>Having seen both good and bad MLMs before, I hope to use this forum to educate Singapore on what is a good MLM and to be able to share enough information for Singaporeans to accept that the MLM industry is a true business and not a scam provided the company is a truly good mlm company that ensures that everybody gets the best. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It may not be an easy task with so many negative people around but this is part of my mission and goal too, that is to educate people to see the true beauty of the business and will try my best to do so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers<br></div>
