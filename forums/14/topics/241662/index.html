It is supposedly to be the most famous MLM company in the world. What are the odds of another MLM company going to more countries than Amway???

(so that you will not get cheated - safe in FLP's company)<br><br>do you just virtually only want to earn money?<br><br>what do you want?<br><br>now the IMPORTANT part - what do you NEED now?<br><br>there can be a lot of wants, but there's must be a few basic NEEDS<br><br>short out your wants and needs accordingly than go about choosing a mlm company if you decide on the choice that you make.<br><br>if you're not sure what you want in future, than i suggest that you go find a normal work to work, and get paid. (go SMU/UNSW path) the proven path of High-Fliers..lol [that is only if you're able to pay for the high educational fees]<br><br>if you have no idea what you want in life, we can meet, and i discuss with you or Rather, I help you do an analysis of what you really want.<br><br>Just let me know if you're interested to do some planning or discussion perhaps on which mlm company is suitable for you.<br><br>Cheers to a Wise and Good Planning.<br>the_fallen  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I have been wondering &amp; thinking &amp; cracking my head trying to find out what does FLP stands for. Suddenly it struck me. It could stand for Forever Living Products!!! Why didn't I think of that???<br><br>If I am not wrong, it is one of the few manufacturing based MLM companies in the world &amp; most of these manufacturing based companies do not close down because they have they own manufacturing plant, their own R&amp;D department &amp; neva controlled by suppliers because most likely they would have bought over the place where they need to have their vital ingredients or whatever economic term the educated people use.<br><br>Some sort like vertical integration is it??? Like for example, I heard that McDonald's grow their own potatoes for their fries, so they can better control the quality &amp; supply of their raw materials. Yes, that is the word!!! Raw material. Vital ingredient sounds dumb.<br><br>Trading based company would mean the opposite of manufacturing based loh. they take products from supplier &amp; then they do MLM or normal retail distribution loh. However, they are always controlled by suppliers because they do not have their own products mah. It can be quite risky when you are not in total control of your business.<br><br>So based on this point, I believe that since FLP is manufacturing based rather than trading based, it is worth taking a look. Since it has been to so many countries, after Singapore, I wonder where FLP can go to.<br><br>Anyway, I think another important point to note is the MLM education you will receiving in a company. What kind of things do they teach you with regards to MLM. Do they teach you the basics, i.e. history of MLM, definition of MLM, etc. To have a chance of doing well in any industry, some basic knowledge is in order.<br><br>Okiee, that is all for now. Hope my reply helps a little.</div>
