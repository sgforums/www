              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I did a random search on the net and i came across this forum with so much information about MLM and related issues.</p>
              <p>I personally do not appreciate MLM's marketing strategies cos of some main reasons..</p>
              <p>1) They force you to buy in bulk of things that you are not even sure they work or in line with health safety standards</p>
              <p>2) They do not really sell their products to you and they want you to sell their products in large scale..using money making terms to entice you.</p>
              <p>3) Most of their products are not originals and usually reproduced using a different (calling others their own)\</p>
              <p>4) Forcing you to sign up as a member and get you to purchase immediately to enjoy great offers after a boring seminar that doesn't answer to their code of ethnic.</p>
              <p>But i do come across a couple of Co. in and out of Singapore that have pretty good, original products that really live up to their names. And yes although they have marketing strategies like purchasing for your own usage and then spread the words to others and allow them to continue being able to buy the products with no own money spent but use the commission they earn from spreading the words. Then they are definitely not labelled as a MLM Company!</p>
              <p>Initially i do feel skeptical about Melaleuca products but as a mother of 2 babies... i give a try and i only bought household products that i already need in the house. And honestly..my maid and i loved the Sol U Guard disinfectant and cleaning solution using only Thyme Oil and Citrus Acid found in oranges and lemon!!!! The next thing i am gonna try is the washing detergent for my babies clothes....said to be so mild with no chemical contents that it is suitable for babies as young as new born. Don't believe, feel free to come to my house and try the Sol U Guard...you will be amazed.</p>
              <p>And i did a research on Melaleuca Oil and apparently only Melaleuca Company manufactures their products using that oil...and believe it or not there's such a plant in Spore Botanical garden.</p>
              <p>I have been approached by Amway, Crystals, Proam, you name it but i never joined any hahaha... cos i do not believe in them...even after a very very seem to be convincing seminar.. hahahaha....i could not bring myself to buy their products...cos they are all centered to sell and sell.. and make a profit from you and your line of marketeers and not to promote the usefulness of their products!</p>
              <p>So my world of advise... there's no such thing as fast cash, fast career pace!!! If you came across some one like that... make a beeline from it... RUN...</p>
              <p>But if you see something you really want to try...example.. a certain product...try it and who knows... the product would be so wonderful that you will want to recommend it to a friend or 2 and in return, you might get a small comission called referral bonus for spreading word of mouth only! Thats like serving its purpose of doing good to you friends and your pocket!</p>
