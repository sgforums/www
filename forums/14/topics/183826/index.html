            <div class='col-md body'>Hi DarthMaul,<br><br>I think you need to be corrected. There is firstly, no such thing as a SLM company - this term was coined by your previous leader Ng Kim leng to mislead people - many believe it's the truth LOL<br><br>Go read up more and you will understand such a thing.<br><br>Secondly, pioneering is out because Enyouth has been around for 6 years, from Tanjong Pagar to Eunos to Carpenter Street, 1000s of distributors have come and gone and you are still talking about pioneering?? Please, it's time to change the way you market if you still want to recruit ignorant people - they are getting smarter nowdays  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reason y we say we're still pioneering is cos compared to other MLM co EY is considered small cos we hv ard 500++ ACTIVE distributors only. SLM is not a self-proclaimed term but it really does exist. u can chk w insurance co cos they're usin a identical system n there is a difference between MLM n SLM so do chk r sources bef u say anything cos they're many of us studing biz also which means u're saying tt we've been taught the wrong things in sch n tt textbooks r all lies?<br>if tt's the case i think u can go dn to bouna vista n tell MOE to stop usin all textbooks cos they're all a bunch of lies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah u are 87 i assume u are born '87. I think it good to be adventurous and positive and willing to learn. but know that becoz u have youth on ur side, u still lack experience. and experience comes only with time. Give it a while more and you will understand what ppl meant about the things they said about enyouth. I dont know if u study business as in 'study' business from ur mlm seniors or really study subjects like finance, accounting, marketing. coz it can be very very different. certain things they teach u in mlm certainly doesnt make sense at all if you have properly studied business subjects. i know studying is different from actual practical work. but there are certain fundamentals that apply across the board.</div>

This type of system is called STAIR-STEP breakaway - please go and read more before sprouting rubbish.<br><br>No.3 - Other MLM's distributor bases gets BIGGER all the time, Enyouth has been maintaining a poolof 500 thoughout - new distributors come in,older ones leave. If there is really growth,5 years back when the population was 500 too it will have been at least 3000-4000 now. Don't give this shit about pioneering please.<br><br>No.4 - I am very impressed by you studying business but unless you have a MBA, don't use education as a shield. It's pathetic. Generalising about telling MOE to stop using textbooks is really childish.<br><br>No.5 - I am not shooting down Enyouth but you are really misrepresenting them. One of the reasons for bad reputation. If you are born in 87, it means you are 19 years old now. Go grow up more.  Else you are a laughing joke in this forum - oh, and sure, do comeback with more emotional retorts,I'm sure a lot of us here will be entertained  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
