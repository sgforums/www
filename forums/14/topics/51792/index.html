            <div class='col-md body'>hello! i'm new here. searched on google for 'dw group' and was brought here. seeing so many ppl with experience, i'd like to seek some advice here:<br><br>last week a guy from dw group approached me on the streets saying they're recruiting new staff for various positions in their company. when i asked what exactly the co. does and wat's his position etc., his answers were very dodgy, and juz replied they're a biotech co. he cant even give me a namecard saying 'if everyone on the streets ask for namecards we wun have anymore rite' like duh, dun even have namecard how dependable... but since i'm pretty much bumming ard nowadays i juz filled out his survey form and he said he'd get back to me if i get 'shortlisted for an interview'<br><br>yesterday he called me and said i was shortlisted (oh thrill) for a position in their co. and told me to go down to his co. for an interview with the big boss or something on a sunday. wat kind of co. opens on a sunday where the big boss goes down to interview prospective workers! so i got a little suspicious from my experience with astral mag and asked him if this is some kind of network marketing thingy. he said oh there are network marketers too but thats little and there are other~ positions to fill out as well.<br><br>i dun trust him.<br><br>has anybody gone thru that b4? should i go down and risk wasting my time listening to another hour of self-important talk like in astral mag? or are they really doing things besides network marketing?<br><br>pls gimme some advice thanks!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh u better not go down if u dun want to be a network marketer. they told u the company is expanding and there are various positions. but the truth is.... there is only one position...that is being recruit as a network marketer under them.  i was there once for some time. i ask them about the various positions they said and one guy told me all newcomers have to be under probation....that is a network marketer. u have to close some sales to promote to other positions. so the thing is... there is never other positions. all are network marketers. just different levels only. for those who read this.... please dun waste ur time to go there. their theory ( or watever u call it ) of 99% heart and 1% tactic......for one person i know there, is all bullshit. to him he is 99% tactics and sales and 1% heart. i believe it's the same for all. trust me. i have been there for some time. if anyone of you who think i am unfair or watever, by all means feel free to go. no one can stop you. i am just telling you the fact and my experience. u dun believe u can go and try it urself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>drats. openmind! y now then u say... i went down to their co. liao... yea u're rite they keep psychoing me to be a bloody network marketer... not offense to network marketers, i'm not saying its not a good career, but i've stated that i dun want to be a network marketer to them dunno how many times...<br><br>really wasted my time there... the guy who 'recruited' me keep saying there are~ other positions but at the 'interview' with their boss, it was a major promoting of network marketing. really, like openmind says, there's nothing else. when i finally asked him not to waste his time on me anymore he says i'm proud and not open minded. like, pls respect other people's decisions dah! lots of $$ does not equate success to everybody.<br><br>for ppl who're not interested in network marketing, pls keep away from dw group.. for those who are, well in all honesty, though i was suitably pissed off, the co. does look promising where u can climb ur speedy little ladder to 'success'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>right nameless. r u in the DW group? if no, then how u know there are various positions? if yes, then u should know there in fact all positions are network marketers. u are first a probation, then close some cases then go next lvl. this carries on and on. while you go higher, beside just selling, u also do other things. like recrutiting new ppl under you, become a SO and help other ppl close deals. make phone calls, do surveys, do paper work which are the collected surveys.... if this is so called the other positions, then there is nothing i can say. because u are still a network marketer!!! to become a SO or manager so watever, u have to do sales!!! tell me if you r working there, who is just purely a admin in the company? u go there and say u want to be a admin and see possible or not. i tell u i tried b4. bullshit. it is all about doing sales and sales. there is really no point arguing. like i say if u like u go ahead. i am just telling the truth to other ppl.<br><br>something extra for u ppl. the reason i quit because i found that my senior there is not 'honest'. i dare not say about all but for him, f***!!! i sms he din reply. not only once but many times on different days. so no reasons for that. he will just f***ing pressure you to approach your relatives and friends. i tell him i dun want and want to do cold market, he f***ing show attitude. tt's the way of 99% heart and 1% tactics. so long in the company, i ask him how to do cold market he say he dunno, he din do before. it really makes ppl wonder. because there is no way to do cold market? have to depend on newcomers friends and relatives? f***ing tok about him make me piss off.<br><br>i was once interested and eager to join the company and do big. dun believe read the forum and see what i said. i told ppl to be openmind and give it a try. but after knowing the truths, NO WAY!!! up to u all lah. u happy u do. none of my business.</div>
