              As long as you are able to receive comission from the sales from two or more generations below you, it can be considered as mlm.
              
              Mlm can also be done through online or offline and some companies like herbalife are doing it both ways.
                      
              There are some differences between the two, the most important one is that in offline mlm, you have to go look for partners while for online, partners come looking for you, this actually increase the chance of closing. Also internet marketing do not need to tap into your family or friends which may strain relationship.
                      
              On the other hand, in internet marketing, you don't get to see the companies and people so people may be more afraid to join you. You need to spend more time to build the trust between the two of you.

              I am not sure because I am not into internet marketing. But there are lots of such ads in mocca, you may want to check them out.
              
              An advice, you should meet up with their agent at least once (it's better if you see their company) before sending any money over. And please do your own research before joining any. Don't give in to hard selling and sign on the spot. You had been in mlm before, so you should be able to understand what I mean

              And mlm can be done through internet marketing too.
                  
              OK, what I mean is that mlm companies can recruit people both by using the traditional way (asking friends to come down to office) and using internet marketing

              <p>OK, let me try to explain both to you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mlm is a marketing system where you are able to earn from the 2nd generation onward. In simper term, this means if you get A (your first generation) to be your salesman, if he earn money, you get comission. If A get B (your 2nd generation) to be his downline, you are able to profit from his sales as well, this is mlm. Mlm does not have to be in the traditional form of calling up friends, asking them down etc. It can also be done through online method or any other methods, as long it has the above element in it, it's mlm. Multi Level Marketing = ability to tap into multi level (multi level comission)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mlm is a <strong>system</strong> used in marketing</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Internet marketing is marketing through online method, using the internet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Internet marketing is a <strong>mode</strong> of marketing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Comparing the two is like comparing communist to capitalism. A country can be both (China), neither (India) or only one (Singapore) as they are used to describe different aspects of the government</p>

              Both are marketing methods and involve selling your service/products to your customers. After all, they have the word "marketing" in them.
              
              A difference I can said is that in traditional mlm, you have to go and look for your customers but internet marketing, you put up an ads or website and wait for customers to come to you.
              
              In traditional mlm, you will have to put in more time and effort because it's you who go look for them. But you will have a mentor and training and guidance will be given to you. Good for people who need them.
              
              The thing is about finding a good company, but it's not that easy because those who are in a mlm company will said their company is good, most that are not in any will said all mlm companies are bad so it's hard to get unbiased view. The only way is that you go and visit the companies yourself and compare but that will take a lot of time and effort but it's worth it if you really want to get a good one.
              
              As for internet marketing, I am not very sure about its pros and cons because I never did it before, maybe you can ask from those who know more about this method of marketing. What I know is that you can put up ads or use a lead capture page where you are able to capture the information of your potential customers
