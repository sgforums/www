            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there Mr LegacyMan, thanks for your reply <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Not many replies, maybe people don't like to reply to new members and new posts.<br><br>"Hearing no is a very common in MLM business, you can't have everyone saying yes right."<br><br>Its common when MLM is done the old way. I remember sharing an MLM biz op with my family, very difficult it was. Got the typical response, "scam scam". Another fellow I know was told by A*way to show the plan..just show the plan and they will join. He found an opportune moment to show the plan to 4 friends in a Spa, and he quit the same day.<br><br>"Consolidate contact list is just one of the way for find people in your current network."<br>Good way to start. Then send all these people to an autoresponder. Use an auto responder to follow up with these people, let them call you when they are ready, because when people call you instead of you call them, it cuts down the "Nos" that you have to endure.<br><br>"Buy leads is out of the questions, but cold call is optional too."<br>I guess I belong to the category where cold calling is difficult for me also. Building a relationship out of thin air is not the easiest thing to do.<br><br>"I think no matter what business you are doing. You really need to network around no matter its to know more people or introduce your business.<br>If you do not like network or talk to people, how you gonna get deals ?"<br>Networking is important, but networking in the MLM context is a little different because there is a stigma about MLM. However, if you introduce your MLM biz as an Internet Biz Op, where sales are made over the internet with a credit card, it breaks down the initial barrier people will have toward the MLMer.<br><br>Respectfully,<br>Bahama</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bahama, I couldn't agree more with you. Personally I found it really difficult to approach friends and even relatives not to mention cold calling numbers with names I'm unable to attach a face to. The stigma people have of MLM is really a tough barrier to overcome.Personally, .. I didn't like the way friends and relatives gave their "I saw a ghost" expression when ever they heard the term. Its like some sort of taboo word.<br><br>Even when someone do sign up, I'd feel really guilty if he/she doesn't make it. I'm sure we can all agree that MLM really do work out for some, yet there are always those who's not really cut out for it.<br><br>The concept for this business is excellent. However, marketing techniques has gotta change. Always prepare for the next step, "...Never stand still" -Richard Templar<br><br></div>
