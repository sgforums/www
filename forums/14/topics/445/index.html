            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I received a call last Sunday, asking me whether IÂ’m interested in joining their new company, which is expanding and hiring staffs. I was a bit surprise to get this call because I didnÂ’t apply for any office job. I ask the person how she got my number and she said she got it through a survey. Funny thing is I didnÂ’t do any survey and I donÂ’t do surveys when I get approached in the streets.<br><br>Anyway, since I got nothing to do, I went down on Monday to take a look. The address she gave me is LOT 18, Aliwal Street. It is directly opposite the Concourse Shopping Mall. When I arrived, I was quite surprised to see that itÂ’s only a 2-storey shop house as I was expecting it to be a multi-storey building. I look around the surroundings and found that opposite the Â“officeÂ” is a karaoke lounge while the shop next to the Â“officeÂ” is a popiah restaurant and the one even further down is Â“Ulu Ulu PubÂ”<br><br>The girl, who called me, came to meet me. Her name is Kelly. She bought me into a showroom where there are a lot of chairs (like a hotel lobby) and thereÂ’s a cross-sectioned bed that she told me has magnetic fields (or something like that).<br><br>She started telling me about the company, which is dealing with Â“a type of technologyÂ”, called LIFE SCIENCES, which is started by a Japanese. The company name is Â“ASAYO xxxÂ” I canÂ’t remember the full name.<br><br>Kelly took my IC to change a visitorÂ’s pass, then she say she will now bring me to Â‘look look see seeÂ’ their office. She led me out of the showroom to the side of the building to take the lift. (Suspicion no 1: why is there a lift when its only a 2 storey building? ItÂ’s a shop house! ) As we walk out, we pass by some cars. She asks me what I think about those cars. I replied, Â“Ok, nice big carsÂ” Kelly went on to tell me that all these cars actually belonged to the staffs working there. When a staff reached certain targets or did something that Â‘impressedÂ’ the Singapore boss, Mr Ng, he will pay the downpayment of the car for you. As Kelly puts it, Mr Ng is a very Â‘humbleÂ’ man. Kelly said that by her eighth month with the company, she has already Â‘worked her wayÂ’ to a car already but because she didnÂ’t have a driving license, the car can only be put on Â‘holdÂ’. And sheÂ’s only 22 years old, mind you.<br><br>Upon reaching the office, I saw there are actually a lot of other people like me who were Â‘invitedÂ’ there for the same purpose. I was shown 3 videotapes. The 1st programme is the local channel 8 morning programme,<br>ZAO AN NI HAO (Good Morning Singapore). This programme shows the host, Xu Nan Sheng introducing the boss,<br>Mr. Ng. Kelly told me this programme was taped about 3 years ago. The 2nd programme is about the Asayo group at their Japanese Headquarters. It also showed a bit about LIFE SCIENCES. The 3rd programme is a Premiere 12 documentary about a wheel-bound man Â‘able to walkÂ’ after going through therapy with the LIFE SCIENCE bed for some time. It also showed a Hawaiian woman who is able to Â‘sleep through the nightÂ’ without waking up several times. And she was able to Â‘sing betterÂ’ after sleeping on the LIFE SCIENCE bed. (Suspicion no 2: I have seen the Good Morning Singapore show before. The guest is usually invited to the studio whereby the host will ask questions and the guest will answer. But the video which they showed me, is after the host introduce the guest, the rest of the programme is a pre-recorded clip of Mr Ng sitting in his office, telling his story of the hardships he faced and how he work Â‘against all oddsÂ’ to become who he is today. Another point is Kelly told me this is a Â‘new companyÂ’ so how come Mr Ng is already on the show 3 years ago??!)<br><br>After watching the videos, Kelly kept on talking about Mr Ng. How he used to work as a apprentice in the furniture trade but by accident his fingers were amputated by a machine. Then he went on to sell insurance and became a millionaire, earning a 5-figure sum monthly. But then, at the end of the day, he realized that although he had the cash, but his health is failing him. Then at this crucial moment, his friend introduce him to the LIFE SCIENCE technology and from then on, he became the distributor and got the rights to this Â‘technologyÂ’ and set up this company in Singapore. She very clearly emphasized to me, Â“we are NOT employing salesman to sell bedsÂ”<br><br>Later on, she shows me around the various departments. As we pass by the departments, I noticed that no one is working at their desks at all. Rather, all the people were chatting. It was around 2pm and lunch break is over long ago. All the men were wearing white shirt and black pants like uniform.  Kelly brought me to a Â‘specialÂ’ department(nobody there) made up entirely of malays to Â‘tackleÂ’ the Malaysia market. (But I remember the 2nd video I watched said that the ASAYO group had operations in HK, Thailand, ROC, China, Singapore and Â…Malaysia!) So what has the branch in Singapore got to do with the operations in Malaysia?<br><br>Kelly also pointed to the commandments certificates that were hanged all over the wall but they looked so fake. I can also make one with my computer. Then she showed me some of their employeeÂ’s photographs. She pointed out an Indian to me and asks if I recognize him. I thought he looks seemingly familiar but I am not sure where I have seen him before. Kelly told me that he is the Indian actor from the channel 8 mandarin programme Qi Cai Xue Tang. She also showed me photographs of them in Tokyo Disneyland. She said that Mr Ng would bring the whole company to Â“excursionÂ” the Japan head quarters every year and will Â‘on the wayÂ’ sightseeing also. All expenses paid!!<br><br>Kelly then brought me to see her superior, a mandarin speaking Indian. He really has very good gift of the gab. He keeps asking me tricky and difficult-to-answer questions like, Â“ What is the difference between a JOB and a CAREER?Â” The questions he asks make me feel very uncomfortable as if heÂ’s trying to corner me or Â‘trapÂ’ me or something.<br><br>Throughout the conversation, he explained to me that the company is a new one and is looking to train a group of<br>Â“top managementÂ” people to run the company in the Â‘futureÂ’. He mentioned that they(company) do not look at educational certificates to hire people. What they are looking for are talents. He cited an example to help me understand better. The company right now is just like Insurance 30 years ago. 30 years ago, nobody knew what is Insurance and what is it for? But look at the people who joined Insurance at that time. They are now sitting at the top management and earning big bucks. These are the people the company is looking for now Â– to sit at the top management seat. He also told me the objective of the company is to open 50 branches in Singapore within the next ten years!!<br><br>Right now, some of  the people in the company only have primary 8 education(?) (So far, they still havenÂ’t told me what post they want me to fill up) The Indian told me that we(the people selected) will go through a few courses like sales, management, marketing, etcÂ…all these for free. And from our performance, we will be further selected for the interview to join the company! So it means even if we now go for the courses, we are not considered hired yet. Before I left his office, he further stressed what Kelly has told me earlier, Â“we are NOT employing salesman to sell bedsÂ”<br><br>After the conversation with him, Kelly took me back to the showroom again to change back my IC. Before I go, she told me not to tell anyone about this. Not even my family?? The time was about 7pm. (My Â‘tourÂ’ took about 2 hours) I asked her what are the working hours of the company and she told me Â“it is up to the individualÂ” for people in the office but they have shift for the showroom so it is actually 24 hours for the showroom because there may be customers who might Â‘pop inÂ’ for a look.(Yeah right, the only people I see are the sleazy customers from the karaoke lounge opposite. Other than that, the street is like ghost town.)<br><br>Kelly fixed me a 2nd appointment the next day when I will learn about Â“more into the detailsÂ” of the companyÂ’s products.<br><br>On my way home, I keep thinking about the whole thing. It sounds like a spam to me. It looks like some sort of pyramid kind of thing. What do you think??<br><br></div>

I felt exactly the same way initially but it takes time for one to see the results that Asayo can provide.<br>As for the pushy attitude, u must remember that u were talking to a saleman. he will not be a salesan for long but at that moment, he is one.

I understand that you have quite a number of doubts about our company's way of doing things and to prevent other further misconception, please allow me to give an explanation to your enquires.<br><br>You quoted a few points that bewildered and aroused your suspicion in your opinion, namely<br>1.	the awkward location of the company<br>2.	the unexpected existent of a lift in a shophouse<br>3.	the disbelief of a young lady owning a BMW<br>4.	the flashing of 3 video clips<br>5.	the exact status of the company<br>6.	the reliability of an annual excursion to the Japanese HQ<br>7.	the tricky questions that the interviewer asked during the interview<br><br>1.	To start off, I admit that the location of the company is indeed not fantastic and that many sleazy pubs made it looked even worse. However being a pioneering company, one has to start somewhere. In fact, we are not alone in this weird location. There are various marketing firms that share the same working environment with us.<br><br>2.	Well, I was taken aback by this point. It is not uncommon to see a lift in a shophouse especially when this building has quite a contemporary concept. Anyway just for your information, Carlsburg supplier company who occupies the second and third storey of the building shares the lift too.<br><br>3.	The young lady of 22 years old, Miss Kelly is actually a very enthusiastic and hardworking employee of the company. It is common to have people like you to be bewildered by her achievements because honestly when I first joined the company, I was equally filled with disbelief and suspicion too. However as much as it seemed impossible for a lady at a tender age of 22 to own a BMW, it is very much possible. Later when I got to know her better, I realised that the BMW is actually a symbol of recognition of all her zealous efforts. I cannot help but acknowledge the fact that Miss Kelly did really worked extremely hard to achieve excellence in her job to the extent that it impressed our boss Mr Ng to reward her with the car incentive. Seriously the car do not come easy, but this example of Miss Kelly proved that the company will not fail to reward you accordingly if you are willing to give the company your best.<br><br>4.	The actual aim of flashing the 3 video clips to our interview candidates is to show that our company is not a hoax and to let them know about the technology that we are engaged in. The video clip of "zao an ni hao" is very much real although it is not similar to the common setting of the show whereby the guests are usually invited to the studio for recording. There are always exceptions in the showbiz and should this exception be the sole reason for it being a fake, it is very myopic and immature deduction. The next 2 video clips that featured magnethotherapy aims to let our candidates have a deeper insight of the technology. This is necessary as this technology is relatively new to Singaporeans though it has been quite established. All these aim to help the candidate understand more about the company and in turn help them to decide whether they are willing to give their best to help the company prosper. We believe in giving our candidates the discretion to choose whether they want this career and give their best to help the establishment of the company. Hence, if you feel that you are not cut out for this career, we do not compel you to stay on.<br><br>5.	Our company has a history of approximately 10 years in Singapore. However, it is still in its pioneering stage because of the nature of the product that we are marketing. I believe you understand that in marketing context different products have different life cycles. Hence, it takes different time for different products to reach its maturity stage of being established. That is why the story of insurance is told to you to illustrate the reason why we are still in the pioneering stage despite being here for almost 10 years.<br><br>6.	The fact is very true. We do have annual Japan trips for outstanding employees to visit the HQ.<br><br>7.	The questions that you pointed out seemed tricky for me too when I came for my first interview. However, I was quick to realise that they are actually not so if I had thought about them initially. I said this because though job and career are used interchangeably in our everyday conversation, it is actually quite different. Have you ever thought of what you want to do when you work? Are you working for the sake of working or is there another meaning to it? Thanks to all the economic crisis and all the conservative teaching of our teachers or parents, Singaporeans have lost the courage to work towards our ambitions. Hence when an opportunity like ours popped up, one can't help but panic at it. It is not easy to work and realise a career but if you are willing to do so, you are exactly the person we are looking for. Hence, I do not agree that the questions that he asked are meant to trap you. On the other hand, are you not glad that somebody asked you to identify what you want in life now than you were to regret for not doing so earlier when you are already past your prime time?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To : ASAYO salesmen,<br><br>26/3/02 newspaper(think it's either STREAT or TODAY) had an article of an ASAYO salesman cum part-time AIA insurance agent got caught for cheating his clients for over 50 over thousands. What have your got to say of this scandal ? Dun tell me 'cannot judge a forest simply by looking at 1 tree'... Seems like ASAYO will take in any Tom, Dick and Harry on the streets as long as he/she does not reject ASAYO's offer. Any constructive comments ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I saw that article too. I admit that this is indeed a scandal of our company. However if you read this article carefully, is there any indication that our company actually instigated him to do that?<br><br>Everybody knows that whatever that Mr Tan had done is not correct and in fact criminal. However, it's sometimes due to certain reasons that people do stupid things that cause one to regret forever. I do not know why had Mr Tan gave in to his temptation of being promoted, he may has his own reason but the fact remains that this is a hard lesson learnt for him and our company.<br><br>It is through these lessons that one learns to be more wise, like wise our company. Since then, our company has already taken precautionary actions against such behaviour and just to let you know, this kind of behavior is not condone in Asayo.</div>
