              <p>You took days eyh? Well hello...gurl..i took 3 weeks...3 effing damn weeks to finally understand what they all are up to. ALL OF THEM. I fall for their every sweet words. They say they will help me but look what happen? They are fucking struggling to even pay up my FIRST FUCKING commission. I don't even fucking care if my money i invested is not refunded but all im asking is wat im earning. And there they are building dreams up there which soon will be drowned in the fires of eternal hell. AND I SWEAR WITH EVERY WORDS THAT THEY SHALL NVR EVER ENJOY WHAT THEY CALL SUCCESS. SCAMMERS AND CHEATERS SHALL NVER!</p>
              <p>Ouh...btw sis. You ARE siding them. and taking only days to understand them? puh-lees...u can ask all those new retards there. Some took half a year to FULLY understand. Puhless la gurl. Ouh...and if i got banned for my first and final post, then good coz i'm done with multi marketing shit. xoxo.</p>

              <p>That's is based on your own thinking :)</p>
              <p>I took days, more then 4 hours of talking to them, just to fully understand, many people has different ways to understand them, i only ask them for main point on how to earn, how does it work, What benefits that's all.</p>
              <p>Each people has each own preference on what they wants :) you took 3 weeks to understand cause you dont really know what's is going on, i admit, when they tell us, it's abit complex, i understand the whole thing also not 1 day, it take days, and how you going to implement it when you heard about it.</p>
              <p>Each people has each ways to have sweet talks to people. But to me and my friends, we dont use sweet words. There's nothing gain about using sweet words.</p>
              <p>Well, i aint siding them. I dont, personally you dont know me well please dont assume i am siding them. I see what i have earn so far. Even thou i haven earn so much yet, but at least there's are results that i can see. No one says you can earn within 1 month or so.</p>
              <p>It's depend on how much effort you put into, and how much people you introduce.</p>
              <p>There's is a few division down there, each division has each own style :) my division culture is not like this :)</p>
              <p>I dont side people or whoever, i side what i saw. :)</p>
              <p>yes, i took afew days to understand so? Does it matters, it's mean your understanding is so uber poor. That u need to took weeks :)</p>

              <p>first of all, is a very simple plan.. just tat they got many many complex and senseless incentive</p>
              <p>next, i was in one of their briefing before. they focus more on the plan den products. u sure their products are tat good?</p>
              <p>lastly, 500 and they will give u 10 international downline. sure not?</p>
              <p>do they even have enough of those downlines for u, or they are making them up?</p>
              <p>i can also give u 100 downlines, international or foreigner or teen or student or doctors or lawyer.... say onli wad</p>
              <p>this is not network marketing my friend,, is called MONEY GAME</p>

              <p>1. I believe their products are 3rd party. Sante, for example, is a healthcare series based and marketed in m'sia before GRI started. So whether the products are gd or not, u shld go find ur sources in m'sia. Post them here for us all to see.</p>
              <p>2. Whether they provide downlines or not, they can only say so much, we can also question so much, but there's no proof being flashed on either side. Talk is cheap. Since it costs only 500, why not somebody who wants to prove the point (from either side) buy one or find someone who bought and show all the data here?</p>
              <p>3. All these shld give a clearer idea whether it is network marketing or money game.</p>

              <p>actually my reason to participate in this discussion is soley because of the thread starter, as he asked about the company and plan  which shows he might be interested and needs more information which is reliable. i cannot give because i do not know much about this company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to thread starter : you might want to find out more from the people or office there since u know the address  :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for non - stakeholders or other people not affliated , what i see is that whenever some new MLM company is established, the info is limited and people already start to assume scamming motives without really giving the company a chance to prove themselves.</p>
              <p>its just like sentencing someone to jail without proper solid proof or without letting him explain his side of the story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have taken sante products , i bought from guardian before and does it mean guardian is working with sante = guardian is a scammer company too ? some food for thought ;)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even herballife from USA is being accused of scamming and the gossips spread far and fast.  But only peole with analysis skills can filter and really think about why things happen and the causes and results before believing in gossips and rumours from people, especially online.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for dreamsterjay, i can understand your fury if you might have been a victim of money game or such?</p>
              <p>If you aren't sure is a money game or how they give those international downlines, why not give them a chance to prove how they do it? if its really done it might be good?</p>
              <p>its the era where people minds are more open to weird and new and creative ideas, but those ideas have been banished and rejected by people who cannot accept creativity or didn't give the creaters a chance to explain or proof how they did it.</p>
              <p>If its me in the briefing, i would ask them how they come up with 10 and how do i check the people, and give them problematic scenarios like what if the people dun work for me ? and see if they can prove and explain and support their plan, before commenting its a money game because its unfair too, whatever company it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i hope that such conflicts would cease because usually the people spreading the uncertainties / money game / company is scamming etc etc are people tat are angry / agitated / or very dis-believing and skeptical so what comments they post and reply would usually repel and chase off those who would stand up and explain or stand up for that company, whatever company it is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2 cents worth, take all above with a pinch of salt as im just stating an objective view which i believe is the cure for debates like these.</p>

              <p>u cant understand them just a day... some people even until few years also can't understand what they are doing! is ok if you just love their product! (i know the director),good quality. ~ but too expensive : (</p>
              <p>in mlm,product cost cant more than 15%... further more this is money game!</p>
              <p>believe or not.. the bonus from autoplacement will drop after some time ... at that time, no more people will go in (because 99.0% people in GRI only want the reward compare with the value of product).then .... ? finish all ....... they open another company again ... and again... and again... (not their fault,they just want to do sales, now conventional mlm hard to do,have to using some thing to ask people join) take care!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey Anti-Scam,<br>  I totally agree with you too. I was offered this by my upline who was one of the top income earner of sunshine empire, i used to earn SGD60k a month with SE. 3 weeks ago James came to my office and offered me positions and discuss to me to bring in my product. I immediately without 2nd thought, I do not want to hurt others anymore. Please think of how many people suffer when you collect your commission check. Like what they say with the endangered animals. When the BUYING STOP , the killing can too.<br><br> I was skeptical the government won't take charge but Grandroyale MLM is really 100% under JAMESE PHANG. He came to see me. I won't be wasting my time to downtell this real thing by typing such a long email that I don't get a cent out of it.<br><br>A quote from Steve. The product is not the product, the product is the plan. Guys open your eyes. Find me one thing is real. Please look at Steve tan record. He got the thickest skin of a human.<br><br>1) He put up his old ugly picture of his neways days (RM40k) and claim he won DISTRIBUTOR OF THE WORLD award by who ? no magazines nothing one u know, one giant throphy and himself with his wife sitting. Blue background photo.<br>2) Now he is a Dr.Steve Tan as off this year 2009. He must have paid a university and got him a Doctorate. Even if you are Dr of writing a thesis in MLM. Please lah , thick skin... Go away <br>3) Picked Xango as his choice of company(resign to do GRI "where he got the money to invest in such a nice porch office ?" distributor who earns SGD50k max as a 200k premier from what i heard. <br>4) Now join venture with James Phang (he knows he got no choice, now he is going all out to con people) Now that u know GRI or www.grandroyale.net . Doris Wood is a good friend of SteveTan (from USA) he goes there to visit her and she comes to visit him often. I shook hands with her before. I asked her about when CHINA is going to legalize mlm there, she got tons of info. A big size old bubbly looking lady.. <br><br>Beware and becarefull , don't join there are tons of good company out there but don't lie and cheat others, KARMA.. What comes around goes around. you will never be happy..</p></div>
