Dont listen to them, it's bullshit... I know for a moment you might be thinking, oh yah what if I end up in some crappy job and lousy pay for the rest of my life... if u are studying now... work hard, have a decent cert and u have a much better chance in life. dont listen to those crap like what graduates have no jobs... if u are a non grad, harder for u to find job... dont be a sucker for money... these mlm ppl are all money minded...they dont care about service nor products, they are only concerned with recruiting.<br><br></div>
