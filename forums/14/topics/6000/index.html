            <div class='col-md body'>I have long since wondered and never come to a conclusion. Where do we come from? Adam and Eve? Particles from the cosmos? Is there even meaning to our lives? What if it's all a lie? A conspiracy? A joke?<br><br>Actually, I think it's really scary to think about such stuff. It makes you question life, the meaning of it, religion etc. Although it might sound dead depressing, if you ever sat down and thought about it, you'd realise that there is some kind of fraud in all this.<br><br>Maybe it's constructed reality. We create the meaning in our lives, we go around explaining the inexplicable, making ourselves great, mighty and important. If we take an atheist stance to it, there'd be no God, no faith to provide the fuel to live on. Are we then living life aimlessly, without promise for a better tomorrow?<br><br>For all we know, we're in a little glass tank and a superior being is looking down on us, laughing at us as we proudly imagine we're the most intelligent beings.<br><br>There are so many stands to take on this. Sure, the fundamentalist Christians will all slam me, as this IS a very controversial topic. But if you are sit back and think about it, use intellectual rigour to test your faith, the result could be intriguing.<br><br>This is of no offence to anyone. I just want to hear what others have to say.<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm what a question, The purpose of life, the unversal and cosmic question of the century. My maybe I just give my humble thoughts on it, since I did give it some thought recently actually.<br><br>Life? The purpose of it? Before we ask ourself such questions, it would be good to reflect on what mankind has evolve to and become over the eons. Ok that's a bit far, but let just look at a typically life cycle. You are created inside the womb.(let's take out test tudes babies for now) You spent 9 months there, asorbing nutrients from your host(Your mother). After that, your first cry is heard in the world. You again start to grow, and learn in the process, as you gain knowledge, and experience life, you form thoughts, theories are made to become the philosophy of your life, you start to classified other lifeforms into your own little catorgaries. You start to learn about survival, morals, values. These form the foundation of your character. As you grow into adulthood, you learn about others, the understanding of oter people, might cause changes to your thoughts and then again your classification of people, and then of course your character, simply put you evolve. You might get married you might not, let's assume you do, then you learn about truly loving another, you learn to care, to tolerate, about respondsibility, and of course, about carrying on your lifeline. Let's say you have a child, and he will inturn go through the same process while you grow old, learn more, evolve more then you die.<br><br>Ok, now, wondered how many times I used the word learn &amp; evolve in the paragraph? Life is about purpose, not without, else, I might just as well, end my life the moment I enter the world, for what would I want to go through it for no value at all?!? the purpose in life is unique, for some it might be major things like bring across world peace and harmony, and to some, smaller like building your family and to contribute your small part to the world in terms of economy, and such. I prefer to look at the universe in a rather abstract term, The universe as a whole consist of a lot of smaller universes, Life. Each life itself is a smaller universe, with their own part in their lifespan to contribute to the bigger universe out there. Does the universe exsist because of us? Or do we exsist because of the universe? Let's put it that we compliment each other. Without life ,the universe is but a empty shell, but without it, life is of no meaning for there is nothing to contribute to.<br><br>Let's now break things up even further. Science has proven that each of us is made up of cells, and cells like all is just life, an atom you may compare it to. Cells the microscopic unit of living matter, is the basis of all life, it's mysterious workings make us what we are, the communication between each is incomprehensible and each of thier purpose unique. Their millions make up one life, and thus the reason of our exsistences, thier contributions to our life is definitely significant but unfound. If we are to compare each of us to a cell, and the universe as a life, then does it expalin the formation of our dependability on each other? It is just a hypothesis, but it's something I thought would explain the formation and purpose of life in this universe.<br><br>Well, just a small part of my views on life. Will post more if anyone like to hear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a story here which might be useful to those who wants to know the purpose of life.<br><br>Once upon a time the great King of Heaven decides to send his beloved son on a sacred mission to earth to find and bring back the "Pearl that resides in the sea"<br><br>Anxious to take on this sacred mission and prove his loyalty, the prince leaves his father's kingdom with great determination. The moment he arrives in this world, however - that is, the moment he is born - he forgets both his mission and his royal origins. Draw to the world's attractions, the hero becomes accustomed to this alien land and finally comes to believe it is the only home he has ever known.<br><br>Time passes. The prince marries, has children, and indulges in the age-old labors and pleasures of human existence, all the while remaining in a state of spiritual forgetfulness.<br><br>Decades go by. Then in his fortieth year, a milestone age for spiritual awakening, the King of Heaven sends his son a message: remember, seek, struggle, accomplish and return. But the prince pays no attention. He is too immersed in life.<br><br>So the King sends the message again, this time in a different form. Again it is ignored.<br><br>Messsage after message is sent down over a period of years. Graudlly the prince begins to comprehend the meaning of these heavenly dispatches and to recognize their urgency. In the end, after much hesitation and many slips and falls, he answers his father's call, finds the Pearl of Great Price-his spiritual nature- and returns home from exile.<br><br>Story ends here. What I wanna say is that everyone of us is the prince. We embarked a journey into life to find our Golden Self and then return to the Promised Land.<br><br>We questioned our existence when the material world doesn't offer permanent satisfaction anymore. We then start to search for other things that will gives us satisfaction.<br><br>Start searching your inner self. Read up books on religion and philosophy. I'm sure this will fill your emptiness that you are filling inside.<br><br>I hope that helps. I'm not good in explaining things, I'm sorry about that. By the way, I'm not a Christian.</div>
