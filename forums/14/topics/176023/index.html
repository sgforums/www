            <div class='col-md body'>huh.. don't want la.. I saw his posts in other threads.. maybe it's truth, but I don't know, it just feel like he's purely attacking Coslab loh..<br><br>Quite sian.. Was talking casually with my friend [from Nu] when then we started talking abt Coslab. She seems quite angry when talk abt Coslab, saying how she don't like Coslab as it's a conning business but I told her every business has got it's sale tactics/marketing style. I don't know how Nuskin works, but I'm certain why she commented about Coslab is through words from others. Think she's now annoyed of me trying to talk her though, thinking I'm a Coslab sales promoter, but all I did is just to highlight every business has got its own way.. But didn't get through.. quite sad.. didn't expect such great impact..but not her wrong too also la.. everyone's got their own view ma.. haha..<br><br>So I hope I can find some answers here... some generic comparison on the sales tactics, not to the extend of who's conning who..<br>I would also want Coslab/Nuskin ppl to comment too ^_^ promote your company <strong>ONLY</strong>, but no flaming ^_^.<br></div>

Multi million dollars company plus it has a proven track record and you only need to do online marketing. Please note, I hate MLM and the reason I ask you to join mine is because you're willing to put yourself into the most disgusting industry ever and I might as well take advantage of you rather than let others do it.</div>

Coslab is also a multi-international company and it is also a manufacturing-based company with a 24 years traditional business history. I juz dunno why people alway prefer ang mor? Are their moon rounder then ours?? lolx! Anyway, both companies have their own cultures and it's up to u to decide which u wan to join.. no point asking people to promote for their companies here. For ur info, i'm from Coslab, but if i promote for my company, will u join me? No right! so pls cut the crap... u wan to know more abt the company, go down and see for urself, always believe ur eyes.. not ur ears.
