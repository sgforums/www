              <p>Ask them, wher do they put their money in.</p>
              <p>If they say "very hard to explain", probe and probe until they break. You must get to the bottom of this. If they say "private company", you then say, as an investor you have all right to know where they put the money into.</p>

              <p>One, you don't have a basic pay. All by commission. Basic logic says a guaranteed stable monthly income is better than commission based.</p>
              <p><br>Two, commission only single digit percentage. Varies from company to company. Your upline is gonna take the great majority of your sales. Try getting your MLM friends to go on strike for a week, or say 2 weeks. See how the uplines react</p>
              <p>Three. Income, who did you hear from? Okay nevermind that. Ask them where do they get their income from, how much. What are the chances of success. Do they preach having 5 digit income? Ask them for Balance Sheet, Financial Report, Profit &amp; Loss statements. LOL. It's like saying... I see some artists sell their paintings for 50M USD, so I buy easels, canvasses and paints, and hope to have their kind of sales. Success? High monetary income? It's extreme materialism to link high earnings with success.</p>
              <p>Promoting? I suggest you approach promoting agencies, rather than MLM. At least you have a small basic pay. MLM? They may teach u to trick people down. At least that's what is going on at Enyouth and Venture Era.  :)</p>
              <p>Ever wonder why your friend sound so desperate, so pushing? Because they would gain a cut from your sales if u were to join them as part of the network. Some companies offer rewards for introducing new ppl into the company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they preach success, 5 digit earnings, and people seem to worship the uplines, the company is very fishy. Like some cult. See Venture Era, Enyouth or Sunshine Empire</p>
