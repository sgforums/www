That is an initial membership fee.<br><br>Each new paying member he brings in, he will recieve 2 % (out of the 10%). He will be promoted to Assistant CG leader when he recruited 10 members or his total monthly pool (total of what he and his recruits contribution) reaches $X.<br><br>Of course other than getting some income from recruiting people, he can also go about selling the music cd and sermons.</div></blockquote>praise the Lord, I had never thought bringing in new member to church can make money! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>For me, my church friend bring their family and friend because they wish they can be touched by the message and be saved into eternal salvation.<br><br>As for the 10% monthly contribution, it's obtain by God's people according to the bible, they call it tithe (in any form of offering; financial, service, time etc) as in bring in first fruit of their harvest to God, and it's stated in the bible, that we tithe to Jesus, but in this world the church received on behalf of Him.<br>My church don't ask new member to tithe openly, whoever wish to tithe will have to register with the church and get more material on the topic before start tithing.<br><br>While the service offering (giving after service) is up to the congregation how much they want to give. Most offering and tithe are collected for church expenses, including staff salary (which include pastors also). Pastors have all the right to collect reasonable salary since they are the one giving spiritual food to the congregation. But promoting church member according to how many members they bring in/monthly pool? it's like sales man hitting quota every month! How strange??<br><br>As for selling tape/CD.. we put it under the ministry arm instead of personal gain, so what every profit (hardly because they are selling it at almost cost price) goes back to church mantainence.<br></div>
