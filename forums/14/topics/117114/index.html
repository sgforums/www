            <div class='col-md body'>Though I am not Christian, and i am in MLM, but it is not ethical to speak bad about the religion, it is the ethusaism of the followers to believe in the higher power, just like some of us here, including myself. When we feel helpless against some incidents, we will go to the temple to pray for the well-being. The way of the CHC is that they are trying to salvage the "sinned" and hope they repent. Religion is something that lead you to the correct path, the contribution that they offer is just like we go temple pray and give xiang you qian, it is just that they are done in a systematic manner, if you do not want to contribute, it is fine actually, just like you go temple pray pray, then never contribute, same meaning. I do not want to classify religion as a sacred kinda of thing, nor the same for MLM though it is a better way of leading a better life.<br>But come to think of it, be it Religion or MLM, it will all depend the people in the "system", one pastor whom was in the news was suspected of misappropriating of funds, there are also people who use MLM to do fraud/scam.<br>Please do not judge the Religion or MLM by the people, judge it when you are the person in the shoes/system and not the one walking around bared-footed, remarking about this and that.<br>Sometimes, religion or MLM is also like the Matrix, you take the red pill, you maybe the "One", but if you take the blue pill, that's it. Furthermore, just to correct about the ranking system in Christianity, the most you can work up to is the senior cell group leader and not to the arch pastor, cos the "One" they believe in will distribute the kinda appointment they will be holding in the church and not based on democracy, however, MLM wise, with your hard work, good product, good company, etc, you will reach the peak if you don't give up.<br>Just my 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

May be.... we can use really copy the MLM way and build a church and be richer than ....!<br><br>The ranks goes like this:<br>Arch Pastor<br>Senior Pastor<br>Junior pastor<br>Pastor undergrad<br>Senior Cell group leader<br>Cell group leader<br>Assistant cell group leader<br>Normal member<br><br>A person starts as a normal member by contributing 10% of his salary every month. That is an initial membership fee.<br><br>Each new paying member he brings in, he will recieve 2 % (out of the 10%). He will be promoted to Assistant CG leader when he recruited 10 members or his total monthly pool (total of what he and his recruits contribution) reaches $X.<br><br>Of course other than getting some income from recruiting people, he can also go about selling the music cd and sermons.</div></blockquote>the purpose of the church is to transform lives, nort to rake in revenue for its pastors. i'm afraid you haf a misconception of the christian faith as a whole. a church is considered by many christians to be the house of god, it has no room for pragmatism of any sort. if you read the bible, you will come across a chapter which depicts jesus shouting at the temple goers for conducting their businesses in the temple.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by harder boy:</div><div class="quote_body">harvest money/cash/profits from the city dwellers ?</div></blockquote>according to the holy scriptures, jesus said that the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. he also said that as christians, we ought to obey the great commission which calls us to spread the faith to all the ends of the earth. harvest, in this context, refers to the converts rather than the monetary benefits the church rakes in.</div>
