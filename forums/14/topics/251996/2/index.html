            <div class='col-md body'>that's the basic excuse to catch up with old times. really interesting<br><br>and about the grand daddy instructor? well, I think as biz ideas goes... if it's a good analogy or example, then it's sure to catch on with other MLM-ers, even if it's from a different company.<br><br>Since it's all about passive income and what not right? So everyone use a certain fix set of sure win ideas to use on noobs who don't have an inkling what MLM or network marketing is all about.<br><br>I'll also like to point out, as a form of biz... i see nothing wrong in it. As long as the 'company' can supply me the product once i order it... then it should be ok.<br>However, due to the extensive use of personal 'network' and human relations involved... that's where people draw the time and say MLM is not for me. Well, I'm not a supporter of MLM's so i guess i can say that in our society... we're a long way in accpeting MLM as a way of doing biz<br><br>cheers!</div>
