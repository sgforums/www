            <div class='col-md body'>I think that everyone are networkers. Might it be students, adults, or even kids. Let me ask this question. When you were younger, did you boast to your friends about anything before? Did it ever cross your mind that you are already networking then? Did you ever had friends who end up buying the same bag or clothes as you just because you convinced them that it is nice? Did you ever managed to ask your friends out to go shopping or do anything to u when they didnt wan to at first? Can i say that you are also CONvincing your friends? So are u a CON man since u are a kid???<br><br>Im now working v closely with many businessmen. U realise that they like to go play golf, drink coffee, and even hightea partying. you think they reali go there juz to enjoy ah??? when u ask the actual reason, they will tell u...'this is the best time to noe XXX boss. He will help me in my business.' or "he is very impt to me. he can help me expand my business." Isnt this wat MLM people are doing oso? so can I say that everyone is a networker????
