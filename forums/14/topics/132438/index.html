If those feel that they are being cheated, please do something about it and stop swearing here. The more you guys post here, the more we happy!<br><br>BECOS, ppl have eyes and know that whatever you guys said here is untrue! BUY BMW for Alan lah, go jail because of someone important lah....all these load of crap! Please ask around if he really owns a 5 series car and a double degree!<br><br>The more you said, the stronget the beliefs are the ppl in there! Because we can tell the truth!<br><br>Those who said that they are cheated, did they 'work' for it or not! Did they cooperate with their uplines? I dunno...<br><br>I believes they are slags who just want to make $ w/o makin any effort...so after a month or so, when no income, they started to 'vent their anger here!<br><br>Whatever, whatever.....you can say what you want.. please don't insult others...to me I only see it as YOU are only insulting yourself!</div>
