Sorry, with more insulting and flaming, the only loser from these farce is you, NTI agents, the sellers, because you only scare away more potential customers, us.<br><br>Anyway, customers complaining and blasting how a company or a product sux, there's nothing wrong with that....Get your act(or maybe not haha) to prove otherwise lor, and that means to make your potential customers happy?
