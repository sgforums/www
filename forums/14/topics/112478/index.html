            <div class='col-md body'>Dear friends in this forum.<br><br>I find a lot of negativities in this forum regarding Network Marketing or MLM.<br><br>I just like to share a little information on the same topic.<br><br>In general, I feel that MLM company is not that bad. If the company has proven products, fair compensation plan, good company background and growth potential. This company has gone a long way and it should be good !<br><br>But what makes them bad ?? And why people hate then and loathe them ?<br><br>I feel the main reasons is the distributors themselves.<br><br>Some 'leaders' will form Groups or Systems and usually claims 3 things :<br>1) easy to master<br>2) sure success<br>3) high pay<br><br>Most of them will tell you history that they up-up-uplines make so much money lah, that lah.<br><br>"Sure success ??"<br><br>Recently I had 2 encounters.<br><br>1) Thru the internet, I chatted up (thru email) a guy from the L99 EDC (they advertise on ST Classified too)....they will tell you all kinds of crap about a training program on entrepruership.<br><br>I found out after some exchange of emails that the L88 EDC is nothing but a smoke-screen for their MLM company. they called it System which gaurantee success.<br><br>2) Again thru the internet, I chatted up another guy which we decided to met up....I called him and asked him this question : "are you active in any MLM company"...the answer is "No".<br><br>On meeting him, I double confirm with him again the same question. Still the answer is NO. And his is where a black suit with a red tie and a pin with the letter U. Trying to bluff me !!? I have known people in this System - say 6-4-3.<br><br>Thru out the entire conversation, he will say he used to be in the group. Hack !! If he is not active, how this guy in the right mind wear a suit in the afternoon !?<br><br>What does my 2 experience tell you ?<br><br>It is the specific groups or system (like L99, 6-4-3 or Network-22) that "encourage" their distributors to follow the way they have always get things done - thru smoke screens and deceit.<br><br>These groups will go all out to con people into their talks.....by<br>1) pretending they are a training organisation<br>2) they are not a MLMer.<br><br>And one of the main points about these systems...are they encourage newcomers to join and purchase products way above what is the minimum required by the company...obvious citing this is the system to success.<br><br>I asked them.."is their company that bad that you have to hide them?"...they fell silent.<br><br>These groups merely create conman and give the industry a bad name. These people turn a network marketing company into a pyramid.<br><br>I personally has been involve in the industry for a while now and I learn a lot from the real leaders in the industry, like Big Al, Jerry Clark among others. None of them encourage people to bluff their way to a presenetation.<br><br>Being a real leaders is not just about signing recruits. It is also have the right ethical values and the integrity. This is seriously what is lacking in the industry.<br><br>Hope those "system" people who read this can reflect on it.<br><br>I personlly do not do such things. Every person I brought to event or presentation will know fully what they are into. They will also join with what is necessary.<br><br>I think we need to raise the ethical standards networkers here.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What you say is true, my dear friend, as what u see in my signature. MLM is another form of marketing strategy, also known as relationship marketing, whereby consumers are also rewarded by means of referrals, recruitment is a must for a networker, but nevertheless if one only depends on recruitment and by means of promising good money and deceiving people to achieve this means, it is very wrong. When someone whom I never meet for a long time ask me what I am doing, I just tell him I am doing MLM and not say business cos beating around the bush does not help, it might even deepen the misunderstanding that you are trying to hide something. Thus, i am more concentrated on looking for customers and converting them into networkers rather than strictly on looking for networkers, as when they do not make money, they will leave, whereas customers, unable to achieve what they want, they will continue to use the products.<br>Juz my 2 cents worth.</div>
