Some dont, but not all, especially disguised pyramid schemes.<br><br>Again, I dont agree company selling substandard products should be labelled straightaway as scams. Specifically, companies using products as cover up for a pyramidical scheme can be considered scams right away.<br><br>Nobody say companies should sell at cost. But no salemen should even open this discussion on the table. Two things - focus on the quality of the products and its value for the price its selling, and be aware of the competition by similar products. Its very stupid to see salesmen, when asked why the price so high, retort back by saying companies have the right to price above costs, instead of extolling the virtue of the products and that its worth its price. This is basic salesmen rules.<br><br>Have you ever work? Goodness, many companies, including the one i last worked in, do teach you how to garner sales and they go by commission system. Referral system is the in thing in the corporate world. Where were you man?<br><br>And lastly, your last statement is going to kill you, especially if you meet level headed people during presentation. The government or any usual corporate do work like multi level in that sense, but its basically stabbing on your own foot when you encourage them to join yet another multi level scheme or system.<br><br>Rather, I would have thought as a MLMers, you would have extoll the beauty of leveraging on people effort to earn an exponentially increasing residual income. Even for this point, handle with care, because you wouldnt want people to think they can work solely by leveraging on other people effort.<br><br>People do know they are living in a multi level system of the capitalist class, but its stupid to encourage them to join another, instead of focusing on the greater benefits of the MLM system.<br><br>By the way, I guess you are new huh?<br><br></div>

You want to continue acting like the people owe the company a living, carry on while these people look for their pot of gold elsewhere.<br><br>Seriously, reading thru some of the posts in this forum, its depressing that only few MLMers know what is marketing all abt. The attitude of some, where they think others owe them a living, the others cannot live without MLM, MLM is the only way out rhetorics...they dont understand they are super dependent on income from customers and downlines. The way its go on, one would have the impression MLM can be a closed system.<br><br>Sheesh<br><br>huh?? i didn't say those hu cannot make it in mlm is weakling... its u who mention that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> its a truth fact in general...Have a nice day....</div>

Some dont, but not all, especially disguised pyramid schemes.<br><br>Again, I dont agree company selling substandard products should be labelled straightaway as scams. Specifically, companies using products as cover up for a pyramidical scheme can be considered scams right away.<br><br>Nobody say companies should sell at cost. But no salemen should even open this discussion on the table. Two things - focus on the quality of the products and its value for the price its selling, and be aware of the competition by similar products. Its very stupid to see salesmen, when asked why the price so high, retort back by saying companies have the right to price above costs, instead of extolling the virtue of the products and that its worth its price. This is basic salesmen rules.<br><br>Have you ever work? Goodness, many companies, including the one i last worked in, do teach you how to garner sales and they go by commission system. Referral system is the in thing in the corporate world. Where were you man?<br><br>And lastly, your last statement is going to kill you, especially if you meet level headed people during presentation. The government or any usual corporate do work like multi level in that sense, but its basically stabbing on your own foot when you encourage them to join yet another multi level scheme or system.<br><br>Rather, I would have thought as a MLMers, you would have extoll the beauty of leveraging on people effort to earn an exponentially increasing residual income. Even for this point, handle with care, because you wouldnt want people to think they can work solely by leveraging on other people effort.<br><br>People do know they are living in a multi level system of the capitalist class, but its stupid to encourage them to join another, instead of focusing on the greater benefits of the MLM system.<br><br>By the way, I guess you are new huh?<br><br></div></blockquote>Firstly , I'm not writing those above in the context of garnering sales from writing it, so make this stand very clear.<br><br>As such from the layman's point of view will be clearer to you why only with good products and good management and training system works.<br><br>It very much depends on the people doing it. You can have a very good product and it lands in the hands of corrupted Salesmen who only wants quick profits by leveraging the sales by making poor downlines stock upfront.

You argued along that government and other aspects of the capitalist system is pyramid-like, i point out that it doesnt make sense to encourage people to join yet another pyramid like scheme. Thats why my whole argument is based on the point you have to approach this with caution, whether you are arguing during sales presentation or for the sake of discussion.<br><br>Actually, to be truthful, I cant make head or tails the rest of your post. Your former post state that scams are companies with substandard products, and now you said pyramid scams are made up of people using quality products but leveraging solely on downlines sales.<br><br>I think you are not specific enough, Going by your definitions, almost all companies would have been labelled scams. Like i said, companies using substandard products arent clearly scams yet, unless they use it as a cover for get-rich-quick schemes. Worse, companies having quality products means they are well meaning to sell good stuff to people, but with marketing plans that pretty flawed, to the extent it allows people to abuse it, This is basically MISMANAGMENT. It doesnt mean they have the intention to cheat.<br><br>And your last few paras. are you replying to my post? Seems to be out of context.<br><br></div>
