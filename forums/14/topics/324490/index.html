              <p>If you are lucky enough to hit upon a unique idea and your business grows<br>quickly then you are in the minority (but congratulations!). If you aren’t that<br>lucky, don’t get discouraged.</p>
              <p>Understand that success is available to any person that patiently works<br>towards a goal. Some get there faster than others so if you expect a long<br>ride you may just be pleasantly surprised when you wake up having met<br>your goals six months earlier than expected rather than disappointed when<br>you are only half as far as you thought you would be.</p>
              <p>Network marketing business takes time to perfect. I remembered, ability to<br>setting GOALS was the first learning in this industry and I always practised to<br>do it. Setting GOALS is important for success, If you want to get anything faster<br>than you ever thought, you have to learn how to setting goals and plan to<br>achieve them.</p>
              <p>"People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content with<br> mediocrity, no matter how impressive their other talents"</p>
              <p>Why write down your GOALS?</p>
              <p>I heard 'Jim Rohn' said it best when he said...<br>"If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you<br>go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good<br>things we build enp up building us."</p>
              <p>Goals Can UNLEASH Your Inner Power!</p>
              <p>If you're strong enough with you goals and honestly passionate about what<br>you want in life...these "passion" become the strongest motivation you will<br>ever have in your lifetime!</p>
              <p>There are several different excellent software programs and seminars that <br>deal with this important subject. But I'm not writing this here to sell something.<br>Instead, I've learned one simple method which work extremely well for many<br>highly successful people and would like to share.</p>
              <p>YOUR Personal "REASON WHY"</p>
              <p><strong>Step 1. </strong>This will require a couple sheets blank paper(or a notebook). Start<br>writing down 100 goals as you have that and would like to accomplish over<br>the next 5 to 10 years (you don't have to stop at 100...keep going if you like).<br>Something like:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>-Pay off XYZ loan by___________date.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>-Buy a new big screen TV before__________date.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>-Take a classon [fill in the blank].</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>-Travel to [fill in the blank].</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>-Build up my investment portfolio to $1,500,000 Net Worth on or before _______month/year.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>-Get to the next level position in network marketing business within _________days/month.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>-You get the picture?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It's important to put in some small attainable goals mixed in very BIG DREAM!<br>It feel so very good when you can scratch goals of your list as your business<br>helps you achieve them.</p>
              <p><strong>TIP:</strong> The more specific and measurable your goals are, the more likely you<br>will be able to achieve them.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Take a highlighter marker and highlight YOUR TOP 10 GOALS -those<br>you want to achieve the absolute positively most in your life.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Of YOUR TOP 10 GOALS, single out 5 that you feel right now would be<br>the easiest for you to achieve.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Get three 3 x 5 index cards and write your MOST IMPORTANT 5 GOALS<br>down on each of them all five goals go on each cards.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Put one card where you are sure to see it several times during your days<br>(for example, maybe the dashboard of your car if you drive back and forth to<br>work each day).</p>
              <p><strong>Step 6. </strong>Tape one card to your bathroom mirror where you will see it every<br>morning when you wake up (and maybe you will see it at the end od each day<br>before you sleep at night).</p>
              <p><strong>Step 7. </strong>Put one cards in your wallet or your purse and carried with you. Pull it out<br>and read it when you need the inspiration to focus on where your future is now<br>headed thanks to your home business.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Special Tip:</strong></em> Many succesful people will complete at least on goal on their TOP 5,<br>then repeat the exercise doing a new TOP 5 or keeping the 4 not complelte and<br>adding a new goal to create a new TOP 5 card set.</p>
              <p>"Excellence is not a singular act, but a habit. You are what you repeatedly do." -Aristotle</p>
              <p>You know, a lot of people deride at the idea of writing down their goals - reading them<br>everyday - seeing them everyday....but there is a very powerful reason for doing this.<br>Two things will begin to happen.</p>
              <p>1. You will constantly be reminded of YOUR REASON WHY, something you<br>    will need during the ups and downs of running your own business. This will<br>    be a powerful tool to help you carry your dream through.</p>
              <p>2. You're not going to go into the whole psychology thing of it here, but I<br>    will say this - when your subconscious mind picks up on the message over<br>    and over and over, you may find that you begin attracting the means to<br>    reach your goals a lot faster than you ever imagined.</p>
              <p>Don't believe it? Well, That's OK...Just trust in process--call it an experiment in time<br>and see exactly what happens if you follow through. Make an appointment with yourself<br>to revisit this exercise 5 years into the future(print this exercise) and tell you sponsor<br>what happened!</p>
              <p><strong>HOT TIP: </strong>Some people have accelerated their goals achievement by cutting out pictures that relate to their goals and posting them in a special area (their work cubicle, their home office bulletin board, around their computer monitor) as a constant reminder of the DREAMS they are building thanks to their own business. <br>Try it! You maybe pleasantly rewarded!</p>
              <p>Enjoys,</p>
