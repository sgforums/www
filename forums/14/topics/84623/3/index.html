I speculate u had no such problems perhaps bcos u have very kind friends and relatives who were generous enough to help u cough up a sales amount of $25,000. Cos the calculation for the commission is 8% of your sales and then a currency exchange of 0.8. and they seriously take away $400 for currency exchange from u if u had earned $1,600. From what I know, this currency exchange thing is a scam, cos the goods are not from Japan, so how did the exchange thingy come about?? Pls get back your "currency exchange" though.<br><br>And if I am not wrong, most prob u would have reached AE stage rite? So good, its your turn to recruit people and make money for u. So do u tink its very easy for u to find people who can also generate 25,000 of sales for u a month? Perhaps, maybe 1 out of a 100.<br><br>Most importantly, what we are trying to put across here is not that we are jealous or envious of people making big bucks in MLM, and people like us who are losers, cant make it big, that's why we are "inputting negative thoughts" (sounds familiar huh??) I am sure u have heard this term no less than 10 times in DW. "Don't care about what people say, they are just jealous of what u are going to have. You continue to work hard and earn money, before 20 years old, u can drive a BMW!!!"<br><br>Lastly, I would like to reiterate that we are just telling people about the experience we have been through. You can choose to listen, u can choose to go ahead with what u want to do. I have been writing and commenting on this thread, because I felt really sad that no one gave me warnings about this company such that I have been so badly cheated. I supposed the people who have been actively commenting here, are not that free to come here and stop people from making biggg bucks.. We have better things to do.... If u are doing fine, then all the best to u. and I really think u must be quite a hardworking and determined person to get such a high commission. But pls remember if u are going to reach the top and recruit more people, pls dont cheat people...</div>

I myself could feel the effects, I didnt have any muscle strain after resting on it for an hour. Thats why I continued to push my friends and relatives to buy it. And in the end, my teacher bought 2 pillows from me, he didnt feel any effects at all and I strongly believe some people just couldnt feel anything, while some does. So as a result, I had to fork out my money to pay back my teacher becos he believed in what I said and supported me by buying from me.<br><br>The thing is why u feel that u are doing nothing wrong (in fact u are doing nothing wrong) is because one thing about this job is that u can bring good health to ur relatives. But...<br><br>Have u ever thought what will happen to u if some of ur relatives who bought a $2K bed padding from u doesnt feel any effects? Are u sincere enough to pay them back on ur own? <span style="color: red;">Or do u think DW will offer a refund!! IMPOSSIBLE!!</span> Or will u just try to smoke ur way through and tell them they will feel effects after using it for a longer time? (That's how the DW people try to convince their unsatisfied customers)<br><br>Moreover, did they tell u the product is from Japan or that the company has got sth to do with Japan? Get this right, my <span style="color: blue;">upline once told me (after we have quitted) that all these goods are inferior goods from CHina</span>, they only sent it for nice DW packaging then marking the price up. Original magnetotherapy goods from Japan is not like that...<br><br>If u have read my first post, I said that I went to the Small Claims Tribunal to file for a claim. At there, the manager he told the referree that the goods are not Japan, they didnt say it was from Japan and it has nothing to do with Japan. But the fact was that they did say its from Japan, Dw's signboard had a JAPAN word on it and ur deduction of 20% from ur pay is a currency exchange thingy for Japan goods. Arent they contradicting themselves??? <span style="color: red;">This is PLAIN CHEATING u of ur hard-earned money!!!!! Can't u see how money-crazed they are?? They are just offering a small 8% of ur sales and they still want to cheat another 20% of ur miserable pay!!!!!!!!!</span><br><br>And I speculate that u have ard $25,000 worth of sales to date. Have ur relatives all receive their goods??? Did they tell u it will take a month? what if u cant get ALL of it in a month?? (which u most probably wun get) Go to Small Claims Tribunal?? Go to POLICE??? All this is not going to work because we have tried it and to no avail!<br><br>The main thing about DW's cheating which I have been talking about is that DW they dont deliver the goods to u on time!! and maybe a few months later u dun want to work already, they will make u stay on by not giving the goods. And if in the end, u have made up ur mind, to go against them openly by going to Small Claims Tribunal, they will play rough and there goes ur $25,000!!!! Just like me!! But I am better, I only have ard $2K!!<br><br>If this really happens to u, which I am worried about, what are u going to dO?? <span style="color: darkblue;">Cough up a $25,000 for ur relatives or will u just go against ur conscience and cheat ur relatives instead??!!!</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Moreover, I think we trust the company's people too easily. $25,000! Do u have any idea how much is it?? How can u trust ur upline so easily that u can give them ur $25,000 and u think ur few pieces of invoice is good enough to ask back the money if anything happens!!!???  </span><br><br>All this happened to me!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>I really hope that u can get all ur $25,000 worth of goods... Do keep us informed...</div>
