The main consumers of their biomagnetic products are basically your friends and family. The moment you join that company, they will tell you to write down a list of phone numbers, that of your friends and relatives. To get 'promoted', you gotta reach a certain quota of sales, $10k if i remember correctly. They claim that family and relatives tend to support their children, so it's easy to sell the products to them. They will then instruct you to arrange a meeting for them and your family/relatives, so that they can 'teach you how to make sales'. Your mom/dad/best friend will tend to try to help you out and that is their marketing strategy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sunday Times 25th Jan 2004<br><br>His teen daughter joins company selling 'biomagnetic' mattresses<br>She starts drinking, smoking and keeping late nights<br>Now, she wants to quit school<br>By Arlina Arshad<br><br>BUSINESSMAN Tan Pin Ho set a curfew for his 16-year-old daughter and made her sign an undertaking that she would not sneak out of school to work as a salesgirl.<br><br>Nothing has worked, laments Mr Tan (above), who has been trying to get daughter Yi Zhen to concentrate on her studies. -- ENRIQUE SORIANO<br>He even threatened to lock Yi Zhen up and paid $800 for professional counselling. But she dropped out after a few sessions, he said.<br><br>Nothing has worked and Mr Tan, 57, says he is at his wit's end.<br><br>Instead, Yi Zhen wants to drop out of school to sell expensive 'biomagnetic' mattress pads and comforters for a direct-marketer called DW Group.<br><br>She was 15 when she joined DW in August last year, on a referral by a schoolmate who is her boyfriend, and she has definitely changed for the worse, said Mr Tan.<br><br>She attends group gatherings and talks that end at midnight or later, wakes up too late to go to school, and once came home drunk, he said. And her grades have nosedived.<br><br>Yi Zhen says she can earn $100 to $200 for every item she sells. She has not sold a thing so far, but gets $300 a month in transport and meal allowances.<br><br>Mr Tan said he has tried to get the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the police and her teachers to help. He has even spoken to DW's bosses. But to no avail.<br><br>MOM said that a child may be employed if he is 12 or older in 'light work suited to his capacity'.<br><br>The Direct Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS) says that direct marketers should not recruit anyone below 18.<br><br>But because DW Group is not registered with DSAS, it is not bound by its rules.<br><br>'Whatever it is, there must be parental consent in writing,' said DSAS chairman Benjamin Tan.<br><br>Mr Tan Pin Ho never consented. He didn't even know Yi Zhen was working with DW till she started bugging him and their relatives to buy its $2,880 mattresses.<br><br>'She said she needed to sell one to get promoted to a 'supervisor',' he said.<br><br>'She used to be obedient but now she doesn't believe anything I say. The company has influenced her and she doesn't realise this.'<br><br>He and his wife got divorced in 2001, and Yi Zhen lives with her mother, a 42-year-old insurance agent who wanted to be known only as Madam Tay.<br><br>Madam Tay said: 'We split but that doesn't mean we don't love her.<br><br>'Her colleagues take her to pubs and she smokes. It's not logical that they're selling a health product and yet they do all this.'<br><br>Yi Zhen told The Sunday Times that she sees a 'future with the company'.<br><br>'I used to be quiet but now I can make my own decisions. I want to quit school after my N levels this year and do this full-time,' she said.<br><br>'I want to prove to my parents that 16-year-olds can make it in this industry.'<br><br>She said she goes to DW's office at Apex Tower in Anson Road at 3pm every day, after school, to set up appointments with clients, and she makes two-hour sales presentations outside until as late as midnight.<br><br>Sometimes, she said, she stays back to attend gatherings with the directors because 'I want to learn more from them'.<br><br>'It's not a must but the directors said I've been specially selected because of my good performance and work attitude. So I go,' she said.<br><br>A 17-year-old said he quit DW after six months because his father cut his pocket money and threatened to disown him.<br><br>He said his superiors would take small groups out to pubs in the Orchard and Tanjong Pagar area for drinking sessions, sometimes as often as three times a week.<br><br>'I'd come home late and fall asleep during lessons,' he said.<br><br>His sister, Miss Liu, 24, an administrative executive, said he spent so much time working and earned only $400 a month.<br><br>She said: 'These are just impressionable kids. They dress smartly and think 'biomagnetism' sounds professional. But they know nothing.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Boss: She's not too young to start work<br><br>AT 16, Yi Zhen is not too young to sell mattresses, said DW Group's managing director Joey Tan, 34.<br><br>She's not staff, he said, but gets $100 to $200 for referring clients.<br><br>There are 10 other under-18 'recommenders', he said.<br><br>'It's not wrong to give her some money because she helps me, like a brother to a sister, right?' he said.<br><br>So how can she be a 'supervisor' if she's not on the staff?<br><br>'It's just a term to motivate her,' said Mr Tan, who set up the company in May 2002 and claims it has an annual turnover of $2 million.<br><br>He also said it had 200 staff working in 10 subsidiaries, all selling biomagnetic mattress pads and comforters from Japan.<br><br>A quarter are younger than 20.<br><br>He said his company gives her $300 a month for transport and meals, even if she doesn't make a sale, and she can attend daily two-hour talks to pick up communication, convincing and interpersonal skills.<br><br>'She earns as she learns,' he said. 'Out of so many youngsters, I feel that she has a vision. I feel that she's mature enough to work,' he said.<br><br>But he denies influencing her to cut classes and to quit school.<br><br>'She's not interested in studies, and isn't it better that she works with me than spend her time mixing with bad company?' he said.<br><br>Paper qualifications aren't everything, he added. Mr Tan, who holds a diploma in electrical engineering, said: 'I've never used it to be where I am today.'<br><br>Of the late-night gatherings, Mr Tan said he was aware that his employees go to pubs, but said that the 10 underaged 'recommenders' only get soft drinks.<br><br>Whether or not the teenage workers want to work or study, it is their decision, he said, and added: 'Their parents and I have no right to stop them from doing so.'<br>__________________________________________________________________<br><br>Another article on DW Group<br><br>Big bucks and a BMW... for selling mattresses?<br>People get the hard sell from direct marketing firm<br><br>By Arlina Arshad<br><br>THE teenagers who attended a 'career opportunity' talk by a direct marketing company were told they could earn at least $2,000 a month and own a BMW if they helped sell biomagnetic mattress pads and comforters.<br><br>After watching a short videotape on biomagnetism, the youngsters toured DW Group's Apex Tower office in Anson Road, where certificates of top sales personnel lined the walls.<br><br>Later, they were taken to the carpark, where several BMW and Mercedes sedans were parked, and were told that these were owned by the directors.<br><br>A Sunday Times reader who once sold mattresses for the company said this was how it recruited people.<br><br>She was one of 10 people who called after The Sunday Times published a report last week about a man whose 15-year-old daughter told him she wanted to quit school to sell mattresses for the company.<br><br>Miss Tan Rui Lin, 17, a polytechnic student, who worked with DW for seven months last year, said: 'The company director would say, 'So-and-so didn't complete his studies but he's now a supervisor. Even if you were a graduate, you'd earn only $3,000 to $4,000'.'<br><br>She said she was asked to do a 'market listing' during a two-day training stint. She had to list of the names and telephone numbers of people she knew and specify if they were 'financially stable', 'generous' or 'supportive'.<br><br>Then she was told to make appointments with them, telling them she was doing a health survey. Follow-up action would be taken by her seniors.<br><br>She quit when she found she was spending more than she earned.<br><br>She said: 'I'd spend $200 on cab fare every month, going to meetings with customers. And I only got $180 in commissions in seven months. It was not worth it.'<br><br>Madam Claire Bang, 31, a health-care consultant, said her 15-year-old cousin had called her on the eve of her exams, pestering her to buy a mattress.<br><br>'She would call to say she was staying overnight at the office. Directors took her out to party at KTV pubs, telling her it was the way to entertain clients,' said Madam Bang.<br><br>She added: 'When I called the company to ask why staff were made to stay overnight, someone said clients sometimes called at 8am and they needed people to man the phone lines.'<br><br>Her cousin has since left the company.<br><br>When asked, DW Group said its management was willing to clarify any misunderstanding and concerned parties should call 6220-3827 to make an appointment.<br><br>It declined further comment.<br><br>In last Sunday's report, Mr Tan Pin Ho, 57, said his daughter, Yi Zhen, attended group gatherings and talks that ended at midnight or later, and woke up too late to go to school.<br><br>But the company does not just recruit youngsters.<br><br>Mr D.L. Loo, 26, an engineer, wrote to say that his 22-year-old wife quit her second-year polytechnic course last year to work full-time with the company.<br><br>She leaves home at 9am and may return at 7am the following day.<br><br>'I see her only once or twice a week, sometimes once a month as she spends all her time at work. I tell our two-year-old daughter that mummy is working,' he said.<br><br>Mrs S. Adam, 42, said her 21-year-old niece, had shelved plans to study overseas after being involved with the company.<br><br>The police said there had been no complaints so far, but they would look into the matter if a report was lodged.<br><br>Mr Benjamin Tan, chairman of the Direct Selling Association of Singapore, which DW Group does not belong to, said: 'Most of the youngsters are still in school and should be concentrating on their studies. There may be those who may not wish to study but we should not distract them. Even if they are ready and mature, they should get their parents' approval before signing up.'<br><br></div>

He quitted the job after buying it and he did not even receive the pillow.. he kept msging the manager and the manager dint even bother to reply the message. such a fark up company, take money and run already.. and i dont like the way they run the company at all. some1 should do something about this soon man. they are recruiting more n more pple everyday. Especially now its the holiday seasons and there are more innocent youngsters/students joining in.. they will get conned cos the pple working inside will make use of their relationship with parents/relatives/frens to buy their product, knowing that their parents will support them(most of the time).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to heartzzz,<br><br>honestly, i really feel sorry for you.<br>i believe that you are interested in that girl fren of<br>yours or maybe you both are already a pair.<br><br>its bad but normal if you break off due to incompatibility or some differences or 3rd party.<br><br>but its totally fuccking unbelievable and ridiculous to lose your GF to some stupid dreams of financial freedom coming from some MLM company.<br><br>thats why i have also emphasized this a zillion times in this forum and elsewhere. GUARD YOUR LOVE ONES FROM THIS MLM GARBAGE.<br><br>and if you think MLM is bad, wait till you see those LGATs like asiaworks. i believe the next big scam is LGATs after MLM.<br>(large group awareness training)<br><br>do a google on this. i am not going to tell you what it is. i want you to read for yourself and be on your guard against this.<br>i don't want to see ppl losing their 1st GF to MLM and 2nd GF to LGATs.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>my apologies if this post bores some of those lau ciaos in this forum.<br><br><span class="small">TYPICAL LIFE CYCLE OF MLMER<br>1) Mr X gets enticed into joining MLM.<br>He persuades people around him (including YOU) to join him in a new business opportunity,quoting the need to have dual income, need to have entrepreneur spirit, need to change mindset..... He will also quote big and prominent names and corporations and say they are into MLM also...names like Bill Gates, IBM, Microsoft, Nike etc.....<br><br>He also claims that his MLM company is the best, with the best product, best mgmt, best team, best remuneration structure.<br>bankers, lawyers, heart surgeons and 747 pilots have joined this company.<br>top men in this company drives Porsche, lives in 2 bungalows etc....<br><br>He also mentions why things like why work for 40 years and retire for 10years. why not work for 10 years and retire for 40 years.<br><br>2) Mr X stops bothering you, taking it that you are hopeless and stubborn and ignorant.<br>Off he goes on his new "business" venture.<br><br>typical paraniod questions thrown at you in the heat of frustration trying to<br>convince you includes:<br><br>i) pyramid selling? can you explain to me what exactly is pyramid selling and the difference between pyramid selling and MLM????????<br><br>ii) you not interested then you ask so many questions for what???!!!!!<br>iii) if I answer this question of yours, you agree to buy and join???, then???!!!!<br><br>You will see him approaching people in all scenarios from a wedding banquet, a drinking session, a mahjong session, lunch, Incamp training etc.....<br><br>3) Mr X having been rejected by the numerous people that he approaches, now complains to you, and starts to bad-mouth those who reject him, labelling them as no ambition, kiasi, no entrepreneurship and so on. But notice that he will not mention a slight hint of the MLM business he is involved in to you, even if you ask him. Vague answers will be given like new way, new business, new concept of selling.<br><br>4) Mr X now having failed considerably to make good on his MLM business, now makes a call to you, asking casually if you are interested in joining his business venture. at most, he will mention the product itself,(magnetic mattress, health food, gold coin) but not the MLM company name itself.<br><br>5) Mr X could have approach his MLM upline trying to refund the product, but this will not be made known to people whom he had approached. Whether the refund is successful or not, only Mr X knows, (I would see this as something being done BACKSTAGE, away from the audience)<br><br>6) Mr X now still stuck, keeps to himself and stop mentioning the business. this is where the embarassment part comes into play. Extreme embarassment meaning he has shown to you so much faith, hope and promise in the thing at the very beginning and now it has failed him entirely and make him so lost. still he presists and refuses to admit its not working, for saving face sake,<br><br>7) so once in a while Mr X unleashes it again,"how would you like to join me in my business."<br>and the name Robert Kiyosaki is probably a standard dish being served in this whole banquet. </span></div>
