            <div class='col-md body'>In DW, many of them who stay there are some ppl whu have not know the truth on DW Group, some whu are very lost, some looking another way or sources. BUT there are still some of the STUPID who was just promoted to A/M at 1st oct 04 on the special plan that is during July 04. Actually some of those are brainless ppl, they think too easy le $2K or $3K promoted to A/M from S/O sound simple but they still need to go and beg their parent or whoever again to get the product, some even take out their own saving to get promoted. Haiz i feel sad to say so cause some of them working in DW for quite time they dun even earn more them $1K still need to waste more money to be able to there. Haiz i feel sad they themselve was cheated by their own boss again and again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SOmething important to share with u guy is nv attend any talk or any thing regarding abt DW Group when ppl from there invited u. Cause they will brainwash you ppl and tell you studying and education are useless nowaday as they ppl inside there earning BIG BUCK!!!<br>But PLS LAH, sure anot they earn BIG BUCK, haha some of my friends there are borrowing $$$ from me and most importantly their position are A/M somemore. haha. JVD earn 5 digtal income, A/M shld earn at least half of it, how come still need to borrow $$$ hahaha. Tell you all this bulff ppl 1, in DW 1 of the training and teaching is before u really earn the money u muz BULLSHIT to them that u really earn that much cause only this way when ppl join then u really earn that much. There is 1  more teaching is that the company itself teach ppl to borrow $$$ from others but not in DW staff in order to survive and help the company to gain more biz.<br>THIS IS THE FACT!!! I m 1 of them who attend such training by they really tell ppl to go borrow $$$ from others. I believe many ppl who walk very suck in DW or some how A/M or whatever actually no $$$ in pocket and owes others $$$. haha. i got a friend whu work in DW and end up owe the loan shark $2-3k and quit the company. haiz sad to say so.<br>The reason why they tell ppl study and education are useless cause they scare that many student will go back to school after holiday and the source of biz will end like this so they will do to their best to brainwash you and stop you from further your studying and work for them.<br>There are quite afew example.<br>I remember 1 of the talk that was the 1st time at astralmag holdings, the female MC from Giant say she is a diploma student and she earn alot in DW but the diploma did not contritude to the $$$ she earn.<br>So how you ppl feel? Luckily she got diploma and she can say that, if not 1 day DW closed down, haha i think she will be....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tell you all lah, actually the so called JVD dun earn 5 digtal income at all. Cause my very friend who is 1 of the JVD there come to borrow $$$ from me $150. you all can see 1, everything juz need ur brain to think but if u all keep on so sturborn and stay in DW for so-called CAREER, continues and go ahead no 1 will stop u all cause u will end up oweing debt everywhere.<br><br>The JVD if they nv earn any $$$ and they still need to pay rented, power bill and their car,family, etc, u think Joey Tan so gd ar pay everything, wait long long( die also dun have ). For my advise i think u all better quit DW now no matter how much $$$ ,effort or time u invested, the longer you stay there the more worse u will be and 1 day you may end up jumping down from the building as you really owes too much debt.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been in DW for quite some time. Recently i decided to quit, but before that i want to let ppl know that this company is a cheat. I was duped into joining this company by my friend. He told me many things, that he was earning alot of money..this that....all turned out to be bull@&amp;$!. I joined, and asked my dad to buy the products, costing my family a few thousand dollars. I thought that i can actually earn the money back, but the fact is that even the directors of this company earn very little. mostly they earn 1 or 2 thousand dollars, but they brag and lie that they earn 10,000 dollars. They all drive mercedes cars and wear good clothes, but they dont have a single buck in their bank. I heard that many of them owe alot of money, to banks and their friends. I sincerely felt that it was a good company when i joined, so i recruited quite a few of my friends. At that time i didnt feel that there was anything wrong. But even after a few months there was no progress. I still was earning very little money, just 100 - 400 a month. Still i kept on trying but when i realised that even the directors earn so little money i decided to quit. I feel i did not make a mistake in buying the product because my parents notice the difference. But this company tries to make use of young teenagers to feed their own greed. There are many ppl who quit their school and their jobs to be part of this company. The management at DW condemn education and keep asking students to quit their schools to join this company. It is for this reason i really feel that we should warn as many ppl as possible to think before joining this company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In DW Group when they make full use of you until dun need you, they will terminal you. An live example is the female JVD promoted just on July 04 from LW Holdings. She contribute a great number of sales to DW last yr and became the top sniper of last yr whole yr some more... But during she was a JVD she nv contribute much sales, so the company terminal her off and came out a Memo and set to all JV holdings abt her. I feel that the company was very bad and i feel no secure if 1 day i became JVD, will i end up like her??<br></div>
