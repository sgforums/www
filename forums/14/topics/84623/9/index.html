            <div class='col-md body'>Long time since i never vist this forum. Still alot of gossip whether is true or fake. Don't think high society or successful people have time to gossip around. Haha. I love coming in to this forum as able to see alot of comments that people not happy, grumble or being both director and actors here. How true all this can be? Think mature enough people will understand. Why let your fingers do the talking, do direct approach to them! Slap them hard on the face and demand for an explaination. If it's true! No point telling stories or invent new stories.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
