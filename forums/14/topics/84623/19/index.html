This company even got into the strait times a few years ago and its still operating now...If the police can stop them (If they are doing anything), then do u think it can open until now? If i can stop them i'll do anything to do so lor, but i'm powerless to do anything...can only advise those young teenagers here about this company only...Haizz</div>

Some people just don't understand...They think its okay to let their bosses or upline earn the money they got from their loved ones...Coz they had been brainwashed until can't differenciate what's right or wrong...They just follow what the bosses tell them to do...If u got friends or close ones working inside then u will know what i mean and feel....<br><br>Anyway, its wise of you to leave...Warn your friends also so that such things will not happen to them...You will never want someone close to you to join this company...It will ruin their life...</div>
