            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by singlish04:</div><div class="quote_body">1st - DW is a MLM company.<br>to answer your question g to to this web site, http://www.dsas.org.sg/dsas/Html/afterlogin.htm<br><br>If they are not reg inside then they are in big trouble, you can check the "Singapore  Law" DW is a full MLM company. cos they earn the money from the agent stright up to the boss.<br><br>2nd - Have you sign and black and white? once you are employee as a agent or full time staff atleast must have a black and white from the company saying you are working there. The reson they never give is they can cover their own ASS. if you don;t believe you can check with the other guys working there, have they sign anything?<br><br>3rd - If their product are so good why not sell them to dealer... like OSIM. Please open your eyes and ears... take a good look from outside the skin.<br><br>Where got a company ask ppl to work and no black and white on their pay out or other term... </div></blockquote>Just want to note on ur first and third point.<br><br>Singapore MLM industry is wholly unregulated. The only "regulations" are the MLM Act, changed in 2000 and 2001.<br><br>An MLM company need not to be registered. There is no provisions for such action. Besides, u mistaken the function of DSAS, which only admit members who abide by its refund policy and rules on hard pressure selling. Meaning, any company can be MLM if it want to, just register for business as per Company Act and open its doors. DSAS members are direct selling (including MLM) companies who abide by its rules, which place a lot of emphasis on refund policy and hard selling. DSAS members are supposedly more ethical in its transactions than any other non DSAS members.<br><br>Note: All MLM companies are direct selling companies, but not all DS companies are MLM<br><br>On ur third point...<br><br>If they use a third party as an intermediary, it defeats the purpose of direct selling. Please note: direct selling is an evolution from traditional form of selling  such as retailing.<br><br>When a company posseses a product it wishes to sell (good or bad), it has the options of many marketing channels, including selling thru wholesalers, retailers or using a network of professional salesmen, or ordinary distributors as in MLM, SLM.<br><br>Therefore, it chooses the marketng channel it see as the most effective way to market its products. A chosen marketing mode cannot reveal how good a product is, until we purchase it and use it.<br><br>Do note also, many statutes such as the Fair Trading Act, Advertising Act, Sales of Goods Act arises from unfair or overclaimed products advertising by business, many of them retailers and other marketing intermediaries.<br><br>Just my dua sens.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi singlish04, I see that u have raised some critical questions!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Yupz, while I was working there, I <span style="color: red;">didnt sign </span>any proper employment document at all... I merely signed the application form which I filled in on the day of the interview. There was no direct proof of our employment to DW Group. The only proof we could offer to the Small Claims Tribunal at that time, was the signature of one of the managers on the invoices.<br><br>As for the reason why they werent registered with DSAS, one reason is because if u are a member of DSAS, there is <span style="color: blue;">a rule that u have to give ur customers a cooling period of 7 days. </span>(ie which means if ur customer doesnt want to buy within 7 days, u have to offer a full refund). In fact ziggyboy, <span style="color: red;">don't u agree that most of ur sales were closed under high pressure situations? If ur relatives and friends know that they can change their mind within 7 days, do u think u can still hit ur sales of $25,000?</span> I think u know the answer to this question better than anyone else.<br><br>I am sure they taught u the seating arrangement thingy during an appointment. Why do u think u have to <span style="color: blue;">corner </span>ur prospect in order to sell sth which u strongly believe is healthy and value-for-money??? They couldnt sell it to dealers because of 2 main reasons:<br><br><span style="color: red;">1. No one will be so stupid to go into a shop and be bombarded by hard core salesman, and be forced to pay for a $2K product.<br><br>2. No dealers except gullible teenagers like us, will let these money suckers take 92% of the total sales and then willingly allowed them to deduct another 20% for currency exchange.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ziggyboy,<br><br>Another recent case of someone getting cheated of $300 plus as DW has failed to deliver the goods. Pls visit this thread:<br><br>http://ww.w.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=88789&amp;page=0<br><br>I think most importantly now, we shouldn't try to force u to believe in what we are saying. My advice to u: <span style="color: red;">Keep an open mind and act rationally. We are not that materialistic to let a BMW make us lose our rationale and ability to analyse the situation.</span><br><br>I sincerely hope that u can get all your products for the sales u have closed. Maybe u can try to observe if there are any delaying tactics on their side and then relate it to what we are saying. When u can figure and link everything together with a clear mind, u will see the truth in what we are saying.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi laurence82,<br><br>I tink these companies are just trying to get around the loopholes of the legal system... In fact, I already have a couple of friends who needs help to get back their money. Since there are many who have been cheated, I suppose we can gather all these people and divide the costs for engaging a lawyer to get back our lump sum from DW... I think it will become an issue if ard 20 individuals are filing against a notorious DW. Or if it doesn't hit the headlines, we can always call up the media..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But seriously, the thought of ziggyboy closing a $25,000 sales is making me lose sleep. I can imagine how those money-crazers are going to splurge his hard-earned money on their own luxurious needs...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lhx_kaze:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi everyone,<br><br>I would just like to share my experience with this company DW Group - KCG Holdings or otherwise now known as EastWing Group. I joined DW Group - KCG Holdings in Dec 2003 located at Apex Tower Tanjong Pagar. In early 2004, KCG Holdings "ventured" out from DW Group and became known as EastWing Group now located at a shophouse at Neil Road, just opposite Cantonment Police Complex.<br><br>I dare to say my working experience in EastWing Group is a really bad experience coz I got cheated a few thousand dollars worth of goods, the infamous health wise mattress worth near $2K each.<br><br>Actually I can tell everyone, the product itself is NOT a scam, because magnetotherapy is rather established in other countries, just that some local companies are actually selling at a very high price, of course thats the way these companies have to survive.<br><br>Well at that time, me and my so-called downline we sold quite a number of goods and as u all know, we have to pay the amount to the management and they promise to give us the goods in one months time. However, we quitted in early March, coz we were really so broke, and we realized that we could not survive in this so-called toughest trade. You can say that we were poor sales personnel, we did not have the skills to survive there. Well, I admit it cos I am glad I did not possess such "surviving" skills.<br><br>I sold a few pillows to my friend and when I quitted I didnt clear all my stocks. When we called the company to ask for the goods, the manager would tried to delay giving us the stocks. Finally, me and my colleague we managed to force the manager to write us an agreement, stipulating by the agreed time, if they couldnt give the goods, we will report to the police. We even got his fingerprint on the agreement.<br><br>In the end, they couldnt produce the goods, and this is actually something which I find quite fishy.. I am really not sure why when we have already paid the full amount, we still couldnt get our goods. The reason given by the manager was the supplier delayed the goods. When I asked the manager for the supplier's no, he IMMEDIATELY changed the topic saying that I shouldnt do this... blah blah blah...<br><br>The next week, my colleague and I we reported the case to the police and the Small Claims Tribunal. We won the case at the SCT and they were supposed to give us back our $2K last month, but up till now we havent get our $$ back. The worst thing is, I had to fork out my own $$ to pay back my friend cos apparently she felt cheated by me for asking her to get their products. By the way, there is no use reporting it to the police, cos they will just take down ur statement and in 2 weeks, they will just write u a letter saying that this is a civilian case, they cant do anything.The managers say they have no $$, but 2 of them are driving BMWs, one of which is a BMW convertible.<br><br>I have to say I am really STUPID, GULLIBLE and NAIVE to have joined the company. I am NOT saying that MLM companies are all cheaters, they are not! but its really my luck for me to have joined EastWing Group. SUbsequently I found a job elsewhere where I get an hourly wage. I do agree that I have learnt quite a lot of presentation skills from my sales job, but u can still learn alot of things elsewhere from other jobs. If MLM really doesnt work for u, just leave. And it is really not suitable for just anyone out there. My new job is quite satisfactory cos I get more benefits over there, if the management did not cheat me of my $$, I would not be here typing so long to share my experience.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">The manager once told our staff, you should always try to CONvince someone, when u cant convince, u try to CONfuse, if not, u try to CONtroll them with ur words. If all fails, u will CON them. </span></span><br><br>I am here not to say any bad about MLM, network marketing or the Japan Life mattresses. My experience with EastWing Group nearly costs me my family, my friends, and my entire savings which is quite precious to a teenager.<br><br>There are many ways for u to succeed, u can do so through MLM too but of course there's a lot for u to learn. I am really regretful that there was no one to tell me their experience, thats why I got cheated by this company. I hope all of u out there will really be careful in choosing which MLM company u all join or will join.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;"><br>* MLM is definitely a good way for u to expand ur investment, believers of MLM are actually very hardworking and determined ppl whom we should respect. BUt my advice is join MLM ONLY if u are at the TOP of the pyramid, otherwise you have to work hard to make $$ for those at the top.</span></span></div></blockquote></div>

I truly feel that this is an insult to ppl in SHORI and Jeff is very rude to Gary and his man. Anyway in DW there is alot of ppl dislike Jeff, his doing is not professional at all.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not much ppl in DW really noes the reason why the price of the bedpad and the pillow increase. Actually the real reason is the boss Joey Tan is getting marry soon and he need to increase the price in order to earn more profit for his wife to go shopping.<br>Right now before 31/12/2004 the pillow is $290 and with GST it will be $304.50 but next yr 2005 it will be $360 and with GST is nearly $400!!! How will somebody get a pillow at this price!!! Telling u guy something, u all can go malaysia, there is an MLM company selling biomagnetism product at KL with have the same pillow, layer and everything the same as DW Biomag STAR (pillow) expect the brand which is not DW costing just RM $259.50( less than S$125).</div>

The 20% actually goes into Joey's pocket as it will be a saving for he to buy new car, house, go drinking, etc.<br><br>In DW, the rent of unit is usually pay by director themselve and there is no much currency exchange as the actually cost price of DW pillow around $50, and the other from around $150 (comforter/ bedpad) to maximum $600 (mattress).</div>
