If it's a small item, I think u can just forget about it and quit now. I am really not sure if they will give u ur item after 1 week, but if u have read my very first post, u will realize that even with the invoice, if they are bent on 'eating' ur money bcos u quit, there's really nothing u can do, unless u are willing to spend lots of $$ to pursue the case.<br><br>As for the salary, during my time it was 8% of what u sold. Assuming u sold a pillow, it's only $23.20. Ur so-called colleagues are not allowed to tell u about the pay scheme, supposedly becos it's sensitive and confidential, but seriously, they just don't want to scare u away when ppl break the news to you in the wrong way. Such things should also be told in a brain-washing session, no?<br><br>But if the product is expensive, maybe try to ask for a refund. That's going to be tough, but if u need help, get an adult to go with you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lhx_kaze:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi everyone,<br><br>I would just like to share my experience with this company DW Group - KCG Holdings or otherwise now known as EastWing Group. I joined DW Group - KCG Holdings in Dec 2003 located at Apex Tower Tanjong Pagar. In early 2004, KCG Holdings "ventured" out from DW Group and became known as EastWing Group now located at a shophouse at Neil Road, just opposite Cantonment Police Complex.<br><br>I dare to say my working experience in EastWing Group is a really bad experience coz I got cheated a few thousand dollars worth of goods, the infamous health wise mattress worth near $2K each.<br><br>Actually I can tell everyone, the product itself is NOT a scam, because magnetotherapy is rather established in other countries, just that some local companies are actually selling at a very high price, of course thats the way these companies have to survive.<br><br>Well at that time, me and my so-called downline we sold quite a number of goods and as u all know, we have to pay the amount to the management and they promise to give us the goods in one months time. However, we quitted in early March, coz we were really so broke, and we realized that we could not survive in this so-called toughest trade. You can say that we were poor sales personnel, we did not have the skills to survive there. Well, I admit it cos I am glad I did not possess such "surviving" skills.<br><br>I sold a few pillows to my friend and when I quitted I didnt clear all my stocks. When we called the company to ask for the goods, the manager would tried to delay giving us the stocks. Finally, me and my colleague we managed to force the manager to write us an agreement, stipulating by the agreed time, if they couldnt give the goods, we will report to the police. We even got his fingerprint on the agreement.<br><br>In the end, they couldnt produce the goods, and this is actually something which I find quite fishy.. I am really not sure why when we have already paid the full amount, we still couldnt get our goods. The reason given by the manager was the supplier delayed the goods. When I asked the manager for the supplier's no, he IMMEDIATELY changed the topic saying that I shouldnt do this... blah blah blah...<br><br>The next week, my colleague and I we reported the case to the police and the Small Claims Tribunal. We won the case at the SCT and they were supposed to give us back our $2K last month, but up till now we havent get our $$ back. The worst thing is, I had to fork out my own $$ to pay back my friend cos apparently she felt cheated by me for asking her to get their products. By the way, there is no use reporting it to the police, cos they will just take down ur statement and in 2 weeks, they will just write u a letter saying that this is a civilian case, they cant do anything.The managers say they have no $$, but 2 of them are driving BMWs, one of which is a BMW convertible.<br><br>I have to say I am really STUPID, GULLIBLE and NAIVE to have joined the company. I am NOT saying that MLM companies are all cheaters, they are not! but its really my luck for me to have joined EastWing Group. SUbsequently I found a job elsewhere where I get an hourly wage. I do agree that I have learnt quite a lot of presentation skills from my sales job, but u can still learn alot of things elsewhere from other jobs. If MLM really doesnt work for u, just leave. And it is really not suitable for just anyone out there. My new job is quite satisfactory cos I get more benefits over there, if the management did not cheat me of my $$, I would not be here typing so long to share my experience.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">The manager once told our staff, you should always try to CONvince someone, when u cant convince, u try to CONfuse, if not, u try to CONtroll them with ur words. If all fails, u will CON them. </span></span><br><br>I am here not to say any bad about MLM, network marketing or the Japan Life mattresses. My experience with EastWing Group nearly costs me my family, my friends, and my entire savings which is quite precious to a teenager.<br><br>There are many ways for u to succeed, u can do so through MLM too but of course there's a lot for u to learn. I am really regretful that there was no one to tell me their experience, thats why I got cheated by this company. I hope all of u out there will really be careful in choosing which MLM company u all join or will join.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;"><br>* MLM is definitely a good way for u to expand ur investment, believers of MLM are actually very hardworking and determined ppl whom we should respect. BUt my advice is join MLM ONLY if u are at the TOP of the pyramid, otherwise you have to work hard to make $$ for those at the top.</span></span></div></blockquote>Wow you sound frustrated....
