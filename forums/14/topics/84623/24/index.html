            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by surferpunk:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't know if this is their new place. Cos I was looking for a job and somehow end up there with my friend. It's near Bugis and is quite near the flea market. The place looks pretty run-down and the excuse is that they are just "expanding" there. As for the magazine, I didn't catch the title but I saw this one lady on the cover page. I can't remember it much due to its insignificance. Initially, I'm interested in the job as there are quite some hot girls. But then, I don't give much s.hit by the time I left the place. This is why.<br><br>When I enter the place, I'm amazed by the office. I buy their excuse that they are expanding as there are some empty cubicles. And it really looked a bit untidy. My friend's friend is the one who intro us to this place. He told us to wait for the interview. I looked around and saw some other guys being interviewed. They looked "inspired". Perhaps their first time in the working world. For me, though I've just finished my As, I've held several other jobs before. So, I've been through all these. While sitting, I looked around and saw a group of boys. And I really mean boys. Wearing shirts and tie. They don't look a bit formal at all. Cos they are just at the corner chit-chatting. I came upon the idea that the place is like a meeting point or something. Next to them are two big boxes of 'I don't know what'.<br><br>Anyway, while waiting, a girl attended to us. I presumed she's about my age. She was the one who gave us more info about the company. As for my friend's friend, he was like very secretive and didn't explain much. Perhaps he's not in position to reveal the trade's secret too early. Anyway, she was explaining why the company is called Dolphin Warriors. "Because dolphin when in the sea, they move together as a group and warrior for their never say die attitude" as quoted.<br><br>I was like thinking..BS man! I wonder why Sony is called Sony or perhaps McDonalds really have a meaning in the words or Nike might have meant something in Latin or something. Anyway, she took us for a tour around the office. Seriously, in my first interview in EVERY job, I've never been showed around until I've finally get the job. So, anyway, she was telling us how global the company is with so many branches in Japan as well as other countries around the world. BS again cos she's like rushing through her words as if she's not comfortable telling us lies. I was like half-listening while admiring her cute looks. Pity her future though. So, she told us about the creator of the company. This Malay lady who is an ITE grad, earning $10k+/mth. And she was IN the office that time. DOING SOME OF THE INTERVIEW!!! I'm like wth!! Is she earning that much because she take multiple positions in the company or is it just a lie?<br><br>Supposedly, got other big heads there as well. While all these were going on, the young group were still just standing around, slacking. Right in front of their boss? I really wonder if any boss don't mind that. Anyway, the application form is really not an application form. Example questions include "What do you plan to achieve in 3 years time?" What does it got to do with an office job. Btw, I was told that the job is an office job.<br><br>Leaving that aside, I waited half an hour for an interview which lasted 5 mins. Which is like talking craps. Like asking what you doing now? I replied finish school. Which school? I feel like replying "Can't you bloody read what I've written in the application form?". A whole load of bull. After that, he told me to go for a 2nd interview 2 days later that is today. I wonder how stupid I must be to fail the 1st interview. From what I read in this thread, it only means more brainwashing. I have no idea of the existence of DW before this. I've only heard of Venture Era. And that is why I check up on DW on the Net. Turns out to be so similar as Venture Era. Except DW is scarier. Damn it! Each time I look for jobs in the Classifieds, most of them are either MLM-related(Apex Tower) or recruiting agencies.<br><br>Anyway, should I go for the second interview? I'm like so bored waiting for NS. Maybe, I should go and have some entertainment, trying to see how they will try to brainwash me. And perhaps raise their hopes with my 'rich' relatives. LOL!</div></blockquote>sounds interesting and fun leh, can somebody bring me along to DW anot?<br><br>sounds fun to go there for a job interview. lol..<br><br>i'm keen in going down for a look.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was also being fooled into DW Group. I saw an ad in classifieds of a company looking for admin assistant. Waste half of my day and time hunting for it before finding it. When I reached there, I was expecting an interviewer to interview me for the job. End up a malay man talking to me that they are looking for people to sell their bio-magnetic mattress and my pay is commission-based. When I asked him about the ad in the newspaper, he deny that they run any ad and said that they already have a girl for admin assistant. Use a unethical way to fool people into coming down. Waste my time and money.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
