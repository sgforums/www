            <div class='col-md body'>OH MY GOODNESS! I think god moved my heart to find out all about DW on the net. Thank god I found this forum! Just for all of your info, I just went for the first interview yesterday. I must admit, they still continue showing you around the building. Boasting with those cars, certs...I know something is just not right but hey, like that one guy, I just smiled and sound impressed. The problem is, this time round, I was interviewed under Giant group or something like that and so far, I've not heard anything about that group from you people. Will it just be the same? I am only 16...I am currently out of school temporarily so I want to find a part time job. I called up that Alfan and he was so determined I can make it even at the first call. And to think that I was immediately offered 2nd interview by the director, something weird is really happening. If I do go there again this Monday, will it be straight away training time? Should I leave before I even got the chance to experience things? I wanted the admins department too but yeah, the director repeatedly asked whether sales position would suit me fine. I said yes because I didn't know what it was all about really. Now, when I read through carefully each post dated back as early as last year or so, I am really starting to worry. What should I do? Yes, I have to agree staffs there are extra kind to all of the interviewee. Even the director herself was kind enough! What good acting skills they have! I think, they should open up a drama class instead of selling biomagnetism goods! I roughly know about the product because, my grandma's sister once told my family that, a distant relative of hers once worked in DW before and tried to sell those mattresses to her at around 3K each. She didn't buy of coz! Who would?!?! I have no idea if she's still working in DW though. Even if she does, I can't recognise her anymore. How sad. Gosh, I think I wrote too long! Someone please help me!!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Hopefully, someone can reply before noon tomorrow!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Don't bother about DW Group now you know they are a scam. As long as you didn't buy anything from them, then you shouldn't feel upset. Move on with your life and just avoid all kinds of MLMs as they only do you more harm than good.</div>

Thank God!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But, I just received a call from the DW company a few hours back reminding me about my 2nd interview tomorrow. After thinking through time and again...I think I finally made up my mind. I'm just gonna go for the 2nd interview tomorrow and see what position I am offered. I hope it's admin because I don't have to handle with sales that way. After all, I'll only be working part time and such. But, if they straight away say I am given the sales position, I'm sorry...I'll back out. Is that a good plan or what? HAHA! I feel like telling them about what I heard about them but with a twist. Of coz I won't say I got all the info from this forum!! If they can CON people, I think I can too. So long as they don't deal with hypnotising, I think I'll be fine. At least now, I have a brief idea of the company's reputation, it's easy to back up everything that I say. I have to put an act too I guess. If anything is ever finalised, I'll make sure I have black and white. That's what my parents say too. Oh man, they don't want to deal with my parents!! They'll regret. Anyhow, I am currently looking in the papers for other kind of jobs too. In fact, I'll go to one interview tomorrow...I hope that company don't have any bad reputation as DW! Sigh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there are 3 interviews, cos they want to see who are the really gullible people, who actually believed what they said and still want to come back. These people who turn up for the 3rd interview will most likely be given a job, in sales. I was in your shoes once, but I didn't turn up for that 3rd interview. The night before, I came to this forum to see if I could find any info on the company, and the rest was history.<br><br>Basically, for the 2nd interview, they brought us to the coffeeshop below the building, past the director's Ferrari. I was interviewed first cos I arrived at the office in the morning first. There were at least 20 people and each interview with the director took at least 15 mins..<br><br>My advice is, don't waste your time going, don't waste your time on these people. Remember, if you think something is too good to be true, it probably is. Good luck for your interview at the other company!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in that case, I guess, I'll just stop going there then. In case they asked, I'll just say I already found a job.

            <div class='col-md body'>this is my own experience in DW Group. i was under the team Royal Magnius. the leader actually told me to convince my dad even though he did not believe in th product. so in actual words he is trying to ask me to con my dad my putting words into his mind so that he will buy the mattress. i read other post on DW mattress. it cost $800 at first however it cos a splitting 2.5k now. isnt the cost of the mattress rising too fast when the quality is the same? the boss actually send one guy to my house in "assisting" me in the sales. the guy consistenly tried to persuade my dad to buy. it took 1 hr before he realized my dad wasnt gonna buy and left. and when i met my friends working together in DW. i actually found out that the boss had one of his workers to follow them home after they insisted that they could not find any suitable buyer that night. one of his worker actually found his way to my friend's uncle house without his consent at 10.30 and left at 12 midnight. so after much thinking my friends and i decided to leave DW. DW is cheating our money even though bio-magnetism is th 'in' thing now. their cost is too high and they manipulate their workers and give them starting pay as low as $600. the only thing i find when i work in DW enjoyable is that the ladies working inside DW are very hot. other than that DW is hell. hope you guys will not fall into their trap and believe them. this is my experience however if some of you doubt me you are more than happy to join that group =)</div>
