            <div class='col-md body'>Here's food for thought<br><br>Lets assume all the posts flaming the company are false and unfounded. The company's management refuses to debate or reply because it believes it's right and all others are wrong.<br><br>Who will win in the end? Hope to see some intelligent response to this.</div>

Take action against the company using  law. Be a gentlement. It just like kids in school, when they be punish or don't like someone, they do things to spoilt someone property or reputation. Of course it's ok to hate someone, but not till the extend of tis cursing right. No one set up a business to spoilt reputation. Please i am not in any MLM or Network companies. I not only post here. Please don't asume. You can lied to anyone, but not urself n GOD. Lenght of service in the company? What attitude u show? Ur objective in Joining a company is to take as part time job, career, or chase after girls? Real reasons to leave a company is terminate, absent without official leave or what? Why push all blame to the company. All human like to push blame to others whereby they always think themselves is always right. Just stop and start thinking. Comment geniune stuffs. Not Condemn. GENIUNE!

            <div class='col-md body'>The other day just before Christmas my friends and I were walking around Orchard and two of them got stuck to do a survey. A few weeks later, last Friday somebody called one of my friend on his hp and told him about the job. Since my friend was going JC first 3 mths he referred the job to us. So me and another friend went down for interview today and the manager Carol interviewed us. We filled out particulars on a form first, den this person told us the manager is only 20 plus and graduated from ITE. She work there for 1 1/2 years and now she's a manager earning $4000 per mth. Carol told us we couldn't do admin work coz we didn't have experience and were not permanent staff and we had to do a second interview tomorrow.<br><br>Then we left the place and went for lunch. Halfway through DW called us and told us we were selected for the job and should go for training tomorrow at 2. I reached home and started doing research on the company and saw all this negative stuff. So me and my friend are now just heading to the company tml and checking things out. Thank god for all this 'testimonials' about DW or we might have been the next young, stupid fresh graduates to fall for their tricks.</div>
