I have a friend who is in DW now and she's now in the AEP position... I know the company is a cheat and I really dun want her to stay and continue to work there... In fact, I actually bought a product from that company because of my friend and the way they conducted the appointment was simply unacceptable... they actually lied to me that my friend needed just one more sale to get promoted<br><br>I know some of you have worked there before and u guys wld hav a better knowledge and understanding of the company than me... pls advice me on how can i help my friend to get out of the company... I've tried persuading her but it didn't work... her reason for staying is that she has spent a lot of time and effort iin the company and doesn't want to give up now... she's aiming to become and S/O...</div></blockquote>Well, exactly, that was one of the tactics taught to the newbies to close sales. Very despicable indeed.<br><br>From my understanding, the only income you got during aep is the commission of the sales you closed, ie to say, you are earning the money of your parents, relatives or close ones, as in those that supported you. As you promote, you will also gain commission from those of your downline. There is no basic pay whatsoever. So, i would say, one have to work very very hard, be it on sales or recruitment. But at the end of the day, the ppl at the top management will gain most of your hard work.<br><br>The company actually brainwash their employees that only the weak gives up and always gives motivational long talk to encourage those who didnt make the sales. Often they will claimed that the boss actually think highly of them and this will further boost their confidence and morale. These are merely tactics.. And many fall for it and think that they are indeed being looked highly upon and worked even harder to prove themselves.<br><br>Perhaps advice her to keep an open mind and not just listen to what her upline say. Have her own stand and perhaps take a step back to really analyze the whole situation.<br><br></div>

Actually JL Holdings they decided to closed down they business in DW since very long ago and they decided to open a brand new company but not Biomagnetism. Their staff there all show no interest to work there, they nv go to the company talk and training at all. Couple of time when my friend there bring ppl to show around the company, they saw that the staff there sitting inside the office and smoke. And usually they closed very early and go outside to look for other source of business. But right now i still dun understand why Mr Jovestsir Png are still there while all his man had leave he.</div>
