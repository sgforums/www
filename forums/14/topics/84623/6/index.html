I believe many of u will be saying i m dreaming or i m wastin my time.. i m jux tryin to convinced myself in the company coz i m already sho deep into this "scam". But may i noe.. are u sure wat ur sae is true.. ur sae alot of complains.. but it seems like always the same few peole toking in this thread.. which company dun make profits..? F&amp;N.. a normal drinks company.. if u check.. a normal can of drink cost $0.12 but we are paying 5 times more.. why? coz dey need to earn.. not only MLM company does it.. u can check it if u dun believe.. true.. maybe u can argue tt no matter how the price rise.. its only a like $1 for the drink while magnetic bedpads cost to thousands.. but itsn't it the same..? the price rise 4-5times.. WHY? earn money.. profiits.. simple as that..  i reply to this thread is not to tell u guys u are wrong.. u hav ur points.. but dun doubt a company just because people spread things bout it.. their so-called "experience".. many MLM companies are thru commission-based plan.. sho if u dun sell.. definitely u wun earn.. sho if u didn't earn $$.. den u shld ask urself "why?".. did u really put in the effort.. true.. some company do ask u to put in $$ to get the bedpads or ani other products.. but the point is.. its ur choice.. if ur parents doesn't hav the products.. and u urself believe in it.. n u noe it can help.. u wish to promote it to ur parents.. n dey eventually bought it.. is it the company's fault? i believe its u urself hu didn't think carefully.. some company kip psychoing their people to put in $$.. to invest.. they will see more returns.. but u have to evauate urself.. no matter u are a teenager or wat.. i believe if u are at least 14 or maybe i shld sae "16 and above.." u shld noe whether its worth it.. of coz if ur parents already have the products.. wat for ask dem put in the $$.. isn't that stupid..? its u urself hu didn't think and u r blaming the company.. furthermore for the magnetic products.. i have seen its usefulness.. if u wan ur parents to use it.. n sho be it.. bt if u wan to invest XTRA $$ into it to gain ur position.. dun blame it on the company that they are brainwashing u.. blame it on urself for not thinking carefully.. another thing i wish to address.. is the magents tt singlish04 sae.. for the price wise.. i believe i explained it above.. how bout this.. u sae its a industrial magnet.. sho i can sae its a cheat company and thus the products doesn't work.. rit?? since its not a medical magent.. den may i ask u.. y do some ppl see effect in it? dun tell me there is a mixture of magnets.. todae.. u buy a product.. or u join a comapny.. dey tell u the product from where from where.. no matter japan amercia or watsoever.. can i sae as long as the products works like wat it supposed to.. isn't it all tt matters..? i m not writin this thread to argue wit u guys. but i feel its really unfair for the companies because u guys dunno the whole detail but jux sae wat ur noe which are all bad things.. todae if u wan to work aniwhere.. think before u do.. dun come and blame the company for brainwashing u.. u are v.innocent.. u got tricked or watsoever.. its you hu didn't think carefully.. dun sae MLM companies.. no matter what also the same.. all i can sae now is.. for those who did not get the products as promised.. if u wan ur $$ back.. its impossible.. but if u still wan the product.. i believe the address is return on the invoice slip.. sho why dun u come down with the invoice and ask for the products.. i believe it will be a beterr and faster way rather den gog thru ur frens.. or ur sho-much hated upliness or managers.. because if u really wan the $$ to be worth while.. at least u can't get a refund u can get the goods.. den jux take the invoice and come down to look for anibody.. please dun gv urself excuses that they will not do anithing..  for DW.. i noe their HQ is at 13th floor.. sho go straight there.. dun sae they wun gv u the goods or wat.. i believe if u go dwn. .they will gv u wat u have ordered and pay for.. thank u</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ermmmmm..... I guess I need to REITERATE what I have been putting across in this thread. The quote regarding the F &amp; N drink is definitely sensible and of course, that's how companies earn their profits.<br><br>I am not saying, I am not saying they cheat people because their goods are very expensive.<br><br>I AM SAYING they cheat people because u dun get ur goods. If u think u can get ur goods just by going down and showing ur invoice, I have TO SAY u are too gullible.<br><br>I DID that. BUT to no avail.<br><br>They did not give me my goods that was due 1 yr ago. 1 YEAR ago.<br><br>Even by going down to the company and showing ur "trumph card" invoice,<br>even by going to the police, to the Small Claims Tribunal, there is no use.<br><br><span style="color: red;">This is what I call PLAIN CHEATING.</span><br><br>P.S: u mention that its the few of us saying bad things here, but do think everyone who have been cheated comes here and read the forums?? I dun think so. Moreover, for a company like DW, I guess the no of people who have been "complaining" here is more than enough to question the creditability of the company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey kaze.. i have read ur reply and i understand ur situation.. may i ask.. are u from EASTWING (KCG Holding) or DW Group? Because if u really had paid for the whole product.. i dun see why they will deny u of the product.. i have heard of people not getting the product but when they actually called or went up.. they actually explained to them that there was too many goods in and out and thus mix up and they was given their goods.. and none had came back for refund or complain.. so i believe if u try one more time.. come down to DW Group if u had purchase it from there and not EASTWING company.. den they will definitely hand u the product if ur invoice got nothing wrong.. i not trying to offend u in aniwae.. but i believe there is no harm doing that rit? maybe this can proved whether u are really cheated or u dun wish to pursue the item animore and jux waste ur $$$..</div>

Care to share more about which holdings u went to and stuff?? u dun haf to worry so much, they wun do anything to u if u go missing in action. Cos when I was doing recruitment for my own network, out of 100 surveys I did, I only managed to persuade 20 to come down to have a look at the company. Out of these 20, only 1 stayed to work as a mattress promoter. In fact, the recruiters themselves knew very well that many people go missing in action, so they wun do anything like that to u, eg asking u to buy their products. But in case they really do that (1% possibility), pls call the police!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey ppl,<br><br>This is nothing to do about my experience working there but how they treated my friend and I when we wanted to apply for the job.<br><br>When my friend and I first arrived for our so called first interview. We were asked to attend a carreer seminar. It was really inspirational and all.<br>Anyway the point is the seminar ends about 1030 pm at night. So tired and both us had to go to work in the morning. So we had to come down for our first interview the next day at 5pm after work . Guess what when we came down we waited for 2 hrs for our interview even though we rushed down from work to be there punctually at 5pm sharp. We were not angry but a bit irritated for their inconsideration. After all that waiting, the first interview were only 5mins long. What a laugh rite...<br><br>So we came down punctually at 5 for the second interview and guess what the interviwer was not there she was out. She didn't even bother to find a replacement. My friend and I decided not to accept this job offer anymore so we decided to come back the next day which was supposedly to be our third interview. We set an appointment with the boss at 5pm sharp so that we can tell him we wanted to decline the job. My friend and I could have just called the company up and said we wanted this job no more. However we felt it was impolite so we came down after work to tell him personally and our reason. Guess what we were forced to leave the place without even telling the boss why we wanted to quit because he was too busy to entertain us.<br><br>I feel the company is so direspectful and inconsiderate for letting us wait for an interview. I thought they would honour the appointments. I mean since they have to set appointments with their clients rite.<br><br>During our second interview they were telling us more about the biomagnetic product. I realise it is nothing spectacular and their explanation are all bull crap. I want to warn people that they should not believe in this product and not fall into their (the company) trap at all. Please I call onto you guys to warn your friends and relatives about this.<br>The cost of the product itself is unreasonable. There are other ways to be healthy and I don't think u have to waste money on this product.<br>Please do reply and tell  me how you feel and if u share the same sentiments as me.<br></div>
