            <div class='col-md body'>i am one of the 'stupid' ones to be cheated by DW group. but its by another branch call Turf holdings. the way turf holding works is they will just squeeze you for alot of sales until you very sick and tired then quit, then they will immediately look for you to close deals with YOU. then they will again, in true DW spirit, cheat ur money and refuse to deliver the stock, meanwhile keep insisiting their policy is to deliver goods on time.!<br><br>i even got cheated by them saying want to borrow money from me, then in the end go use my 'borrowed' money to purchase stocks on my behalf. when i told them i dun wan the stocks, i want my money back, they say cannot lah etc etc keep on push. until i keep on pester them then start to delay the payment etc.  one china girl working part time as student now no more student pass have to go back to china took my money also.<br><br>damn stupid. but DW is cheat!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>If u have read my first post over here, I am sure u know of the bad experience that I have been through... Hi shoutcast, if I am not wrong, they must have told u, the director of LAdy Warriors is a  21 year old female, only a ITE graduate and earning $10 + K a month rite? and they say she has earned herself a baby mercs or sth from the company.<br><br>Get this right, that was what they told me last year and up till now, this lady director still hasnt drove her "baby mercs" over... They are just trying to mark up the amount of money they earn.. If they are really earning $10+ K per month, their annual income would be ard $120K a year, meaning they are eligible to apply for a PLATINUM card. A plat card, not a GOLD card. U can ask them to show u, I doubt anyone of them has it...<br><br>and yes, one thing about them is that they drive luxury cars, if I am not wrong, in the garage near New LEaf cafeteria, there is a blue jaguar, several mercs of the same silver design and a Fair LAdy right?? It is just for a show... They have to do this so that they can CONVINCE people how successful they were, so that people will join this.<br><br><span style="color: red;">IMPORTANT: They will become rich ONLY AFTER u have joined them, not before that. Therefore, they need to fork out money to create a image, a branding. After they have convinced u, they make the money and its your turn to lie to others about how successful u were.</span><br><br>I only earned $100 plus during my 3 months there. So, I really hope people out there especially those finishing A or O Levels not to get cheated by them.. They aim for this people whom they think are gullible and easy to convince..<br><br>One more thing, they like to do their survey at Orchard MRT, outside Heerens and many parts of Orchard. If they give u a "JOB MARKET SURVEY" and ask u to do, just give a false number. <span style="color: brown;">THe actual aim of the survey is to get the telephone numbers of the surveyees aka the prey. </span>During the survey, they will try to engage in a conversation with u so that u can be comfortable with them. After that, they will try all means to convince u to go down to the company. And MOST IMPORTANTLY, over the phone, they will tell u " We have many vacancies, such as ADMIN, telemarketing, data entry blah blah blah...<br><br><span style="color: red;">GET THIS CLEAR, there is NO ADMIN job at all.. Only SALES positions... and<br>its not just sales...</span><br><br>They cheat ur money after u placed the order by not delivering the goods and eventually not giving u ur goods..<br><br></div>

These new members become the first layer of "consumers", where you get the first layer of commission of whatever they consum or "sell".<br></div>
