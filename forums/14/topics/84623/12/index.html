At the end of the day, u'll discover that they only put on a mask to face you....<br><br>I'm filled with anger and disappointment about DW... too many youngsters hold on to the belief and stayed in that company, but they DESTROYED their dreams....................................<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See how DW people defend themselves from now on? They've been the subject of insults, critisism, flaming, attacks etc for so long and they're still alive and kicking. You gotta give credit for that. Will YOU be able to take all this? I'm not siding, my point is DW has a share of good and bad points. In life, often only bad points are mentioned.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, it's going to be lengthy. Do bare with me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>If i didn't recall wrongly, it was around Feb 2003 when I was around Orchard MRT waiting for my friend to arrive. Got approached by some guy doing a survey for a new start up company looking for staff. I do recall him asking about my future ambitions and saying that they have many posts like admin and IT. I thought that was the last I saw of him, until one month later he called me and asked me if I was free and if I'd like to go over to their office for an interview.<br><br>So I went down to Apex Tower for an interview. I do remember waiting quite long for my turn because there were several other people there as well. Prior to the interview, I was taken around the building to their different offices and, yes, to their garage. They also showed me the wall whereby they have all the achievements of the staffs, like top sales for the month ending Jan, etc. My first impression of the office was pretty lively - it was pretty bright and dynamic. The other offices pales a lot in comparison to the KCG office. Perhaps it was the painting.<br><br>Anyway, I found the idea of those achievements on the wall pretty dumb. First off, it's not as if it's some kind of recognised award or something mind you, it was just a piece of paper on the office wall where nobody else except the people who work there will see, so what hang those eye sores all over the wall? Also, I found the cars in the garage in pretty shabby conditions. It's not as if they're gleaming and shiny new cars - they look more like 4 years old or 2nd hand cars. Of cause, I didn't really say anything and just smiled when they showed me all those stuff.<br><br>I didn't get my interview until almost 2 to 3 hours later. In the meantime, I was shone a presentation and an ancient documentary from TV 12. The tape was in such bad condition that I couldn't really watch anything, so the remaining 2 hours was spent sitting around doing nothing...<br><br>The interview was pretty smooth, with Kelvin trying to strike at obvious similarities between the two of us, like religion and family, and doing some business outlook calculations akin to counting your chickens before the eggs hatch. Since it was the holidays and I had nothing better to do, I decided to agree working for fun. Anyway, there wasn't a contractual agreement or anything to sign. I only remember filling a form with my particulars. I recalled them asking if I had any questions and I said no. Then Kelvin mentioned not even the pay, and I said no as well. Then he and the person who surveyed me gawked at each other and ushered me out. Thinking about it now, I supposed they didn't plan to pay me.<br><br>The next day, I, and a few others, was given several sheets of paper to list down the names and contacts of my relatives and friends, label our relationship between hot, warm or cold, and attended some kind of a training session (which amazingly took less than an hour) in their already crammed pantry room. The training was conducted by Geoff, and I recall him mentioning the convince, confuse, control and con theory. Also throughout my stay there, they kept reiterating the fact that sales is the toughest job in the world. Perhaps so for bad salespeople. I also recall them promoting competition within the workplace, which contributes largely to the amount of politics in the office.<br><br>A typical day at work would be going to the office at 9AM, spend the day making appointments and going out to meet the appointments, debriefing at the end of the day and sitting in the kopi-tiam (which will leave a thick oily smell on your clothes) beside the garage chit chatting. I believe that most, if not all, of the people at KCG smokes. And everyday, I'd see new people sitting outside Kelvin's office waiting to be interviewed, given sheets of paper for contacts and more new faces making phone calls everyday.<br><br>Anyway, immediately after the meeting, the group of us, now full-fledged professionals after an hour's  training, were told to start making appointments. I can vividly recall that almost everyone I spoke to at the office talking about raising awareness, and closing the sales wasn't as important as raising awareness. I found out the opposite after my first appointment.<br><br>My first appointment was with a female friend of mine. I remember the person going along with me to do the sales, I can't remember his name but let's call him Joe, telling me how to choose strategic places in order to "trap" a prospect in place. Joe chose a corner seat inside on of the eateries at Far East with my friend sitting in the corner, with myself sitting next to her and Joe sitting opposite us. Then Joe would wait around outside for my friend to meet up with me first, and I would be supposed to tell this friend of mine that Joe was a busy man and was doing some customer service in the area and would be arriving in 14 minutes time. Truth was Joe was just somewhere outside the eatery watching me build rapport with my friend.<br><br>Anyway, Joe came in soon enough and went through the presentation. Long story short, Joe asked me friend if she agreed with the product and she said yes. Joe promptly took out a purchase order slip, wrote down something and asked her to sign it. I was stunned, as was my friend. Joe spent the next 30 minutes trying to get her to sign and I didn't say a word at all. Fact was I felt extremely betrayed by Joe. I can still remember Joe kicking me under the table to get me to convince my friend to sign but I just glared at him. True enough, Joe failed to convince my friend and he tried to confuse her. It didn't work so he tried to control her by using her words against her. In the end, I broke up the entire thing because my friend had to work and was already late. I was totally embarrassed.<br><br>Joe was angry of cause, and he asked me when I kept quiet. I rebutted by saying that the main goal was to rise awareness, and that was not the way to do so. And in true salesman form, he retorted what's the point of meeting and using so much time when we never close a sale. I spent the rest of the day at the office hearing the same thing both Kelvin and Calvin. Of cause, I had other plans, but I've already made up my mind by then to leave. I really didn't need the money anyway.<br><br>Even before I was allowed to leave, they put me through a barrage of talks on successful people don't give up so easily and such things. But heck, I just nodded my head and said I've made up my mind. Anyway, before I left Christine (if I didn't remember wrongly, the ITE girl?) went out with me and she told me not to give up so easily in life.<br><br>With that, she went to the staircase to smoke.<br><br>Strangely, after many months I've left DW KCG, Christine called me and asked me for one referral saying she needs one last sales to meet target and get promotion. I said no and that's the last I've heard of them.<br><br>I hope this does not come across as flaming post, and more of a neutral one for readers to decide whether or not they should engage in such activities.</div>
