So the more people he brings the more points he gets.<br><br>What are your views? anyway good ting i didnt join DW man, i was really close to joing them, my so call UPline was relatively nice and we could click aha. but thank god for this thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, im new to this forum, very interesting and informative....<br><br>Anyway regarding Asayo Group, i thought it is a much better company than DW or astromag because it is the only company that carries the JapanLife product? JapanLife is well established in many countries and even have their own research labs etc...<br><br>DW claimed to have products coming from Japan as well, but little do their customers nor the agents know that in fact it is made in China with much poorer quality, and even had that "made in Japan" tag purposely sewed to their products...Most of these bio-magnetic MLM bosses actually came from Asayo Group, because it seems that Asayo's boss was unable to properly control the expanding business during Asayo's heydays, leading to his men betraying him and forming other companies to steal his business, and causing many other cashflow problems as well. That is why some previous Asayo's customers was unable to collect their products, because the trouble the betrayers created.<br><br>This is what i heard from a friend, who have tried to clarify many misunderstandings in this bio-magnetic trade in singapore. What a saga...</div>
