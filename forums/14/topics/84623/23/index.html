            <div class='col-md body'><br>I joined this company in March 2005. After 4 months I became an assistant manager, but I was earning <strong>$50 a month</strong>. I was in 4 figure debts...reaching 5 figures. Finally after 6 months in the company, I quit in October 2006. I had a BGR with another manager, and our director said he wasn't letting us quit...he was terminating us using our BGR.. The miserable few hundred dollars we had earned for the month of October was not given to us.<br><br>I was very angry...My director's last words to me was 'ni bu ren(2), wo bu yi(4)'. I felt betrayed. I calculated my debts...it was around 10k...I was lost and was desperate to get a job fast to clear my debts. I went for interviews, proudly proclaiming that I was an assistant manger in a Sales Company dealing with magnetic mattresses. The interviewers told me they don't believe in MLM shit. From an assistant manager in DW, I went all the way down to doing room service in Raffles  Hotel.<br><br>1 year has passed. The anger I had for the company has died down. I am now working in a bank earning around $3000 a month. I am still clearing my debts, it seems like eternity...But I did learn a lot of sales stuff from DW, so just take it that I paid $10,000 for their lessons lor...and some magnetic stuff.<br><br>To all of you, DW is a good learning ground, just don't be like me or hanyun go and borrow so much money and throw into that company. The economy outside is not as bad as they say. I'm don't even have a diploma, yet I'm getting $3000 a month, with CPF contribution somemore!<br><br>And to Hanyun, I just saw your statement that's why I'm writing this now. Before I left DW I saw you borrowing and borrowing and felt sorry for you...  Didn't know it would amount to $30000... Hope you are doing fine now. My gf just told me funny thing is...we all knew it won't work, yet we still did it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The moment I walked into Venture Era I had a bad feeling, cuz all their staff looked too young and just...super shady. My friend and I were just there to find out more about the job, but the longer we stayed the more suspicious we got. I don't think any bona fide, ethical company would spend a couple hours dangling promises of lucrative benefits and promotion/experience prospects to lure you to work with their company. Everything was just too good to be true--promotions that can occur within weeks, even days, amazing car incentives for the top, etc etc. It just shows that they're super desperate for people-preferably young and gullible--to work for them. There was not a single older person present, everyone looked either in their late teens or, at the very most, 20s. Which is really weird, cuz most big businesses looking to expand usually have at least a few mature staff; most young companies tend to be smaller in terms of staffing--why use more people, when it means more of the company's profits will leak out in the form of salaries and commissions? Throughout the demo, I asked quite a few questions about the business, and the answers the agent gavesimply made me more suspicious. E.g, :How much profit does the company make?" "A few million".<br><br>Well, if that's so, your company certainly doesn't look it. I guess most of it went into those amazing car incentives?:p<br><br>The few staff I met didn't speak well, nt the very sales kind of person (to be harsh, they did seem like the gullible, not-so-bright sort). Note that that was thge impression i got before i found out the company did MLM. The agent was quite convincing though, I can see why some people would fall hook line and sinker; cuz everything he said makes logical sense and u can't refute the fact that ppl who work hard reap what they sow, and all that. BUT, it just left a bad taste, especially when he kept implying that uni wasn't as good a choice cuz though fresh grads may earn more at first, yearly increments are low, and in the end marketing for them would pay much better.<br><br>He said, "The job is stressful, but you study in school also very stress what some more no income". I'd say, well at least my CONSCIENCE would be more or less INTACT, and I really would prefer school stress to "dunno whether my clients will run away/will the company really give me my $/how to train my downline" stress. Plus, at least I'd be doing something I like, and if I get a good degree at least my career would more likely than not be more steady and less DUBIOUS.<br><br>He said, "Having had management experience will look good on your resume." I'd say, "Yeah, and it'll look bad cuz it'd be proof that I'm GULLIBLE, cold hearted and money minded. Which is not part of my intended image."<br><br>he said, "My friend who's a researcher in the biomed field still earns $2.8 k even after 5 years. I'm earning $3k +" I'd say, well it all sounds good, but have you factored in the externalities? Like how scared your friends and relatives would be of you? Or the fact that it's not doing much for your karma? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> And btw how do i know u're really earning that much?"<br><br>There's a reason why such companies target young people. They say they want new blood, but it's really because young people tend to have less experience with stuff,, don't really know the law or the way businesses work, are more trusting and hence fall for their tricks more easily. Those who still speak up for them, well, I can't force you to wake up, I'm just sad that those businesses have managed to brainwash so many ppl into going crazy for them.  Flaming those who tell the truth/share a certain opinion simply indicates this naivete and the extent of the brainwashing. Boy am I glad the subjects I took  in school taught me to question, analyse and critique what ppl say and do, and look at the context behind them--when u start evaluating things like that (sales pitches etc) you really get a whole new perspective.You don't see things at pure face value any more.<br><br>BTW, we went to DW too. Not much there; they wanted us to fill up this application form even though we said we weren't interesting in being interviewed as yet, and gave very vague replies to our questions. My friends and I left without filling the forms, it was just too disconcerting.<br><br>I'm thinking of harnessing the media to create awareness, then maybe more ppl will come forward and some action can be taken against these companies. What do u think? If more than 1 person tipped the media off I'm sure they'd sit up and take notice.<br></div>

Cos I was looking for a job and somehow end up there with my friend. It's near Bugis and is quite near the flea market. The place looks pretty run-down and the excuse is that they are just "expanding" there. As for the magazine, I didn't catch the title but I saw this one lady on the cover page. I can't remember it much due to its insignificance. Initially, I'm interested in the job as there are quite some hot girls. But then, I don't give much s.hit by the time I left the place. This is why.<br><br>When I enter the place, I'm amazed by the office. I buy their excuse that they are expanding as there are some empty cubicles. And it really looked a bit untidy. My friend's friend is the one who intro us to this place. He told us to wait for the interview. I looked around and saw some other guys being interviewed. They looked "inspired". Perhaps their first time in the working world. For me, though I've just finished my As, I've held several other jobs before. So, I've been through all these. While sitting, I looked around and saw a group of boys. And I really mean boys. Wearing shirts and tie. They don't look a bit formal at all. Cos they are just at the corner chit-chatting. I came upon the idea that the place is like a meeting point or something. Next to them are two big boxes of 'I don't know what'.<br><br>Anyway, while waiting, a girl attended to us. I presumed she's about my age. She was the one who gave us more info about the company. As for my friend's friend, he was like very secretive and didn't explain much. Perhaps he's not in position to reveal the trade's secret too early. Anyway, she was explaining why the company is called Dolphin Warriors. "Because dolphin when in the sea, they move together as a group and warrior for their never say die attitude" as quoted.<br><br>I was like thinking..BS man! I wonder why Sony is called Sony or perhaps McDonalds really have a meaning in the words or Nike might have meant something in Latin or something. Anyway, she took us for a tour around the office. Seriously, in my first interview in EVERY job, I've never been showed around until I've finally get the job. So, anyway, she was telling us how global the company is with so many branches in Japan as well as other countries around the world. BS again cos she's like rushing through her words as if she's not comfortable telling us lies. I was like half-listening while admiring her cute looks. Pity her future though. So, she told us about the creator of the company. This Malay lady who is an ITE grad, earning $10k+/mth. And she was IN the office that time. DOING SOME OF THE INTERVIEW!!! I'm like wth!! Is she earning that much because she take multiple positions in the company or is it just a lie?<br><br>Supposedly, got other big heads there as well. While all these were going on, the young group were still just standing around, slacking. Right in front of their boss? I really wonder if any boss don't mind that. Anyway, the application form is really not an application form. Example questions include "What do you plan to achieve in 3 years time?" What does it got to do with an office job. Btw, I was told that the job is an office job.<br><br>Leaving that aside, I waited half an hour for an interview which lasted 5 mins. Which is like talking craps. Like asking what you doing now? I replied finish school. Which school? I feel like replying "Can't you bloody read what I've written in the application form?". A whole load of bull. After that, he told me to go for a 2nd interview 2 days later that is today. I wonder how stupid I must be to fail the 1st interview. From what I read in this thread, it only means more brainwashing. I have no idea of the existence of DW before this. I've only heard of Venture Era. And that is why I check up on DW on the Net. Turns out to be so similar as Venture Era. Except DW is scarier. Damn it! Each time I look for jobs in the Classifieds, most of them are either MLM-related(Apex Tower) or recruiting agencies.<br><br>Anyway, should I go for the second interview? I'm like so bored waiting for NS. Maybe, I should go and have some entertainment, trying to see how they will try to brainwash me. And perhaps raise their hopes with my 'rich' relatives. LOL!</div>
