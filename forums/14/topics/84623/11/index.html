            <div class='col-md body'>hi everyone, browsing thru the webby and found this thread. well, i'm also a "victim" of DW's MLM. but kinda different cuz i was from the original KCG b4 it broke off frm DW. my SO was a cheat herself. ppl hu used to work in DW will know her. her name is annie. (michael u know her rite?). she's rather popular there. well, she got me and my best fren into great debts. we went in together and was under her. she even tried to cause discord between me and my best fren. and sort of succeeded. i was suspicious of her but cant convince anyone as anything i do in tt company the SO or AM will ask me not to tell anione and blah blah blah.... tt's y i was so suspicious. y so secretive when nothing is wrong? and when they called me, they were promising a "non-political" environment. well, i dont see that there. in KCG, i cant tell who is right and who is wrong. everyone seems so hypocritical.<br><br>ever since i left there i was very wary of surveyors and MLM companies. warning my frenz ard me to not get cheated easily. i feel bad not only tt i was put in debts but also tt i caused my family members to buy those expensive mattress frm me. my aunt bought frm me to help me get promoted. after this experience i really feel very regretful esp to my family. now i will take it as a bad painful lesson.<br>*sigh*</div>

Many people mistaken that DW is the only way toward success but unfortunely it is not, DW will nv make u success. The Boss of DW (Joey Tan) is juz a Big Cheater that make ppl really think that they will success. Be honest many ppl dun really make it( making big bucks) and they landed in debt. Up till now there is alot of sturborn ppl who still dun believe abt the truth of DW is a cheating company, U Won't Success In DW and U Will Nv Success There.<br><br>To Those who are still working in DW: Pls Wake Up, Stop Wasting Ur Time &amp; Effort ended up in debt.<br><br>And for those ppl left DW or having friends in DW, Pls help them to get away from DW or they will ended up badly.</div>

Exorbitant prices like $367 for a magnetic pillow  will instantly turn people off.<br>2.Marketability-which group of people will this product appeal to? Suppose it's $500 for a bottle of miraculous slimming pills, only the highly desperately or gullible will be interested.<br>3.Credibility- Is this product really useful? Does it live up to the qualities it boasts of? Do your personal research on it and NEVER be sweet talked by anyone in that business already.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commission Plan</span>:<br>1. Binary system: Are the returns from direct sales reasonable? Are the leverage bonuses realistic? The conditions for a 'flush'.<br>2. Fineprints: Things like x0.8 for exchange rate fluctuations, x0.9 for shipping charges are detrimental when overlooked.<br><br>My 2 cents worth, hope it helps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

And most of ur sales that help u promte to a/m is from ur family and the real reason u leave is that u dun actually earn any money in DW.<br><br>To me u are also a cheater lah, 2 of my female friend went to ur interview and u try brainwash them by telling them looking at how successful u are and u are a manager, end up u can't convinice and u being them to derrick chin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was in DW. stuck AE and SO for so long. But belief was strong. Blessing in disguise it may be. It came to my horror that they start to change the pay scheme in 2005 after 2 1/2 yrs. Starting 2005 managers and asst jvd cant earn supervisor and manager allowance if sales do not meet 2.5k in a month. No black and white. No one sign agreement. No manager objected (to my disappointment). I guess no JVD fought for the rights of their manager since everyone agrees at that. I was still able to save my supervisor allowance because i was still supervisor. I didnt have the chance to object as i wasnt included in all these management meetings. My friend got promoted to manager in december then jan onwards he never tasted supervisor and manager allowance because he was always put as presenter, never got the chance to build a group.<br><br>People are like zombies in there. No one dares to go against joey tan or wilson tan or whatever he decides his name would be. Because everyone was made to believe. Now that i'm out, it all seems very clear. My own jvd sent and appeal to defer reservist, Fat Larry there jots down his application as "Full Time Sales Assistant". What a joke, there you are, people think highly of u as so-called director, but in the outside world, you are full time sales assistant. Open Yellow pages and you'll see only 2 units registered, DW Group (Biomagnetism) Pte Ltd, and Dw Turf Holdings Pte Ltd. Therefore only these 2 would have Pte Ltd Liabilities.<br><br>Late night stupid meetings and talks, you wont think it's stupid when you are in there. But when you see the real world, you start to see the picture very well. Car Incentive? My friend threw in so much money, close to 60k sales. One month he missed car incentive by a few hundred and he miss for good. One jvd spilled out to me that car incentive is only downpayment, the rest you settle yourself. Call  up an auto car company, you'll find out 1st downpayment for car is negotiable, not worth your 5-digit sales effort.<br><br>To any DW sales people who might read this, welcome to Singapore. you need Singapore Quality Class label or at least people developer award here for people to believe the product is good. you based your convincing one one pathetic ISO from japan/china and uk accredition and sell single set at $2380? its a crazy figure. Singapore known worldwide for its quality management. Dont u think its better joey invest in earning quality status for his product or get new products rather than his ferrari, which he doesnt drive and park beside the rubbish dump? Its a time u want to pick up your business but u buy ferrari instead. One complete internal audit will bring DW down, they lack a lot of black and white. There is no black and white even to say that your pay is so and so much of your turnover. They don't even register their managers as managers in their own staff records, if the definition of JVD in fat larry's records is full time sales asst. Getting Listed is more than just 10mil performance in one year, you need good records and clearance from public accountant.<br><br>This is all i'll say here, now all that im angered of have been put on this page and i will leave it here and not be thinking of the past anymore. It was just a bad and stupid experience, can't change the past. I was once company MC for their seminars, if those who wonder who i am. The day i quit was the day i hosted the seminar, at capital tower where imperial hit top unit. Best Wishes to all, be it you are in DW, or ex DW or just a curious person reading this. It is just my true account. Thats all</div>
