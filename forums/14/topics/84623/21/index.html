            <div class='col-md body'>I came across this job ad in the straits times a couple of weeks back... It said various position available(note tat)... I called up and they fixed an interview for me at Apex Tower... I went for the interview and noticed tat in was held in a small office runned by youths in their twenties who called themselves managers and directors... and the directors highest qualification was 'A' levels... that made me the highest qualified if i have joined the company... They brought me to a interview room to see the young director called some Richard... He interviewed me, told me about the company and showed me his previous paycheck of $11 000... How unprofessional.... I had my doubts oredi... i was then escorted by a lady to see the Asst director... guess wat, they brought me to a coffee shop... &amp;!$$in tweet... and the best part the asst director was toking thrash with me, when i asked him about the job, he din wana tell me anything and told me the details would be told to me in the second interview...<br><br>One of the staff called me to confirm the second interview... he identified himself as calling from Apex tower... wat rubbish... why not the company name? He fixed the interview...<br><br>I went for the 2nd interview mainly to gain some experience and confidence... This time the truth was out... There is oni one position and is tele marketing, you will have to work your way up from there... there is no basic pay and commission could go lower then 500 a month... i was told to come for the 3rd interview... haha... this was getting fun... They wasted my time, so i wanted to waste back theirs... i told them ill be coming...<br><br>i went to the 3rd interview, with no intension of joining the company but to punk them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ... The asst-director brought me to a bookshop to buy a notepad to write some notes (i don understand how they can actually do this) after lunch at the coffee shop... i hate coffee shops and fancy him being a asst-director... We went back to the office and he passed me some notes and told me to copy down in my notebook(WTF, theyve not heard of photocopiers?)... And at the same room which i was sharing with the other fresh interviewees i was copying the notes, they were processing my so called appointment... Recruitment calls were made in all the time and i was over hearing it this time, hehe... This is how it goes... They ask you for you name... Then your age... If youre 30 years and above they say they re looking for 30 year old and below unless you re willing to do sales and marketing wch of course they ll say 'no'... And thats exactly what this recruitment is all about... "Sales And Marketing"...<br>And when someone below the age of 30 ask what are the jobs available, they would offer different positions irrelevent like even 'customer service'... And that theyre dealing with life-science... note that they are actually dealing with bio-magnetism which is not recognised as a life-science resourse in Singapore...<br><br>Tat was my last straw... i left the office for home... Never to come back...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Some of the ridiculous things: (theres more i cant remember)<br>-Asst director having duties to pick up recruitment calls<br>-Sunday trainings<br>-Attire of long sleeve shirt and pants with tie on at all times including lunch<br>-You re not required to have any qualifications<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Other Buildings Youve to Beware of wch indicates various positions:<br><br>Yongda building at Aljunied - dealing with selling tickets in the public...</div>
