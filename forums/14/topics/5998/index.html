            <div class='col-md body'>Today I took the MBTI. For those who don't know what that is, it's the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator, which technically tells me who I am, what I'm good at...etc.<br><br>I thought it was quite good stuff, initially. It described me to some accuracy, told me my strong points and my weaknesses, how I could improve upon them and my most suited career paths. Yet upon reflection, the indicator just shows that we are a classifiable type. That none of us are individuals, that we are all of a certain character type. Yes, there are some who are more extreme in their type than others, but still, we are all one of the 16 different types.<br><br>That got me thinking for a while, that I've always believed human beings to be superior, that we all have different characters, mindsets and moral standards. Yet this test begs to differ. Perhaps in a small sample group, there are several different types of people. But all over the world, we have 5 billion divided by 16 character twins. That scares me a little, to know I'm more common than I think I am...<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think like star signs, there are certain aspects of our personalities that can be classified and grouped.<br>I'm sure you will find that people have characteristics from other groups as well, at certain times. I think its a very general type of classification, not all encompassing for the great variety and flexibility in real life human behaviour.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the MBTI is generally considered as the best of all personality tests. used by PSC and many private organisations, many consider it an accurate gauge of a person's character profile.<br><br>however, like all personality tests, if you really know yourself well, you can more or less gauge which "kind" of person u are. for me, i read up all the types and felt that ESFJ was most like me. a few mths later, i sat for MBTI in J2 and after getting my results, found that i was indeed a ESFJ, though i was so close that just 1-2 qns would put me to I and T.<br><br>so, how gd is MBTI? personally, i rather like the DISC test. though i must admit that MBTI is gd. it's not perfect, but still one of the best there is.<br><br>so, are human beings typed or unique? personally, i feel that while everyone is unique in his/her own way, due to human culture and biological reasons, it is very easy to "categorise" people. Moreover, upon knowing a person's mentality and mindset, it is very easy to predict what a person would do in a given situation and thus what the person's strengths and weaknesses would be.<br><br>This is the main strength and usage of MBTI. eg, when faced with a decision involving the fate of a person, a T person would tend to look at the situation more objectively while a F perons would tend to play more to the human touch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I took the MBTI too, and although it describes me really well, it think its still quite general. I mean for example, I'm an ENTP so that's like extroverted and stuff right? But how and when am i extroverted? Of course people can be classified. "Sarah and Jane have very strong values they hold on to." That doesn't mean Sarah has the same values as Jane does it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey! The MBTI is just a test to allow one to noe SOME of their traits but NOT all, which means that every human being is still UNIQUE afterall!<br><br>Dun u just hate it when people tell you "Eh... u look like a friend of mine?" or "Hey! Your character is EXACTLY like my friend!" Come on, LOOK CLOSELY! We are all DIFFERENT!<br><br>Every gene in one's body counts and that makes us different! Even twins are different in their own unique way!<br><br>Well, just stay the way we are because we are UNIQUE!

The collective group can be easily swayed by the slightest provocation, change at the slightest indication and subject itself to transformations when the right buttons are pressed.<br><br>But individuals are unique.
