Did he fulfill his promise and did you do what you committed to do.<br>3) Have you gone to the office to claim the money back guarantee ? and did they not carry out the obligations - that you have to come to this forum with this topic?<br><br>As far as I can see, its a straight forward process should you change your mind within the agreed  guarantee period.</div>

The way i see it is he trying to buy his way up...<br>if he buy from me, he need to pay only for what ever goods that is in the account which is less than 9k with no gst,  he can then resell the goods to the future downlines... he will gain a lot if i agree to sell him... imagine usual 15k count now offered at 9k...some more he earn commission when i join that means that from his own money he just have to pay 6000+ to get a count account.<br><br>besides count to marquis got time limit also... make 5 count within 6 mths i think (again known only after joining), else the earliest count is not included for the challenge...who knows what other untold rules they have not inform me...<br><br>if marquis can sit there do nothing earn portion of the global sales volume, then the company have to feed lotsa white elephant also, something else must have kept from me also...</div>
