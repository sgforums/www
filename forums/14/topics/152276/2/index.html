            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm....... When anyone is open to business, he or she will be prone to risk.  In the late 90s, many people around lost in the share markets, they are most retail investor.  We know that there are big players who control the movement of market and made a huge killing themselves. In other words, many retailers lost money to a few big players.  There are another group if investors whom are making steady money but self studied and reseach on what shares to invest (long term), most are sitting in profit postition and only a minority make losses.<br><br>In MLM is the same, I have friends who succeed in mlm but many failed.  When I chatted with them, I realised that those who succeed really have done their ground work plus a BIG heart to perserve to succeed. For many who failed, they have not done much groundwork, you can sense by the way they tell you how easy to make money, etc......... Well, it really turn off people ya.<br><br>MLM is simple but not easy at all.<br><br>When we loss $$ in share market, retail business, etc....whatever we invested in are lost forever.  In MLM, there are rules that you can make your refund back within a certain period.  I think should count the blessing.<br><br>My friend who succeed are not pioneer in the company at all. He succeeded well and a really a responsible family man.<br><br></div>
