            <div class='col-md body'>My gawd. Laurence have been giving you some basics in business fundamentals. And all you reciprocated was with filth that stinks of warped MLM. Can i endear you with the 1st rule of the business bible? Rule number 1 is, Listen. If people actually zip their trap and listened, you might have heard some sense if not all in what Laurence and some others have been trying to drone into you. There can't be smoke without fire. Oh no, don't come up with some fire tricks on me.<br><br>There are so many people who are inline with a negativity perception against NTi. Personally, i take a neutral stand. But from what i'm seeing as a neutral party, even if NTi was a proper business, you guys would have brought it down. When you argue, you need to bring out relevant points and use facts to back your pointers out. But what i've been seeing are rebuttal against protagonist as an individual. What is lacking are the facts.<br><br>If you have pride in your company, i believe you will do whatever it takes to protect your company's interest. But flaming others will not solve your problem. It will only antagonize others. You in effect, have SINGLE-HANDEDLY created more bad publicity than anyone in here can ever do. You are a walking NTi sponsored self-detonating bomb. Do yourself a favour, shape up, or ship out.<br><br></div>

There are some already in NTi might be regretting their decision. Let us not add salt to their wound. If any of you guys need any help whatsoever, you can always find the more helpful guys in here. From what i see, there are some very experienced network marketeers or some very savvy business men.<br><br>But for those who insist that NTi is a good company and persist in protecting your company's name, i say good for you! Seriously. But please do so in a more professional manner. When you attempt to bring down your detractors, you only serve to give yourself and your company a bad name. Don't forget, you are your company, your company is you. You are the representative of your company. Whatever you say in here, reflects directly on your company and your boss, James Phang. So i implore you, Nti agents, think twice before you rebutt.</div>
