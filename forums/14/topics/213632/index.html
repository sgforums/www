            <div class='col-md body'>And that is literally be your own boss. Not in the "stock up $20,000 worth of aromatherapy and then go sell it to your neighbours" way of being your own boss, that's just dumb. But rather, really opening your own company and starting at the top. Rent an office, renovation, then find a supplier for a low cost product that you can spam and mark up easily. A product that is so ULU people normally won't even buy it outside. Some kind of supplement that promises lots of intangible health benefits after taken for long term is a good bet. Decorative stuff jacked up to ridiculous prices is also a good bet. Cost price $20 thing mark up and sell $200. then the balance can deduct your own profit margin then use the remainder to fuel the so called MLM plan payout. Isn't that Genius? Every time I sell a 20 dollar thing, I charge 200. Then I deduct 130 per product to pay for my office, utilities, restocking, etc. the remaining 50 dollars I earn per product I device a simple commision plan and let the suckers coming in to go fight for the sales by playing them off one another can already. The best product is when you don't even need to have a psyical product. Sell stupid pple  a "concept", or a "training package", "motivation talk" or "self-improvement course", then charge people to attend. Got certificate somemore!<br><br>Once you have a product, recruit some sales people to start making the sales for you. Pull disgruntled people from other MLM companies through a few ways.<br><br>1. Bad mouth their existing company<br>2. Bad mouth their existing upline<br>3. Bad mouth their existing boss<br>4. Bad mouth them!<br><br>More info to come in a later post</div>

Wonder if they are being paid for that. That, and also to pick litter off their uplines cars. Damn poor thing.</div>

I know very clearly because last time I was also like that what. MLM will never be a business with ethics lar, because of the people in it. What I posted was from my experience last time in MLM and after observing a lot of MLM people from a lot of companies.</div>
