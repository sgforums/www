            <div class='col-md body'>talking about orchard, tell you all one incident i encountered many years ago.<br>I was like 17-18 yrs old, during my upper sec sch days.<br><br>One boring weekend afternoon i got nothing to do, so i ask my fren go taka walk walk. Then we sit outside main entrance of NgeeAn city and chit chat. Later 2 beautiful yound lady (i admit they are quite attractive looking with their make-up on, with the clothes they were wearing) approached us. They starting by asking us what we are doing here, ask if we like to go disco/pub. Well, back then, we go night spot almost every weekend nights. After all these bullshit they start to get in the main topic, they told us they are in "Trend conncetion"(if i didnt remember wrongly). It's a membership thing, once you become a member, you get to join the gathering(to go pub/disco together, and also other gatherings), we can "know more frens"(which the two lady tried to tempt us, make us think we can get to know a lot of chio bu like the two of them). OK, after telling us the situation, how good it is to become a member, they start to talk price. I forgot how much was that, cos we didnt pay. My fren almost wanted to join, but i whisper to him not to, and then i explained to him after the 2 ladies are gone.<br><br>If the two ladies are member of this thing, and they are trying to recruit us to join, there must be a reason behind. Because we are handsome? i am not that ugly, but i dont think i am handsome enough to make them want to know us so bad that they approach us like that. At least other girls didnt come to me and say want to know me and jio me go pub together. So what's the reason behind she trying hard to get us to join this thing? Must be money, they get commission by getting new members under their name. And once i joined, i have to come to Ngee An city to recruit member to earn money too!<br>While i earn, maybe the girl will get a share from my commission too bcos i joined under her name. That's the truth behind it.<br><br>What's the point of paying a membership fee to join, and then get many others to pay membership so that i can get back my membership fee from the commission i earned?<br><br>So, let me relate back to the topic "MLM ALL SAME ONE!!"<br><br>The idea of MLM is just like the example i mentioned above. It may be different in some ways, but the whole idea is the same.<br><br>You pay to ensure some commission for the person who drag you in, then you drag a lot more ppl to ensure you to get back what you have paid.<br><br>What's the ultimate goal? sell the products or drag more ppl in so that ppl on top of the pyramid earns big money?<br><br>If the ultimate goal is to sell products, you can sell it alone, you dont need so many members. We let you earn all the money selling the products yourself.<br><br>If the ultimate goal is to let the ppl on top of pyramid to earn big money, then you are cheating ppl from the bottom.<br><br>Perhaps you have achieved alot like you said, which i dont need you to prove, i assume you have earned alot. But can you sleep well at night? Do you feel guilty at all? You cheated(you would say you earned) money from people at the bottom of pyramid, you wasted the precious time of youngster, they spend one or two year in your MLM, in the end they got nothing becuase all they do is for the profit of people on top. They would have gain something by working outside, at least gain one or two year of real working experience.<br><br>You think Singapore will fall if the youngster dont join MLM? IT'S THE OTHER WAY ROUND!!!!! If all the youngster go join MLM and dont contribute to the society, Singapore will really fall!!<br><br>p.s. Sorry to everyone for the long post, but i couldnt control myself. I think these MLM ppl need to wake up, cos the issue always come a state that Singapore will fall or not.</div>
