            <div class='col-md body'>It's jus a marketing technique and is history.  Things change.  It has nothing to do to help u make a decision in your joining a network marketing company. The only way is to prove its competency is compare it's sales figures in Singapore with other companies. However it is only one indicator though. There are still many other factors to consider.</div>

They use binary plan. Usually only those pyramid schemes use such a plan. Binary schemes only work when they are the first one.

            <div class='col-md body'>Meaning nti too?<br><br>Well, binary is explosive in the beginning, and it expands one leveraging power since it will quickly explode downwards instead of widening network. Soon, residual income will kick in. This is why binary is controversial, since as the network grow bigger, if one cannot balance it, or stabilise it, the distributor will not get comissions due. A good excuse for scammers to delay or cancel away earnings to be given out, since its natural many cannot handle binary network.<br><br>This does not immediately points it as pyramid. Unless coy emphasise on recruitment onli, or they trying to sell useless products..thats when all the question marks come in.<br><br>But seriously, its a good and quick plan for scammers to earn and run away fast.<br><br></div>

(if u have 3 when u start off)...heck ! you end up stocking up products to earn those money.<br><br>binary plan plays a lot of gimmick of easy money.<br><br>sometimes it is not the people that is intentionally out to scam people, but most if them are themselves scammed by their upline thinking binary is the best. ultimately...it is the company that wants to big quick bucks that comes out with the this plan.<br><br>compare this to a plan that are structured to let u grow one leg first, then 2, then 3..and 3 is all u need for the growth in rank...would that be better ? of course if u can grow 4,5,6 or more legs, its much better for u personally. but for a plan with 3 legs and u can grow them one at a time, won't that be better than have 4 legs that u have to grow all together ? remember also there is also quite hard to u can sign up 2 good person on the same day or the same month.<br><br>network marketing itself is not a bad thing...only if u choose the right company and the right group.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">binary plans talks about 2 main features :<br>a) only 2 legs<br>b) unlimited levels<br><br>development is important is u get the right people. now how many of us can say that for sure this chap that you sign up is going to build the leg ? nobody.....statistics from most of the bigger company show that u recruit about 100 chaps to have 2-4 growing legs...so u can imagine success dun come easy. those top earners really earn it...<br></div></blockquote>do excuse me, but i believe a study done at harvard shows that on average ppl who do networking usually sponsor about 2.7 ppl on average in their whole careers.<br>there are no guarantees in anything, regardless of stairstep, unilevel, or binary plan. though i would think putting all my people in 2 teams rather than 4 or more teams makes more sense, no?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">take susana for example, their marketing materials focus on these 2 points. base on facts/stats, what make u think ur first 2 downline is really going to grow ? then they tell u move down the next level...and the next...what happens after 6 levels all are recruited by you...that means u have 128 people under you and it happens the 2-3 builders are under the same leg ? your balls also xiang...it is as good as telling you your commission is zero...since ur other leg is negligible.</div></blockquote>it is a distributor's responsibility to not only build his 2 teams with great thought, but also to develop his people. if he/she does not have the brains to put builders on both teams then is the flaw with the plan or with themselves?<br>and yes of course there is no guarantee your first 2 ppl will grow. not now not ever. so if you can't grow 2 teams, do you think growing 3,4 or more teams is going to be any easier?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">they tell u also, that after balancing, the "unearn" portion from the bigger leg can carry forward...what happen if the bigger leg forever remains the bigger leg...those points will forever remain unearned.</div></blockquote>again an inability to balance is not an inherent plan fault but a distributor's fault<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">unlimited level ? where on earth got unlimited level ? if there is, the company will go broke.....</div></blockquote>unlimited levels to draw commissions from. NOT unlimited income. do you see the difference? ideally a binary plan with a reasonable income cap coupled with ethical marketing strategies and good products is a much better guarantee of income than stairsteps or unilevels.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">notice there is a cap of $xxxx, after which u need to buy in another biz centre...then u need to maintain 4 or more biz centres ??? (if u have 3 when u start off)...heck ! you end up stocking up products to earn those money.</div></blockquote>i don't do usana but their comp plan is one of the many i have looked through. have you examined their comp plan without biased and total honesty? do you know exactly what you are talking about?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">binary plan plays a lot of gimmick of easy money.</div></blockquote>yes if it does then show us your evidence and all your facts. no emotional arguments and flawed logic pls.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">sometimes it is not the people that is intentionally out to scam people, but most if them are themselves scammed by their upline thinking binary is the best. ultimately...it is the company that wants to big quick bucks that comes out with the this plan.</div></blockquote>true enough companies that scam tend to use binary plans. so should we blame the company or the plan?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">compare this to a plan that are structured to let u grow one leg first, then 2, then 3..and 3 is all u need for the growth in rank...would that be better ? of course if u can grow 4,5,6 or more legs, its much better for u personally. but for a plan with 3 legs and u can grow them one at a time, won't that be better than have 4 legs that u have to grow all together ? remember also there is also quite hard to u can sign up 2 good person on the same day or the same month.</div></blockquote>tell me, would it be easier to manage 2 teams or 4,5,6 teams?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by def456:</div><div class="quote_body">network marketing itself is not a bad thing...only if u choose the right company and the right group.</div></blockquote>absolutely true my friend.</div>
