            <div class='col-md body'>QUOTE :<br><br>Hi guys,<br><br>If u have read my first post over here, I am sure u know of the bad experience that I have been through... Hi shoutcast, if I am not wrong, they must have told u, the director of LAdy Warriors is a 21 year old female, only a ITE graduate and earning $10 + K a month rite? and they say she has earned herself a baby mercs or sth from the company.<br><br>Get this right, that was what they told me last year and up till now, this lady director still hasnt drove her "baby mercs" over... They are just trying to mark up the amount of money they earn.. If they are really earning $10+ K per month, their annual income would be ard $120K a year, meaning they are eligible to apply for a PLATINUM card. A plat card, not a GOLD card. U can ask them to show u, I doubt anyone of them has it...<br><br>and yes, one thing about them is that they drive luxury cars, if I am not wrong, in the garage near New LEaf cafeteria, there is a blue jaguar, several mercs of the same silver design and a Fair LAdy right?? It is just for a show... They have to do this so that they can CONVINCE people how successful they were, so that people will join this.<br><br>IMPORTANT: They will become rich ONLY AFTER u have joined them, not before that. Therefore, they need to fork out money to create a image, a branding. After they have convinced u, they make the money and its your turn to lie to others about how successful u were.<br><br>I only earned $100 plus during my 3 months there. So, I really hope people out there especially those finishing A or O Levels not to get cheated by them.. They aim for this people whom they think are gullible and easy to convince..<br><br>One more thing, they like to do their survey at Orchard MRT, outside Heerens and many parts of Orchard. If they give u a "JOB MARKET SURVEY" and ask u to do, just give a false number. THe actual aim of the survey is to get the telephone numbers of the surveyees aka the prey. During the survey, they will try to engage in a conversation with u so that u can be comfortable with them. After that, they will try all means to convince u to go down to the company. And MOST IMPORTANTLY, over the phone, they will tell u " We have many vacancies, such as ADMIN, telemarketing, data entry blah blah blah...<br><br>GET THIS CLEAR, there is NO ADMIN job at all.. Only SALES positions... and<br>its not just sales...<br><br>They cheat ur money after u placed the order by not delivering the goods and eventually not giving u ur goods..<br><br>ANOTHER SUPER FUNNY POST . . . YA WE GAVE OUT SURVEYS . . . WE TRIED TO EMPLOY PEOPLE TO JOIN THE COMPANY . . . COS THE COMPANY IS EXPANDING MAHZ . . . DO YOU GUYS THINK THAT A COMPANY WOULD EXPAND IF IT'S A SCAM ? YOU ALL REALLY THINK YOU'RE ALL SO CLEVER HAHA . . . ACTUALLY PLAIN STUPID (TO THE NO LIFERS LA ) . . . AND ONE MORE THING ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION , MANAGEMENT POSITIONS . . . HAHAHA HAHAHA I REALLY CANNOT TAKE IT LE LA . . . I GOT PROMOTED FROM AN ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE PROBATIONAL TO AN EXECUTIVE TRAINER AND TO A SUPERVISING OFFICER IN ONLY A MONTH AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO DO SALES ANYMORE . . . WITH THIS I CAN SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT YOUR POST IS CRAP .<br><br>OOPS FORGOT TO ADD ON . . . HAHA ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING OUR COMPANY IS A SCAM . . . YOU ALL NO LIFERS PLEASE JUST VISIT THE GOLFHOUSE AT TAKASHIMAYA SHOPPING CENTER OR ROYAL SPORTING HOUSE AT SUNTEC YOU WILL SEE THAT THE STORES HAVE OUR PRODUCTS UP FOR SALES AT $200+ AND 300+ . . . ROYAL SPORTING HOUSE IS NOT STUPID TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IF THEY THINK THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE SCAM IDIOTS . . .<br><br>ANOTHER THING . . . ABOUT THE DELIVERY THINGY . . . YES WE TAKE A LONG TIME TO DELIVER , ABOUT 2 WEEKS TO 6 WEEKS . . .<br><br>WHY ???<br><br>SIMPLY BECAUSE WE NEED TO CUT COST FOR THE PRODUCTS TO BE DELIVERED FROM JAPAN TO SINGAPORE . . . JAPANLIFE TO DW HEADQUARTERS . . .WE USE SHIPPING NOT AIRMAIL . . . COST 400+ CHEAPER FOR A BEDPAD TO BE DELIVERED THIS WAY<br><br>IF YOU WANT CASH ON DELIVERY CAN ! SIMPLY JUST HAVE TO PAY MORE LOR<br>AS YOU CAN SEE LA THE PRODUCTS U ALL SAY SO EX AND STUFF . . . U STILL WANT TO ADD 400+ DOLLARS JUST TO GET IT IN 3 DAYS TIME . . . U SURE NOT ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ziggyboy, I think it's not right of u to call us losers. I speculate u had no such problems perhaps bcos u have very kind friends and relatives who were generous enough to help u cough up a sales amount of $25,000. Cos the calculation for the commission is 8% of your sales and then a currency exchange of 0.8. and they seriously take away $400 for currency exchange from u if u had earned $1,600. From what I know, this currency exchange thing is a scam, cos the goods are not from Japan, so how did the exchange thingy come about?? Pls get back your "currency exchange" though.<br><br>And if I am not wrong, most prob u would have reached AE stage rite? So good, its your turn to recruit people and make money for u. So do u tink its very easy for u to find people who can also generate 25,000 of sales for u a month? Perhaps, maybe 1 out of a 100.<br><br>Most importantly, what we are trying to put across here is not that we are jealous or envious of people making big bucks in MLM, and people like us who are losers, cant make it big, that's why we are "inputting negative thoughts" (sounds familiar huh??) I am sure u have heard this term no less than 10 times in DW. "Don't care about what people say, they are just jealous of what u are going to have. You continue to work hard and earn money, before 20 years old, u can drive a BMW!!!"<br><br>Lastly, I would like to reiterate that we are just telling people about the experience we have been through. You can choose to listen, u can choose to go ahead with what u want to do. I have been writing and commenting on this thread, because I felt really sad that no one gave me warnings about this company such that I have been so badly cheated.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ziggyboy, I think it's not right of u to call us losers. I speculate u had no such problems perhaps bcos u have very kind friends and relatives who were generous enough to help u cough up a sales amount of $25,000. Cos the calculation for the commission is 8% of your sales and then a currency exchange of 0.8. and they seriously take away $400 for currency exchange from u if u had earned $1,600. From what I know, this currency exchange thing is a scam, cos the goods are not from Japan, so how did the exchange thingy come about?? Pls get back your "currency exchange" though.<br><br>And if I am not wrong, most prob u would have reached AE stage rite? So good, its your turn to recruit people and make money for u. So do u tink its very easy for u to find people who can also generate 25,000 of sales for u a month? Perhaps, maybe 1 out of a 100.<br><br>Most importantly, what we are trying to put across here is not that we are jealous or envious of people making big bucks in MLM, and people like us who are losers, cant make it big, that's why we are "inputting negative thoughts" (sounds familiar huh??) I am sure u have heard this term no less than 10 times in DW. "Don't care about what people say, they are just jealous of what u are going to have. You continue to work hard and earn money, before 20 years old, u can drive a BMW!!!"<br><br>Lastly, I would like to reiterate that we are just telling people about the experience we have been through. You can choose to listen, u can choose to go ahead with what u want to do. I have been writing and commenting on this thread, because I felt really sad that no one gave me warnings about this company such that I have been so badly cheated. I supposed the people who have been actively commenting here, are not that free to come here and stop people from making biggg bucks.. We have better things to do.... If u are doing fine, then all the best to u. and I really think u must be quite a hardworking and determined person to get such a high commission.

The reson they never give is they can cover their own ASS. if you don;t believe you can check with the other guys working there, have they sign anything?<br><br>3rd - If their product are so good why not sell them to dealer... like OSIM. Please open your eyes and ears... take a good look from outside the skin.<br><br>Where got a company ask ppl to work and no black and white on their pay out or other term...<br>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br><br>THIS POST AT LEAST KNOW A LITTLE OF WHAT IT'S SPEAKING OF . . .<br><br>YOU SEE . . .

The fees are not very x.<br><br>I believe they don’t have the cert to say that is a medical magnet.<br><br>1 last thing, I notice that the manage or sales person having problem to pay phone bill and even borrow money from my fr.<br><br>I really don’t understand how the company can operate.<br><br>Come and think of it, for those to side the company, try to go back and think about it. If the company don’t really have much problem then why this forum is up? Why is there so much of comment from different people and is not 1 but a few.
