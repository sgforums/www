Please la, life is short... you spend the days arguing and finding who's right or wrong, worth it or not.... and time passed like that... so many people out there might not even have one second you knowz............<br><br>So can we make this a discussion, not a quarreling session.... i know discussion means we have our own point of view.. but explain your point of view in a nicer way.. and not in BIG CAPS LIKE THIS.. yea.... And you can never make people see from your point of view...<br><br>People who quit from DW will say DW is bad, DW cheat, DW con people...<br>People who still in DW will defend DW by saying we are weaklings, it's our fault...<br>Quarrel like that until like the cows come home, worth it or not.. at the end of the day.. what do you get? Money for posting here? Fame for posting here? or satisfaction of posting here cos you manage to scold people le?<br><br>=======================================================<br>ok lo. . . i understand what u saying . . .no point saying . . . iask those queestion le rite ? no one can contradict mahz . . . they are just trying to win in this petty argument . . .<br><br>as i mentioned in my post earlier la . . . those 1, 2, 3 points i posted . . . like the royal sporting house shit and singapore island country club and psb and iso certificate shit . . . u all think dw = scam then u all try to get reporters to come and seal dw lor . . .talk so much cocks sia u all cocksters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... it was really interesting to hear those comments from everyone..... I guess theres a lot of issues involved that makes it very hard to pin-point whether wat the coy does is right. But i guess you can pin-point pple if you find that their character has a prob.... As the usual case, there are always pple who make it and pple who fail in every aspect of work and even life.... Not really much point to argue about that.... And to those who so called felt very strongly that they have been so called cheated. All I can really say its that even if you are, wat u can do is take it in your stride and learn from it. Its part and parcel of life..... rather than breathing fire in here so much and really losing your senses and logical thinking, you'll shd just learn from it and be smarter. I know its easy to just say but seriously I know of a lot of friends that felt that exact same way, including my very own gf. I am not a bit negative and I feel that everyone has their choice in wat they want to pursue. One fact is that there are REALLY pple who earn that much in the mlm structure but of course its not a everyone thing..... For those who believe, you have my blessings if you wanna try. For those who have tried but din like and quited, find yourself better ambitions. For those who are still trying and believing, all I hope is you guys make sure you keep your minds fresh cos theres not only 1 opportunity in the whole world.... but nonetheless, its a good experience to have.</div>

But we poorer friends only can afford to eat at hawker center. So everytime, when my friend buy something from a hawker, the hawker got no change for him. So end up we poorer friends got to pay for him. After a few times, we decided not to go out with him. Cos he only got big notes, but not willingly to treat us to a good restaurant."<br>So having a thick stack of notes doesn't mean the person is rich. Maybe all he had is the few stacks of big notes.<br>Buying a car is easy, but maintaining the car installment is another story. So dun judge the book by the cover.<br>I also know Joey. He was one of the director with asayo. But i dare to say that joey is not the kind that only talks to the person with ranking. I met him at Devil's Bar a couple of years back. He also came to talk to me.<br>However, like i said, how would you like a boss who betray his ex boss. Huh? He just left Asayo in lurch when the company is facing its critical crsis then.</div>
