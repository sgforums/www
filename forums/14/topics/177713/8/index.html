              <p>Guys, why make things so complicated and so messy!!?? i think you guys all who currently is still working under the MLM who wish to make big bucks out of this the unrealistic balloon, i urged you guys please wake up your bloody idea! Please if whatever company that you guys had mentioned DW, Asayo Astralmag blah blah blah... it is all a whole lot of bullshit, If this so called all the Magical products that whatever the company carrys can really make wonders, i think there isn't a need for any doctors, scientist to be in the world trying to find cures, rememdies, researching all the medicines. Come'on, wake up your bloody idea and pry open your coconut shell and see if there is still any juice or has it become stale water in it. Be down to earth and work hard to earn realistic money and end of the month get your pay cheque.</p>
              <p>If MLM really can make wonders like Osim carrying health products or machine who can go into IPO, Eu Yan Seng who can go into regional market, PLEASE! Would any of the surviving MLM currently struggling in the market, PLEASE! show me the result and news of whatever company that can/able to go public offering IPOs! Which i stake both my hands / legs and my bloody head as a stake! Want to sell products, don't use unscruplous tecnique by asking the employee to fork out their bloody hard earn money to buy those stupid / useless products asking them to try out before asking them to brain wash their relatives / friends into conning them of their money! But in the fact of the return on what those poor lads got? hell lots of scolding and break up of friendships, kinship turn sour! Do you all bloody fiend know that! Why?? give me a very sastifsfactory explanation! For you all info, i ain't a victim of being con or a ex MLM poor dogs.</p>
              <p>As for you guys arguing about whoever driving Ferrari, Merc, BMWs etc... i would agree that those cheapskate Merc and BMWs is all those scrap category cars for those achievers, but for THE ONE that driving Ferraris to attend a talk to a certain hotel, Yah i do believe you can afford to buy one, Why???!!! Because all the money you had to buy this car is the money you con out of your lackeys who in turn con their friends or relatives! Even if LET'S SAID you are not able to buy it, you are also able to rent it from those shop out there?! AutoBahn in Bukit Timah got those flashing cars for rent, what speed machine you name it, they have it! Aston Martin, Ferraris, Porsche, Mersarati etc.. they have!!</p>
              <p>So the moral of all this i have voice out is that i'm simply sick of all this dogs in the market trying to con people in this current economic situation! There is nothing free or easy money in this world! wake up the bloody coconut, get a job and get a decent life!</p>

              <p>wow this thread is so old. dw group is still here la. shifted fo far east  shopping centre (the more ulu one). went for an interview there. was kinda deceived because the ad on the newspaper stated all positions available 10 bucks per hour. went for the first interview, passed and went on the the second interview. which was kinda prep-talk-ish  and product knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i don't think that its a scam company. just that i feel that its quite dinghy. being in a ulu shopping centre. btw, regine is still there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyways i did not take up the job (not because of this thread because i declined before finding out about this thread today while i thought i should try to find out more about the company) because of other commitments and boy, are they realistic. the person who tried to 'catch up' with me by smsing me everyday (while i was busy with my cca) just stopped smsing me. and she did not ask why like other companies either. weird.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not sure about the products. but now there's pet products cuz they merged with alpha paws, some pet company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyways, its weird that they did not give me any namecards when i was accepted. and the office was a shop front, with only 2 of the more big comfy tables, one for regine, the other for the other higher positioned person i guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyways this thread is weird la. why is annex_ *something* so agitated if those are just rumours??? anyways the company doesn't have a webbie dwbio.com doesnt work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh well, does anyone else have any other updates???</p>

              <p>Those who still keep track with this company should know that it has merged with another company, Alpha Paw which sell pets products. The company marks this as a new begaining and claims it has made a lot of improvement and brush up its ways of doing things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a story from my friend, a ex DW member, went back and most likely going to leave again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He joined this company about half a year ago and was there for a while. He sold some products and managed to recruit a few friends as well. After a month or so, he was sick of how DW works, the way it tricks people, lies to new comers how easy to earn monet etc. So he left the company. Being a nice guy, he still continue to get in touch with his upline but more as a friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently, he received a call from his upline, telling him about the meger and told him that DW has changed a lot, improved its ways of doing things, learned from their old mistakes and asked if he want to come down to see it for himself. My friend believed them and decided to keep an open mind and went down to DW again, now located at Far East Shopping Centre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After a few times there, to his shock, their ways of doing is still the same. Appointment, recruitment and the presentation, there is no change at all. They still put up ads on newspapers using the same wordings. They used the same methods to teach the new comers and teach them the same things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even his upline, whom he said had promoted to a mangement position, still do the same things. He sees no improvement in his upline except better at talking (or conning) and a slightly bigger network.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the pet products, he said that the company is still focusing on their old products and alpha paw is nothing but a tool for them to tee up DW, saying if they are not good, why alpha paw wanted to merge with them etc. After that back to their bed pad again. Ok, for this, it is understandable for me because alpha paw don't have much products yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DW has done a bit in its packeting, new sales kit, shirts, namecards etc but this may only be a false impression telling others they are moving forward and making changes, giving people a new sense of hope but actually the system and everything else inside is still the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To add my own view on this, I found it suprising that the company is not making any improvement at all. Even if not for the meger, every companies should take out some time looking back to how they do things and make improvement, especially for a company that is going down. Improvement = Growth. I don't see DW doing it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really hope for the best for DW and the people in it...</p>

I think you ppl juz dont like the structure of the company lorr...you guys speak abt the bosses all the time...i have join in other MLM company ah...their structure is much worse lor....muz achieve alot of target and points...I think whoever dont like DW is because you guys are DW rivals lorrr...working for some other companies and put other company's name to shame...this is what you call healthy competition izzit? more like dirty tricks up in your sleeves...DW only want ppl to be aware of the products but there is no obligation whatsoever lorr..ppl make this product using good quality and materials and can last 20-30 yrs...you think cheap ah? $2000-$3000 for 20-30 yrs of worth....don't you think it is worth it? The thing is we have testimonials lorr...so no one can call actually DW a scam...</p></div>
