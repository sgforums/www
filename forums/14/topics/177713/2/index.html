I believe many of u will be saying i m dreaming or i m wastin my time.. i m jux tryin to convinced myself in the company coz i m already sho deep into this "scam". But may i noe.. are u sure wat ur sae is true.. ur sae alot of complains.. but it seems like always the same few peole toking in this thread.. which company dun make profits..? F&amp;N.. a normal drinks company.. if u check.. a normal can of drink cost $0.12 but we are paying 5 times more.. why? coz dey need to earn.. not only MLM company does it.. u can check it if u dun believe.. true.. maybe u can argue tt no matter how the price rise.. its only a like $1 for the drink while magnetic bedpads cost to thousands.. but itsn't it the same..? the price rise 4-5times.. WHY? earn money.. profiits.. simple as that.. i reply to this thread is not to tell u guys u are wrong.. u hav ur points.. but dun doubt a company just because people spread things bout it.. their so-called "experience".. many MLM companies are thru commission-based plan.. sho if u dun sell.. definitely u wun earn.. sho if u didn't earn $$.. den u shld ask urself "why?".. did u really put in the effort.. true.. some company do ask u to put in $$ to get the bedpads or ani other products.. but the point is.. its ur choice.. if ur parents doesn't hav the products.. and u urself believe in it.. n u noe it can help.. u wish to promote it to ur parents.. n dey eventually bought it.. is it the company's fault? i believe its u urself hu didn't think carefully.. some company kip psychoing their people to put in $$.. to invest.. they will see more returns.. but u have to evauate urself.. no matter u are a teenager or wat.. i believe if u are at least 14 or maybe i shld sae "16 and above.." u shld noe whether its worth it.. of coz if ur parents already have the products.. wat for ask dem put in the $$.. isn't that stupid..? its u urself hu didn't think and u r blaming the company.. furthermore for the magnetic products.. i have seen its usefulness.. if u wan ur parents to use it.. n sho be it.. bt if u wan to invest XTRA $$ into it to gain ur position.. dun blame it on the company that they are brainwashing u.. blame it on urself for not thinking carefully.. another thing i wish to address.. is the magents tt singlish04 sae.. for the price wise.. i believe i explained it above.. how bout this.. u sae its a industrial magnet.. sho i can sae its a cheat company and thus the products doesn't work.. rit?? since its not a medical magent.. den may i ask u.. y do some ppl see effect in it? dun tell me there is a mixture of magnets.. todae.. u buy a product.. or u join a comapny.. dey tell u the product from where from where.. no matter japan amercia or watsoever.. can i sae as long as the products works like wat it supposed to.. isn't it all tt matters..? i m not writin this thread to argue wit u guys. but i feel its really unfair for the companies because u guys dunno the whole detail but jux sae wat ur noe which are all bad things.. todae if u wan to work aniwhere.. think before u do.. dun come and blame the company for brainwashing u.. u are v.innocent.. u got tricked or watsoever.. its you hu didn't think carefully.. dun sae MLM companies.. no matter what also the same.. all i can sae now is.. for those who did not get the products as promised.. if u wan ur $$ back.. its impossible.. but if u still wan the product.. i believe the address is return on the invoice slip.. sho why dun u come down with the invoice and ask for the products.. i believe it will be a beterr and faster way rather den gog thru ur frens.. or ur sho-much hated upliness or managers.. because if u really wan the $$ to be worth while.. at least u can't get a refund u can get the goods.. den jux take the invoice and come down to look for anibody.. please dun gv urself excuses that they will not do anithing.. for DW.. i noe their HQ is at 13th floor.. sho go straight there.. dun sae they wun gv u the goods or wat.. i believe if u go dwn. .they will gv u wat u have ordered and pay for.. thank u<br><br>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>ANOTHER FIGHTER FOR TRUTH !
