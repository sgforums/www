              <p>Right now we recommend any stall or show we share we will not get anything.. isn't it more of like using all of us to increase his/her own profit without giving out anything?</p>

              <p>why suddenly talk about chicken rice stall..where's the link?</p>
              <p>if you're writing in response to my previous comment on your lead-capture page..you have got to learn more..</p>
              <p>read up more on getting positive remarks first before you think you know business..it's all about marketing/advertising and operational expenses..</p>
              <p>from your reply..it's just typical/standard FAQs reply format taught in mlm companies..and it is not flexible at all..another poor soul being brainwashed..</p>
              <p>speak and write to be understood and not to mislead others..(which the website has already clearly mislead people)</p>
              <p>FYI: Misleading people are the taboos of business across the globe and that's what keeps the compliants pouring into the all businesses - refer to the previous AIG Bailout and Lehamn Brothers incident..thus Financial + Insurance agents are trained not to misrepresent the business..</p>

              <p>Network marketing has existed among us without us realising such as online promotions that requires friends referral.</p>

              <p>That's also network marketing in a way as we refer to our friends that the particular product or company is good, we stand to gain something.

              <p>Doing this also reduce the cost of advertisement of common media such as newspaper, radio or tv. It also provides jobs to many and many to attain their goals in life.</p>
              <p>Not all network marketing companies are bad. Their products can be far better than the products you find outside.

              <p><br>Another gimmick/misleading thread reply..</p>
              <p>Your reply make it sounds more like a scam..the idea it gives me..is like do nothing and get paid..</p>
              <p>When you mention No Sales and talk about referrral to promote products, referral cum promote products still falls under SALES.</p>
              <p>No Investment; What kind of investment are you referring to? Time, Money Commitment?  With the "No Investment" it gives a very wrong impression that its easy.</p>
              <p>There's a saying, good things don't come easy, you have to work for it.</p>
              <p>The only time you have things easy for you is the time when you get scam/cheated by others..which is what you're post is suggesting (from my personal view point only)</p>
              <p>So if you're saying its a no investment plus no sales..than how do businesses even make money?</p>
              <p>Another thing is that you mention about blacksheep companies..who ruin reputation..ask your friends or read it again yourself..you are pushing the blame to others by slapping yourself?</p>
              <p>There's no blacksheep companies..</p>
              <p>the blacksheeps are the people who are not representives of the company</p>
              <p>they can join the company as agent just to make the commission and should in no way ruin the reputation of the company but sad to say..majority as high as 99.98% of the agents does it..</p>

              <p>Some of the people in this thread aren't showing the simplest level of maturity at all.</p>

              <p>Yes, its very true but not only applies to MLM salesmen. Retail shops salesmen/promoter gets commission also. Isn't that getting a cut from all the products they sell? Who in the hell came out to work for free? You? Think before you speak.</p>
              <p>And moreover MLM salesmen aren't getting paid for finding customers until they actually close a sales. Retail shop promoters/salesmen are getting paid BASIC salary even if theres no sales done.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://mlmg.sgforums.com/users/267304">gtyp</a> said ,</span><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">Hey Alessandro, I heard they are doing Diamonds too and opened a diamon shop at Marina Square (which my friend took me to that day).

              <p>Sorry I've got to say this, I don't think opening a retail shop in shopping centre needs approval from government until they actually want to register their business as Private Limited etc etc.</p>
              <p>Lastly , Advertisement of Direct Sales Products. </p>
              <p>MLM companies products/direct sales products are advertised by their salesperson. They're working for free until they actually close a sales. Salesperson of  MLM companies are their main source of ADVERTISEMENTS. Advantage is, its free. Disadvantage, lower popularity due to the fact they are not very well known.</p>
              <p>Retail companies products/Retail shop products are advertised by newspaper/internet/tv ads etc. All these sources and medium cost money and are not cheap. Advantage, more people knowing product. Higher popularity. Disadvantage is, what if there is no or low sales? Do you think mediums like Television Ads/Newspaper let you advertise for FREE?</p>
              <p>Question to you is, which is a cheaper source of advertisement?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't assume products that we see in shopping malls, NTUC, shelves are the best.What makes you think so? Is it because everyone is buying it or it is very easily accessible? What makes up a good product? Just because its on the shelves in retail shops, its a good one? How sure are you?</p>
              <p>Think.</p>

              <p>Sure, MLM'ers earns commissions, but so does salespeople from many companies. MLM'ers aren't paid a fixed salary, so if they don't earn commission, what's the point of doing the business in the first place?</p>

                      Time, Money Commitment?  With the "No Investment" it gives a
                      very wrong impression that its easy.</p>
              <p>There's a saying, good things don't come easy, you have to work
                      for it.</p>
              <p>The only time you have things easy for you is the time when you
                      get scam/cheated by others..which is what you're post is suggesting
                      (from my personal view point only)</p>
              <p>So if you're saying its a no investment plus no sales..than how
                      do businesses even make money?</p>
              <p>Another thing is that you mention about blacksheep
                      companies..who ruin reputation..ask your friends or read it again
                      yourself..you are pushing the blame to others by slapping
                      yourself?</p>
              <p>There's no blacksheep companies..</p>
              <p>the blacksheeps are the people who are not representives of the
                      company</p>
              <p>they can join the company as agent just to make the commission
                      and should in no way ruin the reputation of the company but sad to
                      say..majority as high as 99.98% of the agents does it..</p>

              <p>as your thread reply are mis-leading too..focusing on the advanced strategies when you still lack the foundation/basic understanding of the industry as a whole</p>
              <p>i don't want anybody else to think that they can quote my posts in future thinking that i will not rebutt them just because they agree with my replies..if i sense some hidden agenda/motive brewing in progress..i'll just point it out..</p>

              <p>Thanks for the reply. Appreciate it. Ok, 1st of all I would say that I'm not perfect in providing information with regards to this industry, we all learn from each other. But what I would hope is that this industry will one day become an industry that gets the good name that it deserves. </p>
              <p>However, if I lack any basic understanding of the industry, do point it out and I can learn from you as well.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, yes for one to enter the network marketing scene, one MUST understand the fundamentals of MLM. But like I said, that's not the true concern as the fact that the industry is getting a bad reputation is due to how distributors go about operating their business. So that extends to the networkers themselves and the general public alike.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I believe Sgforums can serve the entire industry of Network Marketing, but we have to get beyond all this to accomplish that, and
                      we have to consider all the people who have benefited and struggled in this industry.<span>  This industry</span> can serve them
                      too, but not like this.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I'll get off the soap box and hope this can be transmuted
                      into a positive outcome.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I don't think anyone really did anything wrong.<span>  </span>I think this is what happens sometimes when
                      we 'practice' business.<span>  </span>We learn, we
                      grow.</p>
