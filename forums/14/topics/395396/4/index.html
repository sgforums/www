              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thanks for the reply. Appreciate it. Ok, 1st of all I would say
                  that I'm not perfect in providing information with regards to this
                  industry, we all learn from each other. But what I would hope is
                  that this industry will one day become an industry that gets the
                  good name that it deserves. </p>
              <p>However, if I lack any basic understanding of the industry, do
                  point it out and I can learn from you as well.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, yes for one to enter the network marketing scene,
                  one MUST understand the fundamentals of MLM. But like I said,
                  that's not the true concern as the fact that the industry is
                  getting a bad reputation is due to how distributors go about
                  operating their business. So that extends to the networkers
                  themselves and the general public alike.</p>
              <p>I believe Sgforums can serve the entire industry of
                  Network Marketing, but we have to get beyond all this to accomplish
                  that, and we have to consider all the people who have benefited and
                  struggled in this industry.<span>  This
                  industry</span> can serve them too, but not like this.</p>
              <p>I'll get off the soap box and hope this can be
                  transmuted into a positive outcome.</p>
              <p>I don't think anyone really did anything
                  wrong.<span> </span> I think this is what happens
                  sometimes when we 'practice' business.<span> </span> We learn, we grow.</p>

              <p>Yup, agreed! </p>
              <p>Anyway, this forum has been awfully quiet. Well, that can be a good thing as well. </p>
              <p>Ok, I'm relatively new to the industry. However, I'm fortunate enough to learn the ropes of marketing and business strategies to help other networkers prosper in the long run.</p>
              <p>Relating to the topic, my understanding and approach of MLM is simple:</p>
              <p>1) MLM is a legitimate business, one that allows you to have residual income.</p>
              <p>2) As a networker/entrepreneur, you have to monetize your income. (It is always easier to achieve $100 in front end retail sales instead of $100 in residual income)</p>
              <p>3) Build your business around YOU! Stuart Tan, Adam Khoo, Fabian Lim can all attest to this. They've all built their business around themselves as a person. Network Marketing should only be a small portion of (Your Name) pie. The reason why I said that is simple:</p>
              <p><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>a) People will want to do business whom they know, like and trust.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>b) When you establish your brand, that is your income! (The value and knowledge <span style="white-space:pre"> </span>that you offer allows you to be financially free) For example, if David Beckham <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>retires from football, do you think he would stop earning? People will still want to buy <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>his jerseys and things related to his brand.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>c) It allows you to differentiate yourself from the competition because there's only <span style="white-space:pre"> </span>ONE you in the entire world. </p>
              <p>4) Read up any books or pick up any courses that will help increase your knowledge, be it in the network marketing business or personal development. As the old adage goes, the more you learn, the more you earn.</p>
              <p>5) Lastly, you need to have a strong and positive mindset. There is no point having to learn the most cutting edge tools but you don't have a proper mindset to help you withstand the difficult periods.</p>
              <p>Now, there has been alot of talk and buzz around using "Attraction Marketing" and "Funded Proposals" to build your network marketing organization and I'm a full advocate of that. <a href="http://heiderhassan.com/2010/06/18/top-10-web-2-0-network-marketers-why-how-they-did-it/">Mike Dillard, the Industry Guru</a>, especially in the online portion has single-handedly revolutionize the industry. I highly recommend those who have no clue what I'm talking about, go check him out. Regardless if you are in network marketing or doing any business, do check him out! It will literally help to propel your business to a whole new level.</p>
              <p>Jaz Lai, Singapore's Top Attraction Marketer, has been around the industry for quite some time and using the techniques by Mike, he has been able to create a successful business for himself.</p>
              <p>Regardless of your approach, it is important to take note of the points above to be able to succeed in this industry. Both methods (Traditional MLM techniques and New MLM techniques are both doable; just don't fall prey to unscrupulous methods which will undermine you and your shot at financial freedom)</p>
              <p>Ok if my post is totally off the main discussion thread, do let me know. I'm merely expressing my opinion on the industry and helping those who come here to share their thoughts on their understanding on the industry as well. We all can learn from each other.</p>
              <p>I've set up <a href="/forums/14/topics/403042">another separate thread</a>. Do come and express your ideas and knowledge about the industry. I would really appreciate it!</p>

              <p>The forum will be more quiet as time goes by and people find out the reality of MLM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also people want to do business with whomever they know, like and trust but at the end it boils down to product...product good they buy, not good don't buy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MLM basically sells products to people who buy them as a requirement to join the 'get rich scheme'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That residual income thing you're talking about only serves to widen the gap between your cost price and selling price. Unless you are selling a brand? Tag Huerer? Beemer? Amway, Oneway...what way lol?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>High margin = Not worth it. e.g. Magnetic pillows with health benefits.... I know the magnetic power can help to improve my blood circulation cause alot of iron yar? Price of this magic pillow?</p>

              Interesting perspective, Genie99a. Most people buy based on relationship anyway, whether it is personal, commercial or otherwise. MLM was originally conceived as a way in which companies could market their products while bypassing traditional advertising &amp; marketing methods and give people an oppty to buy products at market or just below market value for similar products. 
              
              The advent of internet has changed the paradigm of MLM. Its effect is evolution of opportunity. Like you say . . .some products good and some bad . . .just a matter of perspective.
