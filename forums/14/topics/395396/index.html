              <p>thanks</p>
              <p>Of course its genuine and it comes out from the heart. I'm doing this business with my relatives and friends, so it has to be genuine. and now they are so grateful to me that i showed them this business.</p>
              <p>yea, this is another form of satisfaction you get in network marketing.</p>
              <p>How do you get  this form of satisfaction? you don't want people to join the business for fun or ''try try lah''. Get people to see their possibilities in this business, and alot will start readily with a full heart. My companý's system has a way of doing that.</p>

              <p>1) MOST MLM salesmen use hard sell, in other words they practically brainwash and force their customers to buy.</p>
              <p>2) When you do 'presentations' etc...your main motive is to get your relatives/friends to buy your product. SO you'll be getting commission from them, and because they wanna support you or give you face, they will part with their hard earned money for a product that may, or may not work</p>
              <p>3) I dunno what the crap you're talking about</p>
              <p>4) Your fixed income is partly made up of commission taken from the people below. And yes, it is still unstable, as it depends on how many sales are closed per month.</p>
              <p>5) How many people have you heard of who actually managed to get their money back? SO many complaints at CASE already and still nothing.</p>
