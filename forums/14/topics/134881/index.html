StudioTraffic is similar to your local television where you can sit, relax and look at advertisements. The difference between StudioTraffic and your local television is that StudioTraffic pays you to surf and watch advertisers' websites, whereas your local TV station allows you to watch TV programs for free.<br>For Advertisers: If you wish to advertise your websites online, just as you would on TV, StudioTraffic is the right place to be. The important thing about StudioTraffic is that you can advertise your websites for free.<br><br>What is unique about StudioTraffic, is that you can be a member or an advertiser or both at the same time. StudioTraffic is a unique system where you can advertise your sites and our advertisers will pay you to view their websites, giving you the opportunity to increase those earnings further, and let you earn credits to advertise your own site, at the very same time.<br><br>How does it work?<br><br>Sign up now, and StudioTraffic will give you a free $10 account level. Then, all you need to do is log into your account, click on the Surf STV button, and watch. A new window will open for you, and show you our advertiserÂ’s web sites, on a 20-second timer. Once you have viewed your allocated number of sites, you will be credited with 1% of your account level. With a free account, thatÂ’s $0.10 a day! ItÂ’s that easy. You can also choose to upgrade your account to earn even more! Remember that there is NO OBLIGATION TO PAY ANYTHING, EVER. Use Surf STV as long as you wish, for free. You can earn between $0.10 up to $150 a day, depending on your account level, for about an hour of surfing. On top of that, you will earn credits that you can use to advertise your own website. We have thousands of members using Surf STV at any time. ThatÂ’s thousands of people ready to spend money at your website. Think about it.
