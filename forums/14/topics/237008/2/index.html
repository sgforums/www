            <div class='col-md body'>As for saturation, melaleuca has just set up shop in singapore just a little a year ago... currently only 16,000 people have signed up and we're far from being saturated. Almost everyone we've recommended have not heard of it yet (unlike Nu Skin, Usana, Amway) and most were quite impressed with the pricing and quality of the products.<br><br></div>

Although their compensation plans are much more attractive, they are also extremely prone to manipulation and you can end up losing lots of inventory.<br><br>I was really skeptical at first, but my wife and my retired father started it and is now reaping in a good decent monthly paycheck that is increasing by the month whilst working on it part-time. (I'm still hitting myself on the head on hesistating and now signing up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) The best part is that the investment is really small. Just $50 to get you off with a full business kit and you're off.<br><br>Another reason why this is going to take off... is that the company has not launched its 'internet ordering' and 'enrolment' portal yet (expected mid-Apr / May). Yes, it is still that new in Singapore.<br><br>If you are interested, pse PM me or visit our website at 'www.melaleucasingapore.com'. We'll be able to provide you more details there...<br></div></blockquote>$50 is kind of expensive...<br><br>i've got offers costing less than that..<br><br>and the products works as well..<br><br>with regards to the mlm companies that you've mentioned, from what i observed, most of them if not all of them emphasis on sales more than recruitment..<br><br>but since we're talking about positive residual income each month with lots of repeat sales, thus it's okay to choose companies which concentrate on sales rather networking..<br><br>correct me if i'm wrong in anyway..<br><br>thank you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pardon my butting in. I've read many posts in this forum debunking MLM companies as 'Ponzi schemes' because they focus too much on recruitment. Here I see people sneering at MLM companies for focusing too much on sales.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>In ANY company, MLM or not, isn't sales the most important aspect of the business? More Sales = More $$$$$$ = More profits<br><br>In fact, if anyone who is working for a company knows that the company is not doing well in sales, he/she will be worried and should be too.<br><br>I reckon anyone who wants to be successful in MLM has to associate him/herself with a company that is doing well. Sorry, having large crowds of people at meetings does not equate high sales. You got to observe the sales counter - how many people out of the 500 attendees at the meeting are actually buying products. Of course, not all sales transactions are done during the duration of the meetings, but most are.<br><br>I personally do not view the 'packaging' (lavish furnishings, large office space, etc) as the SOLE indication of the company's credibility or even success. I would prefer to look at how well the products are received by everyone I know and whether I'll be paid my bonus cheque promptly every month.<br><br>I am not a network marketer myself but I do know many people who were/are in MLM - past and present.<br><br>Melaleuca is well known in the market as a competitor of Amway because of its product line.<br><br>Not everyone is suitable for MLM and that is a fact.</div>
