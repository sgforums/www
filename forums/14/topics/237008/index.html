            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the Bear:</div><div class="quote_body">please explain..<br><br>seriously...<br><br>do you "refer someone" to the product or do you make that person you have to make the "referred person" commit to buying a pile of the product?<br><br>does the "referred person" have to pay a "membership fee" ?</div></blockquote>One would normally "refer" the potential customer to try out "xyz" product.<br>Some companies have sample-sized products for trial, some companies requires product to be bought because no sample sizes are available, some companies have free products for trails at their office.<br><br>For those who are professional, there is no tactic of "making" the customer "commit to buying a pile".<br>The customer either says Yes or No after reviewing the whole package presented to him/her.<br>Most customers are intelligent enough these days to think logically, so hard-sales (where you try to dictate people's decisions) are methods from ancient history.<br><br>The customer should see the reason (whatever it might be) that he/she wants to use the products, before committing to any small or large purchases.<br><br>If there is still buyer's remorse after signing on the dotted line, no worries, laws are in place for product refunds to be given in full.<br><br>Now... with the words "pile" and "membership" being brought up... Mr/Ms Bear is clearly leading us to the age-old discussion of "it's just another MLM".<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>MLM (well... not all of them, but it's good to know there exists some) in this modern day:<br><br>1)<br>Has products that cost less than retail shops (<strong>yet able </strong>to transfer revenue margins back to product promoters / distributors).<br><br>Companies with high-retail-cost products usually do not have competing equivalent-ingredient products in the <strong>retail </strong>market.<br><br>--&gt; Know what you're looking for: either lower-cost product (also see "membership" pointer below), or unique product.<br><br>2)<br>Confident private-retailers / individuals buy up a large initial stock of products for the product-promotion business that they are intending to conduct.<br>Companies thus naturally reward them <span style="font-style: italic;">better </span>than "normal" consumers / distributors who purchase a small initial stock.<br>(Makes normal business sense to provide this perk.)<br><br>However, human greed manifests itself here where individuals who didn't intend to do large-scale promoting buy up too large a stock than they need just to gain the attractive rewards the companies give.<br><br>--&gt; Buy what you think you need after doing your personal due diligence.<br>But don't go around exclaiming "oh i got cheated of a large investment in this so-called business" when it only shows one's initial unwise business decision. Better off keeping quiet.<br>(e.g.) You open a new McDonald's / Subway franchise in your area, throw in gigantic investment in franchisee fees (also like a "membership" of sorts), rental, overheads, etc to set it up, but due to unforeseen circumstances cannot continue business... are you going to go around proclaiming McD / Subway scammed you??<br>From the way people react to failure in true-product-mlm, yes you should proclaim McD scammed you of your money.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>3)<br>finally "membership".<br>(locals are really sticky with this concept... simply because we feel we aren't paid enough at our jobs -- more often than not this is true with your own boss who even "bargains" with you about your request for a pay raise.)<br><br>if a laundromat offers "membership" for discounted prices,<br>if a spa offers "membership" for member prices,<br>if a social club offers "membership" for members to enjoy facility/service priviledges,<br>etc.<br>etc.<br>are we to argue that?<br><br>now mlm companies... basically place a "membership" requirement of sorts because if you aren't a member, you need to buy at the higher "retail" product pricing.<br>(if you really like the product, what is up with being a member.<br>usually the membership fee is <strong>far less </strong>than the savings obtained.)<br><br>have issues with being a member? then the company has only to be fair to its product-promoter-member (aka distributor) to provide some sort of retail margin for retail sales (e.g. selling to you, a retail customer who refuses to pay membership fees).<br><br>also, some companies have a membership fee to cover for some of its unique admin features.<br>(some have personalised online shopping/retail carts (it <strong>is </strong>a business you're starting y'know), personalised websites, online accounting, online ordering, special delivery services, etcetc).<br><br>its true some say: "you can give me free wat". sure, a company might provide such services for free, what you're paying for there is a service.<br>if you're not happy for paying a service (&amp; its not surprising as Sg does not have a tipping culture to reward people who provide good service), find a company that can provide everything f.o.c.<br><br>remember, a lot of the times when you pay peanuts you get monkeys.<br><br>--&gt;"Membership" -- do you want to pay high-er retail prices for products you think you might want to use... or do you want to pay lower "wholesale" prices?<br>And, do you want to have access to member facilities?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Have they saturated the market and closed shop? They are $19 on the NYSE!)<br><br>but to minimise this "saturation" fear... why work with 4, 5, 6, 10 customer-minimum companies, when modern-day mlm's allow earnings starting with just 2?<br><a href="http://networkmarketingtrialsandtribulations.blogspot.com/2006/08/working-plan.html" rel="nofollow">http://networkmarketingtrialsandtribulations.blogspot.com/2006/08/working-plan.html</a><br></div>
