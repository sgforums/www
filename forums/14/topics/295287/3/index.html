                  <p><br>What's wrong with it? Mlmers know their own tricks better. What concern me is that why most of the members are not local compaines. It's Direct Selling Association of <strong>Singapore.</strong></p> But it's like a US committee to me.

              <p>What I read from the above post seems to be over exaggerated. I have been an active MLM business owners in 2 companies but what I quite agree is the tactics employed.</p>
              <p><strong>Firstly I want to clarify some points:</strong></p>
              <p>1) First understand that MLM is a business. When one is in business, one has to do some marketing.Therefore, on the business standpoint, its just part and parcel of business practices. Even working in a company when meeting with potential clients, it is purely social etiqueete.</p>
              <p>2) Secondly, its a people business. Hence, relationship building is necessary. However what so differentiate from other business models is its unique word of mouth sharing of its services and  products. This enables clients or potential customers to be well - informed about the products that are introduced. But before I went on, allow me to relate a personal account of my own story:</p>
              <p>I remember once i 'm having acne issue and so I went to a department store to find possible solution to my problem. The sales lady would brought me to a list of products and begin to provide recommendation. Since they are professional, I trust their advice and it turns out to be a nightmare. It does not work at all and it is expensive.</p>
              <p>Then I meet up with a network marketer. I was surpised when they began to analyse my issue and even show me the cause of my acne and how I should remedy it. It was then I realize the difference between a network marketer and a salesman.</p>
              <p>A salesman will sell a product that they never used themselves and their objective is to sell the product and earn a commission. While a network marketer is in a <strong>teaching</strong> and <strong>consulting</strong> business. Since their income comes from repeat orders of products, it is necessary to provide excellent and professional services with an uphold of integrity. It is their own business, do you think they will ruin it? A salesman on the other hand is working for somebody. Think for a while, who will give more value added in terms of quality and information to resolve your existing problems.</p>
              <p>I agree that they may be some who resort to gimmicks for profitability, and not offering what clients truly required, but certainly MLM is a legitimate business and is even part of the core curriculum of Harvard business school. In fact, I seen lives were changed after taking MLM, some from the scorn of society to becoming the prince of the world.</p>
              <p>When I think about it, who will give the less fortunate a chance to proof themselves in a realistic world where qualifications is necessary. Yet network marketing is a building people business and great friendship and bonds were built up as a result. Its more than a business, perhaps in my opinions, it has become a reform center. Why?</p>
              <p>I have seen familiess who came to an almost broke up to a restored relationship through network marketing. I have seen people who have lost confidence in themselves changed and had become great leaders. In fact, many who become successful lives a life of giving and service to others. They share what they have, their knowledge, expertise and support. In addition, the support and help from network marketers becomes a strong pillar of support for those in adverse time. People of diverse backgrounds stood out to help one another, sometime in the process brings about the concept of sacrificial giving that is lacking in modern society. In the corporate world, most backbiting occurs in office politics. Who will sacrifice to lend support to the 'slower' colleagues? And how many suffer in silence inspite of their selfless giving to their company ended up in a letter of dismissal. In fact, last week, while working in my mnc company, I was shocked by a dedicated worker who even willingly to forsake his lunch to complete an important task is scolded by his superior and are even made a remark of being not serious in his work. When I saw how upset he was, I feel so sorry for him. These I did speak out from what I truly saw and personally experience.</p>
              <p>It may be pure generalisation that it occurs in all companies but statistically, it appears 80% are not happy in their work and hope for more time with their own family, wishing for financial independence and being able to live their dreams. The question is who will give them opportunity and how can they obtain it? Companies giving you more time, provide you with financial freedom and ......? If there is such a 'lobang' let me know. In my opinion, what network marketers offering them is a golden opportunity to turn their life around, and certainly their motive is not to take advantage of as perceived from the message that conveys earlier. It appears from your letter that MLM is bad, but can you on the other hand lead these disgruntled souls out and provide them twith solutions....Some even with health issues and if the products of a network marketing company can help them, why not. In fact, I have personally research and having been in the industry as a network marketer and being a worker in coporate world, network marketing, I discover that mlm forms a social platform where human are able to come to a personal level where social interaction is possible given the fast-paced and virtual world that society has become. It is healthy and in addition, a perfect abode for solace....where there is no competition, but encouragement....and good products that solve our problems.</p>
              <p>Finally, before jumping to conclusion, and before making any criticism, unless you have alternative solutions for the less fortunates, enterprising and people who want to change their lots in their lives, please think first before throwing a wet blanket over them, dashing their hopes and dreams and missing some opportunities.</p>
              <p>The worst thing that can happen in life is someone without a dream and one without a hope. Don't kill their soul with a pure remark for words are powerful weapon. Therefore be wise in your words for one never knows how your words can influence and affect the lives of others.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p><br>that is very subjective.. what kind of MLM company you working in and wat kind of platform and system they ar using.. What product or services they have.. thier branding.. their market.. <br>MLM.. "Multi Level Marketing" alone is just is a tool... in fact a powerful tool..<br>today it depends on who is using it..</p>
              <p>A jackass will use it to play money game.. and at the end of the day the top ends the most and they run.. Yes! that happens..</p>
              <p>But if it's a good company using it it will be different.. and if u dont know yet.. all if not most of the big company is using MLM.. for example.. Citibank... which u certainly dont know.</p>
              <p>lets talk about insurance.. the 1st person went in.. earn the most.. that's for sure.. when the 100th person went in.. he is still earn.. leveraging with people.. population of the world increasing not.. decreasing.. today the 101th person went in and he doesnt earn.. came out of the system and start complaining.. "ah.. i'm not the poineer im so much at the bottom.. the poineer cheat our money!" that is bullshi*.. <br><br>think abt it.. people who always complain is the people who never success in anything..<br><br>lets make a bet.. right now lets bet on a MLM company now.. say imuone.. right now she is still new.. people start saying it's a scam.. i can promise u.. 10 years down the road when thousands and millions people came out successful from this company.. the same people will still be in this same forum complaining that it is a scam..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Do you think the rate of "success" is very low? Given the saturated market of mlm companies selling the same product types (example, health products). And the number of mlm agents? Everyone is a competitor, selling the same products. Lets say a company has 1000 agents, one person would have to compete with 999 other agents selling the same product. Encouraging agents to bring people in just increases the competition. The rate of incoming agents are high, slightly lower are the rate of outgoing agents.</p></div>

              <p>This a just a Business of their own or let say is a job of
              theirs.</p>
              <p>GOVERMENT has already step out to say MLM can do and is not
              Scamming. But do you all have all this free time to sit infront of
              the computer and gossip here and there.</p>
              <p>We have our own job to do. just respect ppl occupation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Tms Rmn;">right to say everything you
              do , if you want to get high return of cos hardwork must be there.
              even if you work for others without hardwork you will get
              retrenched what. if ppl is putting mlm and scamming PYRAMIND
              together as the same, i would just say that corperate
              company are also pyramind.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as you will see this if you realise.</p>

              <p>u also got nothing better to do and come here to post all this?</p>
              <p>The main difference in that pyramid is that the people below doesn't pay the ones at the top and they dun psycho people into joining them or buy their overprice products. Basically mlm is similar to a cult, they just want to brainwash u so u would part with ur money and get others to join and do the same. They are usually very hype up and make empty promises, if mlm does work as they claim who the hell would join the work force?</p>
              <p>Btw mlm is not an occupation, they always tell u its a 'business'.... a rather fishy business <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi xfool, it seems you have a bad impression of the industry, maybe you done it before maybe not, the thing is those brainwashing techniques you call are actually the mlm getting the person to get interested, however, just because the person did not succeed, he starts complaining, just like everyone, lets play a game, try not complaining for a week.</p>
              <p>It is this complaining that spreads about and everybody starts to be afraid. I nearly got into a very bad company before, which is avita, and i have heard of very bad companies, but then, is it a good enough reason to stop looking for an opportunity to make money?</p>
              <p>MLM actually does work if the company has the proper guidance and with the proper compensation plan but the thing is that not everyone is meant to be in the business.</p>
              <p>It is really a business because leadership skills, sales skills, promoting skills and just about anything that has got to do with an actual business are learnt from the people the the company. It is a place where the leader has to train his downline to succeed in order to make money. How fishy is that?</p>
              <p>People, please stop the rumors that mlm is bad just because you or a friend or relative had been tricked into a bad mlm company before. For the people who have failed at it, look back and reflect, did you even do your part to make an effort to grow your team and what you could have done in order to have been successful?</p>

              <p>Hi Xfool. Basically, i am really a person who does not have much thing to do... :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I can say is , earning big money is not easy AT all, if just because of starting 3 months or half a year haven seen any income , than just give up than this person has no determination. In such case , please teach me how to do a traditional business than can earn back your capital from start, failure is always failure ???no right. there are really ppl who did well in this industry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ppl always like to talk about bad things and not good thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why ask ppl who fail doing business and not asking ppl who succeed in business ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's also the same why ask ppl who fail in MLM and why don ask ppl who success in MLM on how to really do this MLM in order to success?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Am I right ?</p>
              <p>Some ppl just cannot accept that they just fail.Than blame here and there ?</p>
              <p>Did you once study before ? There is always ppl who gets good result and there is always ppl who failed ? Are the ppl who fail gonna tell you that WOW THIS SCHOOL CANNOT study  one?</p>
              <p> Basically it's still base on hardship and hardwork you put in..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don tell me that who you work hard your boss pay you addidtional 100 - 1000 extra per month ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you don perform , Out you go ! you are gonna be the first one to be retrenched,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> It the same loh. There are ppl who are lazy , and everyday complaining  but they themselves cannot show ppl how to earn big money ? they are ppl who cannot do MLM and ppl who cannot do their own biz. they can only work and work and work for the rest of their life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ppl who fail doing mlm and spreading that mlm cannot do , they are the ppl who  are so proud of themselves that they fail their BIZ. same one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don see that there is over cost for their product except those selling bed or what la. but for health product I can see that the guradian or GNC selling also not cheap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where got any business starting you can earn back your money one ?</p>
              <p>Please tell me , if have I also want to do ...</p>

              <p>In this business, the company is very important. The company you mention indeed is bad, but one company doesnt represent the industry.</p>
              <p>What is important is that little or no capital is involved.. meaning no money lost.. and nothing is earned from recruiting.</p>
              <p>The mindset is important too... have to understand the whole business and how it can help people and to self-develop oneself to be a better person and to make more friends.. ultimately thats how a gd businessman shld be.. to care for others....</p>
              <p>If you look around, there are indeed some positive and serious companies with non-overpriced products and a gd education and business system to simply help others at minimal or no cost.</p>
              <p>So never condemn the industry just because of a few black sheeps :D</p>
