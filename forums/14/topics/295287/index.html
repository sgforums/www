            <div class='col-md body'>I'm finally free to make a long consolidated post.<br><br><strong>How they CONvince you to join them</strong><br><br>Beware when some random stranger messages you online, email, sms etc, asking to be friend. The typical lines would be...<br><br>"Whats your interest"<br>"Whats your ambition"<br>"Interested to do biz?"<br><br>This is called fake facade. Fake friendship. Some people go to great lengths to act out friendship to drag people into MLMing. Trust me... It's like a drama serial, all planned out.<br><br>Then one fine day they'll give an excuse to ask you out. This can be extremely creative. From askin you out to dinner, lunch to movies, asking you to help them do some stuff, give something to them, matchmaking, etc.<br><br>Usually it would be at an eating place, or someplace where you can gather. Most probably somewhere near the company's office. One favourite haunt is Lau Pa Sat.<br><br>Then here, the fake friendliness gets really scary. It seems everyone's know you for a million years and starts talking to you like an old frined. But take note there would almost always have this one person chatting to you. He'll be the most friendly, acting concerned, etc. Beware, this guy/girl might be your future upline if you join. Thi s is called building relationship is sales.<br><br>You would ask where they are going, then the most common excuses they'll give are:<br><br>"Why do you ask so much"<br>"It's very hard to explain"<br>"You'll know when you reach there"<br>"It's fun, its interesting"<br><br>Or they'll just divert topic.t<br><br>Ask them directly, and they would give you the lost for words expression, and will repeat the excuses. I've had 5 different people asking me "do you know what you're here for" and when I ask them what, they give all sorts of excues. So when I finally probe this guy, he admits its sales, but says its SLM, not MLM. They can think op of all sorts of unique names. But the concept is still the same. Another excuse is "start you own business".<br><br>Finally they've successfully tricked you into going for their outing. Then, slowly, fox tail emerges. They would tell you to go "somewhere see see" or some creative excuses to get you to go to their office, seminar, whatever.<br><br>Office situation:<br><br>Will intro you their products, will say how great the company is. Or to one particular company, says how great their father... oops i mean boss is.<br><br>Some companies, like this particular one used to be behind LPS, now shifted to Eunos will boast how great their company is, to lame extents, like how they can afford Shenton Way rent, if its not good they won't be able to, blah blah blah. Other people would hold you back until the big guy arrives with a "business proposal".<br><br>Typical manipulation of emotions sequence of steps:<br><br><strong>1) Question your future</strong><br><br>They would question your future, what is your ambition, etc.<br><br><strong>2) Makes you question your future</strong><br><br>They would make you question your future. Tell you to think of how much you can earn, how big is the industry of your field, etc.<br><br><strong>3) Insults your future</strong><br><br>They would say how bad your future is, there's no future in your field, etc. Your job no hope, cannot earn anything, won't be successful. Basically trying to shoot you down and to shatter your morale. This is a critical step for them.<br><br><strong>4) "Reality check"</strong><br><br>They would say how cost of living is increasing, how news say your field has no hope, etc. Stating some "examples". Say what power tariffs increasing, petrol price increasing, etc. Say you job would not be able to make the money to cover it.<br><br><strong>5) "Your road to success"</strong><br><br>Knowing your morale had been destroyed by steps 2 to 4, they try to "console" you, there is a way out. This is called, enforcing relationships. Like a knight helping a damsel in distress. They would hope that you would "thank" them for it.<br><br><strong>6) Gives examples </strong><br>Typical "examples":<br><br>a) Earn more than uni grad<br>b) "Look at him, he's &lt; insert age here &gt;, so young, driving car liao"<br>c) Say can earn few thousands a month. Shows the top earners in suits, looking confident, how much they had earned, a few 10Ks.<br>d) Say how MLM had "changed their lives" and "made them a better person"<br><br><strong>7) Boast, compare</strong><br><br>They would boast about how successful their company is, how fast they've grown, how fast they'll grow, etc. Would say how great their seniors are, say they're  at <br><br><strong>8 ) Big guy arrives</strong><br><br>They would send for the big guys, their seniors, and most likely the steps would be repeated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many MLMs give ppl the false hope of making it big. Give example of ppl driving car, 5 figure income, in suits (in tropical sg weather!)... etc. So based on this argument of 5K figure, say I strike Toto once, got few hundred dollars. Then I see ppl making $15M in Toto, so I say I can retire early being professional Toto buyer?<br><br>Say simi sai can retire early, earn more than uni grad, financial freedom, etc. Lots of crap excuses. Say what cost of living increasing, start biz can earn more than working. Why work for 40 years, retire for 20 when u can work 20yrs, retire for 40?<br><br>The target youths... why? Cos youths are generally:.<br>1) presumed to have more friends (more potential downlines)<br>2) more lively (can sell more)<br>3) more daring<br>4) are presumed to be at crossroads of deciding what they want to do in their future<br>5) are presumed to be unsure of their future<br>6) are presumed to need $$$</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, in addition to the above, I would like to clarify on 1 point. In internet network marketing, it isn't done the same way. You can't really ask the guy out for lunch or dinner. In the online way, advertisements are simply placed all over the internet and those who are interested will join. So there is no need for fake friendship or anything like that. Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I don't mean to help or put down anyone here but I think that everyone does have a right to say what they want, even if it makes no sense to anyone else. After all that is what a forum is about, everybodys' views. Anyway, from where the topic is going, it seems to be about whether if a company is cleared of fraud once it is listed on SGX or something like that. I do US trading so I don't really know much about SGX. But personally, I think that there must be some criteria if it is to be listed in our precious SGX. Of course I am not saying that these criterias are able to clear a company of fraud but just that I guess only "sound" companies are allowed on SGX. Because Singapore very "kia see" mah. Anyone jump off the building because they lost their life savings goes headlines so they don't really want that too. Again this is just my own personal opinion. Cheers</div>
