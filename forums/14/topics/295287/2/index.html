              <p>VE group. U wanna see their products? Go to 3rd level via the main lift.<br><br>Reading the TS point if view, I feel so stupid being their victim... luckily I didnt sell anything, just treat it as time wasted and a lesson learnt.<br><br>Oh ya and the their phone calls, let me explain the untold truth<br><br>1. "Earn about 500 to 2k per month"<br><br>- Actually it should be 0 to 2k per month, there is no guarantee that u will earn<br><br>2. "Assist managers in assignments"<br><br>- Ya sort of "assist them" by getting permission to your friends or relative house to sell them stuffs.<br><br>3. "Not so much about marketing, more on managing"<br><br>-Its a long way before u reach the "managing part"<br><br>4. "I am calling VE group"<br><br>-Why u didnt dare to say your company full name out loud?<br><br>My advice, if they call u, and u have nothing to do (especially the school holidays) give it a try. I mean just go down there and see what they are up to and most importantly learn from them. Hear what they have to say. You can also spend some time into their "free job training"<br><br>But most importantly do not reveal any other people's contact. If they give you some paper and ask to to write down a contact list as a form of HP backup,<br><span style="color: red;">LEAVE THE COMPANY IMMEDIATELY</span><br><br>Luckily my friend is understand enough to forgive me when I went up to his house for "assignment"</p>

The typical lines would be...<br><br>"Whats your interest"<br>"Whats your ambition"<br>"Interested to do biz?"<br><br>This is called fake facade. Fake friendship. Some people go to great lengths to act out friendship to drag people into MLMing. Trust me... It's like a drama serial, all planned out.<br><br>Then one fine day they'll give an excuse to ask you out. This can be extremely creative. From askin you out to dinner, lunch to movies, asking you to help them do some stuff, give something to them, matchmaking, etc.<br><br>Usually it would be at an eating place, or someplace where you can gather. Most probably somewhere near the company's office. One favourite haunt is Lau Pa Sat.<br><br>Then here, the fake friendliness gets really scary. It seems everyone's know you for a million years and starts talking to you like an old frined. But take note there would almost always have this one person chatting to you. He'll be the most friendly, acting concerned, etc. Beware, this guy/girl might be your future upline if you join. Thi s is called building relationship is sales.<br><br>You would ask where they are going, then the most common excuses they'll give are:<br><br>"Why do you ask so much"<br>"It's very hard to explain"<br>"You'll know when you reach there"<br>"It's fun, its interesting"<br><br>Or they'll just divert topic.t<br><br>Ask them directly, and they would give you the lost for words expression, and will repeat the excuses. I've had 5 different people asking me "do you know what you're here for" and when I ask them what, they give all sorts of excues. So when I finally probe this guy, he admits its sales, but says its SLM, not MLM. They can think op of all sorts of unique names. But the concept is still the same. Another excuse is "start you own business".<br><br>Finally they've successfully tricked you into going for their outing. Then, slowly, fox tail emerges. They would tell you to go "somewhere see see" or some creative excuses to get you to go to their office, seminar, whatever.<br><br>Office situation:<br><br>Will intro you their products, will say how great the company is. Or to one particular company, says how great their father... oops i mean boss is.<br><br>Some companies, like this particular one used to be behind LPS, now shifted to Eunos will boast how great their company is, to lame extents, like how they can afford Shenton Way rent, if its not good they won't be able to, blah blah blah. Other people would hold you back until the big guy arrives with a "business proposal".<br><br>Typical manipulation of emotions sequence of steps:<br><br><strong>1) Question your future</strong><br><br>They would question your future, what is your ambition, etc.<br><br><strong>2) Makes you question your future</strong><br><br>They would make you question your future. Tell you to think of how much you can earn, how big is the industry of your field, etc.<br><br><strong>3) Insults your future</strong><br><br>They would say how bad your future is, there's no future in your field, etc. Your job no hope, cannot earn anything, won't be successful. Basically trying to shoot you down and to shatter your morale. This is a critical step for them.<br><br><strong>4) "Reality check"</strong><br><br>They would say how cost of living is increasing, how news say your field has no hope, etc. Stating some "examples". Say what power tariffs increasing, petrol price increasing, etc. Say you job would not be able to make the money to cover it.<br><br><strong>5) "Your road to success"</strong><br><br>Knowing your morale had been destroyed by steps 2 to 4, they try to "console" you, there is a way out. This is called, enforcing relationships. Like a knight helping a damsel in distress. They would hope that you would "thank" them for it.<br><br><strong>6) Gives examples </strong><br>Typical "examples":<br><br>a) Earn more than uni grad<br>b) "Look at him, he's &lt; insert age here &gt;, so young, driving car liao"<br>c) Say can earn few thousands a month. Shows the top earners in suits, looking confident, how much they had earned, a few 10Ks.<br>d) Say how MLM had "changed their lives" and "made them a better person"<br><br><strong>7) Boast, compare</strong><br><br>They would boast about how successful their company is, how fast they've grown, how fast they'll grow, etc. Would say how great their seniors are, say they're  at <br><br><strong>8 ) Big guy arrives</strong><br><br>They would send for the big guys, their seniors, and most likely the steps would be repeated.

              <p>The most common line would be "If you don't buy how you know it doesn't work". For this simply say "why don't you buy for me to try?"</p>
              <p>Best excuse would be no money. If they say withdraw from ATM, say no ATM card, or ATM account empty. Or give some lame excuse say you just paid your taxes, bills, fees, etc no money.</p>

              <p>The story is The Parable of the Pipeline.. like the title, it is
              a parable, so of coz no direct link.. the main point of the story
              is just to teach us to be able to think out of the box and able to
              understand and see a good opportunity for the long term even though

              <p>Yes. But the Parable of the Pipeline has nothing to do with MLMs.</p>
              <p>The pipeline works because there is an increase in productivity. The manpower and effort required to build the pipe costs less than the manpower and effort required to move the equivalent amount of water by hand over the lifetime of the pipe.</p>
              <p>MLMs do not increase productivity. Instead of building a pipeline, an MLMer would get all his friends and relatives to help him carry water and promise them huge amounts of money to do so. However, the catch is that the greater returns they want, the more water they have to buy. In theory, they could sell the water to other people as well but the water is so overpriced, people would not buy for the water itself, but for the promised returns.</p>

              <p>hmmm... im just curious... does any1 that replies in this forum is a network marketer? i mean... actually i think we all know that in any industry there are the black sheeps ... but are'nt we a bit too extreme here? i read from books by robert t.kiyosaki that explains on network marketing and why it is do-able for people who are willing to get out of their comfort zone.</p>
              <p>I saw a interesting qn being posted above "Eh does property agency work in some similar way like MLM?"</p>
              <p>haha.. in fact, many insurance agents, financial planners, wealth managers and property agents are leveraging on network marketing to build their individual biznesses... if it is so "wrong" why is it so prominent now?</p>
              <p><br>I know of a friend in ntu now who is in year 2 now earns close to 30k per month from his wealth manager sideline :) and he is leveraging on this bizness model :)</p>

              Your friend earns near 30K per month? Are you sure did not add an extra zero yourself? Why the hell is he still studying then? Since he is earning more than most CEOs, he should quit school and maybe get the Straits Times or Chronicle to feature him.

              <p>Actually there are many more things in life then just money... knowledge and time is precious to sum people too...</p>
              <p>Values and priorities are the key behind a person's actions..</p>
              <p>The fact that some people choose to finish their studies even though they are earning way more then most people outside is not to intimidate ppl.. but more of trying to bring across values that are enduring :) im not saying that quittin  school to do stuff is wrong but its just a matter of priorities and values :)</p>
              <p>Have faith in wadever u do after you have fixed your direction :) if u identified network marketing as the model to go den persevere in it. As long as you do not cross your own line and you are answerable to yourself by all means make that bold step :) mlm tactics to put it simply are just sales tactics. Nothing much wrong wif dat though :)</p>
              <p>Some of the richest people and youngsters are still pursuing their studies even though they do not need to worry about their life in terms of security. These people are doing what dey are doing from the hunger they have within them. It is this "hunger" thats invaluable.</p>
              <p>A lot is in the self. A lot of students will always complain about lecturers and tutors.. but most of the time, its really us students that are just not showing enuff enthusiasm in wad we are learning which shows in the kinda results u get :)</p>
              <p>The key to the post earlier is to maybe show a different side to people who read this thread. You should always be shown 2 sides of the story. :)</p>
              <p>I hav to sae dat i hav a lot to learn from young entrepreneurs like those :) but i still believe in my own passion .</p>
              <p>Identify ur passion and work towards it.. there may be many falls and obstacles but the result is satisfying</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I'm finally free to make a long consolidated post.<br> <br> <strong>How they CONvince you to join them</strong><br> <br> Beware when some random stranger messages you online, email, sms
              etc, asking to be friend. The typical lines would be...<br> <br> "Whats your interest"<br> "Whats your ambition"<br> "Interested to do biz?"<br> <br> This is called fake facade. Fake friendship. Some people go to
              great lengths to act out friendship to drag people into MLMing.
              Trust me... It's like a drama serial, all planned out.<br> <br> Then one fine day they'll give an excuse to ask you out. This can
              be extremely creative. From askin you out to dinner, lunch to
              movies, asking you to help them do some stuff, give something to
              them, matchmaking, etc.<br> <br> Usually it would be at an eating place, or someplace where you can
              gather. Most probably somewhere near the company's office. One
              favourite haunt is Lau Pa Sat.<br> <br> Then here, the fake friendliness gets really scary. It seems
              everyone's know you for a million years and starts talking to you
              like an old frined. But take note there would almost always have
              this one person chatting to you. He'll be the most friendly, acting
              concerned, etc. Beware, this guy/girl might be your future upline
              if you join. Thi s is called building relationship is sales.<br> <br> You would ask where they are going, then the most common excuses
              they'll give are:<br> <br> "Why do you ask so much"<br> "It's very hard to explain"<br> "You'll know when you reach there"<br> "It's fun, its interesting"<br> <br> Or they'll just divert topic.t<br> <br> Ask them directly, and they would give you the lost for words
              expression, and will repeat the excuses. I've had 5 different
              people asking me "do you know what you're here for" and when I ask
              them what, they give all sorts of excues. So when I finally probe
              this guy, he admits its sales, but says its SLM, not MLM. They can
              think op of all sorts of unique names. But the concept is still the
              same. Another excuse is "start you own business".<br> <br> Finally they've successfully tricked you into going for their
              outing. Then, slowly, fox tail emerges. They would tell you to go
              "somewhere see see" or some creative excuses to get you to go to
              their office, seminar, whatever.<br> <br> Office situation:<br> <br> Will intro you their products, will say how great the company is.
              Or to one particular company, says how great their father... oops i
              mean boss is.<br> <br> Some companies, like this particular one used to be behind LPS, now
              shifted to Eunos will boast how great their company is, to lame
              extents, like how they can afford Shenton Way rent, if its not good
              they won't be able to, blah blah blah. Other people would hold you
              back until the big guy arrives with a "business proposal".<br> <br> Typical manipulation of emotions sequence of steps:<br> <br> <strong>1) Question your future</strong><br> <br> They would question your future, what is your ambition, etc.<br> <br> <strong>2) Makes you question your future</strong><br> <br> They would make you question your future. Tell you to think of how
              much you can earn, how big is the industry of your field,
              etc.<br> <br> <strong>3) Insults your future</strong><br> <br> They would say how bad your future is, there's no future in your
              field, etc. Your job no hope, cannot earn anything, won't be
              successful. Basically trying to shoot you down and to shatter your
              morale. This is a critical step for them.<br> <br> <strong>4) "Reality check"</strong><br> <br> They would say how cost of living is increasing, how news say your
              field has no hope, etc. Stating some "examples". Say what power
              tariffs increasing, petrol price increasing, etc. Say you job would
              not be able to make the money to cover it.<br> <br> <strong>5) "Your road to success"</strong><br> <br> Knowing your morale had been destroyed by steps 2 to 4, they try to
              "console" you, there is a way out. This is called, enforcing
              relationships. Like a knight helping a damsel in distress. They
              would hope that you would "thank" them for it.<br> <br> <strong>6) Gives examples</strong><br> Typical "examples":<br> <br> a) Earn more than uni grad<br> b) "Look at him, he's &lt; insert age here &gt;, so young, driving
              car liao"<br> c) Say can earn few thousands a month. Shows the top earners in
              suits, looking confident, how much they had earned, a few
              10Ks.<br> d) Say how MLM had "changed their lives" and "made them a better
              person"<br> <br> <strong>7) Boast, compare</strong><br> <br> They would boast about how successful their company is, how fast
              they've grown, how fast they'll grow, etc. Would say how great
              their seniors are, say they're at<br> <br> <strong>8 ) Big guy arrives</strong><br> <br> They would send for the big guys, their seniors, and most likely
              the steps would be repeated.</p>
