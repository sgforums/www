              <p>its not only me that have bad impression , I think almost anyone
              who has contact with mlm have bad experiences or know of someone
              that lost money in it. btw what rumors are u talking about ,its a
              fact that this industry is bad, sunshine emipire is a good
              example,theres an article on new paper 2 days ago and u call that a
              rumor?</p>
              <p>I agree that not everyone is suitable in this 'business' but
              they would always try to recruit anyone just to make their money
              without caring if that person is interested or suitable in this
              'business'.</p>
              <p>There are other ways to make money than to be in this industry
              and get condem by friends and relatives.</p>

              <p>The thing is, so what if you had a bad experience or someone who knows about it, do you actually understand how it works from the inside out? Unless you do before then you understand but also depending on which company you were in, just because of one bad company you say that the whole industry is no good, is that logical? What about china's milk, now the whole world must say china no good, stop going china, don't do business which china all this?? You get what i mean?</p>
              <p>I'm not telling you go and love this industry but at least get your facts right.</p>
              <p>The rumor all you people like to spread is that mlm is bad and is a scam, understand the whole thing then talk alright. There are the people who recruit others in, but why the recruited do not earned? It's because the upline is not a proper teacher to show the downline the proper way to conduct the business.</p>
              <p>The thing about mlmers going about recruiting everyone is because they just want to try asking if people would be interested in the compensation plan and promote the products, if you open your own business, don't tell me you open shop and not promote your products at all, of course you will tell everyone about what you have that can benefit them.</p>
              <p>Need any more clarifications?</p>

              <p>In this business, the company is very important. The company you
              mention indeed is bad, but one company doesnt represent the
              industry.</p>
              <p>What is important is that little or no capital is involved..
              meaning no money lost.. and nothing is earned from recruiting.</p>
              <p>The mindset is important too... have to understand the whole
              business and how it can help people and to self-develop oneself to
              be a better person and to make more friends.. ultimately thats how
              a gd businessman shld be.. to care for others....</p>
              <p>If you look around, there are indeed some positive and serious
              companies with non-overpriced products and a gd education and
              business system to simply help others at minimal or no cost.</p>
              <p>So never condemn the industry just because of a few black sheeps
              :D</p>
