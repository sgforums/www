            <div class='col-md body'>WE'LL MISS YOU, KUMAR<br><br>BY YONG SIEW FERN<br>Apr 3, 2000<br><br>THAT'S all, folks.<br><br>And he couldn't help but cry.<br><br>Kumar, the funny man who had been making people laugh at The Boom Boom Room, was a tearful sight last night.<br><br>And who could blame him?<br><br>After all, it WAS closing night.<br><br>But more of Kumar's tears later.<br><br>Sure it's sad to see them go. But it's just as well that The Boom Boom Room closed its doors after eight years yesterday.<br><br>Or this early morning if you will.<br><br>The people on and off stage deserve a bigger, better place.<br><br>If it got any more popular - especially at times when it said it is closing and seemingly sentimental Singaporeans swarmed to catch its last shows - the whole room would have flouted fire safety standards to outrageous measures.<br><br>At its closing party last night, the Bugis comedy joint was rumbling in its own belly of wild fire.<br><br>O LA LA!: Is that you, Kumar? My, what a cute bra you have... Eh, can borrow or not?<br><br>It was holding a sweltering 400-odd crowd in its premises that feature antiquated dull red carpets, peeling ceilings, heavy red stools and plenty of large fans and air-coolers that had long given up on turning heat to cold.<br><br>Guests by private invitation sashayed in from 8 pm onwards. Then, by 10 pm, after the place was opened to the public and the first snaking queue of people had found its way into the throbbing belly, it was almost impossible to find a trace of fresh oxygen.<br><br>People were packed body-to-body.<br><br>So it was that when the deejay shouted "If you have a lighter, put it up!", a silent prayer was said so no fool would actually combust everyone.<br><br>Occasionally, the PSI reading for the room reached 200, with very poor visibility of the crowd on the other end of the room - courtesy of cigarette smoke and smoke machines.<br><br>It was almost mystical - or maybe it was just the air-starved mind hallucinating.<br><br>It was a culture shock of sorts - and not because of the performers. The last time I visited the club three years ago, it was comfortable even if you had to stand.<br><br>Its managing director, Alan Koh, deadpanned: "For the past two weeks, it's been like this. The queue would go up to the main road. It's not Hello Kitty. It's Goodbye Kumar.<br><br>HMMM: Eh, who says I modern only? Sometimes, I'm traditional, too. Go East lah.<br><br>"Just like what Kumar said, it's so Singaporean. For the past 7Â½ years, he's been here and no one comes but when we say we're closing, everyone is here."<br><br>They have had to turn away people on other nights and when I asked if there were fire exits in the room, he pointed loosely to three spots but I was too groggy to figure them out.<br><br>Gratefully, at 11 pm, the red velvet stage curtains finally spread open like a seasoned, er, dancer.<br><br>Then, everything else seemed the same as three years ago - the bright lights, even brighter costumes, impressive choreography and choice songs.<br><br>Only this time, there were more new faces alongside the old ones and the acts had become very polished.<br><br>No newbies were out there testing waters for their stand-up comic skills - they left it to pros such as Sherry, Leena and Kumar.<br><br>They poured their hearts, bra paddings, stockings and tight butts into what they do best - their favourite cabaret numbers which tossed out the funny nuances of Singapore's three main ethnic groups.<br><br>ARGUMENT<br><br>WOW: Aiyo, this dress is so tight lah. Breathless boy...<br><br>But at least one woman in the audience was not touched by their efforts as she started a late-night argument with Kumar during his stand-up gig about the people he poked fun at.<br><br>"If you're uneducated, don't come to this club," he retorted.<br><br>"One more word from her, let's kill her!" Kumar urged as she refused to give up.<br><br>The audience - which by then had included the cast of Chicago the musical - yelled their approval.<br><br>When the show ended at 2 am, the night came to a very sticky hot drag as all 22 performers and two managers said their thanks to mostly the same people.<br><br>Kumar cried, as did Alan and half of the performers. After all, it's been a hard day's night. For many, many nights.<br><br>So thank you, guys, for making us laugh.<br><br>Take a bow.<br><br>from The New Paper, 3 April 2000</div>
