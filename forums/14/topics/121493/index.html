For those who haven't sign up, you might want to take a look at this great business opportunity. Anyway we already have a SG community at their forum.<br><br>I emailed them for their StudioPay office in SG. I will drop by and take a pic to be posted here.

It's easy.<br><br>Step 1.  <a href="http://www.studiotraffic.com/index.php?refid=108271" rel="nofollow">Sign up under me</a>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Step 2. Your membership level is 10. You earn $0.1 daily for surfing 200 sites.<br><br>Step 3. You need a minimum of level 100 to cash out. So you decide invest for e.g. $100, to upgrade your account. As promised, I will give you a free $10 upgrade. Therefore, your membership level by then would be 120.<br><br>Step 4. So you are happily earning $1.2 daily for surfing 100sites, which takes you no more than an hour. But you realise you are not able to surf everyday.<br><br>Step 5. You can either a) get me to surf for you (earning 0.7% daily) or b) get the admin to surf for you (earning 0.5% daily)<br><br>We are all adults. We know there bound to be risks involved. So invest within your limits.<br><br>So let's hope the program will last as long as possible.</div></blockquote>Just to clarify something:<br><br><blockquote>From faq in StudioTraffic:<br><strong>Maximum number of sites I can surf in a day</strong><br>Free accounts Â– 200 sites a day<br>- $20 - $100 Â– 300 sites a day<br>- $101- $300 Â– 400 sites a day<br>- $301 - $500 Â– 500 sites a day<br>- $501 - $800 Â– 600 sites a day<br>- $801 - $1000 Â– 700 sites a day<br>- $1001- $3000 Â– 800 sites a day<br>- $3001 - $4000 Â– 900 sites a day<br>- $4001 - $5000 Â– 1000 sites a day<br>- $5001 onwards Â– unlimited sites a day<br><br><strong>Minimum number of sites to surf to earn 1%</strong><br>Free member Â– 200 sites a day<br>20 Â– 490 level Â– 100 sites a day<br>500 Â– 990 level Â– 70 sites a day<br>1000 + level Â– 50 sites a day.</blockquote>Lets say for example, I upgrade my account level to 120 as suggested in step 3. I would be able to surf a max of 400 sites a day, and in order to earn my 1% i only need to surf 100 sites. So does that means that i can earn 4% a day, which is equivalent to $4.8 a day, if i surf my maximum?[/b]</div>
