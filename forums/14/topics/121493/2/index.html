They are only closing stormpay for upgrades for the rest of this month. It will resume after pay-out day. Check out their forum, john has answered to this issue:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Posted by John:<br></div><div class="quote_body">Hello,<br><br>This has nothing to do with stormpay, paypal or any payment processors. We have simply closed our upgrade lines for this month.<br><br>For members who want to upgrade in the coming week, I know you are disappointed that you cannot upgrade your account this month. Rest assured that you can do so next month.<br><br>I forsee some members getting very angry over this but do take it easy. You can always upgrade next month.<br><br>In fact, members should be happy that upgrade lines are closed early. Why?<br><br>If you study trends, you will understand that this situation will actually assure you the stability of the program. Why?<br><br>When upgrade lines are closed early in a month, it will create a backlog of upgrades. Due to this, most likely upgrade lines will have to be closed early again in the next month because a hugh surge of upgrades will occur in the first week of the month.<br><br>And as it goes on, it will create a big database of upgrades backlog. Just on this alone will show you that StudioTraffic will be around for a long time, not to mention about other factors.<br><br>I am afraid to say that closing upgrade lines early will be a normal occurence from now on. If you intend to upgrade, just do so early to avoid disappointment.<br><br>Regards,<br>John<br>studiotraffic.com</div></blockquote></div>

Furthermore, such programs do not have a long sustainable life.<br><br>If ST hasn't been around for a year or two, or it hasn't been paying my friends, I wouldn't believe this kinda crap. Just like you, I'm pretty skeptical about such programs too.<br>After lotsa research, now I'm confident to share this with you. I definitely wouldn't want to recommend any "Tom, Dick and Harry" programs and be labeled as a "scammer" in some other threads (which obviously both of us are in the same program), when these programs barely lasts a few months.<br><br><strong>Honesty</strong>.<br><br>And a promise is a promise. Within my means, I will try as much as possible to help my downlines and keep 'em happy. Let this be one enjoyable investment.<br><br>As for <a href="http://tinyurl.com/d5vlq" rel="nofollow">4Daily</a>, I'm not having high hopes nor investing a lot. High ROI, members growing daily, good reviews so far, BUT not as diversified. Now, you decide.</div>
