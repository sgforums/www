            <div class='col-md body'>i not sure about the location, anyway i copy  this week ST newsletter here<br><br>Dear members,<br><br>We have so much going on this month. We have made major changes to SurfSTV and our management structure.<br><br>I am sure most members will find that surfing is fun and smooth now. Our programmers have been working hard for the last couple of months for a solution which will allow StudioTraffic to accommodate more members and the increase in surfing. I am confident that with this new system, we will be able to accommodate millions of people surfing in one day. It is a new system where all we have to do is to continue to add more servers to cope with the increased traffic.<br><br>Currently, StudioTraffic is ranked in the top 700 most popular among billions of websites worldwide within these 3 months. If Amazon gets you to buy books from them the second time, they jump up for joy because online or offline, their most treasured business is repeat business. Here, at StudioTraffic, we get you to come to our website everyday. Do you know how powerful this asset is? We do not just get 1 or 2 people; we get tens of thousands of people staying with our site for at least 2 hours a day. How much do you think this asset alone is worth? If you are as amazed and overwhelmed as I am by this powerful force, just think how many advertisers will pay us to be part of this! I have no doubt of the success and we are going to capitalize on this. If advertisers are willing to pay tens of thousands to advertise ads on TV, I am sure they are willing to pay us too because they know people worldwide are going to see their ad everyday.<br><br>To do this, we need lots of manpower. It is true that companies do not hire entrepreneurs because entrepreneurs love risks and power. Here at StudioTraffic, we intend to have the best of both worlds. We strongly encourage members to join us full time, be part of this growing enterprise. Our office in Canada is ready and is aggressively recruiting people now. Our office in Singapore and Spain will be ready within 2 months. We aim to have 100 people with us full time within 3 months from now. If you think you are a good manager and can help us setup offices worldwide, reply to this email and let us know how you will go about it in your country. DonÂ’t ask us to tell you what we want, you tell us what your ideas are, this way we can get a better feel for your ideas, innovation and ingenuity.<br><br>If you have the entrepreneur spirit, join us now. Set up your own company with StudioTraffic as your Â‘supplierÂ’. Make use of our network. For example, use your earnings at StudioTraffic to upgrade your referralÂ’s account through StudioPay. Your referral will save 5% surcharge on credit cards, and you will make 8% referral commissions. Plus, best of all, they will stay in your downline for life. This business is huge. Do the math.<br><br>You can also apply your own merchant account and help them to process credit card sales. Once you get started, you can use StudioPay as your Â‘supplierÂ’ too. Resell debit cards, handle online payment processing and earn even more money with the same downline. If your referrals are doing well at StudioTraffic, not only will you get lots of free dinners and coffees at StudioCafe, but you can also get them to purchase other services at StudioWalker and StudioHug.<br><br>You have the power of network at your fingertips with Studio, guaranteed earnings and instant customers. Now is the best time to start, while we are still in the beginning stages of this tremendous growth potential. The pioneers always get the advantages first.<br><br>One the forum, one of the members was saying how he got a StudioTraffic lead by telling his friend about StudioRocks. They will always ask you how you get to this site. This is the best time to tell them about StudioTraffic. Most often than not, they will ask you to send them the referral link so they can save on the 5% surcharge.<br><br>Next month will be an exciting month. We will launch 5 programs somewhere mid of next month for a trial run. If we have just 20,000 paying subscriber in each site, our revenue will hit $1 million easily without including revenues from StudioTraffic, StudioPay and advertising revenue. Our potential is hugh. The best of all is that you can take part and own a piece of our revenue by just promoting it. Any referral signed up in any of Studio Programs will be considered as your downline for all programs if they use our easy 2 clicks signup. You will get commissions for all programs he/she signed up after the first one. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to just sit there and collect monthly commissions for a living.<br><br>We look forward in you joining our dynamic enterprise,<br>Cheers,<br>John Horan<br>StudioTraffic Inc.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i have 2 question,<br><br>I understand that all upgrades in StudioTraffic last for only 1 year. My question is after this 1 year, is the Upgrade money being returned back to your StudioPay account or is it eaten up by StudioTraffic?<br><br>2nd question is, if i chose the option of sponsor to surf for me, do my downlines get to benefit from my "completion of surfing from my sponsors" if they opted for me to surf for them too?<br><br>Thanks in advance for any advice and answers</div>
