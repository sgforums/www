You know how they market it? like real estate sia! buy more niches for yourself and your family!!! can appreciate in value and sell next time!!! So a lot of 'investors' were invited to buy, 'official launch' at a hotel, celebs, whole song and dance, etc. So many, many people sunk tens of thousands into it. In the end?

Nothing. So how?<br><br>THEY DECIDED TO GO INTO A PROJECT!!! CALLED MORINGTON CRESENT COUNTRY CLUB AKA THE HAUNTED COUNTRY CLUB! asked all the NTI members to fork out money for 'memberships'!

I am not sure about the niche so not comments about it.<br><br>2.  MK i know about it, but the truth is not for us to know as we all only know the project failed and many investor could not get back the money.  But i know alot got back too.<br><br>3.  Emall has already been started, just that we are not active in it.<br><br>4.  China Dream yes i know this, but anyway its not selling underwear, its some nutrition product in china.<br><br>5.  This 2 director thing i comfirm dunno about it, cause it not link up with the company.  Anyway how you know one of the director spent all on drinking and etc ?  You are the director or he tell u ?<br><br>6.  This CC i heard about it.  Call empire club right ?  Not sure about how they manage it, but seems to be a failure for now.<br><br>7.  Emcom is still not sure yet, since the project is not even close to completion.<br><br>The only thing i fear about the emcom project is the recent taiwan earthquake might have affected the construction.<br><br>So anything else to shoot?</div>

CALLED Ã�Ã©Â¹ÃˆÃ‹Ã¾!!! basically selling NICHES at a columbarium. You know how they market it? like real estate sia! buy more niches for yourself and your family!!! can appreciate in value and sell next time!!! So a lot of 'investors' were invited to buy, 'official launch' at a hotel, celebs, whole song and dance, etc. So many, many people sunk tens of thousands into it. In the end? RUG PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM. No such thing. Cannot sell for what was promised. So what happened?<br><br>THEY DECIDED TO GO INTO ANOTHER PROJECT! CALLED MAGIC KINGDOM! basically selling a CONCEPT for a country club, basically THE BIGGEST and GRANDEST CLUB IN SINGAPORE, JB and SOME SAY BATAM!!! so you know how they market it? Like a CONDO project, man! beautiful mockup, showroom, everything! So many, many people sunk untold thousands into it again. In the end?  RUG PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM. No such thing. Company folded. So what happened?<br><br>lay low for a while...<br><br>So few years ago, ANOTHER COMPANY CAME UP!!! NTI!!! SELLING Aromatherapy! ( Then went into crystals, skin care products, etc etc)<br><br>THEY DECIDED TO GO INTO A PROJECT! CALLED EMALL!!! Touted as the next-gen solution to internet and online shopping! Marketed as the "EBAY KILLER" sia! In the end? Just a fart in the wind. Until now this epic 3 years in the making still not operational yet. So how?<br><br>THEY DECIDED TO GO INTO A PROJECT! CALLED CHINA DREAM!!! SELLING THE UNDERWEAR IN CHINA!!! Again, many, many investors "invested" in the project, so now how? poof. Again, nothing.<br><br>THEY DECIDED TO GO INTO A PROJECT! 2 DIRECTORS of this company ASKED ALL THE MANAGERS THERE TO INVEST!!! 5-10K EACH!!! OPEN A COMPANY IN SHENZHEN!!!! total collected almost 200K. So after one of the directors went to china with the money and spent it drinking, whoring, eating, etc. Anything to show for it? poof. Nothing. So how?<br><br>THEY DECIDED TO GO INTO A PROJECT!!! CALLED MORINGTON CRESENT COUNTRY CLUB AKA THE HAUNTED COUNTRY CLUB! asked all the NTI members to fork out money for 'memberships'! In the end? NO MONEY TO DO COMPLETE RENOVATIONS, HAD TO CALL ALL THE 'MANAGERS' to go help clean up the place.<br><br>That means, for you kids out there, THOSE MANAGERS WHO PAID FOR THE MEMBERSHIP FOR THE HAUNTED COUNTRY CLUB WERE ASKED TO GO THERE AND WORK FOR FREE PULLING WEEDS AND CLEARING RUBBISH.<br><br>WOW!!! HOW EXCLUSIVE!<br><br>So 2 months after 'launching', the only habitants in the place now are still, only the resident ghosts. So now how?<br><br>THEY DECIDE TO GO INTO A PROJECT!!! CALLED EMCON + SUNSHINE EMPIRE + TAIWAN WIRELESS BROADBAND!!! PROMISING almost 3600% returns on investment!!! WOW, so incredible!<br><br>Whats gonna happen next?
