He started the conversation asking questions about which isp is better and how to configure wireless network. Being a nice person, I gave him a brief comparison to let him decide and offered to help him with the wireless configurations.<br><br>Soon, he drifted away from this excuse he used to strike up the conversation and said he has something that would be useful for my future and would like to introduce it to me. He claimed that it will only take a short while and no harm listening. I was ambivalent at that time and didnt really reply him directly. Then another person (B) whom I know from the same place as this friend messaged me too, saying that it had been a while since we last met and suggested meeting each other over a cup of coffee.<br><br>I wasnt close to these two people and didnt really want to meet up, but I gave in anyway as I didnt want to be mean and unsociable. The place was of course Raffles Place. I was puzzled initially why of all places they wanted to go there but I just went along anyway.<br><br>Met up with them, went to LPS and sat down. They talked about the past for a while before this other guy B started talking all the crap about foreign talents, outsourcing and how nowadays you cant get a stable job. He also mentioned how soft skills, which are not taught in schools are important in the workplace. I started to get irritated by all the crap he was talking and suspected there was a motive behind it. Then he said he and A are working in this company and are earning as they are learning these skills and invited me to come over for a look.<br><br>I didnt really want to go, but again didnt want to be rude in rejecting them so I just tagged along. No prizes for guessing where I ended up, at a place located so convinently close by. On that day, there were a lot of people and there was an event being held, some pageant or something and it was pretty crowded. They even had food catered. Then they showed me around and introduced me to the courses that they are going through.<br><br>They then made me sit down to begin their brainwashing sessions, person after person wearing those black suits came and talked about the usual stuff people who have been through it would know. The standard procedure I guess. Scribbling on A4 paper and then tearing them up at the end. They will probably ask the victim what they wanted to pursue in life or in further education and then match it with one of their guy in black suits. "Hey this guy is also studying in ______ or from ______. He can tell you more about it. Then this guy will tell you biased things about this ________ to sow seeds of doubts in your mind about getting a proper job or the rewards of going through the further studies on this subject.<br><br>Then they will show you a biased selection of newspaper articles with titles like "Degree = less earning power", "Singaporeans ill-prepared for sudden job loss", "Sorry you are over-qualified" to make you doubt that going through further education and getting qualifications is the right path for you to take in life. They will also mention about grabbing opportunities that present themselves and how this agent saved himself because he joined cause his family went broke and him working in NTI is pulling in all the money to feed his family or how this agent's parents suddenly got cancer or something and need money and lucky he joined this company. They will also create scenarios about you, like lets say tomorrow your parents got this fatal disease and all the bad stuff and you need money, then ask are you prepared for it. All of this is to make you fear the uncertainties of life and make you see how financially strapped you are in dealing with these crisis.<br><br>After which they will introduce their so called business plans. Throughout they will never mention MLM or network marketing or that you are supposed to sell products or 'education'. They will just briefly mention about how you can introduce this to your friends and you can get a comission and then paint rosy pictures of 5-digit income into your head.<br><br>I went there at around 10-11pm and they made me go without lunch and continuously brainwashing till 3,4pm. Fatigue got the better of me as I had just fulfilled a tiring day of duties at my workplace. I didnt really understand their binary crap or what I was supposed to do. I was looking for an opportunity to get out of there in a polite manner but of course, with so many people crowding around you, keep telling you about these stuff over and over again, that opportunity never presented itself.<br><br>It was dumb of me, but I just signed up based on trust. I wasnt really interested in the binary money stuff but just thought that at least the courses are worth something as I can see A and B being more outspoken in their verbal presentation. (But now I can see how powerful money is to be able to change one's personality.)<br><br>All I got for a few thousand dollars was a clear file with their rubbish papers inside and a notebook. It was only after I signed under A and paid that they put in the word "Network Marketing" into the picture, and I got to know that the people who are going to teach in these courses are those agents themselves. Then they made me do this 8 reasons why I joined NTI. I didnt do it as I was too tired. This is probably something they get you to do to shoot yourself in the leg should you decide to quit or have doubts over what you are doing. They will just take the reasons you said you joined NTI for and shoot you in the leg. I felt cheated, but I was already very tired so I just went home dazed and sad.<br><br>When I recovered slightly, I visited the websites and fought out that I was supposed to sell aroma therapy stuff and other werid crap. WTH. I messaged my friend to request for a refund and the manager called me to go down to settle it. When I went down, my manager was nowhere in sight, my upline A was busying psychoing another person and B talked to me. I tried my best to resist all the crap and demanded for a refund, but in the end they got more people to argue that the reasons I gave will not be able to get my refund. Then B just suddenly left for his "lesson" and they just left me there. With so many gangsters against just one me, it was a losing battle so I left.<br><br>The next few days, I just happened to surf around and found this place. Thats when I got to know the holy refund form that is so hard to grab! With some friends, I bypassed the gangsters and went straight for it. Not long after, B called with a threatening voice and asked why I didnt trash things out with him before going for a refund. Well, there's nothing to trash it out over, all that's coming out of him is trash and I'm sick of him.<br><br>Even if NTI were not a fraud, their customer service definitely sucks. Just for the stupid interview, I made some wasted trips only to be told the person responsible for my refund was not available even though we had an appointment.<br><br>They stated that I would receive a letter regarding the results of the interview in a week, but till today it has been more than a week or two and I received nothing. Guess they are too poor to even spend 25 cents to send a letter.<br><br>There goes my money. Being the thrifty type, its sure is heartbreaking to see the money I saved so hard being cheated away. Leading a meager life and forgoing all the entertainment just to save up for further education and now a significant portion of it is conned. I was just so dumb to let them get to me.<br><br>Looking a this forum, NTI has been around for some time, its been a pity I hadnt heard of this dumb company before and was mislead by its errant agents. I hope people reading this will make aware to their friends the existence of such companies and warn them to stay alert.<br><br>Yes NTI is a business. Its a business where you are self-employed. Your work is to sell your relationships/friendships and those who trust you. Cash them in for money. Network Marketing. Market your network of friends to NTI for a measly comission.<br><br>I'm grateful to my friend who spent time and money to accompany me down for the refund procedure. It sure is heartwarming to know that there are still people around who genuinely care for their friends and not cash them in as prospects for money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your testimonial is as sad and honest as can be. I don't know how the NTI agents feel but these are real people they are hurting, real human beings who saved up their hard earned money and all you did was to swoop in, make a quick buck and end it all. To call you people heartless is just being too nice. Some of these guys are your good friends and collegues. If the NTI agents only know what they have become after joining the company, they'd feel sad for themselves too.</div>

(But now I can see how powerful money is to be able to change one's personality.)<br><br>All I got for a few thousand dollars was a clear file with their rubbish papers inside and a notebook. It was only after I signed under A and paid that they put in the word "Network Marketing" into the picture, and I got to know that the people who are going to teach in these courses are those agents themselves. Then they made me do this 8 reasons why I joined NTI. I didnt do it as I was too tired. This is probably something they get you to do to shoot yourself in the leg should you decide to quit or have doubts over what you are doing. They will just take the reasons you said you joined NTI for and shoot you in the leg. I felt cheated, but I was already very tired so I just went home dazed and sad.<br><br>When I recovered slightly, I visited the websites and fought out that I was supposed to sell aroma therapy stuff and other werid crap. WTH. I messaged my friend to request for a refund and the manager called me to go down to settle it. When I went down, my manager was nowhere in sight, my upline A was busying psychoing another person and B talked to me. I tried my best to resist all the crap and demanded for a refund, but in the end they got more people to argue that the reasons I gave will not be able to get my refund. Then B just suddenly left for his "lesson" and they just left me there. With so many gangsters against just one me, it was a losing battle so I left.<br><br>The next few days, I just happened to surf around and found this place. Thats when I got to know the holy refund form that is so hard to grab! With some friends, I bypassed the gangsters and went straight for it. Not long after, B called with a threatening voice and asked why I didnt trash things out with him before going for a refund. Well, there's nothing to trash it out over, all that's coming out of him is trash and I'm sick of him.<br><br>Even if NTI were not a fraud, their customer service definitely sucks. Just for the stupid interview, I made some wasted trips only to be told the person responsible for my refund was not available even though we had an appointment.<br><br>They stated that I would receive a letter regarding the results of the interview in a week, but till today it has been more than a week or two and I received nothing. Guess they are too poor to even spend 25 cents to send a letter.<br><br>There goes my money. Being the thrifty type, its sure is heartbreaking to see the money I saved so hard being cheated away. Leading a meager life and forgoing all the entertainment just to save up for further education and now a significant portion of it is conned. I was just so dumb to let them get to me.<br><br>Looking a this forum, NTI has been around for some time, its been a pity I hadnt heard of this dumb company before and was mislead by its errant agents. I hope people reading this will make aware to their friends the existence of such companies and warn them to stay alert.<br><br>Yes NTI is a business. Its a business where you are self-employed. Your work is to sell your relationships/friendships and those who trust you. Cash them in for money. Network Marketing. Market your network of friends to NTI for a measly comission.<br><br>I'm grateful to my friend who spent time and money to accompany me down for the refund procedure. It sure is heartwarming to know that there are still people around who genuinely care for their friends and not cash them in as prospects for money.</div></blockquote>Ask yr friend to leave NTI, if not, they will lose more friends like you!</div>
