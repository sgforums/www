            <div class='col-md body'>If your join date did not exceed 60 days, u definately will get back your money. Remember to photo-copy your refund form that they ask you to fill in. That will help you to prove when you submit your refund. Dont go thru thosr IDIOT MANAGERS, go directly to the admin floor at 22nd floor and ask for refund. Dont ever bother to talk to any managers or directors, coz they will try to psycho u not to refund by making more empty promises. So dont fall into their trap.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi laserboy. not too worry the law regulatating MLMs in Singapore states that you are entitited a a refund within 60 days of the contract agreement. Just call the CAD (Commercial Affairs Department) and lodge a report with them. They will be able to advice you accordingly. Look at the Bel Air Topic on what i have posted before to understand the laws and regulation governing MLM companies in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do not go alone for the "interview". There should not be an interview and all you need to do is to get a copy of the form and a date when u can collect your money. Is there anyone who has succeeded and willing to help others? Drop me a mail at edkieu@gmail.com with more info on how its done, just incase those ppl from NTI figure out how we plan to get the refunds.</div>
