            <div class='col-md body'>last year, this young lady Miss Hong XY msged me on friendster said want to make friends. So okay lor.... chat abit, but strangely she kept asking about what i wanna do in the future, do I like business or what. Then said wanted to intro friend to me, so I said ok lor. Ah Hong there said meet this place this time, I kept asking why, she said go seminar. I was already WTF. I probe further, since I already have this bad gut feeling it's MLM.<br><br>She kept giving excuses like "y u ask so much ah", "you'll know when u get there", "very hard to explain", "its fun". That day finally came, last min she was bloody 30mins late. Meet liao never say sorry somemore, still smile smile intro me everyone. There's this guy in his mid 20s who was super friendly, I suppose he'll be my future upline or what.<br><br>Most of the group was like in their teens, with a few in their early 20s. And 5 guys approached me asked if I know what I was here for? WTH.... So when I shoot them back they'll just walk away or divert topic. Hong drag me to Lau Pa Sat, another infamous MLM cult gathering ground. Wah, such a big group. The mid 20s guy (lets call him Mr A) strangely said to me "all of us a young" and introduces me to their "business associates".... WTF why so damn formal? I know I've been tricked but decided to play along, and later post about my experiences online.<br><br>So finally we reach NTUC Auditorium, wah so lively, more ppl shoot me "do u know what u're here for?". When I ask them, they divert topic, WTF... Then inside, everyone was shouting and screaming like some cult whenever the seniors say something, even the smallest slightest words.</div>
