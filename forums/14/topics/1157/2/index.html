            <div class='col-md body'>Ranking system in schools sucks BIG TIME! ARGH!! *FROWNZ* They were just suggesting last year that they wanna rank primary schools! POOR kids... *SOBZ*SOBZ* They are NOT only deprived of the fun and play time that NORMAL children have but now they have to face the pressure of upcoming primary school ranking... for wat? So that they can get into a PRESTIGIOUS school! DUH!~ Singapore's education system is really screwed up man!<br><br>Yes, with competition, students will seek to excel but wat abt those left behind? Will they just be ABANDONED by our education system? True, we have the top few ranking for schools and yes, students will excel to move towards that but how about those who cannot make it? This ranking system has made many complacent personnels and needless to say, inferior students who feel that they are NOT as good too! HUMPH! *SIGHZ*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have to point out one thing, having a ranking system is not the problem, but the people who implement the system and the people who use the system as an absolute gauge to a student's ability is the problem. We should rectify the attitude of Singaporeans in the ranking system.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my persepctive is that rankings are an icon of the  kiasuness of singaporeans, especially the parents.<br>im sure all your parents would have told you at some stage that you must study hard, work hard ... blah blah blah...get the best school... and this goes to show that rankings mean the world to them. the pressure probably applied by your parents upon you is an example of the flaw of the singaporean way of ranking. the competition that is supposed to arise when people are middle aged has started by pri 6. how many of you can honestly say you have enjoyed learning? i personally took it as a chore... and once again am forced to conclude that the education system is horribly flawed..<br><br>ps the woman principal mentioned in the first few posts in lpm...its obvious.. i was under her...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well 1st of all i conclude that you're in one of the few or if not the better jcs. I'm from the lowest ranked jc and we don't really have this kind of problem. The school in a way may seem harsh and come very hard on students who can't excel in the particular subject, but they also have the student's interest at heart.<br><br>Let me ask you. Do you want to concentrate on just 3 A subjects and score or do you want to get inferior grades by taking 4 subjects? After all you only need 3 A level subjects to get into the University. I feel that if the school don't do anything about it then you'll be blaming the school after you receive your results.<br><br>Students may feel the the interest is there and therefore should not be discouraged but the thing is, you may do better in a subject you have no interest in. Be more practical that's all I can say.</div>
