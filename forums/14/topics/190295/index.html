            <div class='col-md body'>Well, today, i met a fren whom i never met for almost a year plus...A bit surprised when he msged me to meet, coz he never msg me b4 1....But i juz agreed to meet him....<br><br>First of all, i wanna say i'm someone who knows wat MLM is all about, as i have some past exp b4 in it...So b4 i met him, the kind of thinking that he is gonna sell me something or he is meeting me with some purpose is there.<br><br>Initially, everything was okay, we talk crap and everything is fine. Then, after a while, he said his fren is coming 2 pass him something. After that, his fren come and they say they have a meeting later at a hotel. We are at suntec btw...<br><br>They then sat down together with me n my fren and started sharing with me about business. At this point of time, i think things are starting to turn fishy. They then say about the usual crap of working for money or starting your own business. I juz acted i dunno anything n nodded with him when he said. But everything he said i also know!!<br><br>Then he said he got a "gui ren", which is like a savior to him, coz he changed his life. Then he said he is free to have a talk with me. Wth? Everything is like wat i exp last time in my mlm days. But since can listen to some crap, i went.<br><br>After the talk, he said i'm "qualified" to come down for a talk or seminar tomorrow...Looks more like brainwashing crap right? Worst still may need to pay fee or wat. I wanted to help my fren, but wat if he is "using" me as a victim? That's why i'm hesitating whether to help him or not.<br><br>As expected, my fren dun wanna reveal the company name when i ask him. He say come down 2morrow and i will know. Expected kind of crap. Now what? Should i go 2morrow to see what kind of "business" they do or juz don't go??<br><br>Thanks 4 reading....It could be of some help when next time "frens" ask u out for kopi... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel the best way to avoid a weird situation is to simply not go for the meeting. Say you have other committments and priorities. This way your friendship can still be salvaged. When you go there you will start hating him for using you and then it will be terrible for your relationship. As you said you have been out of touch for so long, its easy to come up with a valid excuse not to go.</div>

If we has just joined and quit within the guarantee period he will still lose a couple of thousand dollars. He can say good bye to whatever he has invested if he has been it for quite a while and stuck with worthless inventory- essential oils.
