            <div class='col-md body'>Sunday Times 25th Jan 2004<br><br>His teen daughter joins company selling 'biomagnetic' mattresses<br>She starts drinking, smoking and keeping late nights<br>Now, she wants to quit school<br>By Arlina Arshad<br><br>BUSINESSMAN Tan Pin Ho set a curfew for his 16-year-old daughter and made her sign an undertaking that she would not sneak out of school to work as a salesgirl.<br><br>Nothing has worked, laments Mr Tan (above), who has been trying to get daughter Yi Zhen to concentrate on her studies. -- ENRIQUE SORIANO<br>He even threatened to lock Yi Zhen up and paid $800 for professional counselling. But she dropped out after a few sessions, he said.<br><br>Nothing has worked and Mr Tan, 57, says he is at his wit's end.<br><br>Instead, Yi Zhen wants to drop out of school to sell expensive 'biomagnetic' mattress pads and comforters for a direct-marketer called DW Group.<br><br>She was 15 when she joined DW in August last year, on a referral by a schoolmate who is her boyfriend, and she has definitely changed for the worse, said Mr Tan.<br><br>She attends group gatherings and talks that end at midnight or later, wakes up too late to go to school, and once came home drunk, he said. And her grades have nosedived.<br><br>Yi Zhen says she can earn $100 to $200 for every item she sells. She has not sold a thing so far, but gets $300 a month in transport and meal allowances.<br><br>Mr Tan said he has tried to get the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the police and her teachers to help. He has even spoken to DW's bosses. But to no avail.<br><br>MOM said that a child may be employed if he is 12 or older in 'light work suited to his capacity'.<br><br>The Direct Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS) says that direct marketers should not recruit anyone below 18.<br><br>But because DW Group is not registered with DSAS, it is not bound by its rules.<br><br>'Whatever it is, there must be parental consent in writing,' said DSAS chairman Benjamin Tan.<br><br>Mr Tan Pin Ho never consented. He didn't even know Yi Zhen was working with DW till she started bugging him and their relatives to buy its $2,880 mattresses.<br><br>'She said she needed to sell one to get promoted to a 'supervisor',' he said.<br><br>'She used to be obedient but now she doesn't believe anything I say. The company has influenced her and she doesn't realise this.'<br><br>He and his wife got divorced in 2001, and Yi Zhen lives with her mother, a 42-year-old insurance agent who wanted to be known only as Madam Tay.<br><br>Madam Tay said: 'We split but that doesn't mean we don't love her.<br><br>'Her colleagues take her to pubs and she smokes. It's not logical that they're selling a health product and yet they do all this.'<br><br>Yi Zhen told The Sunday Times that she sees a 'future with the company'.<br><br>'I used to be quiet but now I can make my own decisions. I want to quit school after my N levels this year and do this full-time,' she said.<br><br>'I want to prove to my parents that 16-year-olds can make it in this industry.'<br><br>She said she goes to DW's office at Apex Tower in Anson Road at 3pm every day, after school, to set up appointments with clients, and she makes two-hour sales presentations outside until as late as midnight.<br><br>Sometimes, she said, she stays back to attend gatherings with the directors because 'I want to learn more from them'.<br><br>'It's not a must but the directors said I've been specially selected because of my good performance and work attitude. So I go,' she said.<br><br>A 17-year-old said he quit DW after six months because his father cut his pocket money and threatened to disown him.<br><br>He said his superiors would take small groups out to pubs in the Orchard and Tanjong Pagar area for drinking sessions, sometimes as often as three times a week.<br><br>'I'd come home late and fall asleep during lessons,' he said.<br><br>His sister, Miss Liu, 24, an administrative executive, said he spent so much time working and earned only $400 a month.<br><br>She said: 'These are just impressionable kids. They dress smartly and think 'biomagnetism' sounds professional. But they know nothing.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Boss: She's not too young to start work<br><br>AT 16, Yi Zhen is not too young to sell mattresses, said DW Group's managing director Joey Tan, 34.<br><br>She's not staff, he said, but gets $100 to $200 for referring clients.<br><br>There are 10 other under-18 'recommenders', he said.<br><br>'It's not wrong to give her some money because she helps me, like a brother to a sister, right?' he said.<br><br>So how can she be a 'supervisor' if she's not on the staff?<br><br>'It's just a term to motivate her,' said Mr Tan, who set up the company in May 2002 and claims it has an annual turnover of $2 million.<br><br>He also said it had 200 staff working in 10 subsidiaries, all selling biomagnetic mattress pads and comforters from Japan.<br><br>A quarter are younger than 20.<br><br>He said his company gives her $300 a month for transport and meals, even if she doesn't make a sale, and she can attend daily two-hour talks to pick up communication, convincing and interpersonal skills.<br><br>'She earns as she learns,' he said. 'Out of so many youngsters, I feel that she has a vision. I feel that she's mature enough to work,' he said.<br><br>But he denies influencing her to cut classes and to quit school.<br><br>'She's not interested in studies, and isn't it better that she works with me than spend her time mixing with bad company?' he said.<br><br>Paper qualifications aren't everything, he added. Mr Tan, who holds a diploma in electrical engineering, said: 'I've never used it to be where I am today.'<br><br>Of the late-night gatherings, Mr Tan said he was aware that his employees go to pubs, but said that the 10 underaged 'recommenders' only get soft drinks.<br><br>Whether or not the teenage workers want to work or study, it is their decision, he said, and added: 'Their parents and I have no right to stop them from doing so.'<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4386,231645,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4386,231645,00.html</a><br><br></div>

Under no logical cicumstances you will expect 16 yr old here to become soldiers at such a tender age .. can you imagine if every 16 yr old in Singapore were to quit school and come out to work ?

Oh me..urm ok ok  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Dude, I agree with you totally for your first point. I had been pointing out all along about companies that have all the following features - young(less than five years), local start up that targets teenagers. I havent seen all of them, but those i seen so far are disappointing, coz of two reasons a) products and marketing plan not as fantastic as more established ones, but when i ask the people as to why they jumped in or what features of the company are good, none gave answers qualitatively. Quite disappointing as i see them telling me stuff which are actually nonsensical if one sit down to review them. Urm these people btw are teenagers.<br><br>Many older people i know seriously taught me a lot in choosing MLM, and gave me experience of MLM from decades back till now. Those who enter bad ones, realised fast enough to scoot out, instead of young ones who will pia like siao. More established companies tend to have people from late 20s onwards, and when i ask them how come, they said they had joined young companies that attract youngsters before, and didnt work out.  What i feel is that only those companies that attract teenagers are not working out, we should also do more in depth research and soul searching before jumping in. In anyway, taking tour of the industry is also good....<br><br>Second point is MLM is only two to three years into the Sg market, so, unlike other countries, the market quite rough as many rushes into the country to have the share of the pie. So tendency is for many 'rubbish' companies to float around, till they are eliminated in the process...so its not worrying to have cases like the ntiparis, amh or even dw group cases flying around. They will be eliminated in the end, and people get wiser..or is it. New companies will be set up, and new suckers join in, so the vicious cycle dont really disappear.<br><br>urm, your second point abt unscrupulous people in dw group, seriously i have not read the article thoroughly and do not have contact with the company, so i do not know what dw is seriously about. For many reasons, i was worried when i see their ad on tv while in malaysia. Ad on tv will increase its sales and membership, and eliminate other companies? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Not really. I am more worried on what happening in the company that compel them to to have ad on tv. From what i know, they are direct marketing company, so the ad was puzzling.....<br><br>Basically this case is mainly on mlm that have impact on the youngsters...as eric cartman in south park used to say "I am sorry, the movie has warped my fragile little mind", many inexperienced youngster are likely to be targeted coz of they are more gullible and less sceptical than older people.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

Even if you were a graduate, you'd earn only $3,000 to $4,000'.'<br><br>She said she was asked to do a 'market listing' during a two-day training stint. She had to list of the names and telephone numbers of people she knew and specify if they were 'financially stable', 'generous' or 'supportive'.<br><br>Then she was told to make appointments with them, telling them she was doing a health survey. Follow-up action would be taken by her seniors.<br><br>She quit when she found she was spending more than she earned.<br><br>She said: 'I'd spend $200 on cab fare every month, going to meetings with customers. And I only got $180 in commissions in seven months. It was not worth it.'<br><br>Madam Claire Bang, 31, a health-care consultant, said her 15-year-old cousin had called her on the eve of her exams, pestering her to buy a mattress.<br><br>'She would call to say she was staying overnight at the office. Directors took her out to party at KTV pubs, telling her it was the way to entertain clients,' said Madam Bang.<br><br>She added: 'When I called the company to ask why staff were made to stay overnight, someone said clients sometimes called at 8am and they needed people to man the phone lines.'<br><br>Her cousin has since left the company.<br><br>When asked, DW Group said its management was willing to clarify any misunderstanding and concerned parties should call 6220-3827 to make an appointment.<br><br>It declined further comment.<br><br>In last Sunday's report, Mr Tan Pin Ho, 57, said his daughter, Yi Zhen, attended group gatherings and talks that ended at midnight or later, and woke up too late to go to school.<br><br>But the company does not just recruit youngsters.<br><br>Mr D.L. Loo, 26, an engineer, wrote to say that his 22-year-old wife quit her second-year polytechnic course last year to work full-time with the company.<br><br>She leaves home at 9am and may return at 7am the following day.<br><br>'I see her only once or twice a week, sometimes once a month as she spends all her time at work. I tell our two-year-old daughter that mummy is working,' he said.<br><br>Mrs S. Adam, 42, said her 21-year-old niece, had shelved plans to study overseas after being involved with the company.<br><br>The police said there had been no complaints so far, but they would look into the matter if a report was lodged.<br><br>Mr Benjamin Tan, chairman of the Direct Selling Association of Singapore, which DW Group does not belong to, said: 'Most of the youngsters are still in school and should be concentrating on their studies. There may be those who may not wish to study but we should not distract them. Even if they are ready and mature, they should get their parents' approval before signing up.'<br></div>
