            <div class='col-md body'>my opinion is lets open our minds and think again.<br><br>MLMarketing use the name marketing... doing business needs to market their product. but what actually bel'air markets, where the main source of income and structure is from recruiting ppl.<br><br>the product is just show item, and all they have in their mind is to recruit more people and get the hack amount of money.<br><br>this is very unethical and i feel the money they (or you if join) is unclean.<br><br>there is nothing to do with joining Bel'air and doing business. this is purely not doing business, but simply whacking people's money. when your money is sucked up by upline, and u become member, then you looked for other ppl to get money. and this cascaded to find more and more. same like vampire movie. u got sucked by vampiere, u become one and do the same thing to others.<br><br>what your friend or leader or whatever the f**k doing is not a business at all. so if you think this is doing business, think first.<br><br>analyze when going to their seminars, they will make you feel like do business for your residual income, and make you feel like stupid man if you don't join them. by the way, thats what all MLM'ers will do.<br>in the seminars, nobody talks about selling the products, but just about doing business (by joining and look for ppl to join).<br><br>lets be honest, doing MLM with Bel'air is more about getting money from other people, but not really getting profit from selling/marketing the products. there may be people earning money, but ask them from where?<br><br>those earning big amount of money name themselves as successful people. but think again. they're actually big suckers. big thick skinned people that can con more people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think I agree with K2wanviet and GSXR~RACER. If we examined it in detail, the scheme is just recruitment, to me they are really not concern about earning residual income based on product consumption, but more on the quick and easy money.<br><br>Actually, I was a little mad, each time talking about BA. I really question whether do they really know about life? Which they always associate it with $.<br>I wonder do they know the word - conscience.<br><br>Maybe I have gone a little too much.<br><br>cheers,<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi K2wanviet, you are right --  let the authorities, the public and this forum see for themselves if the biz program is a scam or is something wrong, according to your views.<br><br>I repeat again my previous message below and let any reader see for themself if it sounds desparate or dodging or distorting or rhetoric etc as what u are constantly claiming. If the simple english and facts like this causes such abusive words from you then there is no point continuing this discussion.<br>I've a better suggestion instead of your "advertisement challenge" - please leave your mobile number here (or you can call ST directly) and arrangements will be made for a Straits Times reporter to meet u and you can voice out all your point of view. Who knows the headlines may turn out the way you've always wanted: "K2wanviet uncovers big MLM scam in Spore". Might even appear in front page - better than any advertisement that u suggested - then let the public and the authorities decide the real truth shall we? Hence, no more accusation from you about rhetoric, dodging,  hypocrisy etc - Do it if its what u always wanted.<br>The doors at Bel'Air is always open to the authorities to take a look. And they already have.<br>So  you can say what you want - and I'm sure you still have a lot more to say.<br>Let the public (not just this forum) and the law in singapore decide if what u claim has any merit and if the biz is legitimate. So it will be life &amp; biz as usual for Belair as well as many MLM in Singapore<br>Have a  good day and goodbye<br>________________________________________<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Enterprise1:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear K2wanviet<br>Thank you for your sharing your doubts<br>First, I really wanted to learn what was your bad experience in Belair when you joined.<br>My apologies if  my earlier reply still gives you more questions<br>No one is dodging the issue of 1+5 or 1+15 as you said. I have already stated that I personally present a choice of entry positions according to the corporate presentation kit to new candidates. And no one is misrepresenting the $60 minimum entry Â–it is there and I just showed you how one can still make money with this route, though its abeit on the slow pace of returns. No body is forcing anyone to come in at a level too big for the personÂ’s capacity. The final choice is left to the candidateÂ’s choice.<br>If some other individual distributor present it wrongly or put undue pressure or make empty promises  and  they canÂ’t deliver those promises, then they will get into trouble one day. So why challenge me to take a newspaper ad when that is not my way of marketing?<br><br>If you have been informed by your upline of this 1+5/1+15, then challenge your upline to do it.  As you have join Belair before, may I suggest take this issue with your leader who is pushing 1+5 or 1+15  especially if he did so with no justification. Or you can also challenge him to come into the forum to state his actions.<br>So let the candidates do their due diligence and respect their intelligence to decide for themselves if its a scam or a legitimate business<br><br>I hope you understand I cannot speak for your upline and I really am not sure how the other groups are representing this 1+5/1+15 program, as far as I know this Count discount promotion ends in August. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enterprise 1<br>I was a little disappointed when I read your posting. I was expecting you to provide the full details of the"1+5" +"1+15" but you offer nothing.<br><br>You are in Bel'Air and trying hard to be their spokeman but apparently you cannot handle the situation. If what I say contain untruths or lies or for that matter views expressed by Concerned Man or GSXR~Racer, you or Bel'Air have every opportunity in this forum to offer a full rebuttal but you offer none.<br><br>Do you know why you are still alone after so many postings and discussions? The reason is simple- your "comrades" or "friends in Bel'Air" know you are fighting a losing battle. Let your Marquises, Dukes or your CEO know what have been posted so far. I welcome full rebuttals from you or anyone of them. Your failure to rebut means what I say are truths and nothing but the truths.<br><br>You asked me to leave my mobile number here and an arrangement will be made with a ST reporter to interview me. I have your real name, your mobile contact number and a photograph of you but I will keep my promise, for now, and shall not disclose them. Why not you publish the details of yourself here then? Let the readers, Bel'Airians or the ST reporter know who the real Enterprise 1 is ? You are a Bel'Airian, you lied in this forum, you apologised and said sorry for being a liar- What else can I say? Let the readers or the journalist from ST know what a "Martyr" you are. Tell the ST jounalist whom you will arrange about this forum and interview you. Perhaps, the headline might be " Enterprise 1- Martyr to Liar". Let's wait for Enterprise 1 to publish his contacts.<br><br>Finally, you mentioned that the "authorities have taken a look" at Bel'Air. It suggests you know something. Tell us more- When did it take place? Who is that "authority" ? What is the subject matter? I am sure the forum readers. Concerned Man, GSXR-Racer would be interested to know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>I read with interest the commentaries posted here. I would like to share my personal views on this matter as I have attended one of those 1+5 / 1+15 seminars.<br><br>Please refer to the MLM Act Section 2(c) (vi), I quote<br><br>"A promoter of a scheme <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>shall not</strong></span>, and shall take reasonable steps to ensure that participants in the scheme :<br><br>..<br>..<br>(D) in promoting the scheme or the commodity, use, or cause or permit to be used, fraud, coercion, harassment, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>unconsciounable</strong></span> or unlawful means"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>After the attending one of such seminars, I observed that there was alot of hype in it. (i.e. loud music, people sharing, lots of yelling, showing their pay cheques....) With some basic knowledge of human pyschology, if a persons' mind is not sufficiently strong, he/she may be swayed into making a decision which is not based on clear facts but emotions/ group dynamics.<br><br>So, my question is Belair infringing on the ACT by practicising 'unconsciounable' means to promote the scheme. Can the relevant authorities please look into it as we may not be qualified to ascertain it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Promoting 1+5/ 1+15 is basically creating a virtual network before finding the recruits. Based on my reading knowledge of some US MLM consultants, creating a virtual network is not a professional MLM practice! It is not a representation of the TRUTH of doing MLM i.e. Not all will recover their 'so-called' investment into the essential oils.<br><br>Well, some may argue that there are risks involved with any business. I agree but the business can be started with only $1,000/-, so why 'pyscho' people to invest so much money in it.<br><br>However, to balance off, maybe such schemes are more appropriate for 'rich' business man who has the money and contacts. In the seminar, I see people who invested 1+5 are ordinary working folks like you and me. Its' their life savings for some.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> I believe this is done through the demonstration of pay cheques (some as high as $30,000) of the uplines who had reaped a huge profit from their downlines who had buy 1+5/1+15. So my 2nd question, how many will actually earn this amount of money, is it only a minority few <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Just some food for thoughts for all readers. I hope my sharing will help people who has not joined to find out more and make an informed decision.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear K2WANVIET, Did I say anything about your topic of 1+5 /1+15 that is a lie?<br>I apologized for stating that I was considering 2 MLM companies. In fact I am doing that and I see nothing wrong in doing so, but I still apologized to you as I know there is no point dwelling on it.<br>Please do not provide incomplete information (based on  your last posting about what you described thatÂ’s happening in Belair )Â– otherwise readers will know who the real liar is.<br>My apologies if you are offended and donÂ’t want to reply my simple question posted to you 3 times earlier, but I meant it sincerely - I wanted to know what was your unhappiness in Belair that made you quit Â–  I only wanted to learn from your open sharing because I am learning from you too<br><br>But lets stick to the main issue here which is the 1+5/1+15 that you raised.<br>Since you have joined Belair before, so  you had an upline, and you must have heard of this promotion presented by your upline, So please invite your upline to this forum to state how he presented the promotion Â– then lets all see if there is anything unethical or improper, etc<br>You were in Belair before , so obviously you know I cannot be the spokesman for Belair or for your upline or for the information of 1+5/1+15 that was presented to you., especially when I have stated that that is not my style of presenting entry positions.<br>If you still want to call me a liar for that  or  continue calling me names like desparate, rhetoric, dodging etc, etc Â– then I have nothing more to say, because it appears you are unable to accept facts and reality in my situation.<br><br>So please, I sincerely appreciate your cooperation to be in this forum together for constructive discussion, no need for names-calling, mud-slinging , use of abusive words, etc.<br><br>Please keep this forum on a friendly tone . We are all here to be friends on the forum Â–otherwise no point continuing.<br><br>I do appreciate your concern about people may be Â“psychoÂ’dÂ” in to something they didÂ’nt want to do. That is really my concern too. If they were invited by their friends, then itÂ’s friendship being abused.  The consolation I can see is if they change their mind, they have a money back guarantee for 6 months. (90% by the company and the rest by the upline). Nevertheless the needs of the person must come first and the various entry position must be presented to match those needs (if they are users) and capacity (if their doing the distribution biz).<br><br>I agree with forum writer BRANDSING, that individual overzealous distributors using "psycho-methods" is wrong. But sadly it doesnt  happen only in one company. If this is taking place and if there is improper conduct of presentation, IÂ’m sure the authorities will be checking by now, let the public do their due diligence and decide to pursue the biz or walk away, after seeing the whole picture of the business, the markets, repeat consumption market, various product range, com.plan etc Â– and the entry positions to suit the individual capacity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enterprise 1- Did I say you lie on the "1+5" or "1+15" ? How could I have said that when you did not even take up the challenge of reviewing the full details of "1+5" or "1+15". I said you lied because you had not been up front from the beginning. In case you have forgotten,let's review what you have posted<br><br><strong>"I'm considering for last 2 months and narrowed down my search to 2 possible MLM to do and will make my decision by next week"</strong><br><br>The fact is you are already with Bel'Air which you admitted, said sorry and apologised to the forum readers. Now, you said " <strong>In fact I am doing that and I see nothing wrong in doing so "</strong> which is equivalent to saying " Yes, I lied, what is the big deal". How could you expect the people in this forum to trust you when lying is nothing wrong to you?<br><br>Now, for the part which you said I did not provide incomplete information. Tell the readers what information is incomplete? I described what I saw and you just post a sweeping statement and said the information was incomplete. Tell the forum readers then what is "complete information" then.<br><br>Now, I challenged you or Bel'Air again to state categorically that<br><br>(1) They have never shown slides of luxurious houses and expensive cars in their presentations.<br><br>(2) None of the their speakers ever mentioned the phrase" Taking holidays 4 times a year with each lasting 3 months"<br><br>(3) Using credit card as a form of funding to join Bel'Air was never shown in their presentation slides.<br><br>Do not dodge the issues again this time. The questions only require a Yes or No answer. If you are not sure, check with your Marquises, Dukes and CEO. The forum readers and me are waiting. Let's see who is telling the truth.<br><br>I will reveal more at the appropriate time. Be patient. As Concerned Man said, it is getting more interesting with more forum readers posting their views.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My dear Enterprise 1, I was expecting you to rise to the challenge and answer the questions I have raised. I put it simply for you to answer with a Yes or No but you disappointed the readers again because they are undisputable truths and you have no ways to counter them.<br><br>You sound pathetic and I thought you would bow out of the scene gracefully. I was wrong and you attempt to influence the forum readers again by attempting on the "90% or 100% money back guarantee". Since you brought out this subject, we shall discuss the guarantee in details:<br><br>(a) Please provide more details on the upline covering the 10%. How does it work? I would like to know how "generous" or "benevolent" the uplines are.<br><br>(b) At this point, let assume it is 90% until Enterprise 1 provides us with details of uplines covering the other 10%. Now, let review one of the safeguards which I saw on the MTI webpage for MLMs operating in Singapore<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Safeguards - A participant cannot be required to provide any benefit or acquire any commodity in order to become a participant in the scheme, other than the purchase of demonstration equipment which are not for resale, at no more than cost price and for which no commission can be given out.A <span style="color: red;">legitimate multi-level marketing scheme would not impose a financial risk on salespersons. For example, salespersons should be entitled to full refunds, under reasonable commercial terms, for any inventories kept or purchased by them which are not sold to end consumers, so long as the inventories are returned within a period of 60 days</span>. </span></span></strong><br><br>If you decide the "Business" is not for you and withdraw within 60 days. By law, Bel'Air must refund you 100% for the inventories. By extending it to 180 days, the investor cannot rely on the law to protect them anymore. If you analyse it carefully, extending the guarantee may not be beneficial to the investors, Bel''Air works within the scope of the law but you loss the 10 %.<br><br>For "1+5" you give a discount to Bel'Air and loss $72,000 x 10% =($7,200). It is even more significant for "1+15", $192,000 x 10%=($19,200). Also, it would be naive to assume your loss is limited to the 10% as you would have drawn out the inventories for your own consumption which they strongly encourage( so that the upline will earn more even if you decide to withdraw from the so call "Business") Now, I have few queries for Enterprise 1:-<br><br>(a) When will the money be returned to the "Investors" ? Immediate upon the investor withdrawing, 1 week,1 month, 1 year or 5 years? Was it listed on the contract when and how the money will be returned?<br><br>(b) Bel'Air products are not limited to essential oils. It's product range include cosmetics, healthcare etc. The 90% guarantee cover all the products or are there any exclusion clauses ? If there are exclusion clauses, what are they? Which products are covered and which are not.<br><br>Let's wait for the Enterprise 1 answers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear k2wanviet,<br><br>I can understand about your unpleasant experiences with Bel'Air, especially with the group prompting for "1+5" and "1+15". I was disturbed and angry too. But I think, since Enterprise1 has already openly apologise, we can continue to have open friendly information exchange. Chinese there is this saying "Yuan jia yi jie(3), bu yi jie(4)".<br><br>Enterprise1,<br>I am sure by now you are aware about what others felt about BelAir business ethics. There must be reasons for this to happen. To be frank, I was very much dissappointed with Bel'Air strategies and witness people falling into their traps, playing with their vunerable emotions. Please also understand that more people now know about their dirty-tricks. Put it bluntly, most of us now are not stupid now. Nevertheless, I think you are a good person. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers,<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Concerned Man, it is great to have you in the forum. Like I say earlier, I was impressed because of your objective views and the genuine desire to participate in a constructive discussion.<br><br>Enterprise 1 has so far unable to convince the forum readers the "great business opportunities" in Bel'Air. I will be friendly as long as he stops giving misleading informations to the readers and I will continue to be critical if he does so. Now, if he is "Good Man" , he should have conscience and stop associating himself with "undesirable elements ". So far, all postings have been negative. Why? Because there is really nothing good to talk about the "Business". He knows the "1+5" and "1+15" schemes well and should offer the readers his frank and honest opinion whether the promotion is ethical. Unfortunately, I still cannot bring myself to believe a "good man". I will, if he does decide to seek for greener pasture one day and leave the "undesirable element". Enterprise 1, wake up and just move on with your life. It is really not worth losing your friends and their trust just for money. Just ask yourself- Will your kids be proud with your " Business" when they they grow up and come to know what you are doing. I read an article on the net about a former MLM giving up because he does not want his kids to perceive him as a professional conman. Have the courage to be like him and your kids will be proud of you. Think seriously what I have said  and you will be glad one day you have participated in the forum found yourself a true friend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Concerned Man - You are indeed an objective person.  You are definitely looking things at neutral point of view.  You are the mediator between k2wanviet and enterprise1.<br><br>Enterprise1- You have started the topic at the wrong foot by stating that you are looking at 2 mlm companies when you already chose belair and in belair for 3 years.  If you have already built belair for 3 years, than why are you still looking at 2nd coy? This is clearly a dishonestly on your side.  Nonetheless, you have already apologised to k2wanviet and to the people.  Therefore I forgive you.  The rest of the issue that you mentioned are acceptable.<br><br>k2wanviet - enterprised has piss you off by starting at the wrong foot.  At your request for him to apologise, enterprise1 has done it and done it several time.  It seem like you are asking enterprise1 to apologise for the sake of showing or proving something to the readers....you aren't really sincere to enterprise1 and the readers when you request for an apologise from enterprise1.  It is right for you to brand enterprise1 a liar the first time round...but not continously.  May I ask you a question, in your life, have you never once told a lied before?  I think most of us did.  Do I like you to call me a liar? I don't like that. Do you like me to call you a liar because you have told a single lied before? I don't think so.  Unless you dared to tell the readers that you have not told a lied before.  I believe you are a honest person whom are frastrated by unthical doing in the mlm industry.  Enterprise1 did mentioned that anyone only need $60 to start the business and the rest is up to that particular person to make the decision.  Regarding the slide showing cars, house etc.....I find nothing wrong with it.  I have been attending Anthony Robin, Robert Kiyosaki, Dennis Wee etc seminar before and all of them show cars, houses and hoildays.  Same goes to banks and credit card coy that attract customer to buy their product by winning a nice car or house. Aren't most people looking forwards to 3 times hoilday and each 4 months period?<br><br>The question on hand is not the cars, house, 3X4months etc as most of us work hard to get all this material things.  The issue here is "Does an individual willing to do the right thing in mlm to earn money by building a good network accordance to the law?"  In any industry they are bound to have black sheep, example are recent case like NKF, Enron, China Aviation, etc.... The companies are not at fault but the people who are running it did all the wrong things.  Up till today, there is no blaming on the charitable organisation due to NKF, no blaming on Power business due to Enron, etc... Surely, there shouldn't be any branding or blaming on the whole of mlm industry due to black sheeps.  It is something like a father did something wrong in the past and his sons, wife and daughters are being brand bad family. It does not make sense at all.<br><br>Enterprise1 has repeatedly ask you to state your unhappiness but you did not answered at all.  On the other hand, you keep on saying that enterprise1 dodge your question.  In my opinion, you are doing the dodging too.<br><br>In my view, i felt that no matter what enterprise1 said, you will defintely come up with new thing to create another topic to blame.  I expected you to show appreciation to enterprise1 when he aplogised but instead you did a complete opposite.  I was at your side at first, but you are trying to prove something that i am now not interested at.<br><br>Regarding the 1+5 or $60 or $1000 etc....it is up to an individual to make the decision.  No problem about that when greed is not presence with that individual.<br><br>The law did provide 60 days refund and it is good for the consumers. Doing a business is an important decision for anyone of us and should not be taken lightly. So, in my opinion, 60 days are there to protect the consumers and people who are there to do business.  If a person feel that he/she is not suitable or decide not to do the business, oneself should be very clear within 60 days so refund can be made.  If couldn't make up one mind in 2 months or 60 days, than who is to blame?  I am sure there are consumers or business people who missed the 60 days deadline and are now blaming the industry. I certainly have heard my friend complained about it.<br><br>If a company stated whatever% refund (180daysetc), I am sure it will be fulfilled, if not, it will look stupid on the company and reputation will be at stake.<br><br>Anyone who wants to know the period of refund, he/she should visit the company or give the company a call for clearer advice.  I bought a computer a year ago and I return it within 4 days as it is not up to specification, it took more than 3 months for me to get my money back(though it is not my fault).  Can anyone confidently said that "I believe all companies across all industries will refund my money immediately or within 5 days?"  No one can ever say that as each company operate differently and have different refund policy.<br><br>As far as I am concern, if I invested $200,000 in a business and have an option to get back 90% of my capital, I will be happy enough and count my blessing. I am happy even if it take 1 year to get my money back.  Again, this is not the main issue, the issue is "Why am I investing $200,000 in the first place??? Did I invest because I feel it is an easy business? or I invested $200,000 knowing that it is tough but can do business?"  In the year 2000, I have lost my $100,000 without getting a cent back.  I am happy even if I can get back 10% and not to mentioned 90%.<br><br>Regarding credit card.  When I lost $100,000, i really have no money to set up another business.  I need to work but at the same time I am thinking of doing business.  My 2 credit card (Citibank &amp; DBS) help me to finance my business and thats the way i start my business again.  I promise myself to pay back to the bank once there is cash received.  So credit card to finance a business is not a problem. It is better for anyone to buy plasma tv, holiday, dining, cars, etc on credits or credit cards. Anyone who are in this category will be slave to the bank.  Using credits is not a problem if it is done correctly.  Anyone who choose to use credit card to finance mlm business should remember to work hard to pay back the loan.<br><br>Last but not least, doing any business is not easy, it will be very tough and that include mlm.  Hard work is the primary criteria for any work and business.<br><br>Take note that if you are not being promoted at your work, if you are not making any progress in your business or if you are not successful in mlm. Always ask yourself what went wrong and learnt from it.  There are too many people out there who keep blaming their colleage, managers, boss, business partners, the economic and every other thing except oneself.  Why do I know this? Because I have done it myself in the past.  When I did that for several years, it did not improve me or help me at all, instead, it made me bitter everyday.<br><br>Thank you and I am sorry for making all of you to read such a long boring writing.<br><br>Have a good life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Teampreneurs- Welcome to the forum. You joined today as a member, have your first posting and it is indeed long and boring. Nevertheless, it is a good try and we shall start on an equal footing to discuss what I have initially wanted to discuss- " Bel'Air promoting investment up to S$200,000 ".<br><br>You are an honest person, have a good grasp and understanding of the issues on hand and trying really hard to be objective. Since you agree with me that he has been dishonest, we shall end the episode and start afresh with you.<br><br>To have a constructive and open discussion, I have stated openly I was formerly from Bel'Air. Now, you have to state your position openly to the forum readers too. Need not provide any details and just tell the readers in this forum a simple question:-<br><br>Are you from Bel'Air or any MLM business?<br><br>I will response to your posting once you post your position.<br><br>Have a good day and life too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... I have to disagree BelAir encourage their distributor to use Credit Cards for investment. I don't think any financial company will advise it's client to do this, at least I've not heard of one that do this. Again, I may be wrong.<br><br>Yes, individuals have their rights to use credit card for BA investment. But the problem is. the liability is on the individuals and NOT Bel'Air. So in this sense, I do not think it is lawful and ethical for Bel'Air to promote it's scheme using credit cards. The losing end is always the individual investor. BA and it's top distributor are the ones to gain, I don't think they are or would be concerned about individual's credit loans from the bank.<br><br>I was also at one of those Seminars where they encourage to use credit cards. I think it is really unprofessional.<br><br>cheers,<br><br></div>

I take it you mean well and I appreciate your concern<br>I have posted in this forum that the bigger positions you mentioned are not for everybody. Certainly not for my group.<br>It is sad that you are attacking me just because some other distributors are pushing those big positions to people not suited for those big positions, and you are assuming I do the same.<br>I have posted earlier that if anyone distributor  is pushing a position too big for the individual capacity and making promises he cant keep in the business, then that person  will land in hot soup.

Lets call that View#1<br>But the issue at hand is not only this.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm new to this forum, I was overseas for a few years and now returned to Singapore and on seeing the forum it only shocks me.<br><br>1) I observed that over 95% of the forum topics onMLM whether its NTI, Coslab, Venture ERA, Belair, even MLM itself Â….. well  too many writers are too quick to resort to name calling, threatening, bad mouthing &amp; criticizing others and rarely anyone will apologise first irregardless.<br><br>2) Think about it - The act of criticizing, name calling, threatening will only make you feel good temporarily. It only denies you of an opportunity to selectively learn from those who are willing to share good information. Who is the loser in the end?<br><br>3) If MLM is not your cup of tea, why are you still in the forum sowing seeds of discontent. Everyone knows MLM is not for everyone.<br>But recognize there are consumers out there consuming MLM products and they enjoy it or need to consume it Â– So you decide, if you want to be part of the  distribution<br><br>If you decide not to be part of it, and if you choose to view it as "making money from friends", "unethical", "bad elements" , etc, then donÂ’t do the business.<br>But donÂ’t begrudge others who are making an honest living doing the business the correct way and with a conscience.<br><br>4) The key point here is the introducer should have a conscience that what he/she introduce to his friend is to the benefit of his friend, and not to the selfish interest of the introducer.<br><br>Of course, the flip-side of this is If the consumers are forced to consume products that has no benefit or value and has good money stuck in the business due to the misrepresentation of the introducer, then thatÂ’s another matter - thatÂ’s not right. May the law go real hard on these people<br><br>5) If you see injustice,  scams happening, cheating going on,,, why complain on the forum and sow seeds of discontent? Go and do something constructive like calling up the authorities -  Instead of complaining on &amp; on and expect the whole world to serve you.<br><br>6) If MLM is for you, go pick the products, the company, the people culture etc that you feel comfortable with. If youÂ’re not , just walk away. AND Respect peopleÂ’s intelligence to decide what they want.<br><br>7) When you joined and quit, instead of blaming anyone or something else, take a good look at yourself in the mirror first. No body will determine your fate except yourself<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> DonÂ’t believe everything you hear at those seminars. What worked for the guy may not necessarily work the same way for you. Every individual is different<br><br>9) I think the Singapore market is way too small to generate a repeat-purchase consumer market that then generates the residual income they promise you in the seminars.<br><br>10) Recognise in any company NEVER generalize everyone is the same There will be black sheep and there are good ones. Recognise not every one conducts the business in similar fashion.<br><br>Lastly Never threaten anyoneÂ…not even in this forum, not in the street, never everÂ… because it will backfire on you. Surprisingly I donÂ’t see that many harsh words used on the other forum topics.<br><br>I like to interpret the shocking behavior and language I see in this forum especially in the MLM topic as a maturing process in the MLM industry here. I take it positively but guess it will take some years to come of age</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's great to know that we have now more contributions.<br><br>I stand by this that there are and will be extraordinary leaders in the BA MLM business. With a completely different operating culture that adds value to their company, consumers, distributors and our economy. To be honest, I am not comfortable with their latest ("1+5"/"1+15") strategies, and who knows the next time maybe ("1+50"). It is best that the relevant Authority look into the matter. I think there may be social problem at a later stage, if more get burnt.<br><br>We all make mistakes in life, learn, make adjustment and get better. Provided we all see from the other side of the coin. I think both BA and us(the public) can learn something constructive and valuable from this. As for me, I've gathered some important information from you all to ponder upon. I choose to believe that I am able to comprehend about k2wanviet points pertaining to BA's business practice. And I believe his objective is understandable because he is doing in his capacity to prevent more from falling into the trap.<br><br>There are many solutions to one answer. We are living in a web of dependent activities. We have to be concious about what we do. As this will not only seal our fate, and may have a drastic impact on the life of others. 100 years from now, irregardless of how spectacular our lives are, slowly and surely we will be forgotten and become insignificant.<br><br>cheers,<br><br></div>
