            <div class='col-md body'>Enterprise 1- I received your pdf file with thanks. You mentioned in the file that you are an independent distributor of Sathelyne International Group. Is'nt this company has something to do with Bel'Air? Also, you mentioned in the forum you are narrowing your choice to 2 MLM companies but actually you are already an independent distributor of Bel'Air.Is'nt that a contradiction? I think you have not been perfectly honest and using the forum to fish your next target. The problem with the whole MLM industry is many are not upfront with what they are doing, just like Enterprise 1. Lying like what you did will only do disservice to the whole industry.<br><br>Concerned Man- I have been following some of the postings by you. I must say you have been very analytical and objective. I am impressed.<br><br>Now, back to Bel'Air promoting so call "business opportunity" that could run to hundred of thousand dollars. Enterprise 1 says that it is for " overseas expansion". This obviously refers to the "Chinese nationals and Malaysian" based on the posting by Concerned Man. I think the issue is not who they are promoting to but the hugh investment amount and the associated risks.<br><br>Investing hundred of thousands dollars for " business opportunity" of essential oils ? What is the probability of recouping your "investment"? I hope someone can enlighten me whether their are any other MLMs companies that is as aggressive as Bel'Air. Also, could someone in this forum advise what is the legal recourse available to the Malaysian or Chinese nationals should they be unfairly treated when something goes wrong.<br><br>I think it would be good if anyone who has attended Bel'Air seminars could elaborate more on the "5+1" or " 15+1" for the benefits of everyone in this forum. Of course, Enterprise 1 has been disqualified for further comments for being a liar.<br><br></div>

He is a liar.<br><br>To: Enterprise 1<br>Stop treating the people in this forum as idiots. I shall expose your hidden agenda if you persist in using the forum to fish for unsuspecting investors. If you want to be rich as what Bel'Air propagandises, do it with dignity, compassion and conscience and not at the expense of others. If you feel I have maligned your reputation, I accept any challenge you pose in this forum and will forward your e-mail to me for the readers to decide who is telling the truth. Otherwise, you should be man enough to apologise that you actually lied and disappear from this forum. A word of advice- Lying or misrepresentations to your prospects is something you should refrain from doing. You may get them to invest with the organisation you represent but ultimately they wll find out the truths and your friends, relatives or colleagues will shy away from you.Ask yourself, is it worth it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me refute what 2005WSS has just said.Firstly, I did not dispute nor pointed out to the reader that the contents of Enterprise 1 is factually incorrect. Secondly, I did not mislead the forum by saying you definitely have to invest more than S$200,000 to join Bel'Air. I said Bel'Air is "promoting" and was seeking clarification whether such a scheme exist which Enterprise 1 from Bel' Air has confirmed.<br><br>Like Concerned Man, I was merely expressing my concerns that an MLM company could come out with an "Investment Scheme" that cost more than 100K~200K. If the business opportunity is so attractive, I suggest Bel'Air advertise it in the local newspapers for the local investors to decide its "Business Opportunity. Why held only in the seminar rooms where most of the audience are Chinese nationals &amp; Malaysians?<br><br>Finally, I am not wrong to say Enterprise 1 is a liar if he is really a liar. Even our government called an opposition candidate a liar for twisting facts. The fact is he lied and he knew it. He has every opportunity in this forum to defend himself and I welcome  his further comments and not to hide behind the scene and use another name to fish for his new target. Of course, if he chooses to defend himself, I have the right to use any materials at my disposal, including exposing his real idenity to substantiate my claim he is a liar. If he apologised to the forum members that he did lie, I promised to him his true identity will never be disclosed again.Now, Enterprise 1, the choice is yours.<br><br>I shall substantiate the fact that Enterprise 1 often change his name to hide his identity. Go to topic "Bel'Ã�ir???" started by GSXR-Racer.Check the profile of "Achiever" as against "Enterprise 1" in this forum. In other word, I can derive the following equation:-<br><br>Enterprise 1= Achiever<br><br>2005WSS joined as a forum member today and coincidentally commented on this issue.Whether,<br><br>Enterprise 1= Achiever=2005WSS<br><br>is for the forum readers to decide</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand how you feel towards the company Belair.<br>My sincere apologies if it upset you in the way I presented my point -<br>I am very sorry.<br>First let me state that I felt like you when I first started in MLM , I was misled by my upline, I was very cheesed of by the entire business called MLM<br>I lost money and time initially, and it was very painful for me. Then I took stock of the situation and assessed what went wrong, It was an individual problem, maybe me in believing the guy that introduced to me. It really wasnÂ’t  the company or products.<br>So please let me show people who are interested to know, to be very careful in selecting  MLM.<br>Its ok even if they donÂ’t join MLM, I really donÂ’t want anyone considering MLM to suffer the pain  I went through in my 1st year before I turned things around to see some light of the business after 3 years.<br><br>I donÂ’t know who this 2005person is at all but I see your point now that you are making, and I agree with you about the wrong hefty investment if the person is not ready- it is not correct. That is why I always recommend to start small and go at your pace. Never I in my 3 years career will I ask anyone to wear a shoe to big for his feet. IMO, only overseas start-up stockist has the capacity to stock up but not individuals and not local networkers.<br>Any responsible person should not do this and the day will come when the authorities will catch those irresponsible people that give wrong advise that ruin peoples lives. In this respect my conscience is clear. And in this respect I agree with your concern.<br>So why not, please tell us, what was your unpleasant experience you went through that didnÂ’t work for you in Belair<br>was it your upline, upline group , the products etc etc, I really , sincerely like to know as well, because I had the same problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enterprise 1- Welcome Back.<br><br>First, you did not dispute the fact that Enterprise 1= Achiever. You admit that you are using different identities to fish for unsuspecting investors.<br><br>Second, intelligent readers in this forum will know whether Enterprise 1 = Achiever=2005WSS. You need not admit or deny. Obviously, everyone knows the answer.<br><br>Third, I want to point out again you misrepresented to the readers in your earlier posting. You said your sister paid $60 and start to do business already. It's either you misrepresented or intentionally lie to get the unsuspecting investor attention. The fact is $60 is only for membership where you will be given a sales kit. To start the business, you need to be a distributor where you have to buy $1,000 worth of goods from your upline. Your upline will say you need to try the products first. If you follow to their recommendations, the $1,000 worth of goods will be consumed within 2 weeks.<br><br>Fourth,you agreed with everthing I said and did not dispute any facts presented. It is an admission you lied by apologising and saying sorry to the forum members.The forum members know you are from Bel'Air, you lied and are now saying sorry. Do not worry:- Since you apologised and said sorry, I will keep to my promise that your true identity will not be disclosed. However, I will not hestitate to disclose all should you try to fish your target in this forum or other discussions forums if I happen to find out you are back to your old trick.<br><br>Fifth, you told your story in this forum about your initial years in Bel'Air. To be frank, I am not impressed at all as it sounds too familiar. Like what Concerned Man said in his earlier posting"They are really good at emotional tactics". Be upfront if you really want people to trust you. Do not play tricks with me as I know the dirty tricks, emotional tactics and the "strategies" use to hook your "fishes" with your baits.<br><br>Lastly, I repeat my challenge to you or your company, Bel'Air. Be transparent.You could promote your "1+5" or "1+15" to all the readers here, advertise in the local newspapers, or make it available in your website for public scrunity on the attractiveness of the "Business Opportunity". Why restrict the "Lobang" to mainly the Chinese nationals or Malaysian?<br><br>As far as I know, the amount to join as a Count has been slashed frpm S$16K to S$12K recently to attract more "Followers". Based on this new amount, I deduce the "Investment" will be:-<br><br>"1+5" = S$12K x 6 = S$72,000<br>"1+15" =S$12K x 16 = S$192,000<br><br>I do not know the details. Enterprise 1- Care to enlighten the forum readers. If this issue has become too hot for you to handle, I suggest you consult your uplines, be it Marquis, Duke or your CEO. I am ready to ask more pointed questions based on the facts presented. Be upfront and do not play games again. Let's pray for the preys.<br></div>

They can collect orders, then buy from introducer and they make 5% profit, and after accumulating $1000 worth of orders collected, they are promoted to Franchisee, with 20% profit thereafter.<br>What you mentioned is an individual distributor problem in training - some are taught to say the 1st $1k of goods (before discount) is for own consumption, but in reality for the users category (those who dont do the business but consume)  they also accumulate their PV points to the next level of discount. So for those who join as members, they collect orders and make profit from this group of consumers till they cross the net level of profit margin.<br><br>This is the sad thing here - not every distributor is pushing the same promotional discount program (those big levels you mentioned) although they follow the same basic educational training<br>For anyone who have met me can vouch for this  - I will never in my life recomend any position too big for the individual. I have even recommended people on the $60 plan to test drive the business to get a feel of the training program, to feel the business of MLM first. But IMO, 5% may be small for some but ok for others. But I always recommend "a shoe-size to fit the wearer's feet"<br><br>If the other distributors in Belair are doing otherwise then I feel sad that they are spoiling the Belair name if any new signed-up distributor gets into financial difficulty one day. This may happen if they cannot get their money-back guarantee &amp; IMO, the individual will likely to "go after" their introducer for all the promises they made.  FYI, it's not only the Malaysian or China nationals you mentioned, I have heard even locals too and I have seen some weeks back, some other distributors even advertising in the StraitsTimes classified  for this business.<br><br>But to be fair, while there are many who dropped out and disapointed for various reasons, do recognise that there are also some who became very successful in Belair and the common factor is being able to expand overseas - but their success is not overnight and not without hard work, its likely to be over a period of at least 2 to 3 years.<br><br>Lets share our pain experienced in your initial period in MLM or in Belair.  Please share what was your irritation, frustration or dissapointment that I can learn from. thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am hearing so many complaints about MLM  Since you said you had been misled by your upline, I mean from a layman point of view, why not in future, can a contract or agreement be legalised that if upline do not carry out certain function promised, downline have the right to take action against the upline or have the right to change upline.Is it possible?<br>______________________________________________<br>to answer your question, when we first join any MLM, we follow their standard distributor agreement which normally state no switching of lines. Maybe can check with people in the business if its possible to have a separate side agreement with upline that if upline do not carry out certain promises he /she made, then it allows the aggrieved person to switch line or switch leader. Maybe possible, and sounds like an interesting suggestion though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enterprise 1- It seems to me you tried too hard to speak on high moral grounds. Do not dodge on the issues we were discussing, Bel'Air came out with the scheme of "1+5" and "1+15" and not individuals or groups. Do not blame the individuals or groups as no one will promote the " Business Opportunies" if they do not come out with such an "innovative scheme" in the first place. Bel'Air promotes itself as a respectable MLM company by associating itself with "NKF" and "NDP", now it is an opportunity for you or them to do some social services- published the full details of of "1+5" or "1+15" "Investment Opportunities"<br><br>Now, you seem "concerned" that it is not only the Chinese nationals or Malaysian that they are promoting but also Singaporeans. I reckon you must be at least a Marquis or otherise you would not be able to sustain for the last 3 years. You should know the details well - Published it for the benefits of all readers in this forum to judge the "attractiveness". Why hold the "Investment Opportunities" only in the seminar rooms- I am giving you this opportunity to tell more to attract more investors. Tell us more so that the forum readers can judge your sincerity. Do not forget you lied earlier and this is an opportunity for you to salvage your ruin reputation.<br><br>As for your statement that there are successful cases, let me tell you this:- There is nothing to be proud of if you are earning a five figures monthly at the expense of others. I have full respect for those who are earning a meagre income by having a decent job or business.<br><br>Lastly, do not misrepresent the forum readers again by stressing on the $60. Anyone who has attended the ''Business Opportunities" can vouch that Bel'Air is actively promoting investors to join as a "Count" minimum. Same for you, "Entrepreneur". For you, do not speak on high moral grounds, you would not be able to sustain for the last 3 years if many of your investors started with $60.<br><br>You are from Bel'Air. Take the challenge, publish the "1+5" and "1+15" in full details.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear K2wanviet<br>Thank you for your sharing your doubts<br>First, I really wanted to learn what was your bad experience in Belair when you joined.<br>My apologies if  my earlier reply still gives you more questions<br>No one is dodging the issue of 1+5 or 1+15 as you said. I have already stated that I personally present a choice of entry positions according to the corporate presentation kit to new candidates. And no one is misrepresenting the $60 minimum entry Â–it is there and I just showed you how one can still make money with this route, though its abeit on the slow pace of returns. No body is forcing anyone to come in at a level too big for the personÂ’s capacity. The final choice is left to the candidateÂ’s choice.<br>If some other individual distributor present it wrongly or put undue pressure or make empty promises  and  they canÂ’t deliver those promises, then they will get into trouble one day. So why challenge me to take a newspaper ad when that is not my way of marketing?<br><br>If you have been informed by your upline of this 1+5/1+15, then challenge your upline to do it.  As you have join Belair before, may I suggest take this issue with your leader who is pushing 1+5 or 1+15  especially if he did so with no justification. Or you can also challenge him to come into the forum to state his actions.<br>So let the candidates do their due diligence and respect their intelligence to decide for themselves if its a scam or a legitimate business<br><br>I hope you understand I cannot speak for your upline and I really am not sure how the other groups are representing this 1+5/1+15 program, as far as I know this Count discount promotion ends in August.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Concerned man<br>NKF saga? IMO, Belair has been a donor for many years. Donating dialysis machines etc and cash donations. So its NKF receiving it -not the other way around. Besides Belair, their are also many corporate sponsors that pumped in donations to NKF. So how and what NKF did with the donations is out of all the corporate donors and public donors control until now. Just my 2 cents worth of opinion. ....</div>

Some users got started by using samples given. If there is no beneficial benefits experienced while using the products then the person will look elsewhere for other solution. The point is he has a choice. If there is a benefit experienced while using the product, then he chooses to continue using and/or expand the option to be a distributor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enterprise 1- I can sense the desperation in you. Firstly, you lied and were forced to apologise to the forum readers. You tried to salvage the situation by trying to show your "benevolence" and "concerns" but unfortunately it did not work. You were unable to dispute the points I raised when challenged because I am talking facts while you continue to dodge issues, misrepresent and trying unsuccessfully to persuade the forum readers with your rhetorics. The more your tried, the worst the situation becomes:- Your flaw character is exposed-Readers can feel your insecurity, dishonesty and hypocrisy.<br><br>Now, refer to my earlier posting:- "Lastly, I repeat my challenge to you or your company, Bel'Air. Be transparent.You could promote your "1+5" or "1+15" to all the readers here, advertise in the local newspapers, or make it available in your website for public scrunity on the attractiveness of the "Business Opportunity". Why restrict the "Lobang" to mainly the Chinese nationals or Malaysian? "<br><br>I suggested to you or your company 3 options and advertising on the local newspapers is just one of the options. You are back to your old habits of twisting facts. Now, tell us what is your way of marketing then? Masking your real intentions and making use of this forum to fish for preys?<br><br>I asked you earlier is the promotion of "1+5" and "1+15"  too hot for you to handle and you said no. Now, you try to find an escape route by asking me to check with my uplines, which I do not have. It does not matter whether the promotion ends in August because probably more " Attractive Promotions " costing more will follow.<br><br>Also a "wonderful" slogan you or Bel'Air used:-<br>"Count Discount Promotion"- Investment amount of S$72,000 to S$192,000  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I wonder how much it costs when there is no discount.<br><br>Lastly, I repeat my challenge again. Published the full details of the "1+5" or "1+15" schemes in whatever medium you/Bel'Air deem appropriate as long as it can be subjected to public scrutinity. Since we have been discussing about this issue in the forum, it is one of the  better options as the forum readers can decide based on the merits of the schemes. Do it now and do not dodge the subject again. I am sure the readers following this forum will be keen to know more details.Of course, once you/Bel'Air published it , there will  be more questions from me and the public. My contributions will not end here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was kinda disappointed when I first got to know about the "1+5" where the investment is somewhere b/w 50K-70K. By and large, MLM business should be affordable for all. I don't think Bel'Air is in MLM Association list in sg.<br><br>Surprised that they have gone further to push for $200K with the "1+15" strategy. I thought the authority would be doing something about it. But I was wrong.<br><br>Maybe it is really time to re-examine about MLM ethical code of practice. Personally, I've been to other NON-MLM seminars and they were professional conducted with a lot more comfort. Yes, most of them were professional tactful, but definitely not pushy and insistant.<br><br>A sum of just $16K for a count stock with a 70% payout. 70% may look attractive, but if we think clearly - inorder to sustain this payout, the value of BA pdts could have been overpriced. This could be the reason why they need to push for huge investment to sustain for their fat pay-cheques. My personal gut feel is that, about less than 10% are making the these money. Even if they are reaping in profits for now, it will not be for long.<br><br>Please do not fall into the trap where your friends, banks, loan-sharks coming after you for money. Do not let greed consume you. Yes, you can make over $10K per month (for some $30k and more), but at what price? One thing you can do for yourself is to research on the COMPLETE statistic of such people making these investment and their returns. Often those presented on stage were the more successful ones, but make also a detail study of those who did make it. You may be surprised by your findings.<br><br>I must agree also that there are extraordinary leaders in BA, which I've personally came across and shake hands with, and they have a total different set of values and cultures with outstanding professionalism. And yes, if you are sure that they are your leaders, by all means pls. But, I think the public is looking at a whole, not at specific grps. If there were some black sheeps, then I suggest the management to do something about it. Just being truthful.<br><br>I just hope no one get hurt playing their games.<br><br>cheers,<br>Concerned Man<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, it is simple Maths. For example, a bottle of essential oil or cosmetic may cost $10 to produce. They use big terms like "biotechnology" for their essential oils and "nanotechnology" for the cosmetics to justify the high costs of the products. They recruit so call distributors and sell the products at say $100 to the consumers. Based on the 70% payout, $30 goes to the manufacturer and $70 will be shared by the multi-level pyramid structure. Ask them, what is the price of a small bottle of essential oil or cosmetic and you will be surprised how exorbitant it can be. Ask yourself, will you pay for the same price if  the products are being sold in a normal retail outlet or shopping centre?<br><br>Proponents of MLMs said that you save costs because goods are brought to you directly from the manufacturers, eliminating the middlemen, advertising expenses, fixed costs and blah blah blah. Then why are MLMs products so expensive then? The truth is  there are actually more middlemen now-the different levels in a pyramid structured MLMs.<br><br>Would an MLM company ever tell you the true statistics:- How many were recruited, how many leave, how many make losses and how many make money etc. The answer is a definite no because it threatens their own existence by revealing all.<br><br>Unfortunately, Concerned Man, many more are going to get hurt playing their games. Let's pray for the preys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While waiting for Enterprise 1 to response and if time permits, I will tell more about Bel'Air for the benefits of all forum readers. If what I say is factually incorrect, I welcome responses from Enterprise 1 or Bel'Air. I will name and serialise it as " Bel-Air- The Inside Story "<br><br>(1) In one of the presentation by speaker of Bel'Air, they will show slides of luxurious bungalows by the sea, expensive cars like Ferraris, Lamborghini,Mercedes,BMW and the like and exotic oversea destinations. I was amused when speaker mentioned the phase " Having expensive holidays four times a year with each lasting 3 months." More to it, the presentation will be accompanied with " soothing music " to "ease" your mind. It smacks of materialism and discourage participants working for others and come out to be a "businessman" or "entrepreneur". It is sending the message " Come and join Bel'Air and your "Dreams" will come through.<br><br>In the same presentation, they will show with slides how you could raise money  to join Bel'Air if you have none. I cannot remember all the methods but there is one I find it particularly distasteful and abhorrence. They actually encourage the use of credit cards at 24% interest to fund and join them as Count. What I find it unbelievable is the speaker shows with calculation why the 24% interest is nothing as compared with the returns you can get by joining them. What I found disturbing was there were many impressionable youths on the day of the presentation, some of them students.It is not only in this seminar that they present credit card as a means of funding for "Count".Once in a while, Bel'Air will invite "Great Motivational Speakers" from Taiwan to give talk. Bel'Airians are encouraged to bring their friends, colleagues and potential prospects to attend the talks. Of course, the "Motivational Lectures" are not for free as you have to pay for it. I happened to see the training materials and the use of credit cards to fund your dream was repeated.<br><br>To me, it is totally irresponsible to encourage this means of funding as there is every likelihood that they would be unable to pay and declare bankrupt. Would any respectable and responsible company encourage this form of funding? I do not think so.<br><br>The CAD has been invited to investigate into the affairs of "NKF". The "NDP" is a national celebration for all Singaporeans are proud of it. Just hope the "NDP" maintains the dignity it deserves as it is our National Day.<br></div>
