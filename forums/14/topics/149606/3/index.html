            <div class='col-md body'>There had been quite a few postings in the last few days and I shall be brief in my replies<br><br>Teampreneurs posted a long message and I mentioned I would give a full response if she would answer me one simple question. She had chosen not to reply and instead indicated that she will not participate in the forum again. It is obvious to the forum readers whom she represents and since she is not going to offer her views, I do not see the need to response further.<br><br>Halftime90- I appreciate your views about the "investment" of S$200,000 to the forum readers though you are a network marketer. Also, you mentioned I have been ungentleman in certain ways. I have been receiving quite  a number of mails, both in my yahoo and sgforums mailbox, since I posted in this forum. I shall relate to you once incident. This guy wrote to my yahoo mailbox and was upfront which company he represents from the beginning. I told him I respected him for being honest and do not doubt his sincerity. We exchanged views and were friendly. I happened to see another private mail in sgforums from the same guy requesting me to send to him what Enterprise 1 had sent to me. Now, he knew the promise I made to Enterprise 1 and yet he requested me to send the details to him.Of course I rejected him outright and explained why I should not do it. What is his motive? I deduce he is out to prove something- that I am a liar and someone who cannot be trusted to keep promises. Now, I am sure this guy will continue to follow the threads. He should know what I am talking about. If he a gentleman? I trusted him earlier but know I seriously have my doubts.<br><br>2005wss-I'm new to this forum, I was overseas for a few years.....................  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> What you have written sound more like an experienced marketer to me. Benefit of doubt to you. Nevertheless, you offer a balance view and there is nothing much to comment. I am not sure whether the MLM Act has been revised since the government allowed MLM companies to operate in Singapore (Year 2000?). Like the property or financial industries, laws are constantly changing to keep abreast of times and changing needs of the industry. There are definitely too many black sheeps in the industry and tightening the laws will benefit those who honestly wants to earn a living. My personal opinion is the MLM companies has little capacity to develop further because of the small market and the hype will die down sooner or later. Many consumers will be burnt when this happens. Loss will not be significant if the MLM company is product focus. Unfortunately, many companies disguise themselves as a product focus company but if you study the whole system and observe carefully, their operation is actually " investment" and "recruitment" based. This is actually against the law as far as I know but unfortunately smart MLM companies know how to operate within the loopholes of the law. Just hope the authority study the operations of MLM companies operating in Singapore more thoroughly. They opened up the industry and has an obligation to protect the public from some unscrupulous companies who promote hugh investments for the benefits of themselves.<br><br>Have a good day, all<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good afternoon<br><br>This is defintely an interesting yet amusing site to be in.<br><br>I read the whole thread and discovered something pretty annoying.<br><br>As a human being, the most basic criteria is learn how to respect others from all backgrond.  Giving other respect is giving a respect to yourself.  K2, when I read the thread, it seem like you choose who you like. You like those who SUPPORTED you and BADMOUTH those who think otherwise.  Whatever Enterprise1's comment so far are fair to me and it make sense.  Whatver 2005's comment so far make sense to me. Whatever teampreneur comment so far make sense to me, whatever halftime's comment make sense to you.  I do respect their view.<br><br>K2, there is something terriblly unbalance about you.  When people comment's are suitable for you, you will fight them.  When people's comments are fair and just, you brand them as "trying to be a good person".  What are you trying "HARD" to prove here.  Trying to tell people that you are the best person here, trying "HARD" to announce to the people that you are the Robin Hood of mlm's victims.<br><br>You are from Belair before and you does not like the way they carry out their activities.  I have worked in so many companies and I did not like the way some companies work, but that does not mean that they are not good companies.  In fact they are reputable companies.  I have a big doubt with you trying your best to convince people.  How can a person like you whom aren't objective at all  and don't know how to respect others qualify to teach people.<br><br>In addition, you are trying to be smart. But you are only a SMART ALEC.   Teampreneur prefer not to release his/her company name is his/her decision.  He/she gave her reason for not releasing it and I think you should respect that. Instead, you GUESS and CONCLUDE based on your "SMART" thinking that he/she is defintely from a company. What are you trying to prove here.  I will not want to release it too. Why should I get myself involve with you. It make no different for anyone to review or not to review, they will still get rubbish from you.<br><br>Halftime have gave an objective view.  You keep on stating you gave someone respect at first and now you are not.  K2, if you really respect someone, you respect him/her as a person. You don't judge base on their opinion whether they warrant your respect or not.  I have my own opinion, you have your own opinion, others have their own opinion, thats the reason why we have something to talk about.  Halftime has the right to follow the thread or any other thread.  Does that mean if he read the thread, than you WIN? Aiyoh, you are so childish.  You can be a detective you know!!!! You can perceive so many thing by yourselves. Very Bo Liao of you....<br><br>I do accept your contribution base on your experience but the way you disrespect all those who have different opinion have warrant me not to respsect you as a person.<br><br>There is a point where you said "Enterprise1, it seem like you are fighting a lonely war, no one is siding you".  Hey, when no one write in, it does not mean people approve of what you are writing.  Why are you getting others to get involve with you to disapprove enterprise1?  I really pity you very much that you are proving that you are a good person who try hard to help people. You CAN'T even help yourself!!!!!!<br><br>2005 has gave opinions and whether he/she states whether he/she is in mlm or not is another issue.  Why are you trying to be a smart alec to "think" that he/she is from one.<br><br>You seem to like to perceive  thing that are probably does not exist at all.  Yet you use those "perceive" thinking to advise others.<br><br>I am not supporting anyone out here. At first, I don't intend to give any view, but, I cannot tolerate after knowing how unreasonable and disrecption K2 is.<br><br>If you failed in your networking activities in Belair, then it is your personal failure and should bear the consequences.  Why trying to warn other when you cannot balance yourself emotionally.<br><br>Concern Man, teampreneur, 2005, enterprise and halftime gave their objectives view and its good for discussion.  As for you, I gave up.<br><br>FYI, I am not from any mlm company as I got no time to do the business. I am neutral to mlm as I see good and bad of mlm.  I have state my ground,  so K2 need not be a smart alec to mislead other readers saying that "Anthony must be........".<br><br>My colleagues have read what you have written and the comment were "K2 is a born loser and a sour grapes. Trying to be a good samaritan to help the world".  None of them want to give thier comment on you. Why?? Because you are a WASTE of time.<br><br>K2, please set up another account and pretend to be another person to support yourself.  Just like when you stated Enterprise = Achiever. Go get another account so you can waste your life here.  Maybe one day you can win your argument in this forum.<br><br>Anything to say about me? Tough for you not to say anything right? Say lah as this is your trueself.<br><br>I got no time for you so will not read your rubbish.<br><br>Cheers to all. Jeer to K2.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems to me your brain is programmed to read selectively what you want to see. Whatever Enterprise 1, 2005WSS, Teampreneurs, Halftime90 mentioned make sense to you. My postings were labelled rubbish.Similarly,postings by GSXR~Racer, Concerned Man &amp; BrandSing, who personally attended Bel'Air seminars, and posted their views should make no sense to you too.<br><br>The readers will take your posting more seriously if you rebut in details what were rubbish I/they had written. You did'nt and go all out in a futile attempt to discredit me. You mentioned you were not from any MLM company and were neutral to MLM. Your views were completely lopsided. What a neutral stand you have taken!!! You were upset because views that are not to your liking hit your acupoints hard. You are worried that readers know the truth and will hit your pockets- your fat pay cheques.<br><br>Lastly, you weren't serious to engage in constructive discussion and I see no reason why I should response to your posting again. It works both ways:- I have no time for you either. Change your profile and try harder next time.</div>

Everything strictly cash there. That's my way of building people up the right way. We just have to conduct our business the right way according to our conscience. What others do that is wrong, unethical, or improper or without conscience, I have no control over them. Only the authorities will go after those who misrepresent.<br><br>The next time if you suspect someone in any seminar  in Belair or other companies making unethical or dangerous promises, take a recorder, record it and bring it up with the authorities.<br>Unfortunately I dont attend all Belair seminars because there are 5 locations throughout Singapore with different groups doing their own style and flavour eventhough the central message and theme is supposed to be uniform. I also do attend other company's MLM seminars and also find somethings said quite dangerous.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys- you know what? I really find this K2Wanviet character quite amusing.<br>The more he talks on the forum, readers can see through his true intelligence level.<br>Anthony Lee has raised some very good points to him, so have I,  so has Enterprise, so has Teampreneur, so has halftime,  so has Sailormonsoon, yet he refuses to acknowledge the good points  from any of them.<br>Practically every one has answered his questions, even my 13 year old child can see that he side-tracks and rudely raises uproar over non-relevant issues<br><br>LetÂ’s just leave this guy alone for him to Â“bitch and moanÂ” . He still has a lot to learn about manners<br>Belair is already a high profile company and the authorities wonÂ’t be so blind as to have improper business escape their radar.<br>I agree with the earlier writer SailorMonsoon, that if K2wanviet is so convinced that Belair is improper, then K2 should go do something about it- K2, go move your butt and go complain to the authorities and make your case, why bitch and moan and challenge other people on this forum?<br><br>To K2wanviet. I have stated in earlier posting, I said Â“in life, never threaten or challenge anyone or it will backfire on youÂ”  (unless of course if you are practicing to be in opposition politics or WWF wrestling)<br><br>I can understand how sailormonsoon and AnthonyLee feelsÂ….<br>To reply Lawrence82, the more  I read k2wanviets arrogant and stupid replies, he makes me want to vomit and at the same time laugh at his stupidity.<br>In some ways I pity himÂ… for having such pathetic level of intellect, yet  having an over-inflated ego. Just lookÂ… despite being outnumbered he wonÂ’t stop his antics and keep getting  people irritated with his arrogant repliesÂ– may I suggest that in order to keep our emotions in check (as suggested by Lawrence82) why not everyone leave this thread  for good (like so many other writers did ) as long as this irritating K2wanviet is around. Cheers to all.<br><br>Pls note:    I think I better leave now before someone thinks that 2005wss=Concernedman=enterprise1=teampreneur=halftime=sailormonsoon=anthonyLee.... hahaha what a joke.</div>

They can use any words they want to describe me but responding to such comments are redundant.<br><br>As Laurence82 correctly pointed out, forumers are on track trying to argue on facts and I shall stay on this track. It's simple- focus on rebutting me based on facts to win your arguments. So far, they have failed to do so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, first of all I am a network marketer (part time), to make things clear.  And I am doing mlm (of course) for the money.  I am doing rather well now, but there's one thing about mlm which I find disturbing.  I skimmed through this thread and didn't examine much of it, but I know of one thing.  People and friends, please do not throw in thousands of dollars into mlm even if they promise you high rewards and benefits. Because it is not a bank or investment company.  And chances are you will lose all the money.  I feel that I wanted to say this because I have seen friends and their relatives who have lost their entire household savings to mlm companies.  I feel sad because greed has got the better of them and they throw in all the money (thousands) because the company tells them they can get it back.  MLM is not a bank, investment or insurance company, I would have to stress again.  Please do not be duped.<br>I know I risk being criticised by some of the network marketers here, but I beseech you all to think again, whether is it ethical to convince the people to throw in the thousands of dollars so that you can earn some commission from them, but risk their savings at the same time.  Thank you, I have said my piece.</div>

Most interestingly, they are traditional business owner that have thousands of dollars to spare.  They even hire employee to do the MLM business, they so call invested.  My conclusion to this action is that people even businessman knows very little of MLM.  More time is needed to fine tune the mindset of people with regards to MLM business.<br><br>Congratulation in your success.  Keep it up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am just wondering these guys AnthonyLee, sailormonsoon, Enterprise1, 2005wss, etc from Bel'air too...<br><br>ok ok!!!  without talking about you, me, whoever in this discussion personally, lets talk more about the Bel'air and their business... AnthonyLee, sailormonsoon, Enterprise1, 2005wss, can you guys comment anything with Bel'air's so call business model that i posted in the previous page? sorry i put up my own page again...<br><br>in addition, robber, drug trafficker, etc. also can name name themselves doing their own business. but is it ethical, is it not involved persuading, cheating, brain wash in their business or not..<br><br>MLM might pay you well, so do as bank robbing and drug trafficking.. so do i want 4 figure doing that? of coz NO. do i suggest others to do? No!!!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by GSXR~RACER:</div><div class="quote_body">my opinion is lets open our minds and think again.<br><br>MLMarketing use the name marketing... doing business needs to market their product. but what actually bel'air markets, where the main source of income and structure is from recruiting ppl.<br><br>the product is just show item, and all they have in their mind is to recruit more people and get the hack amount of money.<br><br>this is very unethical and i feel the money they (or you if join) is unclean.<br><br>there is nothing to do with joining Bel'air and doing business. this is purely not doing business, but simply whacking people's money. when your money is sucked up by upline, and u become member, then you looked for other ppl to get money. and this cascaded to find more and more. same like vampire movie. u got sucked by vampiere, u become one and do the same thing to others.<br><br>what your friend or leader or whatever the f**k doing is not a business at all. so if you think this is doing business, think first.<br><br>analyze when going to their seminars, they will make you feel like do business for your residual income, and make you feel like stupid man if you don't join them. by the way, thats what all MLM'ers will do.<br>in the seminars, nobody talks about selling the products, but just about doing business (by joining and look for ppl to join).<br><br>lets be honest, doing MLM with Bel'air is more about getting money from other people, but not really getting profit from selling/marketing the products. there may be people earning money, but ask them from where?<br><br>those earning big amount of money name themselves as successful people. but think again. they're actually big suckers. big thick skinned people that can con more people. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only thing that you can do is to raise the issue up to the government.  Lots of cheating and dissatisfaction had been raised here....if it is true, than probably anyone who is here can bring forth the evidence to the relevant authority.  If not, the talk here can be only equal to bitching. Can anyone who know belair really well and has evidences raise it to the authority? If not, than probably can just stop all this unncessary bitching.</div>
