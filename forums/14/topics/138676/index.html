            <div class='col-md body'>It has come to my attention that these 3 companies are majoring in magnetic bed as their main sales product in order to gain the most PW for promotion.

DW's product is a copy of Asayo and enyouth's is of older generation magnetic bed.<br></blockquote>From what I know , Asayo was the very first company among the three to introduce the magnetic bed theory . The founder of DW , Joey Tan , 'branched' out from Asayo and founded DW . As for the claim above , it is quite true as from my short stint at DW , when my superior handed materials to me for my sales kit , i usuually saw the 'Asayo' logo on the bottom right hand side of the papers .<br><br>for Enyouth , I'm not so sure .<br><br><blockquote><br>I like to hear any view's arguements about these facts? So who is the black sheep among these 3 companies selling magnetic bed products? Which company will u choose if u are to buy a magnetic bed?<br></blockquote>For me , IMHO , this 'magneto-therapy' business might very well be beneficial to one's heath , but i won't consider buying any of the products simply because its priced way too high (even for 100+) , and I do not trust many (if not all) of the companies mentioned above .</div>
