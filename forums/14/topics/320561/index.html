              <p>For those who remembered, EMCOM Singapore declared once they bought over a company named China Photar, with Sunshine Empire as 1 of the shareholder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They renamed it EMCOM International.</p>

              <p>Now it seemed that Those who founded SE is moving away from this SE name. ie., by forming EM MAX.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both SE &amp; its President Hoo Choon Cheat in April had completely let of their share in EMCOM International</p>

Now that SE is only an empty shell, the most that they can get refund from is the paid capital which I believe will not be much.

            <div class='col-md body'>If I am not wrong, should be about 300K (I get this info from another forum) But I am not sure this will be given to the people because I think there is a list of people (like stakeholder or whatever) that are allowed to take their share first. Futhermore, when these people sign an agreement with SE, they are not given a copy of the agreement (from what I heard from my friend), so there is no proof to show they had put their money in. I suggest that they go to SE and ask for one now but I doubt they will get it (SE customer support is one of the worst I know in mlm companies)</div>

              <p>A safe guess is that they would blame america's recession multiplyer effect during 2010 when it collapses and then build up their new company... maybe emipire investments plus? or smth?</p>

              <p>Flashback:</p>
              <p>During the Sunshine Empire 1st Anniversary Celebration (the
                                      final and only one) held in Genting Highlands in 2007, James Phang
                                      and Jackie Hoo was being held up in detention and assisting in
                                      investigation by the Commercials Affairs Department [CAD] of
                                      Singapore. Their passports were held by the police and could not
                                      escape.</p>
              <p>David Phang (brother of James Phang and accomplice) announced in
                                      the Sunshine Empire Concert (held in "Arena of Stars", Genting
                                      Highlands) that he was busy in Singapore as his mother was sick and
                                      resting in hospotal.</p>
              <p><strong>This is a lie, publicity stunt and
                                      cover-up.</strong></p>
              <p>The instructions from Jackie Hoo to all BRMs such as Lee Yong
                                      Chew (Fake Name used to scam people = Ken Lee), Rick, Yuan Jie
                                      (David), Mei Qi, Alex Au etc, was to safeguard this information of
                                      James Phang being locked up by the police.</p>
              <p>Top priority was to ensure confidence of GP investors in the
                                      Taipei and TaiChung Wireless project (now both proven to be
                                      non-existent) and not to upset the Sunshine Empire Agents outside
                                      of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The secondary priority was to shift attention of CAD, MAS
                                      (Monetary Authority of Singapore) to investigate other MLM
                                      companies such as EnYouth, Long Far and CosLab. Jackie's rationale
                                      was EnYouth was most similar to NTI; LongFar and Coslab's products
                                      and marketing plans was most similar to Sunshine Empire's
                                      unauthorised and unregulated investment schemes (Gold Prime, Silver
                                      Prime, Bronze Prime, EmPin). Agents were told to call CAD,
                                      MediaCorp to report the alleged crimes of these companies.</p>
              <p>This was also the time that the internationl GP or EmPin was
                                      formulated to save Sunshine Empire Singapore. (Later on, EmPin's
                                      pay out proved to be worst than any other GP, SP or BP. Now EmPin
                                      is a defunct product and investors are still waiting for a
                                      refund)</p>
              <p><strong>One month later, James Phang's mother really died.</strong> Agents,
                                      Managers, Downlines were all expected to attend the wake and
                                      funeral to prove their loyalty to James Phang and
                                      <strong>attendance was taken</strong>. It is a EGA tradition to
                                      make even a wake/funeral to be a business related function. Small
                                      division meeting were even held during the wake to boost sales in
                                      order to compensate James Phang's lost.</p>
