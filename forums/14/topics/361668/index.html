              <p>Ever since my first personal encounter with an MLMer back in 2005,
              I've noticed something extremely curious and may I say disturbing. </p>
              <p>They
              will defend their company and their upline/leader/boss til the end,
              believing in him in whatever he says, defending the company/ products/
              company philosophy against all criticism. Glorification of the
              bosses/uplines/leaders, motivational seminars, etc which sound as if
              its an ideological rally or a religious service.</p>
              <p>Classic
              example is the NTI, NOP, EGA, SE, Emmax, Niu Lifestyle line. We all
              know what kind of "pattern" the company can come out with. Open a
              company, recruit, make huge promises, sudden excuse, company closes
              down. People lose money. Open new one, recruit, make huge promises, say
              boss "won't fail again, won't give up", give a sudden excuse, close
              company down. More people lose more money... the process continues. But
              somehow, they are still people who believe blindly in the boss.
              Idolising, glorification.</p>
              <p>Why? MY PERSONAL guess is that
              this is done to ensure continued loyalty and support of the boss even
              when something goes wrong, someone criticises the company, they will
              not believe them. Akin to self brainwash. The agents would aspire to be
              like him, and that he is someone that could bring them "riches", albiet
              need to work hard. Corporate propoganda and cult of personality?</p>
              <p>One
              company even uses "(the boss) failed before many times, but he never
              gave up, do you think he'll fail again"? This can be used in cycles,
              again and again. Quite scary for people to believe in this I must say.</p>
              <p>Then there are some, like EY and VE which teaches agents to trick people down. Ultimate black sheep of the lot.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Why they trick? It's a non stop vicious cycle. They know their reputation is bad, and people will avoid once they hear the term "mlm". So they teach their agents to trick people down.</p>
              <p>The VE tactic is hiding their company name, as mentioned in the VE thread. Using the names VE Pte Ltd, VE Grp Pte Ltd, VEG Pte Ltd instead of Venture Era.</p>
              <p>Many mlmers trick people down to the office with the pretext of a "lunch meetup", among other creative things to get people to meet up with him/her on the pretext, and "conveniently" bring them up to their office. Always very secretive, never tell people where they're heading to. "Its fun", "u'll know when u get there", etc. After which the victims would be "persuaded" or more like pressurised to stay with peer pressure. There they'll be subjected to the recruiting pitch and not allowed to leav the office.</p>
              <p>Why? They trick people down with the hope their upline can change the victim's mindset about mlm. But just think of it... Lets say 75% of the people already has bad impression of mlm... only 25% say "yes" to you asking if they would like to join.</p>
              <p>Versus you tricking the "100%" into mlm. there they'll be very angry and disgusted about being tricked down. So what are the chances of u successfully changing their mindset? 10%? 5%?</p>
              <p>I know your upline always tell u, every happy customer would tell 6 ppl abt their good experience. BUT an angry victim would tell even more people abt their encounter, and this results in a deadly downward spiral</p>

              <p>Well, i guess being tricked into attending their gathering is not a very good feeling.</p>
              <p>I think one of the reason why there are so many complaints against mlmer is due to the low entry level.</p>
              <p>Almost anyone can join!</p>
              <p>This in turn might tend to attract people desperate to get rich or " it all seems easy just to find people to join" and shake leg all the way.</p>
              <p>I have recently went to one of their gathering. Since it is a friend who brought me there, i decides to just head there to listen.</p>
              <p>After listening, i find that some of what they say actually makes sense. So im wondering why you guys keep saying its a scam? Or is it?</p>
              <p>I don't think so. You guys should read business school by robert kiyosaki Author of rich dad poor dad. An opinion about the network marketing business from a 3rd party helps.</p>

              <p>I didn't say MLM i scam.. perhaps only a few. But majority are non-scam operations. But that doesn't mean their mode of operations is moral and ethical.</p>
              <p>robert kiyosaki... for god's sake can you stop quoting him for once. Almost 60% of the pro-mlm comments I heard are quoting or mentioning him. lol. He had became a prophet of MLM Religion already.</p>
              <p>Who am I against? I'm against MLMs who trick people down, use underhand tactics, scam people, and brainwash people with false hopes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The tricking thing is a vicious cycle. Why trick? Becos ppl got bad impression abt mlm. Trick in hopes of the upline being able to change the victim's mindset. But most of the time the victim is so angry this only makes his impression of MLM worse... So he tells more people, and the reputation is even worse, so they have to trick people down since very few are willing to go down anymore. Makes sense?</p>
              <p>Logic? Many of them are too brainwashed to use logic. They only subscribe to the logic of their boss. Case in point, Sunshine Empire. "Mr James failed before, he never gave up, do you think he'll fail again". Saw this somewhere in a pro SE forum post before they all went into hiding. And well all know his history and track record. So this statement can be used over and over again.</p>

              <p>Well, birds of a feather tend to flock together.</p>
              <p>Im also not rich. But the people i mix with are rather well to do. Not all of course. Who you mix with is important.</p>
              <p>No offence. I don't mean to say that you or your friend are not rich but just that maybe you are not really exposed to meeting credible people.</p>
              <p>And if reading books can get you rich, i would be damn rich by now. LOL</p>
              <p>Its not about what you read will make you rich or not, its what you can learn from the books that matters.</p>

              <p>hahaha</p>
              <p>of course not. Actually its not so much about whos rich anot. Everyone has their own definition of sucess.</p>
              <p>Its about what is it that makes them sucessful in their own area of work, and this doesnt just apply to mlm.</p>
              <p>If you think just what im saying is by being with the rich makes you rich, you are wrong again. Its what makes you as a person and what makes them sucessful and learn from it.</p>

              <p>Well, i guess being tricked into attending their gathering is
              not a very good feeling.</p>
              <p>I think one of the reason why there are so many complaints
              against mlmer is due to the low entry level.</p>
              <p>Almost anyone can join!</p>
              <p>This in turn might tend to attract people desperate to get rich
              or " it all seems easy just to find people to join" and shake leg
              all the way.</p>
              <p>I have recently went to one of their gathering. Since it is a
              friend who brought me there, i decides to just head there to
              listen.</p>
              <p>After listening, i find that some of what they say actually
              makes sense. So im wondering why you guys keep saying its a scam?
              Or is it?</p>
              <p>I don't think so. You guys should read business school by robert
              kiyosaki Author of rich dad poor dad. An opinion about the network
              marketing business from a 3rd party helps.</p>

              <p>mlm is a viable business route. if you are one of the people up there in the chain.</p>
              <p>And btw, the uplines get paid partially by people who go in and try and fail. Income is still generated when they purchase the supplies.  And a constant churn ensures income. up to a point.</p>

              <p>Yup. The top will get the most. All business and jobs are shape it like that. A manager will never earn more than a CEO of a company.</p>
              <p>If none of your friend make it then i think it is better that you start to expand your network of friends. lol</p>

              <p>well, they said the same thing as u did, read robert kiyosaki, mix with rich people, expand network etc and they fail</p>
              <p>everyone think they are different and they think they got something worth more than others, but in the end they fail</p>
              <p>well, i think u better make your exit plans quickly and search for more viable biz....</p>
