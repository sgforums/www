              <p>Amway (BWW) has a new location for their business discussions. Bestway Building. Can hear some of their associates chanting slogans after their classes -_-"</p>
              <p>The usual tricks. Getting their business associates to drop by shake hand, to give the impression of big business and that their own network is big. There're some young and pretty chicks there. Don't be misled, the only 2 people who matter there: the friend who conned you down and his/her upline. Everyone else is just there as part of the show.</p>
              <p>The distributor agreement form has no prices stated. There's this odd fine print that says "I have my own Business Kit" that doesn't make sense. Isn't there a startup kit that comes with every signup, yet there's still a fine print that I have to sign to say I have my own business kit? To cover their backside incase I use my own "Business Kit", instead of theirs, and misrepresent to clients?</p>
              <p>The story about DSAS being a government organisation to protect me. I gagged.</p>
              <p>I work in another industry. When the client gives a buying signal showing that he's interested, I'll immediate ask "So Sir, do you want to pay by cheque or credit card?" This Amway upline went on talking and talking even when I already mentioned I interested to sign. Passed name card using 1 hand casually. Really no standard.</p>
              <p>Haven't signed yet.</p>
              <p>The amount of time and effort they spent to try and close me, I'd say not worth it. The overriding that they'll earn from me...Let's just say if I knew I'll earn such a little amount from a prospect, I'll direct him/her elsewhere.</p>

              <p>One of my friend (not quite close) has recently joined Amway, but I was not sure if I am gonna dissuade the person out of it.</p>
              <p>So there I go, the person asked me out for some "business proposal"...(typical stuff) except something cropped up.</p>
              <p>Of course I was sure MLMs are viable (or even ethical) if they had proper contracts and tools, but during my initial meetings with many MLMs I was petrified.</p>
              <p>Amway, no idea if its BWW or anything provides mostly motivational tools which are totally overwhelming if one is not prepared for it. I was being thrown in with Kiyosaki's books, which some of them I had already read before in libraries...</p>
              <p>But the horror! I was shown the 'harsh realities', which is true, people are too comfortable with their monies, which is true. But the rest are all bullshit and dangerous advices which shouldn't come from any consultant with decent financial knowledge.</p>
              <p>I am also doing personal research on "Greed and Fear" brought me to a temporal conclusion that sometimes people wish they had control in their lives, and some people managed to give them the hope. Be it illusion or truth, I do not know. But this serves as charismatic power for my next research paper on management...</p>

              <p>MLM is definitely not a get rich quick scheme.  More importantly, MLM is not an EASY get rich quick scheme.</p>
              <p>Like in every business, there are simple actions to be taken on a daily basis to make it in the business.  Even the simple actions are not easy, it is definitely possible.</p>
              <p>The most important to notice if the person is sincere is helping you is to reject his business proposal and see his response.  If his response is defensive and keep on questioning why, then the next question is if he is trying to close you.</p>
              <p>If you still insist on saying no, but do say politely though, see what is their response.  If a person is professional, he will respect your decision but if he shows negative response, then you know what type of business partner are you going to have even if you join him one day.</p>

              MLM is about sales; and for those who have done / in the industry / not the industry, income figure is the benchmark of success.  I've been in MLM industry for 2.5 years and had seen enough on the human nature side.
              
              The most important thing in this line is constant "production" so your objectives must be clear and being consistent in doing your sales and all the what-have-you-nots.

              <p>I'm not against MLM. I'm just against the points put forward by
              MLMers who come into this forum, who come in sounding as though
              they know a deep secret and everyone else who is not in MLM dunno.
              And they come in with the first few questions of: how much you earn
              in your job, it's about multiple streams of income, passive income,
              etc etc, all kinds of rubbish... It is as though they will
              definitely succeed just because they know merely a few financial
              terms. Not only that, all others are losers because they are not in
              it.</p>
              <p>Another irritating thing about those forumers who came in here,
              including you, is this sentence:<br> "Go read some books and find out yourself. I don't want to
              spoonfeed you."</p>
              <p>You and other failed MLMers who come in here say this sentence
              aplenty. And I'm not going to start on the number of financial,
              stock analysis, business books/magazines/online articles I have
              read. I even have my own financial articles written and published
              in an ezine.</p>
              <p>All I can say is that the books are sensible, but your mindset
              has been twisted and warped by your MLM upline. It's the same as
              how Al Qaeda twisted Islam. Same holy book, but warped
              interpretations with people following blindly and loyally.</p>

              <p>"If you can sell Jim Jones through Jim Jones' eyes, you can sell Jim Jones what Jim Jones buys!"</p>
              <p>For those of you who do not know who Jim Jones is, just google. His cult followers believed everything he said, even when he instructed nearly 1,000 of his "cult" followers to drink cyanide to commit mass suicide. It CAN HAPPEN IN ANY BUSINESS or environment . . . . not just in MLM.</p>
              <p>The point here is that many people can be very persuasive - some with very good and honorable business intentions, while others have ulterior motive. It is up to YOU to be congnizant of what you are getting yourself into and to evaluate each opportunity for what it can provide you, as well as to evaluate the integrity of the group with whom you may choose to associate.</p>
              <p>MLM is a GREAT business to be involved in, yet as with anything . . . it is only as good as the foundations upon which it is built. This is true for ANY business.</p>
              <p>Wishing you all success . . . .</p>
