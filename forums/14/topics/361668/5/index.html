              <p>Comm is different from profit but i have already explain that in
              my previous post. Been paid a profit is from the overall profit

              themselves not from the sales they made.</p>
              <p>My definition of leverage is making use of people's expertise or

              <p><strong>Dividends</strong> are payments made by a <a title="Corporation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation">corporation</a> to its <strong><a class="mw-redirect" title="Shareholders" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholders">shareholders</a></strong>. It is the portion of corporate <strong>profits paid out to stockholders</strong>.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> When a <strong>corporation earns a <a title="Profit (accounting)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_%28accounting%29">profit</a></strong> or surplus, that money can be put to two uses: it can either be re-invested in the business (called <a title="Retained earnings" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_earnings">retained earnings</a>), or it can be paid to the shareholders as a dividend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have already explain what is profit sharing. This description fits exactly what im saying.</p>
              <p>Alright correction here. Instead of stockholders, it is to distributors instead.</p>

              <p>Received this email from my school</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dear Student</span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> This announcement is to alert the student population to the potential
              risk involved in participating in Network Marketing or MLM type
              schemes. The risk includes loss of up to 100% of your financial
              investment, while legal action including fines and imprisonment.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> It is also important to know that it is an offence to circulate Network
              Marketing (hereafter referred to as MLM type schemes) products and
              services via the NPNet email and associated IT infrastructure.</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> What is MLM?</span></span></strong></p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Multi Level Marketing (MLM) usually refers to a business strategy that
              involves an up-front membership charge or purchase of inventory.</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> In return participants are promised financial rewards for additional recruits. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> How do I avoid investing in MLM?</span></span></strong><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> If you are approached to participate in any "investment like" programme, we advice you to ask yourself three questions: </span></p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Do I have to make an “investment” or pay to get the right to recruit others into the programme? </span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> When I recruit another person into the programme, will I receive what
              the law calls “consideration” (that usually means money) as a result? </span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Will the person I recruit have to make an “investment” or pay to get
              the right to recruit and receive “consideration” for getting other
              people to join?</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"> If the answer to the above is Yes, we advise you to stay away from such investment schemes.</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Is MLM allowed?</span></span></strong></p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> MLM type schemes are prohibited by the Multi Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> It is an offence to participate in MLM schemes. </span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Some MLM schemes are exempted from the Act by the MLM Exclusion Order.e.g. insurance companies and master franchises.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Is there a penalty?</span></span></strong></p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Penalty for breaching the MLM Act includes:</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> A fine of up to $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5
              years, or to both. The fines are for the following offences:</span><ol type="1">
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small;"> Promoting or participating in a multi-level marketing, or pyramid selling, scheme or arrangement. </span></li>

              <p>You don't see it as being an employee, I do see you as an
              employee.</p>
              <p>Example... a tuition teacher at Stalford is paid according to
              the number of students who sign up for his/her class. It is fully
              commission based. Is the teacher considered employed? Maybe no to
              you, but it's a yes to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Never mind la, you happy can liao. Just be the king who wears
              his new clothes and struts around can liao :D</p>

              <p>Haha. Please don't get me wrong. I don't mean that the difference in status means im king or what.</p>
              <p>Being a representative doesn't neccesarily means that im better or what. Just that the positioning and certain flexibility is there.</p>
