              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">Is it free To Join it? I paid $40
                          for it.They say It's for Starter Kit.2nd Time I went down.They
                          asked Me To pay $1600+ for The Bed.I said I had only $500 for it. I
                          Don't know how It works. But Seriously~I Don't like Sales. But no
                          pain no gain.That's what I believed. They might Trick you
                          down/Brainwash you.It occurs To 80/even 90% of The people out
                          there.I don't know if This is A Trick.I've not yet earned any $
                          yet. Then Im To pay them $.Im not really Happy with it.I Told To 1
                          of my friend~He said It Totally is A Scam.I read some of The
                          posts~It said The Bed has no effect. I can't say anything for now.
                          Maybe,I can in 1 month Time.So~How Does It work Im not sure. Having
                          RICH in 3 years Time? My Friend said This''If This is True~There're
                          many rich people now. All were AIM for This company.'' well ~I
                          Agree with him.I Don't know The Truth of EY. I Don't Believed I can
                          earn many in there.I think It's Just like any Sales Job. Just That
                          The name is like ''FAMOUS''. like what my friend said~If EY really
                          is good. whys there still poor people now? For Me~I think''If EY
                          really is good.whys There still so much Complaints''? Yet
                          I Doubted.I must say The Good Points are</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">1st.The people are Friendly. It
                          feels like Family in there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">2ndly.It's A Flexible Job. not
                          like others~You needa wear uniform/sign contract/ work for it like
                          hell. You can go there wherever you want. But If That's so(Your
                          Rank will always Remain low)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">3rdly.People in there always Happy

                          didn't even saw/get it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">2ndly.They say how well The
                          product is Etc. After They asked You To Take few $100-$1000+ out To
                          buy their products To know The Benefits of it ~so you can convince
                          customers next time you selling it To them.</span></p>

                          help your friend To Promote into higher ranks so They Benefits From

              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p>perhaps i can help you address some concern of yours. In regards to EY, i don't have much exposure to them so i can only address it in a general way.</p>
              <p>In a network marketing, it is never free to join. If they tell you it's free, they are lying. Getting a starter kit is essential as it can provides you with basic info on products and ways to conduct your biz. Btw, they should have told you about the cost of the kit right from the start and when would you get it.</p>
              <p>If you still haven't receive it, you should ask them. It would be irresponsible of them not to follow up for you.</p>
              <p> You should evaluate their products and costs before you join.</p>
              <p>One of the essential skills you need to learn when starting a biz or anything for that matter is to learn how to sell. How to sell yourself, your product and all. You need to be prepared to learn how to sell if not mlm might not be suitable for you.</p>
              <p>Your upline might and should be able to teach you that.</p>
              <p>If you have not earn any money yet, is it because you did not put enough effort to it or your upline did not coach you properly?</p>
              <p>Becoming rich is definitely possible ( subjected to the company and team you join ) but it is not guaranteed. You have to put effort to it.There is no sure way to confirm get rich in biz.</p>
              <p>They can let you see the potential of it but in the end it is really up to your effort and your belief.</p>
              <p> Why they ask you to use the product is because in a biz you run, you must have the belief in your products you sell. Otherwise, it would be hard to imagine you been sucessful in it.</p>
              <p>Would you caught employees of coca cola to drink pepsi while working? Highly unlikely. And you wouldn't see bill gates using mac also.</p>
              <p>Your friend mention that if it is so easy to be rich, there would be people joining it right? There are. But whether they can be rich anot is another thing.</p>
              <p>Take bubble tea for example. In the beginning, one cup sells for 3 to 4 dollar and sells like crazy. Now it is 1 dollar plus and not many survive. Why? It is biz. Nothing is guaranteed.</p>

              <p>Mlm is comparably to franchise. But of course the system is different. Franchise makes the system simple.

              <p>Then in that case, nothing in this world is guaranteed. Not even your job is guaranteed. Not even good results in school guaranteed. True to a certain extent, but there are 1001 ways to tweak probabilities to your side, such that you can be &gt;90% assured of success.</p>

              <p>Again, i agree with you on this to a certain extent. You do not
              have complete ownership to the company but that doesn't exclude the

              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">I Joined EY few weeks
              ago~</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">Is it free To Join it? I paid $40
              for it.They say It's for Starter Kit.2nd Time I went down.They
              asked Me To pay $1600+ for The Bed.I said I had only $500 for it. I
              Don't know how It works. But Seriously~I Don't like Sales. But no
              pain no gain.That's what I believed. They might Trick you
              down/Brainwash you.It occurs To 80/even 90% of The people out
              there.I don't know if This is A Trick.I've not yet earned any $
              yet. Then Im To pay them $.Im not really Happy with it.I Told To 1
              of my friend~He said It Totally is A Scam.I read some of The
              posts~It said The Bed has no effect. I can't say anything for now.
              Maybe,I can in 1 month Time.So~How Does It work Im not sure. Having
              RICH in 3 years Time? My Friend said This''If This is True~There're
              many rich people now. All were AIM for This company.'' well ~I
              Agree with him.I Don't know The Truth of EY. I Don't Believed I can
              earn many in there.I think It's Just like any Sales Job. Just That
              The name is like ''FAMOUS''. like what my friend said~If EY really
              is good. whys there still poor people now? For Me~I think''If EY
              really is good.whys There still so much Complaints''? Yet
              I Doubted.I must say The Good Points are</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">1st.The people are Friendly. It
              feels like Family in there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">2ndly.It's A Flexible Job. not
              like others~You needa wear uniform/sign contract/ work for it like
              hell. You can go there wherever you want. But If That's so(Your
              Rank will always Remain low)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">3rdly.People in there always Happy
              To share with you Their Experiences.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">4Th.They're good convincers..
              (Tricked you down..Tell you good points of EY Etc.How They earn so
              much in There.....)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">For The Bad Points</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">1st.never heard must pay $40 for
              The 1st day. It's like unreasonable.where's The starter kit? I
              didn't even saw/get it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">2ndly.They say how well The
              product is Etc. After They asked You To Take few $100-$1000+ out To
              buy their products To know The Benefits of it ~so you can convince
              customers next time you selling it To them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">3rdly.They Just ask You To
              Join(Reason:To Make Their Ranks higher.To help them buy their
              products,asking your friends To go down there..Etc saying They'll
              help your friend To Promote into higher ranks so They Benefits From
              it but not You)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">4Th.They Don't really reveal out
              Their Salary.Just used By Talkings~how much They earn Etc Etc.It's
              like Exaggerating/Empty Talks.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">I really Agree with redstone. I
              feel somehow Regret To Join Them for nothing.</span></p>

              <p>My reply was "Whether they do it a not, my statement that "you have zero

              <p>1) Interesting... But still sound wrong to me, though I can't pinpoint where at the moment</p>
              <p>2) Many other jobs also allows u to leverage on others. E.g. engineers can leverage on engineering assistants to help them in their work.</p>

              <p>Thats where i disagree with you...Wotever it is as long as you are listed as a distributor, you are no more but an employee...especially in the pyramid scheme...you are still working under the company therefore, you're no more than an employee</p>
              <p>you are tied down by ranks...a person who is self employed is not an ODM, DM, SDM or wotever bloody rank that makes them...besides, commission is made at a very low percentage...in a real business, profits are made, not commission...</p>
              <p>The company will give you a portion of their profit? i doubt they'd do anything like that if its not for bonuses or to make the company look good...</p>

              <p>Yup Deino pointed out right... commission is different from profits</p>
              <p>Being paid a commission merely means you will earn as much as the number of successful sales you made. Commissions are merely tools to employ people to work hard...</p>
              <p>In businesses, you talk about costs, overheads, selling price, profits, not commissions.</p>

              <p>But Deino, being listed as a distributor doesn't necessary mean you must be an employee. Nutritionpark is a distributor for certain products, but they are still a business.</p>

              <p>yea especially about the part where he/she talks about the company giving percentage of profits...</p>
              <p>profits are kept either for the owner of the company, the company itself and its share holders...</p>

              anyone know abt ponzi schemes?
              
              I think the MLM took a leaf out of the ponzi schemes in the early 1920s-1930s. pyramid selling also copied from ponzi schemes.

              <p>Haiz.. Go check the definiton of employee in the dictionary or any government website.</p>
              <p>Enough said.</p>
              <p>I do understand where you are coming from but your explanation is unfounded.</p>
              <p>Comm is different from profit but i have already explain that in my previous post. Been paid a profit is from the overall profit that the company made and is been distributed to the distrbutor themselves not from the sales they made.</p>
              <p>My definition of leverage is making use of people's expertise or strength to expand one's biz. Not in the area of engineer or any employee's work for that matter.</p>
