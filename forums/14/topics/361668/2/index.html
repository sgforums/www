              <p>Im also not rich. But the people i mix with are rather well to

              <p>And if reading books can get you rich, i would be damn rich by
              now. LOL</p>

              <p>I'm not against MLM. I'm just against the points put forward by
              MLMers who come into this forum, who come in sounding as though they
              know a deep secret and everyone else who is not in MLM dunno. And they
              come in with the first few questions of: how much you earn in your job,
              it's about multiple streams of income, passive income, etc etc, all
              kinds of rubbish... It is as though they will definitely succeed just
              because they know merely a few financial terms. Not only that, all others are losers because they are not in it.</p>
              <p>Another irritating thing about those forumers who came in here, including you, is this sentence: <br> "Go read some
                                      books and find out yourself. I don't want to spoonfeed you."</p>
              <p>You and other failed MLMers who come in here say this sentence aplenty. And
              I'm not going to start on the number of financial, stock analysis, business books/magazines/online articles I have read. I even have my own financial articles written and published in an ezine.</p>
              <p>All I can say is that the books are sensible, but your mindset has been
              twisted and warped by your MLM upline. It's the same as how Al Qaeda
              twisted Islam. Same holy book, but warped interpretations with people
              following blindly and loyally.</p>

              <p>I got too much things to do to spoonfeed you bit by bit. You are definitely one who reads selectively, not only my posts, but on Robert Kiyosaki's one as well. It does nothing to my ego when you ask me to read more books, because one should always read more. Just FYI, I'm gobbling up available information on the Elliot Wave Principle right now. Go google if you do not know what it is.</p>
              <p>The most major contradiction of your actions is from this sentence</p>
              <p>"<em>Im never make it to Uni"</em></p>
              <p>Robert mentioned one should get a uni education.<br>He also mentioned that your mindset should never be "I'll never be able to make it" but instead "How can I do it"</p>
              <p>This sentence alone shows that you only read things you want to read, do things you want to do, apply things halfway.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd, even you yourself is contradictory</p>

                                              telling everyone im sucessful.<br> <br> It's embarassing.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I don't see how you can get downlines by not telling everyone who has the potential to be your downline that you are successful</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now you are still new to the game, so you are still bogged down by what your uplines have told you. You are still "motivated" by them because of their NLP. Given the state of the economy right now, I doubt you will see much success initially.</p>
              <p>You may say no success, you still have other sources of income (which I expect it to be another job, pardon me if I'm wrong). In fact, by saying that, you have already subconsciously implanted "no success" inside yourself. People usually succeed because it is a must. You are already not making it a must.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, I'm not against MLM system as a whole. My motive is to get forumers like you to wake up your idea (just read my other posts). The way you prove your point is already illogical (just because 3rd party with vested interest say so), yet you persist in it. Like what Warren Buffett said, he never believe in what analysts (or banks) have to say because they have vested interest. Surely Warren Buffett will give even more credibility than your Robert Kiyosaki (who claimed he could earn more than WB if he wanted). Like duh.</p>
              <p>You do need to read up more, and not only that, read objectively and fully, not selectively as you have done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Learning and applying things halfway and selectively like you will bring little success.</p>
              <p>And lastly, you know one thing? You will be the one on the losing end by being so stubborn-minded not to learn and accept opinions here because you are in the industry, and defending it so stubbornly. Even I don't do that for those different areas I earn from (engineering, education, equities, websites). No matter whether you managed to convince us here, we don't lose out because we are not inside.</p>
              <p>Ok enough spoonfeeding.</p>

              <p>It's simple human psychology. Your ego has clearly been bruised earlier
                          on, so whatever people say about you, you try to push it on others that
                          their ego has been bruised. And back to you: "<em>This is obvious from all your all your postings.</em> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png">"</p>

Same words used. No one else started mentioning about ego-bruising and agitation until you do. Really, I do think your ego must have been badly bruised in school last time, and you must really have been agitated by people who were against your opinion of MLM.</p>
              <p>Agitated... Perhaps a little when you illogically attempt to support your stand by raising a 3rd party with vested interest, and who did not go through the same path... I really can't believe people will fall for this again and again, and I guess it's no coincidence all who came to sgforums to say this all declare that they did not do well in school except for one who went NS after his JC.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Nah, you have clearly given the impression that you are boasting you have multiple streams of income like it is a big deal. Especially when it was placed after telling others that they don't get it.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Seems like you dont get it. Its not about others. Its abt you
                                                  yourself.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Anyway</span> i already have multiple stream of income</strong> so if one fail i
                                                  stil have the others.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Guess your ego must have been really really bruised when you see so many people around you scoring better than you in school making you a failure there.</p>
              <p>So much so that when I attempted to share what helps me earn by giving little hints here and there, you think that you succeeded in ego bruising. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Obviously in self-denial.</p>
              <p>It's really suspicious when you keep telling me my ego is bruised and I'm agitated. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br>Is that what and how your MLM upline taught you to deal with people who doubt you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh ya, enough of sarcasm in showing you what is really called ego bruising. Let me repeat my stand in this edit which you obviously can't comprehend yet.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In short, I'm not against MLM system as a whole. My motive is to
                                          get forumers like you to wake up your idea (just read my other
                                          posts). The way you prove your point is already illogical (just
                                          because 3rd party with vested interest say so), yet you persist in
                                          it. Like what Warren Buffett said, he never believe in what
                                          analysts (or banks) have to say because they have vested interest.
                                          Surely Warren Buffett will give even more credibility than your
                                          Robert Kiyosaki (who claimed he could earn more than WB if he
                                          wanted). Like duh.</p>
              <p>You do need to read up more, and not only that, read objectively
                                          and fully, not selectively as you have done.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I won't dissuade you from going through this path, but please, that mindset of yours that it's good because Robert said it is.... is just plain crap...</p>
              <p>Do it because you want to try it out. Do it because you think you will like it. Do it because you want to.</p>
              <p>Not do it because</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>You guys should read business school by robert
                                          kiyosaki Author of rich dad poor dad. <strong>An opinion about the network
                                          marketing business from a 3rd party helps</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And also not because you have other streams of income and thus the "fail then fail lor" mentality.</p>
              <p>Also, you have already assumed here that we didn't read books by Robert here. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Talking about assumptions again?<br></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, like what laurence82 mentioned:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>all your general theories...are just theories which we get from
                                          MLMers all the time</p>
              <p>tell me something that adds value</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As long as you haven't successfully applied any of the theories and understandings you have here, what you said here are merely empty talks.</p>
              <p>Apply it, succeed in it, then it will give you credibiltiy. You don't get better by knowing theories, but by successfully applying them.</p>
              <p>Example, I'm applying what I have learned in channel trading, and earned quite a bit in it as mentioned in another sub-forum. I put my hard earned cash down to apply it, and succeed. Easily 1k + monthly without much effort if you understand what's the probability and the risk/reward ratio. But I'm still not like you, coming here and telling people they should do this do that, and assuming others have not read this or that, and this is especially rude when you are just a new sign-up.</p>

              <p>It's ping pong because you are the one who told off others for it, yet doing it yourself. A pot calling the kettle black. A hypocrite. What you had posted cannot even be constituted as part of a debate; no debates would use such illogical way of proving your points. As I have said, if you do this in a paper, you will be shot left right down centre.</p>
              <p>That said, I admit and agree I'm carrying it far, and delibrately. It's a just a little display what's an attempt on ego bruising, although it's still a weak one. Won't carry on in this. Everything withdrawn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point still stands that it's illogical to take the opinion of a 3rd party who has vested in it, and whom did not go through that path, as the basis of your decision, and as the basis that other people here (whom are also 3rd party) are wrong.</p>
