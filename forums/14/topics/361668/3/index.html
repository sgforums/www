              <p>it is for a small number of ppl to earn money from the majority who doesn't...</p>
              <p>theres no point in being an upline if you dun have many downline and if you are one of those downlines, the only way you can earn much is if you area above...</p>
              <p>most companies will "advice" new agents to invest in the company...</p>
              <p>imagine if you were to buy a product which costs around 1k or 2k from the company...in order for you to make money, you'd have to sell a large amount of products to cover that cost since "commision" is relatively low...now you add the expenses you use during your time working and i bet you ain't be really making any dough...rather just covering up for the losses you made...</p>
              <p>most victims these days are youths, young and inexperienced individuals, told by their uplines that its a free and easy job when its a fact that it is actually time consuming...</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, those hours they clocked in mlm could actually be used to find more decent jobs could actually earn them more than wot they can sell in a month...</p>

              <p>From the replies I see from most of the get-rich-wannabes MLMers that come to this forum, I get the uneasy feeling that the 'uplines' are actually using NLP techniques to 'program' these people into their robots.</p>
              <p>i.e.<br>"pple who leave the company are quitters"<br>"you will earn a lot of passive income; that's income without working much"<br><br>Basically, these words prey on the mentality of most youngsters: <br>i) On the strawberry generation: Earn money by working hard, and find a lot of downlines; then after that you don't need to work hard, just need your downlines to help you generate passive income<br>ii) On the rebellious nature of youngsters: Don't listen to pple who don't support you; they are just jealous.<br></p>

              <p>Probably. But seriously when one join a mlm you have to ask yourself are you doing the right thing.

              <p>Your second point is a grey area. In sucessful biz, chances are the founders usually can choose to let other capable people run their biz  after they have set up their system and they can either sit back or set up other area of biz.</p>

              <p>I can't deny the fact that there are people out there brainwashing. Esp in internet marketing where infomation are so readily available.</p>
              <p>If a company is gone, so is the passive income.</p>
              <p>If we take all the possible ways of having passive income. It is true also.</p>
              <p>Writing a book for example. Unless that the book you write creates plenty of values to others, it is likely that the passive income generated from writing a book last only a few yrs. You still need to constantly reinvent or repackage the book.</p>
              <p>Owning a biz. If you set up a system that can auto run by people, you can only receive income if the biz still exist. And you need to innovate and improve on your biz values to survive in this competitive market.</p>
              <p>I believe what they are trying to say is to make them be aware that having an employee mindset won't make you sucessful in it. Instead, one need to think like a biz owner to expand his network.</p>
              <p>There are mlm company that sells expensive product. Then again its very subjective. If the product is below the market price does it consider cheap?</p>
              <p>Did you know that Handphone cost price is actually very cheap. A hp selling for 500plus or more in the market can cost ard 50 plus from distributor. The profit margin is definitely huge. <br>This of course is very dependable on what sort of products is being sold.</p>
              <p>Advertising cost is indeed expensive but in my point of view, it is neccesary to a certain extent. If you are able to cut down on ads cost, who wouldn't want.</p>
              <p>My company ( not an mlm of course ) does not do much advertising, this in turn allows our clients and their staffs to benefit from it.</p>

              <p>When people say you will earn alot of passive income without
                  working much, then obviously they are lying or just wana get rich
                  quick.</p>
              <p>Your second point is a grey area. In sucessful biz, chances are
                  the founders usually can choose to let other capable people run
                  their biz  after they have set up their system and they can
                  either sit back or set up other area of biz.</p>
              <p>In most cast, they will probably carry on due to their
                  passion.</p>
              <p>Your last point brings about a personal exp of mine.</p>
              <p>I was approach by this SE person whos ard 19 yr old abt 1 yr
                  plus back. His dream is to own a bmw 5 series in 2 month time and
                  become a millionaire in abt 8 mth time. Given his age and his
                  surrounding "biz partners" whos also ard his age, i get this uneasy
                  feeling that this all seems like a scam.</p>
              <p>In the end, it's true afterall.</p>

              <p>Can be true or false.</p>
              <p>And easier said than done.</p>
              <p>But nvm, I've too much work to go into details. Already sleeping like &lt;5 hrs a day... I got this source of website adsense passive income that has potential, but no time to grow it further... So want to add some more things now... Haven't been updating it for 3 months, though adsense revenue still trickles in a little without me doing much...</p>
              <p>Anyway, go ahead and do it. Hope you can be successful in 6 mths time and come back to tell me about it.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">I Joined EY few weeks ago~</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">Is it free To Join it? I paid $40 for it.They say It's for Starter Kit.2nd Time I went down.They asked Me To pay $1600+ for The Bed.I said I had only $500 for it. I Don't know how It works. But Seriously~I Don't like Sales. But no pain no gain.That's what I believed. They might Trick you down/Brainwash you.It occurs To 80/even 90% of The people out there.I don't know if This is A Trick.I've not yet earned any $ yet. Then Im To pay them $.Im not really Happy with it.I Told To 1 of my friend~He said It Totally is A Scam.I read some of The posts~It said The Bed has no effect. I can't say anything for now. Maybe,I can in 1 month Time.So~How Does It work Im not sure. Having RICH in 3 years Time? My Friend said This''If This is True~There're many rich people now. All were AIM for This company.'' well ~I Agree with him.I Don't know The Truth of EY. I Don't Believed I can earn many in there.I think It's Just like any Sales Job. Just That The name is like ''FAMOUS''. like what my friend said~If EY really is good. whys there still poor people now? For Me~I think''If EY really is good.whys There still so much Complaints''? Yet I Doubted.I must say The Good Points are</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">1st.The people are Friendly. It feels like Family in there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">2ndly.It's A Flexible Job. not like others~You needa wear uniform/sign contract/ work for it like hell. You can go there wherever you want. But If That's so(Your Rank will always Remain low)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">3rdly.People in there always Happy To share with you Their Experiences.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">4Th.They're good convincers.. (Tricked you down..Tell you good points of EY Etc.How They earn so much in There.....)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">For The Bad Points</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">1st.never heard must pay $40 for The 1st day. It's like unreasonable.where's The starter kit? I didn't even saw/get it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">2ndly.They say how well The product is Etc. After They asked You To Take few $100-$1000+ out To buy their products To know The Benefits of it ~so you can convince customers next time you selling it To them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">3rdly.They Just ask You To Join(Reason:To Make Their Ranks higher.To help them buy their products,asking your friends To go down there..Etc saying They'll help your friend To Promote into higher ranks so They Benefits From it but not You)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">4Th.They Don't really reveal out Their Salary.Just used By Talkings~how much They earn Etc Etc.It's like Exaggerating/Empty Talks.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #9a0fef;">I really Agree with redstone. I feel somehow Regret To Join Them for nothing.</span></p>
