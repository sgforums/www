              Hi guys. 
              
              My friend was called up for an interview as a management trainee but he doesn't remember applying for this position. 
              
              He received this email after speaking to a lady from EY (not Ernst and Young) who called and she said they're a financial company. She said they had engaged a headhunting company but are unable to reveal which website (JobsDB or JobStreet, etc) it is due to confidentiality purposes.
              
              She also said it's not an MLM company and are purely a financial company. 
              
              This is the email:

              <p>Delfi? That near Bunka..lol...missed that place...</p>
              <p>Anyways..from wot i know agents use the letters EY as a shortform of Enyouth..<br>Ofcourse which company will say they are MLM right?</p>
              <p>My advice is tell your friend to do research about MLM first and then go for the interview to determine whether it is genuine to play safe...lol...anything can happen</p>

              <p>My friend was called up for an interview as a management trainee
                      but he doesn’t remember applying for this position.</p>
              <p>He received this email after speaking to a lady from EY (not
                      Ernst and Young) who called and she said they’re a financial
                      company. She said they had engaged a headhunting company but are
                      unable to reveal which website (JobsDB or JobStreet, etc) it is due
                      to confidentiality purposes.</p>
              <p>She also said it’s not an <span>MLM</span> company and
                      are purely a financial company.</p>
              <p>This is the email:</p>

              <p>probe for name of company. You have full right to know which company u're going to interview with right? If they still hide here n there, about their name and which field they're in ("financial" can be very wide), got chance is MLM.</p>

              <p>If they found your profile in a job website like JobsDB, that means they should already have a copy of your resume with them. (your resume would have been posted at the job site for them to see right? )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asking you to bring another copy should already alert you to be careful.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And what crap confidential headhunting info can they not reveal?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If it was a legitimate headhunting firm, the headhunter will be calling you first to find out more about you, not the client company. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suspect it could be those companies seeking participants to their "wealth seminars".  They want people to sign up for their seminars which they will teach you financial planning and those NLP stuff. Yes, you get to pay them money to join their "I want to make you rich" seminar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are curious, can go see what it is all about, but never sign anything or provide too much personal details to them if you find it is not a job interview. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Think we shouldn't brand the whole MLM or Direct Selling industry as bad just because of a few black sheeps.</p>
              <p>Regardless of whatever industry, there are always black sheep but that doesn't mean the industry is bad.</p>
              <p>One word of precaution is this, if you are seriously considering to join an MLM company, do not invest in more than $5,000 and the most important thing is this, ask them the prices of the products they are buying from the company and the prices you will be buying, then you know if your upline is frontloading you.</p>

              <p>Wow, looks like a debate to me, hahaha...</p>
              <p>But I glanced through and find this said is quite true: MLM is not for everyone!  Only for minority, I guess.</p>
              <p>Recently I read a book call 'Corporate Life to Multi Level Marketing'.  What I learned from this author - Lee Poh Eng is really an eye-opener for me.  Maybe before anyone especially for those who  use to 'listen only' to others or those who ever joined MLM but always put blame on the company but not themselves, are advise to read this book. Of course, if you are curious &amp; love to read, please go and get one. </p>
