              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just to share that i am a victim of this Coslab MLM scheme which make me loss 5k and i still do not know if i am able to recover the return.. This is suppose to be a "Re-know" and establish company which is also one of the reason why i decided to join after my upline keep pushing me to join..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I signed up for their life-style package early last year promises of a " GUARNTEE" monthly return of investment together with "FREE" session of facial within their coslab network , but it was only after a few month later that i began to reliaize that things is not right... As of all "Empire-scheme", we usually get a "fat" cheque making us to beleive that we will be initially be paid off our investment and soon getting a profit from their so call " Share pool" of profit ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe this was done to built trust to attract new distributor to bring in more distributor. But after the 3 month, they started dealying the repayment and some month even skip payment.. Now the main office in tanjong pagar has been shut down, and none of their stuff in their outlet since was told not to review where there new head office is afraid that we will go claim for the money..</p>
              <p>All i was given an email and HP contact which i tryiing email and calling but no reply..</p>
              <p>Anyone which suffer the same faith with me maybe can share over here..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>If you want to recover your investment back, My most effective suggestion is you can either approach Consumers Association of Singapore , their link : <a href="http://www.case.org.sg/">http://www.case.org.sg/</a> or you can call the MediaCorp News Hotline 68222268.No point share your mourn here and get ridiculed here.(If you have read most of the forum you will understand what I mean)</p>
              <p>Need more proof? , check this straits times link and you will find that some people even get "ripped" for $20000 and this is how they bring attention to the public.</p>

              <p>I would just like to share this bad experience here and hope no one will fall into this trap..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was just like you guys, thinking over "How good can it be true? " that such company is giving such a deal.. My friend keep telling me COSLAB is an establsih company bah bah bah, with proven track reccord and you have many plan to expand their business to M'sia ect so you will see your investment back with good return very soon..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My friend even gave me a "personal promise" he said that if anything go wrong, he will bare for it.. So in the end, he has signed up 5 person which is including me of course, and he happily get his first pay cheque of 5K which he is able to get back his initial investment of course.. and for those 5 poor friends of his, have to suck thumb and bare this shit ourslves.. Now i call COSLAB marina and suntec, they only tell me to call this number which no one ever pick it up, and when i ask them where is their office now ? They have they all have move to M'sia ?? It seem like they are trying to run away for this without having any answer for those poor fellows..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe i can say MLM is also a business where you can see your friend truely..</p>
