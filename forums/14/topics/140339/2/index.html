(go read my LIFE CYCLE OF A TYPICAL MLMER thread if it is still around).  she must have snubbed those ppl who try to pull her out.   so now there's no turning back for her, but to soldier on aimlessly,  and one thing for her to do is to DRAG OTHERS DOWN INTO THE MUD WITH HER.<br><br>its like she was dumped on her wedding day, and now she goes around breaking up couples and families.<br><br>am i correct Miss Prickly Heat???<br><br>ok lah, i shall not be too hard on her........<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for Miss Prickly Heat<br><br>______________________________________________________<br>1) Mr X gets enticed into joining MLM.<br>He persuades people around him (including YOU) to join him in a new business opportunity,quoting the need to have dual income, need to have entrepreneur spirit, need to change mindset..... He will also quote big and prominent names and corporations and say they are into MLM also...names like Bill Gates, IBM, Microsoft, Nike etc.....<br><br>He also claims that his MLM company is the best, with the best product, best mgmt, best team, best remuneration structure.<br>bankers, lawyers, heart surgeons and 747 pilots have joined this company.<br>top men in this company drives Porsche, lives in 2 bungalows etc....<br><br>He also mentions why things like why work for 40 years and retire for 10years. why not work for 10 years and retire for 40 years.<br><br>2) Mr X stops bothering you, taking it that you are hopeless and stubborn and ignorant.<br>Off he goes on his new "business" venture.<br><br>typical paraniod questions thrown at you in the heat of frustration trying to<br>convince you includes:<br><br>i) pyramid selling? can you explain to me what exactly is pyramid selling and the difference between pyramid selling and MLM????????<br><br>ii) you not interested then you ask so many questions for what???!!!!!<br>iii) if I answer this question of yours, you agree to buy and join???, then???!!!!<br><br>You will see him approaching people in all scenarios from a wedding banquet, a drinking session, a mahjong session, lunch, Incamp training etc.....<br><br>3) Mr X having been rejected by the numerous people that he approaches, now complains to you, and starts to bad-mouth those who reject him, labelling them as no ambition, kiasi, no entrepreneurship and so on. But notice that he will not mention a slight hint of the MLM business he is involved in to you, even if you ask him. Vague answers will be given like new way, new business, new concept of selling.<br><br>4) Mr X now having failed considerably to make good on his MLM business, now makes a call to you, asking casually if you are interested in joining his business venture. at most, he will mention the product itself,(magnetic mattress, health food, gold coin) but not the MLM company name itself.<br><br>5) Mr X could have approach his MLM upline trying to refund the product, but this will not be made known to people whom he had approached. Whether the refund is successful or not, only Mr X knows, (I would see this as something being done BACKSTAGE, away from the audience)<br><br>6) Mr X now still stuck, keeps to himself and stop mentioning the business. this is where the embarassment part comes into play. Extreme embarassment meaning he has shown to you so much faith, hope and promise in the thing at the very beginning and now it has failed him entirely and make him so lost. still he presists and refuses to admit its not working, for saving face sake,<br><br>7) so once in a while Mr X unleashes it again,"how would you like to join me in my business."<br>and the name Robert Kiyosaki is probably a standard dish being served in this whole banquet.<br><br>__________________________________________________________<br><br>so Miss Prickly Heat, which stage are you in now??  7?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, the fact that it's a top selling business book(ie Rich Dad) infer nothing about its quality.<br><br>If it's a storybook, like Harry Potter or Da Vinci Code, the fact that it's a best-seller still have some relevance because it's because people like the writing style or the fact that the story have the ability to excite the readers, giving joy in the process. No prior knowledge or experience is required.<br><br>However when it comes to books on business and finance? Who are the ones who buy the books to make it a best-seller? Yes, it's the newbies! So are the opinion of newbies regarding to business and finance books reliable? Of course not! The guide to such books only has relevance only when people who judge them are familiar with this field (ie business leaders, CEOs, etc).<br><br>Anyway, IMHO, only the first 1/3 of Rich Dad is relevant, but VERY SHALLOW. The rest is plain nonsense and long-windedness....I seriously doubt the credibiliity of Kiyosaki. Yes, he may be rich, because people who hype and buy his 'business' books made him rich. Not because he was rich from doing business in the first place.

JP will come into the stage in first floor and talk about some dugs like 100 university students how many become successful at the age 55 and how many of them are not successful<br><br>2. after the stupid talk they will let you guys played a game, from what manger to BDM, you must cross over some distance and do a unique actions while you walk. after you are in the other side, you must do another unique actions back again, any repeated actions will have to redo, this time is BDM to BRM.<br><br>3. you will have some cheap skate lunch after this and here is the main physco arrived, if this one they can't physco you, you are safe!<br>Listen up, jp will give each one of them who attend the PSC a piece of paper, the conent of the paper is actually some 'success words' and you really have to shout about it! so difficult you know? shout until your throat have blood but they still say your effort is only 50%. This is a scam here! it won't boost you voice but actually a brainwashing process! they need you to shout to 100%, which is totally impossible.

Haiz...see until that guy/girl shoout until wanna faint liao then all agreed. kns...haha....<br><br>Btw, i'm the only one whom didn't go up to the stage to do those thingys...haha..all rushed to the stage except me...haha...i was left alone sitting on the chair watching them chiong to the stage...haha...guess what...i kenna "AIM" by all the instructors n those "chiongsters".<br><br>I mean, do you need to shout to prove to others so that you can be successful?<br><br>1) Y would i wanna prove to you guys that i'll be successful?<br>2) Y would i need to shout? Sounds so idiotic...<br>3) I see that all are followers rather than leaders.<br><br>Skip the rest of contents of the course..the final episode was again to prove to your groups n instructors that you wanna be successful. Again, shoutings, agressiveness, ppl kenna drag out, ppl crying...blah blah blah~<br><br>My turn to prove....haha...all surrounded me n pushed me ard saying that i won't succeed n chased me to go home...haha..becoz i juz stood there n juz tell them softly that i'll be successful n will be even more successful that anyone of them. haha.....wah seh....all buey song n keep pushing me again n again, my session was even less than 5mins n James Phang &amp; his RHman(A milllionaire) came up to me n congratulate me that i've graduated the course. Shook my hands &amp; hug me...<br><br>Guess what, i'm the only one whom graduated without doing any shoutings...<br>haha...all of them shouted n cried juz to get graduated from the course...what for manz....To be successful is to use your brain, not your shoutings n agressiveness....<br><br>That's what i told JP &amp; the millionaire when i wanted to go home during half of the course. Guess what did the two of them said? They told me that i'm the special one out of the rest of them and i was like the two of them when they were young. haha...the two of them even told me that when everyone chiong to the stage to prove everyone that they wan to be leaders n be successful and i was alone sitting down there, they already spotted my ability n potentials....blah blah blah~<br><br>haha...so...tell me...what have you learnt from those courses huh??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
