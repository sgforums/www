I call it throwing away your money. I still have their crap products with me, opened but un-used. Cause they opened it first day i bought it to 'check for faults' so that way i cannot do refund!

            <div class='col-md body'>Altho there are so called few 'facts', sumone in another thread exposed the picture of the company office in Indonesia as being doctored, thats beside the point whether there is any so called overseas expansion at all.<br><br>That is just a claim, same like when JP used NOP to set up Batam resort, end up the resort wasnt built, NOP moved its office to nti without even informing its customers at all.<br><br>Again, nobody is refutting those points but rather, keep on making claims of expansion and growth. Those who cant get their refunds, and what sort of so called investment opportunity, nobody up to now still explain....whereas there is alredi analysis of their business plan in other similar topics.<br><br>And worse, i see slogans too.<br><br>Next pls..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
