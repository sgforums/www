            <div class='col-md body'>next big thing my arse...<br><br>For every next big thing, there must be good reasons for it. However, proponents for MLM can't make the argument convincing. Ok, some are still logical, but the majority are crapz.<br><br>You may have better luck investing in tech stocks now, since the bubble era is over...    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  At least for tech being the next big thing, there are good reasons for it(just look at how the internet has made transactions and information transfer easier, faster and cheaper), just that people were TOO OPTIMISTIC about its future and its growth, and of course, the mother of all business stupidities - herd mentality.<br><br>When people tell you to be different by joining MLM and how it's about to be the next big thing, and you buy it just like that without deeper reasoning, you are essentially having a herd mentaility...<br><br>That said, I'm not totally dismissing MLM implying it can't work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MLM may not be for everyone but that doesn't mean it's a bad business...<br><br>I think it's the mindset of Singaporean that they prefer to work or stay employed to be rich.<br><br>When they are being approached to work for MLM when they need to approach their friends, relatives and family members...they feel "paisey' to earn their $.<br><br>Two things, products and recruitment.<br><br>I am not against MLM.  To me, it's just another approach to sell a product DIRECTLY to a customer. In the end, we earn our comission by cutting down the advertisements, retailers, rental, and etc...<br><br>There are many products out there which are over-priced too....but how come nobody is complaining? e.g. a can of coke selling in NTUC for 50 cents cost $1.50 elsewhere?<br><br>I see it as the mindset of our very own ppl. We just want to 'save our face'!<br><br>As for recruitment, it's more people-oriented and also depending on the marketing plan. From my experience, pioneers who join the coy first may not be the one who always earn from their downlines. I've seen cases whereby their downlines earns more than their uplines... It's all about the marketing plan.<br><br>It took me many months to understand their marketing plan and I dun believe that from the very first presentation, we can assume that we know EXACTLY how the marketing plan works...and that's where alot of ppl misunderstood that it's a pyramid selling..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a question for ms jane, but that question didnt come from me, some other forumer mentioned it long time ago..<br><br>so if costs of marketing a product thru marketing intermediaries are cut down by not going thru retailers, wholesalers, and advertising agencies, wouldnt it be increased becos the boss find the need to compensate each level of a network?<br><br>so all in all, does cost or price of a product seriously decrease?<br><br>think abt it<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
