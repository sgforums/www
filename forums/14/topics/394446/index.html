              <p>Amway is definitely a legitimate company.</p>
              <p>It has been around for more than 50 years and it has been growing every year in more than 80 countries and territories etc.</p>
              <p>I am not sure how and what methods the others use to promote it.. but definitely the products can be trusted.</p>
              <p>Btw the so-called medicine are not medicine, they are supplements and its currently the top-selling in the world.</p>

              First, you must be clear that "pyramid schemes" ARE NOT MLM!!! Further, they are illegal.
              
              Second, ideas are like the air you breathe . . . . everywhere. To manifest the potential of your market, you must conduct a myriad of studies. When dealing with consumable products there are also many different agencies involved when offering foodstuffs to the public market.
              
              Third - do you have a business plan? Think about your capital and monetization strategies. Many consideration. 
              
              Ideas are only as good as the foundation of its ability to be made a reality.
              
              Wish you success, Genie.
