            <div class='col-md body'>has anyone heard of this company called MRO.?<br><br>a week ago... some telemarketeer called my bf up with an awfully dubious intention...<br><br>telemarketeer: you are cordially invited to the MRO health financial checkup...<br>bf (unsuspectingly) : what is this about?<br>telemarketeer: We will give you a rough status on the current state of your financial health.. and there will be a talk by a very successful entrepreneur.<br>bf (very stupidly): hmm... this sounds great. Count me in.<br><br>after which a few days later, he received a beautifully embossed invitation card. looks pretty much like your typical wedding invitation. The following words were printed on the second page in gold ink:<br><br>MRO FINANCIAL HEALTH CHECKUP<br>80 ANSON ROAD<br>SEE YOU OUTSIDE COFFEE BEAN<br><br>When my bf told me about it... the cynic in me immediately sensed that this was a lowly ploy at work. I mean, why would someone in the world you don't know go through such lengths, from hiring a telemarketeer to printing that card, just to invite you for a talk?<br><br>So i called the telemarketeer up and asked her whether it was anything to do with mlm, direct selling, insurance and the likes of these. Unexpectedly, she said NO. Unconvinced, I told her that we were not coming and then proceeded to cook up an excuse. Still, she pressed on and said...<br><br>telemarketeer: Do you know that if you were to attend this talk, you are entitled to a free gift?<br>I (sounding uninterested): uh-huh.<br>telemarketeer: Tell me what's your name. Let's be friends.<br>I (very plainly) : I'm not interested thanks. I've got something on... got to go. sorry.<br><br>the following day she called my bf again. This led to a quarrel between us.<br>what a nuisance!<br>if she had never called, the preceding events, the quarrel and harrassment, wouldn't have taken place.<br>A few days ago, i saw an AIA advert in the papers about some financial health chekcup... i was wondering if it was the same company?<br><br>Surely there must be some kind of regulation to stop companies from using such low-down tactics to prey on unsuspecting folk like us?</div>
