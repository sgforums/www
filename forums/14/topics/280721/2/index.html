            <div class='col-md body'>heard from my fren who is in SE!! he told me his company is planning to open a theme park in malaysia, just for the members... and they also wan to open up lots more activities for its members...<br><br>problem is, if its just for members, will e.g. theme park be making money?? if profit is taken from the entrance fee of the members, den no point working for a company which is 'helping ' u to earn money, and at the same time take away ur earnings, when u went to their activities EXCLUSIVELY for members rite?<br><br>and if anyone of u heard of this call plan by SE too.. where ur outgoing calls will be converted to incoming calls, as some bill plans like singtel provides a free incoming services... one of my fren bought this plan from SE.. see him everytime make a call also so difficult.. muz press this n tt.. sometime cant even connect.. wad kind of lousy service is this? imagine if u were to be caught in an emergency state... how long wud u take to connect a call via SE call plan, to finally get you out of the situation?? and my SE frem also told me tt some autie and uncles also buy this plan juz to get the rebates, when i told him auntie &amp; uncles rarely make calls... like this, SE might as well stop cuming out with plans like converting outgoing calls... simply juz invest a stupid farking large sum of ur savings to SE, and wait for rebates... no nid to waste time cum out with wad call plans, or insurnace plans... as wad my SE fren told me, SE is intending to provide all-rounder services... summore he inside there hold a wad business marketing manager post..

            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Times expose on SE, raise focus on MLM and other MLM biz in Singapore. Yes, SE ran into problem because they cross over a fine line on its investment schemes. Why does our govt turn a blind to MLM companies pitching a $30 bottle of Vitamin C to its member at $200? Do we have a responsibility to protect un-suspecting consumers or Singaporeans? By allowing them to operate freely in this country, the message is that they are doing it legally. If you wish to be conned into buying over-priced products, it's not my fault.<br><br>So, I think SE did no wrong like any other MLMs operating here. They did their scams in the proper legal manner. Simply fine-tune their scams to fall outside the ambit of MAS, they will do just fine.</div>

OR MLM companies might be giving false description on how they operate... as far as i know.. govt dun allow pyramid scheme to be oeprated in singapore.. and sad to say... MLM are EYEING on ppl who are easily influenced... giving examples of incentives like able to buy a car after a period of time... getting more ppl to join can add on to your earnings ,etc. DID anyone EVER try to persuade a strong-minded person to change his mind, to join MLM? to change his mind to earn lots of money when he dun intend to? if no, FARK MLM.</div>
