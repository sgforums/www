              <p> SUNSHINE Empire generated a revenue of $189 million in just over a
              year, a Deputy Public Prosecutor told a bail court on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor April Phang was giving her reasons why
              prosecution was seeking a high bail of $800,000 for each of the three
              men, Phang Wah, Jackie Hoo and Yong Wai Hong, and $600,00 for Phang's
              wife, Neo Kuon Huay.</p>
              <p>The four were charged on Tuesday morning with various offences under the Penal Code and Companies Act.</p>
              <p>DPP Phang argued that Phang, 49, and Hoo, 29, faced serious
              charges, including criminal breach of trust as an agent amounting to
              almost $1 million.</p>
              <p>The duo are also accused of running a fraudulent business of
              a money circulation scheme involving millions of dollars raised from
              the general public.</p>
              <p>With a mere paid-up capital of $150,000, Sunshine managed to collect $189 million between August 2006 and November 2007.</p>
              <p>Phang's wife's charges of falsifying accounts totalled more
              than $592,896. The 46-year-old also faces one charge of making a false
              declaration amounting to $100,000.</p>
              <p>Yong, 27, is accused of falsely declaring amounts of about
              $1.45 million. The false declarations had given participants the false
              sense that Sunshine's affiliate companies were strong financially, said
              DPP Phang.</p>
              <p>She said Yong, chairman/chief executive officer of a
              Hongkong-listed company known as Emcom International, travelled
              frequently and might choose to remain in Hongkong and not return.</p>
              <p>Mr Subhas Anandan, together with Mr Noor Mohamed Marican,
              argued that $300,000 bail each for Phang and Hoo, $150,000 for Neo, and
              $60,000 for Yong would be sufficient as they had roots in Singapore and
              wanted to stay here to clear their names.</p>
              <p>District Judge John Ng set bail at $600,000 for each of them. Their passports were impounded.</p>
              <p>'The charges against each of the accused person cannot be
              looked at in isolation. The charges are serious in nature and the
              quantum involved is substantial,'' he said.</p>

              <p>Feb 3, 2009<br> 4 charged over MLM scam<br> By Elena Chong<br> FOUR people were hauled to court on Tuesday on charges of being
              involved in a fraudulent investment scheme in connection with the
              controversial multi-level marketing firm Sunshine Empire.<br> Phang Wah, 49, better known as James Phang, his wife, Neo Kuon
              Huay, 46, Jackie Hoo Choon <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cheat</strong></span></span>, 29, and Yong Wai Hong, 27, face
              between six and 20 charges each.<br> <br> The prosecution alleges that Hoo, a director of Sunshine, abetted
              Phang and others to siphon $947,905 from the firm between December
              2006 and August 2007.<br> <br> Both men are said to being party to Sunshine's business when they
              knew it was fraudulently selling prime packages which included
              potential returns.<br> <br> Phang, described as a manager, and Hoo are accused of failing to
              keep accounting and other records for financial year 2007.<br> <br> Phang, who has the most charges, is said to have conspired with his
              wife, Ms Jenny Chan, an accounts clerk, and others to falsify
              accounts involving amounts of $20,000 to $245,000 on six occasions
              between December 2006 and August 2007.<br> <br> Another charge states that he was a director of Empire
              Communication Technology when he authorised someone to falsely
              lodge a return to the Registrar of Companies on May 24, 2006.<br> <br> Phang is also accused of having obscene and uncensored films at his
              Westwood Avenue home on Nov 13, 2007.<br> <br> Yong was charged with six counts of authorising one Ng Chee Tiong
              to falsely lodge returns to the Registrar of Companies that shares
              in the Empire Investment Group, of which he was director, were
              allotted for cash.<br> <br> Mr Subhas Anandan is representing all four, who are claiming
              trial.<br> <br> Bail arguments will be heard later on Tuesday.<br> <br> The cases have been fixed for a pre-trial conference on March
              5.<br> <br> A probe into Sunshine's affairs started in November 2007, two
              months after the company was placed on the investor alert list by
              the Monetary Authority of Singapore.<br> <br> Sunshine was set up by Phang, who says on the company's website
              that he has almost 30 years' experience in retail, sales and
              multinational enterprise building.<br> <br> Sunshine is reported to have attracted 20,000 clients here since it
              was set up in July 2006.</p>

              <p>The only shareholder in Empire Communications is James Phang. The main shareholder of Emcom International is also james Phang. So I wonder on the use of the term.. "Private Group"</p>

              <p>Another man, Sunshine's president (Asia Pacific) Jackie Hoo
                                      Choon Cheat, 29, faced 10 charges including running a fraudulent
                                      business. Two other people, including Phang's wife, also faced
                                      related charges in court yesterday.</p>
              <p>The main charge alleged that the two central figures were
                                      running a Ponzi-like scheme involving many millions of dollars
                                      raised from members of the public.</p>
              <p>In Ponzi schemes, investors are lured to hand over cash on the
                                      promise of high returns - but the returns simply come from funds
                                      pumped in by new investors.</p>
              <p>The charges allege that Sunshine, based at Toa Payoh HDB Hub,
                                      was selling packages which offered returns in the form of cash
                                      rebates. The returns were paid from the proceeds of packages bought
                                      by later Sunshine participants.</p>
              <p>According to Deputy Public Prosecutor April Phang, the revenue
                                      generated by Sunshine, which has a paid-up capital of $150,000,
                                      between August 2006 and November 2007 totalled $189 million.</p>
              <p>It is believed that many investors have their money stuck with
                                      the company and it is unclear whether they can get it back in
                                      full.</p>
              <p>Phang and Hoo also faced charges of failing to maintain proper
                                      accounts.</p>
              <p>The criminal breach of trust charges involve nearly $1 million.
                                      Criminal breach of trust takes place when an offender has the
                                      responsibility of holding money or assets on behalf of others but
                                      misuses the funds by using them for other purposes. The maximum
                                      penalty is life imprisonment, along with possible fines.</p>
              <p>In addition, Phang faced six charges of falsifying accounts and
                                      two related to possessing obscene films. Phang's wife, Neo Kuon
                                      Huay, 46, was charged with falsifying accounts in relation to sums
                                      exceeding $592,800.</p>
              <p>A director of Empire Investment Group, Yong Wai Hong, 27, was
                                      charged with making false declarations involving $1.45 million.
                                      This had allegedly given Sunshine participants the false sense that
                                      its affiliated firms have strong financial standing.</p>
              <p>Yong is also chairman and chief executive of a Hong Kong-listed
                                      firm Emcom International, which was acquired using Sunshine's sale
                                      proceeds.</p>
              <p>The prosecutor, Ms Phang, added that the bulk of Phang and Neo's
                                      assets are in Hong Kong bank accounts.</p>
              <p>Three of the accused, apart from Yong, were arrested on Monday
                                      afternoon and spent that night in remand. Yong was on police bail
                                      then.</p>
              <p>Ms Phang stated that all four are considered a 'high flight
                                      risk' as CAD has information that they are involved in some
                                      business in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Their passports were impounded and bail was set at $600,000 for
                                      each of them. Last evening, they were released on bail and were
                                      driven away in a convoy of Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs.</p>
              <p>They were represented by lawyers Noor Mohamed Marican and Subhas
                                      Anandan.</p>
              <p>Phang, who has four children aged 15 to 23, was addressed as
                                      'Lao Da' ('chief' in Mandarin) as he got into his car.</p>
              <p>The Empire Group Alliance, a group spanning several Asian
                                      countries, was set up in 2003. It claimed to have interests in
                                      network marketing, entertainment, energy, real estate and
                                      telecommunications.</p>

              Despite initial scepticisms,
              the 61-year-old told Today she was swayed by the convincing seminars
              and awestruck by the lavish furnishings at the companyâsToa Payoh Hub
              headquarters.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              âIt was always very crowded and you could always see a lot of cash being handled at the counters,â she said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              In July that year, Mdm Wong
              bought two âgold packagesâ worth over $11,000 each. Unknown to her
              husband, she terminated her insurance policies and closed her fixed
              deposit accounts to take up another four gold packages later, with some
              of the money coming from his savings.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              She also sold packages to her
              friends and siblings, some of whom took out loans to buy into the
              scheme, which required investors to purchase Sunshineâs gold packages
              involving the trading of online goods, such as health supplements in
              return for hefty cash rebates.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              MLM companies, which are legal
              in Singapore,let people pay cash for the right to market productsto
              others. Those involved are also paid for recruiting marketers.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Another client, Mr Goh Choon Seng, had a similar story to tell â he bought one âgold packageâ in September 2007.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Both Mdm Wong and Mr Goh saw
              returns on their investments initially, but these stopped abruptly in
              October that year after the Criminal Affairs Department steppedin to
              investigate the company over concerns thatSunshine was acting as an
              investment fund withoutproper authorisation.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Sunshine is part of the Empire
              Group Alliance. On Tuesday, its founder and international president
              James Phang Wah, 49, was among four people charged in court for alleged
              criminal breach of trust and falsifying accounts, among other offences.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              As the case is heard in the
              courts, Madam Wong said: âI really donât know what to do, Iâm very sad
              over the affair as Iâve even dragged my siblings into it.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              âI have tried asking my âuplineâ but he doesnât seem to have answers.â
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Neither does she have answers for those âdownlineâ.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              An âuplineâ is the person who recruited her into the scheme, while those âdownlineâ are the ones she roped into the programme.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              The companyâs office at Toa
              Payoh was empty when Today visited yesterday. Set up in July 2006,
              Sunshine Empire had reportedly attracted 20,000 people as ofOctober
              2007, when the Monetary Authority of Singapore put the company on its
              Investor Alert List.

              <h2><span class="mw-headline">YouTube Video</span></h2>
              <p>A controversial video titled '<strong>Sunshine Empire Car Achievers 2007'</strong> was uploaded onto <a class="mw-redirect" title="Youtube" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube">Youtube</a> on October 09, 2008<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Empire#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>. The video was categorized as <a title="Comedy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy">Comedy</a> by the owner 'mlmgod'<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Empire#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> who also indicated that the video is 'Back online, due to popular
              demand...' The video has a unnamed narrator introducing the video in
              mandarin. The opening shot shows a BMW car that is registered as '<strong>SGT 8554C'</strong> being driven. 17 Sunshine Empire Merchants were subsequently introduced
              with their vehicle and each Merchant had a short 'thank you' speech in
              mandarin except Andrew Boo, Ho Ming Jie, 22, Tan Yuan Jie, 23. A
              Volkswagon Beetle was also seen and linked to Loy Mei Khay, 24 the
              first female to appear in the video who also thanked 'Mr Jackie'. A BMW
              Z4 linked to Xu Jia Yuan was not seen clearly in the video and a
              Mercedes Benz linked to Sally Cheng &amp; Goh Tiam Hai was also not
              seen. The second last closing shot shows a BMW car that is registered '<strong>SFX 4086D'</strong> being driven along roads in <a title="Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>.
              The video end with the Logo of Sunshine Empire being shown. No specific
              details were given by the 17 merchants on how they attained or achieved
              their car, their roles or position in Sunshine Empire were also not
              given. The video has a total view of 5783 as of February 2009. It is
              notable that for those appearing in the video, that the first person
              practically all of the recipients professed their gratitude to, was
              James Phang with only a few exceptions. The method of addressing him as
              "Lao Da" were existent in the days of James' earlier MLM incarnation <a class="new" title="Number One Product (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Number_One_Product&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">NOP</a>, which folded up in 2001.<br></p>
