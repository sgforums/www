            <div class='col-md body'>Constructive post #2:<br>2nd lesson <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Money Work For You?</span><br><br>First I want to talk about Saving to Build Wealth, it emphasize on getting interest from the bank, and we doesn't need to do anything but just to accumulate wealth. They claimed money is working for them, why?<br><br>We call them investment. Investment includes mutual funds, real estate, etc. something which you doesn't need to go around and <strong>beg others</strong>.<br><br>NTI profile had something call HEART, I forgot E &amp; A (not worth to remember anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br>So the rest is:<br>H - Health (They said this can be archieved by aromatherapy, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> what kind of crap is that? You lazy bums only sit in the void deck all day long and grow fat)<br>E - ???<br>A - ???<br>R - Relationship (The relationship here mean the pyramid structure you had built, making use of your relatives/friends' trust)<br>and you will get T - Treasure<br><br>So if you get HEART, money will actually work for you? They are talking about using other people's time(OPT) to earn money.<br><br>Other people's time isn't that your downline's time? So your upline is using you to earn money, his upline is using him to earn money and so on. From this point, we can't talk about stable income. It is purely profit-base marketing.<br><br>If you talking about money work for you, you can get a stable and 100% return. For NTI pyramid scheme, if your downline is not earning, your leg is not balanced or you doesn't have downline, where is the money to work for you?<br><br>Another important point. Money work for you includes recycling of money, a great knowledge about economy, using your interest/profits to making more money. From NTI schemes, it is purely playing money game.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Furthermore, they just like their downlines to open more account for them instead of getting their prospect outside.<br><br>Lastly, if they are really making money to work for them, why on earth they need to run around like jerks pestering/begging/threatening/pressuring people to join NTI?<span style="font-style: italic;"> Only salesman do that  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So taking Robert Kiyosaki - Cashflow quadrant as a comparision, are NTIers a ...<br>Investor?

So I pose this question to them: If you really believe so much in NTI, please prove it and QUIT your studies and attend NTI's courses and QUIT your current job. Its your gateway to financial freedom isn't it? Until the day you devote all your time to NTI and give up every other avenue of money making, there is some part of you deep down that knows something is wrong and you are planning for your NTI foray to fail.</div>
