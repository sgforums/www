            <div class='col-md body'>Its sad that someone still believes so strongly in ideas that are this flawed. Even communists adapt with the times. Its even worse when the English is barely intelligible. I don't usually post long posts and I don't even like posting much at all as I prefer reading, to post less than 100 posts in 4 years must mean something right?<br><br>Firstly, I'd like to state that I have not lost any money to NTI so my only wish when the people inside NTI finally realise what they are doing is that they will kindly refund all the money they have made out of the victims and find something more legitimate to do. Also, by posting here, I aim to raise awareness of such schemes and their potential pitfalls.<br><br>Secondly, how sure are you I am not as rich as James Phang and Jacky Hoo? Its quite easy to be richer than people who have taken large loans and might or have been made made bankrupt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You posted a few months back? Why did you only register a few days ago? Cloning isn't a particularly nice thing to do. It is because we understand this "trade" so well that we choose not and advise people not to participate. Are you comparing your company to cigarettes? Well, both are similar in a way that the money you invest goes up in flames but at least cigarettes give you some mental relief. One gives cancer of the body and the other is the stem of a cancer of society.<br><br>You accuse us of stealing your dreams. That is precisely what it is. A pipe dream that we are trying to wake you from. Informers? The people that provide us with the info are probably much higher up the pyramid than you are and hence know better than you. Greed festers in you and hence you feel so strongly about NTI as you have not earned back your initial investment and feel that due to this forums, you find difficulty recruiting new members. Interesting note is that you posted 11 $ in your post, perhaps something to do with your subconscious mind seeking catharsis?<br><br>It is zealots like you with weird analogies that don't make sense that amuses and amazes me. Go back to school, find a decent career. There aren't shortcuts to life and what you "learnt" in NTI can be learnt in a much more efficient way elsewhere, either in school or when you start working in a decent job. Take a break from NTI and do some research on it yourself. Your own discoveries will astonish you.</div>

If he bankrupt due to this loan, dont you think that is stupid?</span><br><br><span style="color: orange;">Secondly, if people left NTI and said NTI is bad, that means its really SUX!!! Why other people left other company (such as Amway, ForeverLiving, Enken and etc), and they dont badmouth their ex-company until so bad? Have you ever asked yourself?</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">Thirdly, yes!!! we are!!! But are you? Please lah!!! Have you really help your friends who joined you as what you promised?</span><br><br><span style="color: cyan;">Fourthly, there are more than 60,000 people in singapore who followed JP last time? So why only a few of you guys follow him, why not the majority? Is it because all of them are stupid and a few of you are smart? If you guys r smart, then y alan mok lose so much money in setting up EPI after believing JP will help him? Why that "Look Smart But Stupid" idiot, Jackie Hoo, being make use to take loan for JP?</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Lastly, Ya sure, NTI only teaches you how to con your friend to the company and let your friend being con by your so-called successful managers (earning less than a cleaner)? Isnt that what they teach you?<br><br>Greed? Pls lah... In order to earn back your money, you have to recruit your friends as your downlines, and ask them to do the same thing, right? You have to promise them that you will help them to earn back their money, right? Most of you guys joined is because of the marvelous things they told you and the money they showed you thru the plan. Am i right?<br>One more Question, who is not greedy in this world? If not, why are there so many people queueing up to buy 4D/Toto? Why so many people invest in SGX?<br><br>Just for your info, there might be a lot of company make it BIG oversea but not in singapore, but the fact is they still earning a lot of money thru the oversea markets. BUT NTI? Hmmm... BIG in singapore? Going expansion with a bunch of young and naive monkeys?</span><br><br>And yes, please brush up your english!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>once my friend brought me there, at that time i was already thinking if it was pyramid sales but i didnt say much... he said he was introducing a job to me that would earn alot... but didnt want to tell me much, just kept on bugging me to go down. We had another friend, and i asked him if that guy was going down as well, he replied, "Oh he cant make it today, he got a project going on'. I didnt think he was lying and went down.<br><br>they asked me to wait for their 'respected' senior... sit must sit properly and off handphone.. waited for a while, a 17-18 year old kid wearing suit and tissot watch came over.. he was talking alot of things which sounded cool but i knew it was all bullshit to make mlm sounds nicer<br><br>example (1) you know why bill gates quit harvard can still be so successful? cos he know how to pursue higher learning. here at NTI, we provide you with higher learning. We have courses for you to help you develop your potential<br><br>(in other words, courses to brainwash us and 'develop our potential' - join so that they can earn our $. What has it got to do with bill gates - just want to make us think of him because he's so filthy rich)<br><br>example (2) we are very nice people. if i can earn, i want to help you earn also.<br><br>(talk like they really intent on helping us, but just want us to join so that they can earn from our joining)<br><br>actually i was gona sign up cos at that point in time, i hadn't read up much about MLM, but i've just paid my instalments for my stuffs, so didnt had that much cash with me so i told my friend (sadly, not for now hehe) that i would come back the next day.<br><br>and he acted very nice. "okay, i'll get back to you.. but remember you are my friend that's why i introduce this to you. you must sign with me faster, then your earnings will be higher.. if other people sign with me, you will be lower down the chain and i really want to help you earn more"<br><br>this kind of friend.. know him for so long, still wanted to cheat a newbie in me. MLM destroys friendships and workman professionalism. It promotes laziness in people and induces a mindset in them that they can earn much more when doing nothing as compared to people who works hard and earn peanuts.<br><br>Why will I say it destroys friendships? Because I called that other friend of mine the next day and he said he knew what the other friend was doing all along and he had told him he wasnt interested, thats why he didnt go down. And not because he had a project to do.<br><br>Imagine a person coming up with such a lie just to get a friend to help him earn.</div>

I believe he lied to you because he was "taught" that way, or he too is unsure of what he's doing, lack the confidence... and he feared rejection from you after having being rejected by your friend..<br><br>Yes, he made a mistake but I don't think it's worth breaking your friendship over this..
