            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I just left NTI. Its because whatever they promised are all bullshit. Their courses are to brainwash the young and naive people like me. The products i redeem 2 months ago, not yet here. Those managers in NTI, are not earning much money and some even dont earn a single cent. All they know is "FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.<br><br>After 3 months in NTI, i found that it was a waste of time and money. I got a lot of friends and relatives lost trust in me. My girlfriend and my best friend (8 years friend) even quarrelled with me. Its like almost the whole world is against me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I do have a few friends who trusted me and joined me. Some of them left before me and said that im a cheater. Some of them left with me and now they dont even want to talk to me anymore. I felt guilty for asking my friends to join me and cant help them to earn back their money. I hope they can give me a chance and apologise to them personally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>And as for my own money, i only earn back 20% of what i put in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>What i want to say is dont trust them, dont join them and dont be one of them. NO FUTURE! You cant be an entrepreneur in that kind of environment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't speak for other MLM companies but I assure you NTI is probably the model of the worst kind of MLM you should join. By the way, it is your ENTITLEMENT to see the true earnings of the people who introduce you to the company. Hearing their claims is not enough, they must show you their tax returns, not their payslip. On your request, they must produce the mean, median and average income of their distributors to substantiate their claim. If not they are violating the MLM law.</div>
