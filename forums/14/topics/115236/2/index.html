U people wanna MLM, fine, but the one main reason YOU MLMers need to talk other people into joining MLM is that YOU wouldn't be earning enough $ otherwise. That is the fact, and don't deny it.</div></blockquote>You have dreams.  Ok.  Fine.  It's good to have dreams.<br>But nobody is stopping you to have dreams.  Neither does anybody here force you into anything.  At least I don't see that (If I am wrong, pls point out to me ) .  Here I only see non-MLMers talking MLMers out of their business.<br><br>And to correct you, MLMers don't make as much money when they recruit.  Recruitment takes up a lot of time and also means that the individual MLMer will have to share the profit with his/her downline.  Hence, they make more by retailing.  That's why not all MLMers recruit.  Many are just as happy doing just retailing the product.  <span style="color: red;">This is one of the reasons why MLM is not Pyramid.</span></div>
