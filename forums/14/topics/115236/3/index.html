Then he will be taken aback and u can continue on... The most important thing is to make sure u answer him in unexpected manners n keep talking so he will feel confused n gong gong... once u can get him down to our office, we will surely be able to get him to join..."<br><br>*** and after you join and pay up, you will get very unexpected results too, i promise ***<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
