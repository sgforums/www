(newater) undesirable contaminants such as chlorine and nitrates are filtered out by a semi-permeable membrane. with such high quality of water in the future, singaporeans need not fret over the presence of chlorine or fluoride in our water -- when that happens, appliances such as filters designed for the purpose of water purification will be rendered obsolete.<br></div>

If it does, a dip in the local swimming pool will render you sparkling free of germs. Chlorine is not advisable to be associated to the human body in large quantity (breathing in Chlorine fumes can kill), hence only traces of it in our pipes. However, the most prominant marketing tactics I have seen for some of the water filtration (such as diamond water) is the talk about metals that are dissolved in our local tap water.<br><br>Filtration does have a certain amount of success but never can one claim 100%. Why? Because they wouldn't dare. The moment water is exposed to air, bacteria will invade.<br><br>But some don't care and will continue drinking boiled or tap water. Some will be more concerned. It is the same concept as those who ate in moderation and estimation and those who count every calories they eat.<br><br>Both are not wrong.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woo... seems like there is a heated argument here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Here's my personal view on this issue. Health is a very objective issue, some people see it as impt some don't.. Why? Because maybe say eating vitamins or drinking better quality water seldom let you see too much short term effect, it's the long term effect on your health. So if you don't get any sickness you probably attribute to all these factors. If you do not believe these health issues, it's when you get the sickness then you will realise that. However, there is no guarantee that if you don't live healthy you will get a lot of sickness. For instance, some ppl smoke for so many many years yet they still live till very old. Health issues are like prevention, it's up to you to determine it's value. But one thing is that health is really impt, more than anything else. So probably we don't gamble with our health.<br><br>PUB water is definitely safe and safer than a lot of countries, bar some rusty pipes here and there. Small amt of chlorine won't kill i have to agree. But the main problem i feel is when ppl boil tapwater. They boil water to kill off harmful bateria but they can only be eliminated if you boil for ard 30 mins, so in actual fact ppl are doing the wrong thing if they boil for a while, it won't eliminate the bateria. Not only that, the small amt of chlorine inside when boiled will contribute to some harmful substances known to cause cancer. Thus drink tapwater is safer than drinking boiled tapwater!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Many people don't realise that.<br><br>So what's harmful in PUB tapwater? I suppose the amt of chlorine is still ok, if you don't boil the water. There are some harmful bacteria and maybe some lead or harmful metal compounds from rusty pipes. Singapore water is considered safe, thus you won't see the result of a good water filter system immediately, not like countries where the water from the tap is yellow in colour..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> , that you can obviously feel the difference with a filter.<br><br>Water through a water filter definitely has it's benefits, this i think everyone has to agree, but to some it might not be totally essential, so i term it was more of a prevention. Though i am selling water treatment system too, i don't tell people if you drink tapwater you will get this get that get cancer, as if implying that tapwater in singapore is reli safe. But i share with them what the water treatment system can do for them and how it can benefit them. Outright claiming that drinking singapore tapwater is unsafe is unacceptable, but telling other ppl drinking treated water is better than just drinking normal tapwater is perfectly acceptable!<br><br>Health is the most impt thing, and it's within our hands. It's up to individual to realise it's impt. Some might really don't realise it till they suffer from a major illness. Then again, it's ppl's own choice. We are just here to share with them what we think is beneficial to them, educate them on some knowledge.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by marineman:</div><div class="quote_body">.<br>.<br>PUB water is definitely safe and safer than a lot of countries, bar some rusty pipes here and there. Small amt of chlorine won't kill i have to agree. But the main problem i feel is when ppl boil tapwater. They boil water to kill off harmful bateria but they can only be eliminated if you boil for ard 30 mins, so in actual fact ppl are doing the wrong thing if they boil for a while, it won't eliminate the bateria. Not only that, the small amt of chlorine inside when boiled will contribute to some harmful substances known to cause cancer. Thus drink tapwater is safer than drinking boiled tapwater!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Many people don't realise that.<br><br>So what's harmful in PUB tapwater? I suppose the amt of chlorine is still ok, if you don't boil the water. There are some harmful bacteria and maybe some lead or harmful metal compounds from rusty pipes. Singapore water is considered safe, thus you won't see the result of a good water filter system immediately, not like countries where the water from the tap is yellow in colour..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> , that you can obviously feel the difference with a filter.<br>.<br>.<br>Hope everyone here can have a peaceful discussion, wish all good health and success!</div></blockquote>I think there is flaw in your reasoning that the small amount of chlorine inside tap water when boiled will contribute to some harmful substances known to cause cancer.<br><br>This is not proven and not a fact.  If it is a fact then people should not drink coffee, tea or for that matter any beverage which are made by boiling tap water.  All coffee shops in Singapore should close down then.<br><br>May be we should get our fact right in the first place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  There are indeed proves and reports, some newspaper report citing the possibilities of that but i stress again, the proportion is small. It does contribute to cancer causing materials but it's not that much till if you drink everyday you surely will get cancer that kind. It will contribute plus maybe some other factors like smoking then you will get cancer.<br><br>It's like doctor saying smoking can cause cancer. Do you believe? Yes we do but there are instances that ppl smoke for 40 to 50 years but yet they don't have cancer and live to a ripe old age. Things are not totally 100% i have to say, it's just like a prevention, you might not really see the result but every bit and part adds up till one day ur body fails. So i think it's more of a subjective issue here. As ppl nowadays are more conscious abt their health, they will start to look into the benefits of good water quality. It's just like many years back ppl seldom take vitamins and health products yet ppl also survive till now and living happily then why do ppl nowadays take these products? That's because they have more knowledge and they decided themselves that their health is of importance that's why they do it.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.<br><br>If you need i can find the article and send to you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's the part on Chlorination from the paper...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The Risks of Chlorination<br>Chlorine is an element widely used in modern chemistry be cause it readily reacts with so many substances. The vast majority of public water systems in this country use chlorine to disinfect their drinking water. But the widespread application of chlorine as a drinking water disinfecting agent has raised concerns about the risk of human exposure to chlorine and its by-products. Past experience with chlorine based compounds such as DDT, PCBs, and CFCs, which were later found to pose risks to health and the environment, have encouraged some environmental groups to call for a total ban on all uses of chlorine, rather than waiting to study each use of chlorine and its potential alternatives (Amato 1993).<br><br>Chlorine is toxic not just to microbes but to humans as well. Chlorine gas escaping at the treatment plant can cause acute health effects in workers, since the chemical is highly irritant to the eyes, nasal passages, and respiratory system. Inhalation of the gas can prove fatal at concentrations as low as 0.1% by volume (1,000 ppm) (AWWA 1984). At the minute amounts used in drinking water, however, the acute toxicity of chlorine is quite low. It is rather the potential long term risk of cancer from chronic exposure to moderate amounts of chlorine that is the major concern with the chemical in the drinking water supply. Much of the cancer risk from chlorine stems from the class of complex chloroorganic compounds, known as trihalomethanes (THMs), that are formed as one of the major by products of the chlorination process. Trihalomethanes are formed when chlorine is added to water containing organic materials, such as the humic and fulvic acids emitted from decomposing plant and animal materials in the water supply (Rook 1974; Bellar et al. 1974). Although THMs occur with chlorination of both surface and ground waters, their concentration is much greater with surface water because of its higher levels of naturally occurring organic materials.<br><br>Of particular concern among the THMs is chloroform, the most prevalent and thoroughly studied member of the THM group. Ingestion of chloroform has been associated with an increased incidence of cancerous tumors in multiple laboratory animal bioassays. These tumors occurred at several sites, most notably in the kidney and liver, as well as across several different species and strains of animals (National Cancer Institute 1976; Roe et al. 1979) (see Table 7.1). Although many of the animal studies focused on chloroform administered in corn oil or toothpaste, others also found increased evidence of tumors when the chloroform was administered in drinking water (Jorgenson et al. 1985).<br><br>Using the mouse liver tumor data (NCI 1976), the EPA originally estimated an upper-bound cancer risk--that is, a worst-case analysis--that indicated that the lifetime risk from exposure to chloroform could reach as high as one cancer per 2,500 members of the population exposed (EPA 1977). On the basis of this analysis, the agency began to regulate chloroform and other THMs in 1979, setting a "maximum contaminant level" of 0.10 milligrams per liter (or 100 parts per billion) for total trihalomethanes in the drinking water supply. The incremental lifetime cancer risk from ingesting chloroform in household water at this level has been estimated to be about two in 100,000 (Maxwell et al. 1991). In other words, if 200 million people drank household water at EPA's maximum chloroform level for their entire lives, about 4,000 would die of chloroform induced cancer.<br>Chloroform is not the only by-product formed in the chlorination process that has been subjected to animal toxicity testing. Other major trihalomethanes, as well as trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, various haloacetonitriles, and chlorophenols have been reported to show carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or other toxic properties (Cotruvo and Regelski 1989; Simmon and Tardiff 1978; Herren-Freund et al. 1987; Bull 1982). For other by-products, however, such as various chlorinated acids, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones, there is limited information on their potential toxic effects (Cotruvo and Regelski 1989). There is also a plethora of nonvolatile byproducts formed in the chlorination process for which there are limited data on toxicity and other effects (NAS 1987). Identifying and testing these substances has been a relatively slow process, and much work is continuing in this area (Bull 1982).<br><br>In humans, chlorinated water has been associated with an increased risk of bladder, colon, and rectal cancer in multiple epidemiological studies (Crump and Guess 1982; Williamson 1981). These studies, in general, have found the risks of bladder, colon, and rectal cancer associated with drinking chlorinated water to be about 1.1 to 2.0 times higher than the risk for drinking the same quantity of unchlorinated water (Crump and Guess 1982). The aggregate cancer risk from drinking chlorinated water over a lifetime, however, remains modest.<br><br>One of the studies finding a significant positive association, the large case control work by Cantor and colleagues (1987), suggests that lifetime consumption of chlorinated water in creases the risk of bladder cancer by a factor of about two. The study compared those residing for more than forty years in communities where drinking water was chlorinated with those who drink unchlorinated water. This association may result in about 1,000 to 3,000 excess bladder cancers per year in the United States and could explain as much as 25 to 30 percent of the occurrence of bladder cancer in adults residing in chlorinated communities (Cantor et al. 1987).<br><br>As with many epidemiological studies, however, there are numerous problems with the studies of chlorinated water. Multiple uncontrolled confounding factors (for example, smoking, diet, occupation, lifestyle) could also explain part or all of the observed cancer rates. Inexactness in measuring the chlorine level, water consumption, population migration, and other variables detracts from the definitiveness of the estimated association. Also, because much of the nation's water is chlorinated, the number of individuals who can serve as study controls those who drink unchlorinated water-is limited. Taken together, however, these studies have been interpreted as suggesting a significant association of bladder, colon, and rectal cancer with chlorinated drinking water (EPA 1985). This risk is highest in drinking water contaminated with organic material, but, given the myriad by-products formed in the chlorination process, any of a number of substances or combination of substances could be involved.<br><br>Additional health effects from chlorine have also been revealed in human studies. Of particular interest is a suggested relationship between consumption of chlorinated water and an increase in the total serum cholesterol levels of populations suffering from a diet deficient in calcium. While the increase in cholesterol levels was found to be small, it suggests that consumption of chlorinated water could be a possible risk factor for cardiovascular disease as well as for cancer (Wones et al. 1989; Zeighami et al. 1990).<br><br>Ingestion is not the only route of exposure to these substances in drinking water. There may also be adverse effects from inhalation or dermal exposure during showering, bathing, or swimming. It has been postulated, for example, that exposure to volatile chemicals in drinking water through inhalation may be as large or even larger than exposure from ingestion alone (Maxwell et al. 1991; McKone 1987).<br><br>As with most suspected carcinogens, the adverse health effects associated with chlorine by-products are largely chronic, cumulative, and may involve a long latency period before they appear. The health risks are estimated assuming a constant exposure of many years or often many decades. It may also be several decades before any adverse effects, such as excess cases of cancer, become apparent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
