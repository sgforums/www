            <div class='col-md body'>I quote:  The Straits Times- Friday Â– FORUM Â– 28 Jan 05<br><br>Water quality is tops, so is more filtration needed?<br><br>I refer to the article, Â“Water quality here is world-classÂ” (ST, Jan 26).<br><br>I would like the authorities to go further and explain in details just how good is world-class quality water, for example, the water impact on health, and the substances and chemicals (if any) found in our tap water.<br><br>In so doing, I hope to have conclusive proof that our tap water is safe for drinking straight from the tap without further filtration or purification.<br><br><strong>This is to rebut claims by vendors of household water-filtration systems that water from household taps is Â“not clean enoughÂ” for consumption and requires after-market treatment.  In addition, some systems also ionize water Â“for better healthÂ”.</strong><br><br>No one should be prevented from making an honest living, but if pseudo-scientific claims are passed off as facts, consumers are at risk of being led into making frivolous purchases.<br><br>I hope the study done by the PUB panel of experts will shed light on the quality of tap water for consumption.<br><br>Alvin Tan Kia Seng<br>-----------------------<br>Do not buy the idea from MLM that water is not good enough from the tap and further filtration or treatment is needed.  You are only going to spend unnecessarily.  For me, the most is boil it to get hot water for making my cup of tea.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me reiterate my last point with key evidence.<br><br>Contaminated water from our pipes are not as harmful as what some people say, since spring water isn't any better.<br><br>It is only when corrosion takes place, where the copper oxides get diluted into water when consuming it becomes deadly.<br><br>I believe there are more scientists who calculated the likelihood of built-up stress caused to the kidneys by tap water versus alcohol.<br><br>Get it?

The quality of water of new development can varies also (because the pipes still not fully flushes out and stabilize or whatever).  This is a maintenance issue.<br><br>As to the high cancer rate, they are better explanation.  I believe he highest factor on the list affecting cancer rate is the level of stress experienced by the population, not the content of chlorine in the water.<br><br>PUB will reply?  Not sure because the issue raised in ST Forums is very difficult to explain in layman terms.  LOL.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
