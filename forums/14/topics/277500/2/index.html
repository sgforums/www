He also introduced Anthony to Mr Chen's wife.<br><br>Said Mr Chew: 'I believed Anthony as he said he had invested in the fund for two years. He assured me the fund was stable and the returns are guaranteed.<br><br>'Also, Anthony looked like he was successful. He dressed well and drove a Mercedes Benz.<br><br>'He told me that over $1 million was placed in the fund through him by various people.'<br><br>PROMISED RETURNS<br><br>Mr Chew began with a first deposit of $1,648 in March last year, with promised returns of 15 per cent a month.<br><br>In April, Anthony told him the returns would go up to 25 per cent, but only if he put in more money.<br><br>So Mr Chew invested another $11,146.<br><br>However, he suspected something was amiss when the SwissCash website was no longer accessible in mid-August.<br><br>When asked, Anthony told Mr Chew to wait for a few days as the server was down.<br><br>Then, the monthly payouts stopped and Anthony gave Mr Chew one excuse after another.<br><br>Mr Chew filed a police report in October.<br><br>Last month, The New Paper reported that music teacher G Joseph, 59, lost about $1,500 after putting US$2,000 ($2,700) into SwissCash.<br><br>In 2006, two Malaysian datuks and six others were placed in remand by Malaysian authorities.
