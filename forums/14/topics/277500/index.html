He has now lost US$1,000.<br><br>He said he found out about SwissCash last November when a man named Alfred called him and invited him to attend a seminar.<br><br>Mr Joseph believes the people behind the scheme could have got his number from newspaper advertisements for his music lessons.<br><br>The seminar, he said, was conducted last year in a building in Geylang by a man named Kenneth.<br><br>Mr Joseph said: 'Kenneth joined the fund for a year and he said he got back his principal sum.'<br><br>He added that at the seminar, 'there were people who talked about how they have been receiving money every month'.<br><br>'I was even given a nice book to show how the scheme works.

I would get back the outstanding interest payments then. October came and went but I received nothing at all.'<br><br>He contacted Alfred and Kenneth but the men claimed that they do not know anything.<br><br>Mr Joseph, whose monthly income is about $2,500, realised he could have been cheated after he submitted a form online confirming he was an investor.<br><br>But he didn't get any money even after that.<br><br>He said: 'I didn't know this would happen.
