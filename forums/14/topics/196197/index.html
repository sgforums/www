            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am repeating the message here as I don't know which is the appropriate forum:<br><br>Sometime next month, a Company selling the French fragrance products by the name of Lampe Berger will be holding a grand seminar in Sentosa Island to revive their business in Singapore.(note, this time they change the name to SYN(Steven Yeam Network) to give it a fresh start.<br><br>They have successfully revived their business in Malaysia targeting on young students and graduates. Recently a few Malaysian newspapers have published complaints by parents about how their children got brainwashed by them and refused to listen from their parents and some even thought of leaving school to go full time in the business. Today's(June 18th) Malaysia China Press have a front page headline news about it. Such news will not affect their business but even helped and motivate their distributors who are all young, naive and rebellious to work harder for it.<br><br>They are organising more than 1,000 active young Malaysian agents to come to Singapore together next month to revive their Singapore sales by recruiting younsters. If you have any young adults in your family or young friends, caution them ahead. These are some of their tricks used in recruitment:<br><br>a) They will never tell the prospects what products they are selling during the 1st or 2nd business preview. The most they mentioned are "branded goods from France" and the name "LV"<br>b) They will say products are not important but making money and business is the main aim.<br>c) A fleet of BMWs and sport cars will be driven and pareked together to impress the prospects.<br>d) They will remind their prospects NOT to tell anyone else until they have joined and paid up because outsiders will not understand their business and tend to give negative effects.<br>e) If anyone tell them they heard negative feedback from outsiders or any ex-members who left, they will say, "who should you learn from ? The successful ones like us or those failure ones ?"<br>f) When it come to the products, they will only boost of their over 100 years history in France but they will not tell you that in US and Europe, they are sold as fragrance and perfumes only(check the websites) at only 1/3 of the prices here and NOT as essential oils or aromatherapy products claimed by them.<br>g) They will use a lot of their successfuyl members all well dressed in suits to impress their prospects but they will not tell you that out of every 1 successful, at least another 50 have lost their money and left.<br>h) They will not tell you the products are simply unpractical and troublesome to use. In fact a check in the websites showed the product is even dangerous. An explosion occured and someone in Taiwan got killed. HK TVB news also made a research and condemned them for cheating but their Company defended by telling their members that HK TVBS already "apologised" to them for the mistake and they forgave them.<br>i) They will also tell you that some of their fragrance bottles are collectors' items and can appreciate like antiques in future. In order to make you believe, they even display a few units for bidding and obviously their insiders and top-earners will jack up the price to make it believable.<br>j) They will tell you that you can get a refund up to 90% if you decide to return the unsold stock but most people managed to get back less than half because MOST items are not returnable. They will not tell you fully all which items are not refundable. Most people got caught and lost money because of this trap.<br>k) They even have lawyers and well-known people among them to give business talk so people tend to believe them easily and don't suspect that they have many "hidden" clauses in their contract.<br>l) Their business plan is designed in a manner to trick you to purchase the stock in someone else's name(for easier promotion) so that when it comes to return and refund, you will not be able to do it conveniently.<br>m) They will use their top-earner, a Malaysian by the name of Steven Yeam who is mostly based in HK now to act like a god or cult figure so that more people will adore and follow him blindly.<br>n) Once you joined, they will have many ways to make you pay more money. Even attending their talk or training, you need to pay. They will not tell you when they invite you. Upon arriving or halfway, they will make you pay.<br>o) They will make some big donation to some place and make a big publicity out of it to gain support and confidence from the public.<br>p) They use very high figures and discounts to attract you to buy more stock. Up to as much as 40%. Most people find it diffiult to sell off later.<br>q) They use lies to motivate their members and prospects. Some examples used are: "They will get listed soon in Malaysia""They will get the Singapore government to close Orchard Road for their rally and also loan them 20 helicopters to sentosa Island""They bought some share or joint-venture with Louis Vuitton in France", etc.<br><br>They will have a lot of new tricks and tactics to close a deal and those mentioned above are just a few. So do not underestimate them. Please take it seriously and if you have any friends, please e-mail or inform them with this message before they are victimised. Last I heard of, their Singapire office is in Beach Road but they might have changed now.<br><br>Please caution everyone and anyone who find this message useful, please help to circulate or link it to other forums.<br><br>Thank you for your attention.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, do not trust MLM where they like to change their name a lot.<br><br>This is prolly due to the bad reputation they had built previously. The drop out rate is obviously a lot, and profit wise is bad. You are earning less than 5% when each product is sold.<br><br>Another MLM to take note is NTI.
