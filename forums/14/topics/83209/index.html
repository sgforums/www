            <div class='col-md body'>SkyBiz Leaders John Van Deurzen &amp; Greg Stewart Present<br>1CellNet.com<br>Early Warnings from Down Under<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A New SkyBiz?<br><br>"Make sure to join as an affiliate at the $199 level."<br>(In SkyBiz.com, this was known as the "Tripod"...)<br><br>E-mail received at the WWSN:<br>"In case you haven't noticed there is a new "Skybiz" out now. It's called 1cellnet.com. They are offering smoke and mirrors crapola just so that they can sell you 3 binary positions just like Skybiz. In fact I understand that all the top earners in Skybiz are in on this deal.<br><br>Our Program is designed to help more people, make more money... faster!<br><br>To secure your permanent position in the iChatGlobal/1CellNet powerline, you simply purchase the 1CellNet Affiliate package for $199, or the Consultant package for $99.<br><br>When you come in at the Affiliate level you will be assigned 3 business centers that can earn you up to $50,000 per week.<br><br>If you come in at the Consultant level you will receive 1 business center that can earn you up to $20,000 a week!<br><br>The 1CellNet Global Bonus Pay Plan<br><br>They aren't registered in any country or state that I can find which makes them very illegal.<br><br>They claim to be "lawsuit proof" by the feds because they operate on the internet only.....which is BS as you know.<br><br>They openly pitch that their service "gets around telephone companies" which means tha they are stealing service time. How long before the telephone companies get wise to this and sue. And how long before countries figure out that they are not paying their sales taxes for long distance calls.<br><br>Look at their website......they don't even have a speck of legal policies to review. No privacy protections, nothing.<br><br>I listened in on a conference call the other day with some of their top promoters and it was identical to the old Skybiz sales pitch....IDENTICAL!<br><br>This one is going to go down hard just like Skybiz did.<br><br>Anyway, just thought you would like to be alerted that Skybizzers around the world are piling in on this one.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Please find my basic research below on 1cellnet.<br><br>This is based on work undertaken for a client who asked for a brief on this "project".<br><br>I accept that everything here is not conclusive but in my opinion there are striking similarities between the compensation plan offered and the key hallmarks set out in the document produced by Dr. Peter J. Vander Nat re the Skybiz case in May 2001.<br><br>Further the site www.1cellnet.com is both unclear and raises more issues then it answers. The site also does not explain the underlying business model for real substantiated growth.<br><br>Whilst it is not for me to suggest that there is a specific intent to run a pyramid scheme as opposed to a legal MLM but there are some other issues which do not inspire confidence in the diligence of the operation.<br><br>Nevada Company as outlined on Web Site.<br>For example presently the Nevada State Business Registry has the following records of Incorporated Companies in Nevada containing the word “cellnet”<br><br>CELLNET OF IDAHO, INC. 	      Revoked<br>CELLNETPAY, INC. 	      Revoked<br>US CELLNET INFORMATION, INC.  Current List<br><br>No record on Hoovers or D&amp;B re 1cellnet in Nevada either.<br><br>Mark Cook<br>If one searches for Mark Cook there is no record of anyone with this name as a CEO of any company except one called MAC 6500 Inc. There is a company called CALL PLAN USA HOLDINGS, INC. which might be of interest. The URL to Nevada Company Searches is http://sos.state.nv.us/begin.asp<br><br>Equally the Australian company referred to as an agent is also recorded at another address and as a Credit Union, though this may be owing to changes in name, ownership etc as laid out below<br><br>The ASIC notes are as follows for three entities.<br><br>Name 	UNIFIED INTERACTIVE DATA PTY LTD<br>ACN 	104 333 397<br>Type 	Australian Proprietary Company,<br>Limited By Shares Registration<br>Date 	                07/04/2003<br>Next Review Date 	07/04/2004<br>Status 	Registered<br>Locality of Registered Office 	Bundall QLD 4217<br>Jurisdiction<br>Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission<br><br>Former Name(s) 	A.C.N. 104 333 397 PTY LTD<br><br>Name 	UNIFIED INTERACTIVE PTY.
