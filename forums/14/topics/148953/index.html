            <div class='col-md body'>May i know which MLM company are you with now???<br><br>may i try to answer some of your questions???<br><br>1) when most idiots decides to start a mlm company thinking of earning a fast bucks, first they have problems finding a good product with price comparable with wat you can get off the shelves in the retail market.....<br><br>Let's imagine a toothbrush just for example.... Lets the mlm company and NTUC take it as same cost price. and NTUC only earn 20 cents per toothbrush, the mlm cant possibly sell it as the same margin, if not how to pay out the pv??? so thats why most mlm have to mark up their products super high just for the payout....  So in this case go for the manufacturing based companies that produce their own products... i.e. Nuskin, Amway, Herbal Life, Coslab etc...<br><br>2) from a normal company's point of view, the membership fee paid cant be refunded.... if not, who is paying for all the admin work involve??? of cos at the same time, it shouldn't be too high, so from $40 to $60 should be acceptable.......</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>3) the payout system can't possible be that simple..... if it is, then most likely it is not able to pay very well for generations too far down...... and more often than not, the plan is dead one..... if you got @#$% up products and system in the company, how attractive the plan is also useless cos your concept cant sell anything...... agree???  Most important is the company, product and together with a workable plan will move things very far......<br><br>4) products must be tangible..... dun tell me watever supplements can improve blood circulation or prevent cancer.... how to tell???? when i'm 50??? then most likely the company closed liao i also dunno who to look for if i kena cancer...... hahaha.....  Products should show results within short time from 1 to 3 months for ppl to be convinced.  and should encourage repeat purchase thru quality products......... example of a damn lousy product is the magnetic mattress with warranty of 10 yrs......... stupid.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why you failed in many MLM???? did you ask yourself????<br><br>1) which companies did you join???<br><br>2) i believe there is only a bad upline, never a lousy downline.... its your job to help them succeed....<br><br>3) How long did you do before you decide you cant make it in the mlm company????<br><br>4) Did you try hard enough?? or you just waiting for your downline to bring in sales for you???<br><br>5) Did you duplicate properly the system or did you try to come out with your own way and idea on how to do this business????<br><br>6) Is your dreams big enough?? Are you focused enough??? Are you serious enough???? I guess not, cos if you're serious, you'll stick to a company thats good and keep going......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u are right to say payout from selling toothbrush is small, but mlm companies dont really sell very wide range of products like retail stores<br><br>in fact they are specialised, selling high value items like health products and vacuum cleaners<br><br>i do see some mlm companies selling small items like toothbrush, but thats because they already a base of high value items<br><br>sometimes, small items like cookies are sold for promotions wise or to celebrate some festivals, like Chinese New Year or Hari Raya<br><br></div>
