              <p>If it is, then every single person on earth will be a MLM network marketeer, probably selling their respective MLM products to each other and there will be no shopping malls, no supermarkets, no retail shops, etc because no one wants to work as salesgirl/salesmen, cashiers and what not.</p>
              <p>The problem with the MLM industry is that the distributors think that by sponsoring as many people as they can, they will reach the top and earn big bucks. That is not only a FALLACY but IDEALISTIC.</p>
              <p>Many MLM distributors are told to work on a name list, just like what Insurance Agents are told to do. You cannot work on a name list because more often than not, your family members and friends will be on that list. Some will oblige you by purchasing one or two items from your MLM company's product range; some will even entertain you by accompanying you to an opportunity meeting; some will reject you and generally, most of your personal contacts will discourage you from getting into the business.</p>
              <p>There will come a time when after exhausting all avenues of getting people you know interested in joining as your downline, you will turn to advertising online, giving out flyers and/or name cards to people on the street. So where do you go from there?</p>
              <p>Disappointment, Disillusion, Disbelief sets in and you'll feel cheated and have wasted not only money but also time in pursuit of a business that promises 'Unlimited Wealth'.</p>
              <p>YET, there ARE MLM networkers who succeed and who are able to generate 6 figure income for decades. There must be such people for any MLM companies to stay viable in the business.</p>
              <p>Who are these Leaders?</p>
              <p>If you say they are professional conmen then you'll have to be honest with yourself and say that crooks will sooner or later be found out. But to be fair, the Leaders in MLM companies can be professionals in their former careers and not necessarily the shady back street hoodlums.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, based on my years of working as a Corporate Trainer in a MLM company, those who CAN and WILL succeed in MLM possess several traits/characteristics that made them ideal networkers.</p>
              <p>01.  They are well-respected by friends and friends;</p>
              <p>02.  They have established themselves as people with integrity so when they say 'This is</p>
              <p>      good, others will believe it is good';</p>
              <p>03.  They are affable people, very approachable and well-liked;</p>
              <p>04.  They are inately honest in their dealings and have never once dishonour their words;</p>
              <p>05.  They are humble and even if they are degree holders or millionaires they never</p>
              <p>       talk 'down' to people;</p>
              <p>06.  They are astute in business and know how to plan sales strategies to achieve</p>
              <p>       their sales targets;</p>
              <p>07.  They treat their MLM business as any other kind of businesses - investing in tools</p>
              <p>       that are necessary for them to operate their business;</p>
              <p>08.  They are able to effectively train their downlines and motivate them to duplicate</p>
              <p>       his efforts;</p>
              <p>09.  They see the MLM company they're with as their business partner with them as</p>
              <p>      minor investors with the opportunity to gain major payouts and incentives;</p>
              <p>10.  They are Leaders because they can lead</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I agree with your comments. Due to my experience in MLM, I do really touch on a lot of things from the relationships, company background etc.</p>
              <p>In fact, that is no right or wrong in each company, every company has its own plans and products. You just have to choose which company's plan and products is suitable for you to work on.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, everyone knows that it has regulations. So i believe every MLM company are registered to do their business.</p>
              <p>In MLM, Some people join just mainly to achieve their dreams, some use it as an stepping stone to learn and do business, learn communications skills etc. Others relaly focus on it and make it their passion or career.</p>
              <p>However, a minority of them give up half way due to difficulties they encounter or other reasons. Some really do the wrong methods and land themselves in trouble.</p>
              <p>Yes, I strongly agree that MLM is not for everyone, some people just basically do not have any goals in life and others are just totally not interested.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you tat I myself had join 3 company before and I realise that the most important that you must be flexible in Marketing and the company's plan suits you or else it would not be an disadvantages to you.</p>
              <p>what I am doin now is beyond MLM which includes franchising. A good method for your sources of income. Do consider that if you are unable to ask your friend to join you but your friends might be able to earn you income and so why not tag together with since it creates wins wins situations and benefit him?</p>

              <p>that is why there is a saying in mlm industry and it's something which i did mention in some of my previous post -</p>
              <p>"MLM is for Everybody BUT Not Everybody is suitable for MLM"</p>
              <p>It will take a lot of understanding to know what this phase means, since this thread has got something similar to this content so I thought I just post this phase again to serve as a reminder to everybody not to be infulenced by your peers if you see them attaining success in this field.</p>
              <p>most of the success are only short term - for complete newbies u either depend on your gut feeling to join them if you see the opportunity or u simply wait for your fren to produce consistent results deem convincing for you to join his/her network over a few years of oberservation.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Disclaimer Warning</strong></span></p>
              <p>For complete newbies or distributors who got some prior experience but still unsure of how to look for good deals/offers - You accept the results (consequences regardless of success or failure once you join your fren in their network if you join them based on sympathy/friendship/gut feeling)</p>
              <p>By joining things that you're unsure, you are accepting all responsibilites holding only yourself and nobody else responsible for your loses in any investment. (If the company promise some form of guarantee, than make sure u read the terms and conditions of the company form before joining any company!</p>

              <p>Just like to add a little to the topic, some are being lead into thinking that they join network marketing then they will become rich, it's not such an easy process and I tell the people who want to join me that it is about 2-4 years of hard work and they have to consistently put in time to build the business up. Then again I have some friends who work very hard and not getting anywhere as they are with the wrong company.</p>
              <p>Look around for opportunities but study them, look for companies that have car and luxury bonuses to show for your efforts and have been in operation for about 3-5 years as they have shown staying power and see if they have any awards and do check out if they registered with DSAS(www.dsas.org) or if from USA(www.dsa.org) to prove they are white-listed and check the complaints at the Better Business Bureau. Joining a new company or in the pioneer stage is only suitable for people who are not risk-averse as the staying power of the company is not established yet and it is your choice after all, make it a good one.</p>

              <p>Not particularly sure if you're just here to recruit people or to pull in sales etc.</p>
              <p>This thread is started and the post in here other than yours don't have any advertisments nor links to other sites, if you want to advertise for Randy Gage, I suggest you go to other sites.</p>
              <p>From what I know and have heard of him, he does recommend company which he himself is in thus I believe you are here for other purposes.</p>
              <p>As to the DSAS which you mention, it's from an external source and not recognized in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Thus the suitable one should be <a title="DSAS [Singapore]" href="http://www.dsas.org.sg/dsas/Html/afterlogin.htm">http://www.dsas.org.sg/dsas/Html/afterlogin.htm</a> for those who want to understand more about it in Singapore context and not for those who are registered overseas!!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Warning: </strong></span></p>
              <p>I've gone through the list of members in DSAS (Singapore) and have seen quite a couple of comanies despite being registered inside the list, they are still giving us consumers more headache despite being registered with such a creditable source.</p>
              <p>If you aren't sure what I'm talking about, just look at the forums in the MLM section and those who aren't sure what I'm talking about will get some cules as to what I'm talking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>======================================</p>
              <p>I'm will not post any company's name to black-mark them even if I know they're bad because people in this forum are only aware of such stuffs after they have paid the company and have learnt their lessons.</p>
              <p>So no point in me posting the names of the companies and neither is it eithical nor professional for me to black-list other companies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>=========================================</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>FYI:</strong></span></p>
              <p>If you're wondering why are there only so little companies being listed inside is because they need to have either a strong overseas reputation plus creditability if they want to be listed in Singapore upon starting their Business.</p>
              <p>General Rule of Registration:</p>
              <p>5 straight years of Good Positive Clean Records without any complaints filed to them to be taken into consideration for DSAS membership.</p>
              <p>Express Lane - 3 years (Extremely Rare Case)</p>
              <p>Only for those companies that shows EXTREMELY GOOD CORPORATE Companies with GOOD RECORDS both locally and overseas will get it.</p>
              <p>[Correct me if I'm wrong - For I didn't check the rules for the most updated rules of such stuffs for quite some time now.]</p>

              <p>the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NUMBER 1 MISTAKE </strong>that all mlm agents commit in sgforums</span></span> is trying to <strong>ACT SMART </strong>and try to explain the differences between pyramid and mlm than followed by explaining the differences between each of their respective company verus the other companies out there in the market.</p>
              <p>why bother to repeat the same old thing again and again when it has already being repeated almost everytime as a new company agent try to catch a slice of the sgforum pie by posting in this forum hoping to catch some some fish who's inexperienced and knows nothing; but in fact its the agents themselves who don't actually understand the audience that they are targeting themselves given the high level of skepticsim in this forum.. lol.. which is why i hardly post these days.. given lots of duplicate content here and there..</p>
              <p><em><strong>Ageleon:</strong></em> If you think I've misunderstood your intentions, look back at your own post, and try to find out where you have commited the mistake of wrong usage of words which is clearly hinting that you are doing recruitment in sgforum just by the post itself!</p>
              <p>I'm not gonna tell you specifically where did the words go wrong as it will only increase the difficulty of other agents learning from your mistake and improvise on it thus tricking others into their own respecitive company.</p>

              <p>the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NUMBER 1 MISTAKE</strong> that all mlm
              agents commit in sgforums</span></span> is trying to <strong>ACT
              SMART</strong> and try to explain the differences between pyramid
              and mlm than followed by explaining the differences between each of
              their respective company verus the other companies out there in the
              market.</p>
              <p>why bother to repeat the same old thing again and again when it
              has already being repeated almost everytime as a new company agent
              try to catch a slice of the sgforum pie by posting in this forum
              hoping to catch some some fish who's inexperienced and knows
              nothing; but in fact its the agents themselves who don't actually
              understand the audience that they are targeting themselves given
              the high level of skepticsim in this forum.. lol.. which is why i
              hardly post these days.. given lots of duplicate content here and
              there..</p>
              <p><em><strong>Ageleon:</strong></em> If you think I've
              misunderstood your intentions, look back at your own post, and try
              to find out where you have commited the mistake of wrong usage of
              words which is clearly hinting that you are doing recruitment in
              sgforum just by the post itself!</p>
              <p>I'm not gonna tell you specifically where did the words go wrong
              as it will only increase the difficulty of other agents learning
              from your mistake and improvise on it thus tricking others into
              their own respecitive company.</p>
              <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I bear no ill intention to
              black-list you nor your post, just that your motives are too
              obvious.</p>

              <p>well I did a lot of research and read through many other mlm guide lines, I have an ebook from Phil Snelman, Ann Sieg, Tom "Big Al" Schreiter and Phillip Collinsworth, and others from random reasearch around the net, so what I said was main points that I noticed them saying, there are quite a number of companies out there that are should to meet the recommendations</p>

              <p>Okay, if you don't understand what has gone wrong, it's okay.</p>
              <p>In time to come, you will learn about it.</p>
              <p>Don't dwell on it: I learn about usage of words not from mlm but from other sources of self-upgrading.</p>
              <p>It's not always a 1 Size Fits All kind of guide lines.</p>
              <p>I just combine everything that I learn together into 1 and add in my own list of consideration factors. So you need not bother to search for such guide lines because it don't exist in the market to date for your information.</p>
              <p>Maybe next time you'll understand more about it if you come across similar topics.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>the point is network marketing has a system for success, right? So I've read through so many of their books, advise, etc etc, and I just noticed those recommendations, and if they did it right already, do we need to reinvent the wheel, NO. We just follow what they have been doing that has been bringing them the results, you get what I mean?</p></div>
