            <div class='col-md body'>this was an email written to Scott Adams who draws Dilbert for the daily newspapers... he writes books which cut to the bone about the stupidity and scams of the Corporate world...<br><br>---------------<br><br>...<br><br>But most pyramid schemes are in the business world and look like this one:<br><br><strong><ul>Dear Mr Adams,<br><br>There's a so-called marketing organization that cons people into thinking that they are applying for a job selling financial products.  But before they can earn money, they have to go through a training course that costs up to $750.<br><br>Any sales they make during this training period (which they try to stretch out as long as possible) yield no income to the trainee; the trainer gets to keep all the money.<br><br>They use high-pressure techniques to suck people in, then they try to take as much money away from those people as possible.  This encourages people to stay to recoup the money they've spent.<br><br>Although they deny that their company runs a pyramid scheme, it's run in the spirit of one: the people at the top get a cut of the commissions from everyone below them, and the only way to make money yourself is to "recruit" people to work under you.</ul><br><br></strong><br><br>does this look familiar?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why Singaporeans are so sceptical of MLMs, and Malaysia, Taiwan and Japan become Kings of MLM in Asia?<br><br>Coz Japanese, Taiwanese and Malaysians gullible? Stupid? Greedy? Losers compared to Singaporeans? Blame on stupid gahmen who cannot provide for their people?<br><br>I dont think so<br><br>When I do research on this, I found out few reasons why.<br><br>a) Singaporeans are living in comfort zone. From young, we do not know harships as they do. Even the poorest of us has TV and living perhaps in a concrete dwellling. Even if we are poor, we can turn towards many welfare homes and societies. Our grandparents and even parents work so hard. Do they have Armani and Gucci in the past? So whatever we spend usually comes from their hard earned money. From this comfort zone, I found Singaporeans has less drive in their life.<br><br>Why you go get degree? Why do you take this course?  What you planned to do in life? You got dreams?<br><br>Ans: Dont know, tak tahu, bu zi dao<br><br>Blame on society lor, blame on stupid gahmen, make us like that, bo pian lor. What else can we do?....are the typical answer.<br><br>We become robot. I am very afraid for future generation ,coz Singaporeans are degenerating. For me, I never believe in form, only substance. When presented with a uniform group during secondary school,  they seems so hiong, so solid. Look at the marching, so united. Underneath, I checked it out. As all NSF, past and present,will say, its all wayang. Their programme is totally relied on teachers. When thrown a problem, they will then refer to the teachers. Some other uniform group, seems disorganised. However, when faced with a problem, they have the skill, instinct and knowledge to solve the problems. Then I am impressed<br><br>When presented with cheques and cars and stuff, I was not impressed. I do checked out the companies structure, whether is it strong. To convince me to join any MLM company, you have to impress me by fulfillling my criterias, like products, marketing plan, training, culture, track record.......<br><br>Another stories are of how, when Singaporeans are approached on MLM, some told me they are lazy to do , although they know its good. Some were afraid to do, coz they lack confidence in certain areas, even though these skils can be taught.<br><br>Sigh, few lessons are learned here.<br><br>Singaporeans lack drive. And, I dont mean got drive must join MLM. I mean to pursue things in life that you want. Remember, if the dream is big enough, the facts dont count. And do I mean money, cars, cash? I also mean family, friends and personal development.<br><br>We are also gullible, coz MLM has been only appproved recently. We do not know how to differentiate successful companies from lousy ones. We do not know how to differentiate pyramids from legal MLM. We pursue form, not substance. In many ways, Singaporeans are not as streetwise as other nationalities.And most of all, is all scam in MLM? You be surprised. Lets not talk about drinks stall overpricing Pepsi. Lets talk about other form of scams.<br>Haha, as not to betray scammers out there, lets just say an average scam involve the watch you are wearing, the cologne you sprayed, the insurance you buy, membership clubs fees, company fraud, etc.....6 billion people in the world, equals 6 possible scams ideas.<br><br>We, not only behaving like clones, we are losing our cultures. What culture? I do not know. Malay culture, Chinese culture, Indian culture? Do we know much on our history, traditions and stuff?<br><br>For reasons I do not know why, Singaporeans are increasingly sceptical. We argue against MLM, we argue against gahmen, we argue against this that this. Increasingly, Singaporeans could not take facts at face. Its getting wearisome<br><br>b) What we can learn from Malaysian?<br><br>I went to Malaysia for my company's award night in KL. I was surprised to see Malaysian youth in numbers attending the event. Whereas, from Singapore are mostly older people. I talked to the younger people. They told me, once they see a good opportunities, they will seize it. And do they go bothering people, breaking family ties, and do all kind of funny stuff. Nope. Tak ada. Mei you. Do they enjoy what they do? Yes. And Malaysia has MLM history of 30 years. They are rather streetwise when it comes to business and social life.<br><br>c) What can we learn from the Japanese?<br><br>They are very open minded, humble and courteous, plus the drive too. Has Singapore the ability to beat the Japanese in technology?<br>Resounding yes. Would we want to? Urmmm......<br><br>I met few Japanese before. They always smile. Once, I took a bus from Buona Vista to OETI. A mother and a young daughter, clambered aboard the bus, panting. Obviously, they have chased the bus. The mother was smiling and talking to the daughter. I do not know Jap, but from the sound of it, it sound like "Hey, we got onboard the bus. Isnt it great? Wasnt the chasing fun?"<br><br>It is the spirit that made me smile that day. My friend once told me, where in the world can a group of people be so technological advanced and preserved their culture so deeply. Japan, the land of rising sun, not setting sun.<br><br>Why Amway is successful there? Is it becos market is big? Maybe. But Japanese are open minded and close knitted. They dont reject you out right, neither are they very sceptical and lose family ties too.<br><br>Hey, I must relate Japanese close family ties with our Malay friends.<br>Right here at home, my Malay friends family has many distinct features.<br><br>Mostly live in same area. Kept constantly in touch. Large families, but warm. Hari Raya is always a open house affair. Close knitted.<br>Live in Yishun, but you want me go Geylang now? No prob, is the answer they most likely to give. In many ways, if you observe, Chinese families, if not all, are quite distant apart in terms of ties and distance of residence.<br><br>I am not putting Singaporeans down. I am hoping we can learn and improve, for our sake, if not for future generations.<br><br>Happy holidays<br><br></div>

Cheers~!<br><br>No matter what company u r from, lets not backstab each other since it does no good to the industry.<br><br>Why this industry is getting worse is due to blacksheep among these companies.
