            <div class='col-md body'>my fren told me shes got a job for me, but he told me its very hard to explain so he brought me to the office which is at clarke quay. then she intro me to her many friends and we all shook hands and they are all ery friendly.  then we went to this coffee shop and ate stuff and crap<br><br>then later, i went back w my fren and a higher superior and she explained to me in details about how the company earns revenue. and how we earn points to promote up the ranks. when the superior teaching us, my friend keep saying 'yes' in agreement. all the people all quite young de some less than 20.<br><br>But Ive heard many bad things abt MLM, especially enyouth so im doubtful whether to join or not. My friend is really not the type of person who would cheat a friend becuz ive been w her for quite long le, but maybe money can change a person.<br><br>So its either shes cheated le and she trying to pull me into this crap or she doesnt know she is getting ripped off and she wanted me to help her. If the latter is the case why is she loyal to the company? Did she get psycho'd or something? How should I convince her...?<br><br>Btw, she told me this thing doesnt surely earn me big bucks but it depends on how hard you work....is that true? or is it just a big scam<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your friend is right, joining enyouth doesn't guarantee you money... yet again working hard for enyouth probably doesnt guarantee you any money either.<br>They are just trying to psych you when the DM or SDM is talking to you about some issues and ur friend is constantly making this irritating comment 'dui!' or 'yes!' . That happens to everyone who is brought to enyouth by their friends.<br><br>Try to think critically, why was ur friend constantly affirming the words of the SDM? it's their way of making something that <strong>may not</strong> necessary to true, appear to be true to you. This is also a subtle way of pressure selling.  I'm sorry to say, your friend is probably another idiot who can't think for herself. Many things they try to tell you there is just bullshit, even my grandmother knows better.<br><br>They like ppl with the attitude "WHY NOT I JUST GIVE A TRY", coz these ppl come in easy, put in effort and money for the upline, and when they dont succeed, they leave the company, the upline will still be there to reap the benefits. of coz the hope is that u become one of those uplines... but you will have to live a life psychoing ur good friends into this crap.<br><br>Many of these mlm ppl come in here and make comments like why should you work hard, why not let money work for you... and stuff like you are a failure if you do not dare try out new things... hey pardon me, I'm very <strong>willing</strong> to try out new things.... things like group sex, S&amp;M... but hey just not stuff like taking drugs, frauds and of coz MLM or SLM whatever you want to call it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i do not know much about Enyouth or how it works, but i can share with you what i think about this kind of companies and the pple i worked with before, based on my personal experience....<br><br>I once worked in a company called DW Group...From what i read, its quite similar to what you have mentioned....The pple all treat you very nice and r super friendly...Many chio babes also rite? ha..However, all these comes with a motive...They want to create an impression that they are all working very happily inside and are enjoying their work very much. After that, your impression of the company will be very good...After that, the big boss comes into the picture. He or she will spend some time explaining to you about their structure and stuff, and how this concept of multi level marketing works...You can recruit new pple to join or generate sales yourself, these 2 are the most important. That's why your fren ask you to come. You are going to be her recruit....<br><br>Well, from what i exp, time and money can definitely change a person. And MLM can really show the true side of a person. I'm not saying ur fren is a bad person, but she may have been brainwashed and cannot distinguish what is right and wrong already. Its not totally her fault....<br><br>In the end, its still up to you to make a decision. If you think you can make it in this industry, then go ahead and do it. You never know who can do it. The most important thing is the company you are going to work with and its prospect....No matter what, hope you make the correct decision and don't regret...Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And who's the people you are earning your income from? Its the people you know lor...And how much do you know of the products? I do not know, so i can't give any comments...<br><br>The longer you work. the tougher it gets...You just think lah...Your "market" got no more people liao..you are struggling, of course the next best thing is to recruit others to do the same thing you did when you started out and earn their commission by becoming their "upline"....If u are a normal person, you find people you don't know to be your recruits...however, if you are a "good" person with "morals", you find people you know of and let them do this vicious cycle for you, becoz of the trust and friendship you have previously from them....Thats how people in this line lost their friends and some even lose their family.....However, not everyone will end up like that but its just a possibility....<br><br>I'm not discouraging you or what...I just hope people can think more carefully before making a decision...I don't want people to be like me last time....Mistakes are made to be learnt, but this is a mistake which can definitely be avoided....If last time i got people like myself advising me, then i won't make this mistake le...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All I can say is that once my friends join in MLM, they keep persuading their friends to join too, coz that's how they make money, in the end, these MLM friends loses alot of friendships, and my friend who have been in MLM for almost 1-2 years now still not even making more than a few hundred each month. Now, I seldom contact these MLM friends because alot of times they keep asking me to join. The only friends they got mainly are those MLM people coz they are in the same gang. So I normally don't encourage people to work in MLM companies, they have a very bad reputation and waste the time of alot of people. Ocassionally, there will be people making money and they are normally the ones on top of the ranks, sucking money from the idiots below. Trust me, there are enough idiots willing to give things a try to help the smarter people on top of the ranks pull in the cash. Why am I in a position to criticize and talk about these MLM issues? Because I have MLM friends and I've seen what happened to them. Besides, I own a MLM company DailyInc.com, only that I don't do what most MLM people do, like persuade or ask anyone to join me. My method of marketing is totally different, if you think my products are good, you get it. If not, don't. But most MLM people will force and talk and talk asking you and telling you how good their products are, even if you not interested. This way, they are using hard selling tactics which of course the end results is mostly an unhappy customer who don't know how or why they bought the products or join MLM.</div>
