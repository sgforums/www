That happens to everyone who is brought to enyouth by their friends.<br><br>Try to think critically, why was ur friend constantly affirming the words of the SDM? it's their way of making something that [b]may not</strong> necessary to true, appear to be true to you. This is also a subtle way of pressure selling.  I'm sorry to say, your friend is probably another idiot who can't think for herself. Many things they try to tell you there is just bullshit, even my grandmother knows better.<br><br>They like ppl with the attitude "WHY NOT I JUST GIVE A TRY", coz these ppl come in easy, put in effort and money for the upline, and when they dont succeed, they leave the company, the upline will still be there to reap the benefits. of coz the hope is that u become one of those uplines... but you will have to live a life psychoing ur good friends into this crap.<br><br>Many of these mlm ppl come in here and make comments like why should you work hard, why not let money work for you... and stuff like you are a failure if you do not dare try out new things... hey pardon me, I'm very <strong>willing</strong> to try out new things.... things like group sex, S&amp;M... but hey just not stuff like taking drugs, frauds and of coz MLM or SLM whatever you want to call it.

            <div class='col-md body'>I just got cheated to go down 'dinner' with enyouth. It is same as other mlm. The main product is the 1.5k magnetic mattress which u can get for USD50-100 in ebay. This product is relatively useless if anyone will care to ask singaporeans' opinion. So the emphasis seem to be more on recruiting than the product.<br><br>From what i see, the pyramid will gonna fall again like Astral mag in the near future. The big boss just keep changing location and name, so easy for him. This 1.5k mattress will be very hard to find sales thus contributing to stagnant. They have other products such as magnetic bracelet and health care all grossly overpriced.

It means before u gain your ranks up the network, it collapsed.<br><br>U can describe mlm like releasing a balloon containing X amount of helium to a spiked ceiling. The X is amount of network joined. If the product sell well, X is big and balloon rise and pop. If product sell poorly, balloon dun lift at all. FYI, X is a unlimited variable in mlm. Retailing is different as we control this amount of X to a known number.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was at their place yesterday due to a gathering with my long lost secondary school classmate. Was there at the coffeehop for dinner and she said that her cousin called her where is she and would join us for dinner. For me, a dinner with another guy is ok, but the conversation is very well planed. Asking about your dream, what is your plan, is your work really good, is there security..<br><br>For me, I am very well versed but not saying that I am good in everything. So I was invited to go up to see the company and bcos to give my fren face I agree and was told an hour and a half to finished off everything.<br><br>When I reached their office, they keep trying to show off their Cars, ISO standard, Dare to Fail and Direct selling act etc. To me, those are nothing cos every company will have something to link. I was told about the boss is doing A&amp;P for enyouth, so what?<br><br>Things I observed,<br><br>people are like around 20s, very young. I do not see any people who are around 30s or more. They are behaving like Fa Lun Gong. Yes, Dui... it is very uncomfortable. The compensation plan they have, SXXkc. What they need u to do is to sell and resell. then u become the selling of this company. The presenter a China lady, saying that the PV is 2/3 of the actual price where 1/3 is the actual cost and admin cost. that is 200% or more in the mark up price.<br><br>Yes, there are people earning the money, but how many are not? how many will be harm in the process? Inventory, hypes, emotional motivations, is it wrong to work? Our parents also work so hard to earn and give us educations, a roof to live in and clothes to wear. How long and consistent can you earn from this company? They keep running down on other MLM co which I do not like as this is very unprofessional.<br><br>Their boss, Raymond Lim, last night, the class that he gave, speaks like an uneducated man, words like Ka Ni Na, Na Bei etc. Running down on other co but then say they cannot say this. Really like ah beng leading his kids around. What kind of influence will the young guys and girls take? To me, he is like a clown. My fren keep telling me he is very good, but have anyone seem a much better speaker out there? He is just taking the weak points of our youngers today who want cars, glamour, look good, dress nice and like to listen to good things from friends. End of the day, there are always new suckers around.<br><br>I was not allow to leave till 1230 am and the people are just like cults, YES, Dui... rubbish. How many of them have been through the journey of lifes? Have they survive and live on their own? Wake up your idea guys.<br><br>This is my freedom of thoughts and speech, I have been living in other country for a few years and seem and went through MLM locally and overseas. If you guys are looking for MLM, do your study and do not let emotional decision which can lead u to a longer road. there is no fault with MLM, it is just the people that are the problem starter.<br><br>Let fate decide your destiny but it is you who walk the walk.</div>

My friend is really not the type of person who would cheat a friend becuz ive been w her for quite long le, but maybe money can change a person.<br><br>So its either shes cheated le and she trying to pull me into this crap or she doesnt know she is getting ripped off and she wanted me to help her. If the latter is the case why is she loyal to the company? Did she get psycho'd or something? How should I convince her...?<br><br>Btw, she told me this thing doesnt surely earn me big bucks but it depends on how hard you work....is that true? or is it just a big scam<br><br></div></blockquote>can u intro your friend to me?<br><br>i'll like to go down enyouth to take a look and see if there if the company is good.<br><br>so far i have seen many companies, none are in my good category. for i was cheated a few grands before, so i learnt to be smart, know how to choose a good company already. if you want to know if the company is good<br><br>why not just let me go down enyouth, if i feel it's good, than i let you know.<br><br>i hope i can help you reach a good decision.<br><br>basically, i am once cheated in mlm, anti mlm before but after 1 yr of pondering, slowly understand what is real mlm, so here i am finding for a good company again.</div>
