As usual like any MLM company ard, they start by going thru all their people n comapny's achievement and make it sound very easy to be achieve. To be fair, I will not say that MLM will not work totally. At first i told myself to listen and approah MLM as neutual as possible, maybe it can really earn me some cash. (i'm have lust for cash too !! ...human nature).<br><br>But something that really make me lose the trust toward them is this...<br><br>After all the introduction, according to them, inorder to join them u must pay out this amount of $40-70 dollars first to<br><br>REGISTAR TO DIRECT SELLING ASSOICATION OF SINGAPORE (DSAS) AND THE MONEY WILL ONLY GO TO DSAS ONLY, NOT TO ANYONE OR THE COMPANY.<br><br>I found this fishy and ask wheather this DSAS will give me any recipt or cert to prove that i had registared under them inorder to start this distribution MLM, the reply was a DIRECT NO from the personnels. Although this amount of money is not a great amount but i do wanted to know really where it go to.<br><br>The following day i went to find call up the DSAS to check whether there is a need to pay out any amount of money inorder to be a indivdual distributor in this MLM company. the answer is "NO". and the money that is collected is never a request from DSAS.<br><br>SO THIS IS A TRUE EXPERIENCE..JUST WANNA SHARE TO PPL ARD HERE<br>THE SAD THING IS THAT MLM PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT US TO TRUST THIER COMPANY N PRODUCTS....AND THEY CANNOT EVEN VERIFY THE ABOVE SITUATION...HOW TO TRUST THEM ?<br><br>BEWARE AND CAUTION.........I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS PROCEDURE BEFORE HAND, SO I ENDED UP PAYING THE $40-70.<br><br>TO VERIFY WAT I HAD SAID....U CAN CALL DSAS AT 6333 3325</div></blockquote>Most likely you have paid for the membership fees of Enyouth already.<br><br>Be prepared to have them bugging your hp, my friends happen to have those uplines who bug their hp on a quite often basis.<br><br><strong>Btw, if you want to get refund, I can help you demand for a refund if you still haven join Enyouth more than 60days.<br><br>Or either you print the website with the laws out, than you go demand refund from them.<br><br>It's a law written by Ministry of Trade and Industry.</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Definitely do not join. I felt so cheated by my army friend. We do not keep in contact for so long then out of the blue, he called me to ask me how I am. Then we went to the infamous coffee shop to lah kopi. Then he said he's doing a business then kept on wanting me to take a look at his office.<br><br>Unfortunately, I gong gong followed him. That's where my whole shit started. He kept on mentioning the DM, SDM and how successful they are, what cars they drive etc...<br><br>I was clearing my leave for my army at that time. He painted such a beautiful and tempting picture that I just fell into it. Wanting to earn some money for my university education, I signed up with this shit company.<br><br>Then I was foolishly psyched into buying the useless magnetic mattresses thingy and a bracelet. I wasted about 1.8k plus. Instead of earning money, I lost money wtf. My heart just feel so pain, seeing my money wash down the drain.<br><br>Their tactic is to sell the products to your friends and family. How can you sell an useless stuff to your closest friends and relatives? That's why I decided to leave that freaking place.<br><br>Do not be fooled by their nice dressing and cars. You do not know how many people they have cheated. They just plainly want to build their upline and downline so they can suck other people precious money.<br><br>Well, I hated myself for stupidly falling into my "friend's" trap. I'm just so freaking stupid. I will not even say hi to him if I bump into him on the street. I will not forget you, M****s.<br><br>Do not ever join any MLM shit. You will just be sucked dry of all your money.</div>

Here's what happened.<br><br>My army fren whom I've not contacted for almost a year plus, called me up one day, saying that 'eh, I saw someone who looked like u at City Hall, man!', then showered me with unnatural concern from a guy to another guy, such as 'How are u recently?' and 'Want to meet up for a meal or not?'.<br><br>I feel abit weird liao lor. Cos' I kena conned to go VE before, so I'm more aware of such things now. 2 possibilities: He's really gay, or he's trying to get me into MLM. At first, I thought nothing of it, and asked him to ask more common army frenz along if he wants to organise a meal. For some reason, he kept evading the issue of inviting more ppl. And even when I wasn't free on 2-3 occassions which he planned for us, he still insisted on having lunch wif me. So, I finally obliged today lor. Can't siam foreva mah.<br><br>We caught up a little at first, talking abt army stuffs, then walked to that same exact infamous coffeeshop. We ordered food and we had pretty harmless conversation, until he told me that he invited his other fren to join us. I felt abit weird lor. I thought it's a pure catch-up session for us army frenz? Initially, his fren is alrite, talking abt uni n army stuff, until I asked the qn 'So what are u doing now?'. Man, I tell u, it's a WRONG move, a killer qn! He began to tell me he has his own 'business' now, and my fren is his 'business partner'. At that point of time, I know liao, CHIAM liao.<br><br>He began to intro the company's products to me, then asked his DM to come to speak to me. Told me crap that he's a 'respectable, distinguished' manager, when he's an undergrad like me la. Kaoz. Then, as if deja vu all over again, I went thru another 2 hr of his drivel of his 'perfect' business plan. Once that's over, I thot I'm free at last, but no, my fren's fren still wanted to intro his more 'successful' colleagues to me. If I didn't smoke them that I'm meeting my other frenz real soon, I tink I would've known all of his colleagues frm his office by today. Holy crap, I tell ya.<br><br>As for Enyouth's actual work ethics, product viability etc, I shan't comment cos' I'm not familiar wif them.
