            <div class='col-md body'>I just can't tolerate some people. Well, there is this one fren of mine, she is a year older than me but anyway she thinks because she is a year more senior than all of us she has the right to boss me around. See, she is leaving for her trip in UK tomorrow and told me that she has some books to return to the library but she can't return them since she will be leaving tomorrow morning. She told me this like 2 days ago and I thought she was leaving today but then I found out that she is leaving like tomorrow. Anyway I agreed due to my "soft-heartedness" which I think she sees as a stupidity in my part. When she brought the books over, I was quite shocked because they were quite thick and there were around 9 of them! She then said would you be so kind as to return my friend's books as well? Since I already agreed, I can't really say no...<br><br>And then the worst thing is that she saw my ex crush in my room for the 3 consecutive days already and she knows that he has been overnighting in my place so she decided to slip in some nosy remarks just now, hinting about us being so close that we are almost a couple...I was like ??? I definitely do not think of my ex crush that way anymore, I just hope she would not go around spreading news...*sigh*<br><br>Some people can be such a b*tch.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

Well, there is this one fren of mine, she is a year older than me but anyway she thinks because she is a year more senior than all of us she has the right to boss me around. See, she is leaving for her trip in UK tomorrow and told me that she has some books to return to the library but she can't return them since she will be leaving tomorrow morning. She told me this like 2 days ago and I thought she was leaving today but then I found out that she is leaving like tomorrow. Anyway I agreed due to my "soft-heartedness" which I think she sees as a stupidity in my part. When she brought the books over, I was quite shocked because they were quite thick and there were around 9 of them! She then said would you be so kind as to return my friend's books as well? Since I already agreed, I can't really say no...<br><br>And then the worst thing is that she saw my ex crush in my room for the 3 consecutive days already and she knows that he has been overnighting in my place so she decided to slip in some nosy remarks just now, hinting about us being so close that we are almost a couple...I was like ???
