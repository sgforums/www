            <div class='col-md body'>There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn not to judge<br>things too quickly. So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look<br>at a pear tree that was a great distance away. The first son went in the<br>winter, the second in the spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son<br>in the fall.<br><br>When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe<br>what they had seen.<br><br>The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and twisted. The second son<br>said no-it was covered with green buds and full of promise. The third son<br>disagreed, he said it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and<br>looked so beautiful, it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen. The<br>last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with<br>fruit, full of life and fulfillment.<br><br>The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they<br>had each seen but ONLY one season in the tree's life. He told them that you<br>cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence<br>of who they are - and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life-<br>can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.<br><br>If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the promise of your spring,<br>the beauty of your summer, fulfillment of your fall. Don't let the pain of<br>one season destroy the joy of all the rest.<br><br>Don't judge life by one difficult season. Persevere through the difficult<br>patches and better times are sure to come some time or later.<br><br>Author: Unknown<br>"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments<br>that take our breath away."<br><br>~ Say what you want to say when you have the time, because tomorrow maybe one day late, Our deepest regrets are words unsaid and things undone ~</div>
