            <div class='col-md body'>thank you AdAptAliS.<br>i appreciate ur advices. it's always good to get dif opinions.<br>like all the other creatures u have mentioned, i am too in a way mutated. emotionally that is. life still goes on for me. but the harder i fight back this feeling inside me, the deeper i find myself sinking. there' no return for me now. i might have not much time left. all i want now is to try my best to stay around and wait for time to pass.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AdAptAliS:</div><div class="quote_body">I have a feeling its all in the mentality.<br><br>It sounds like you're avoiding some problem for way too long so much so that it becomes suffocating. And in the end, you became what you described of yourself.<br><br>Instead of thinking how come you don't have the strength to give up, why not give yourself the strength to pick yourself up again? There's a reason why you're still here typing, plus all the lyrics of songs that touched you.<br><br>We humans are the leading species on this planet, yet we are the ones who keep falling so easily. If other animals have the ability to think like us, i don't know what they would do. But for the fact that they don't, they're showing us their will to live. Mutated animals go on living strong, endangered species are still breathing, and injured animals continue to walk the earth. For example, adapting to life without a limb and such.<br><br>I know the example is pretty off-track. Another one would be stray grasses that tries to find a crack in any concrete slab just to live.<br><br>It's all in the mind. And it can be easily override.<br><br>Sorry i took the liberty to assume stuff and took the initiative to offer some advices. If it ain't needed, then feel free to treat it as trash.<br><br>Best wishes.</div></blockquote></div>
