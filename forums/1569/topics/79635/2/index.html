To counteract it, get very very busy...so much so that at the end of each day, you're so darn exhausted that the only thing you're capable of doing when you go home is to fall flat and sleep? or if you will, go do some volunteering work...go do something for the less fortunate ppl in the society....it helps shifting your focus on your sadness, know what i'm saying?<br><br>watever it is...do anything that keeps you from focusing on your regrets and yearning. It won't help initially but given enough "practice", the intensity of your pain might reduce faster than you imagine.<br><br></div>

"whatever u see may not be all there is, whatever u dont see may be present, just that u havent seen them"<br><br>I was like u in the past... now trying my best to know them... at least i can differentiate liao... though intense emotions still overwhelm me, esp guilt, but i dont have suicide thoughts yet...<br><br>good luck</div>
