He knows I am hurting (tho he doesn't know who hurt me) and told me that he will always wait until I heal before we really get into a relationship. I dun wan to be unfair to someone who has treated me so good all along. I have already told my ex crush that we are nothing but frens, and so far I have managed to do dat until these few days, I kept being reminded of the time I used to spend with him last time and it is making me feel guilty towards the guy I am seeing now...<br><br>i.c.y</div>
