            <div class='col-md body'>My 2 cents worth<br><br>The greatest love you can give is time. (wait)<br>The greatest love you recieve also time. (how long he will love you.)<br><br>In simple lanuage it means:<br><br>The longer you wait = the longer he will share his thinking and what deep inside him is thinking.<br><br>If you are his GF now, do you think he will share what he think deep inside him?<br>Will you know so much? Therefore if one day you and him together you will be even closer and understanding then the rest of the gals he likes. This is the best foundation you should build with him.<br><br>Turn the table around, if he likes you and he dare not to tell you. He went to share with another gal about his problem.<br><br>If you deceide to leave him and go with your current bf, don't turn back. You should be able to treat him as a normal friend and each time when he needs to tell to you , ask him to meet you at a public place to hint him you are drawing a line between.<br><br>If you think you like him more than your BF, go tell your BF and clear of 1 side. Start waiting rather than your body with current bf but heart with another.<br>Ended up you might have nothing.<br><br>If you don't have your heart with your current bf, things won't work out. you might ended looking for another or back to begining waiting for the other guy.<br><br>Relationship has no untils of measure to judge how long waited, how deep love is, which one better.......... Love means love when you love , no matter he is Full Of Sh1t you will still love him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>F.O.S<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am pretty sure I am not interested in him romantically anymore. That's why initially I was not worried to let him into my room and talk to him like close frens. But then I started to feel like I am doing too much for him for my own good, plus I was really tired after spending the whole day shopping and now I had to listen to him talk about another girl. Sometimes I just wonder why I have so much patience.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
