            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by icyprincess:<br><br>thanks Bear, for your word. I realize that it is so hard to get people to listen to me here (as in where I am now) My friends do not know about this and they do not understand.<br><strong>did u talk to them abt it, if nt, how are they going to understand</strong><br><br>I am so willing to let go...I think maybe my heart is not ready yet in some ways that i cannot fully explain....<br><strong>as i have explained earlier, ur heart is always slower than ur mind. Nt only u, but the entire world... e.g. like SnowFlag n Kismet...everywhere</strong><br><br>I can't talk to the new guy because somehow I just feel like he is kinda "emotionless" and he hates to be bugged by this kinda stuff. So I am all alone here ... if not for sgforums, I will feel even more tortured...<br><strong>he's not 'emotionless', he doesn't want to lead u on...nt saying wat he's doing is the BEST way, but at least, by doing this, it helping u to move on</strong><br><br>I think I have always been with myself...there hasn't been anyone who is willing to share my sorrows and feelings...<br><strong>refer to the first comment i made...they will understand n b by ur side if they are TRUE friends...e.g the ppl here...esp Bear...n those around u. Do look around u</strong><br><br>I seem to always want something or someone that I cannot have.<br><strong>u dun possess love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> On the other hand, letting go doesn't mean its nt love</strong><br><br>Often it is me who will do all the listening if the other party is sad or depressed..they just assume I am happy and cheerful so they do not even bother to ask if I am alright deep inside.<br><strong>u hide it. how ppl suppose to know ? Like, i can't just go up to a ever cheerful n bubbly guy, pat his back n say 'take it easy man'</strong><br><br>I have always been taken for granted.<br><strong>hmmmm......ur fragile heart on 'strike' liao...</strong><br><br>the weird thing is sumhow I like doing that...I like caring for someone and soothing them if they are hurt..it is just that sumtimes I do want them to do the same to me too...mebbe I have <strong>always</strong> cared for the wrong person...<br><strong>nt always to others, but in this case, u are.</strong><br><br>I know I took around 1 year to forget my first crush completely, but that was becos I had fallen for someone new at that time. I think I have to constantly be crushing on someone..isn't that weird?<br><strong>ur tired heart has never been 'alone', how to love urself first b4 loving another? It's a vicious cycle where most ppl dun realise they are in it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> </strong><br><br>i.c.y</blockquote></div>
