For you it was a pool game, for me it was bowling...<br><br>Went out one night to play bowling with a group of my friends, those are really good bowlers. I really enjoyed the game but was losing miserably to all the other pros. So in the end, I guess I threw a mini-tantrum...and one of them said the same thing to me. Told me not to look at the score and just enjoy the moment, the game itself.<br><br>Sometimes we pressure ourselves too much with the thoughts of losing that we even forgot to cherish the present moment itself.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
