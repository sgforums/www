            <div class='col-md body'>Another touching email... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>There was once a guy who suffered<br>from<br>cancer... A cancer that can't be treated. He was<br>18 years old and he could die anytime. All his<br>life, he was stuck in his house being taken<br>cared by his mother. He never went outside but<br>he was sick of staying home and wanted to go<br>out<br>for once.<br><br>So he asked his mother and she gave him<br>permission. He walked down his block and<br>found<br>a lot of stores. He passed a CD store and<br>looked<br>through the front door for a second as he<br>walked. He stopped and went back to look into<br>the store. He saw a young girl about his age<br>and<br>he knew it was love at first sight. He opened<br>the door and walked in, not looking at anything<br>else but her. He walked closer and closer until<br>he was finally at the front desk where she sat.<br><br>She looked up and asked "Can I help you?"<br>She<br>smiled and he thought it was the most beautiful<br>smile he has ever seen before and wanted to<br>kiss<br>her right there.<br><br>He said "Uh... Yeah... Umm... I would like to<br>buy a CD." He picked one out and gave her<br>money for it.<br><br>"Would you like me to wrap it for you?" she<br>asked, smiling her cute smile again.<br><br>He nodded and she went to the back.<br><br>She came back with the wrapped CD and gave<br>it<br>to him. He took it and walked out of the store.<br>He went home and from then on, he went to<br>that<br>store everyday and bought a CD, and she<br>wrapped<br>it for him. He took the CD home and put it in<br>his closet. He was still too shy to ask her out<br>and he really wanted to but he couldn't. His<br>mother found out about this and told him to just<br>ask her.<br><br>So the next day, he took all his courage and<br>went to the store. He bought a CD like he did<br>everyday and once again she went to the back<br>of<br>the store and came back with it wrapped. He<br>took<br>it and when she wasn't looking, he left his<br>phone number on the desk and ran out...<br><br>!!!RRRRRING!!!<br><br>The mother picked up the phone and<br>said, "Hello?"<br><br>It was the girl!!! She asked for the boy and<br>the mother started to cry and said, "You don't<br>know? He passed away yesterday...<br><br>" The line was quiet except for the cries of<br>the boy's mother. Later in the day. The mother<br>went into the boy's room because she wanted<br>to<br>remember him. She thought she would start by<br>looking at his clothes. So she opened the<br>closet. She was face to face with piles and<br>piles and piles of unopened CDs. She was<br>surprised to find all those CDs and she picked<br>one up and sat down on the bed and she<br>started<br>to open one.<br><br>Inside, there was a CD and as she took it out<br>of the wrapper, out fell a piece of paper. The<br>mother picked it up and started to read it.<br><br>It said: Hi... I think U R really cute. Do u<br>wanna go out with me? Love,Jacelyn<br><br>The mother opened another CD...<br><br>Again there was a piece of paper. It said:<br>Hi... I think U R really cute. Do u wanna go out<br>with me? Love, Jacelyn<br><br>Love is... when you've had a huge fight but<br>then decide to put aside your egos, hold hands<br>and say, "I Love You"<br></div>
