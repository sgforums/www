            <div class='col-md body'>Why is it that nice people are always taken advantage of? I grew up believing that I should be nice to people, so I have always tried my best. I have always been there to help a friend, I was there when my room mate has problem with some guys, I was there to help my ex-crush chased after the girl he likes and actually I am still helping him now. I was there to accompany him when he is lonely and dateless, but when I asked him for a few hours now, he said there is no need for him to do that. I even walked in the snow to accompany my friends to do their shopping.<br><br>It makes me cry to just think about how unfair everything is. I know I shouldn't expect anything in return. But this is much more than not getting anything in return. People know I am nice, they know I have a problem saying no to every request that is made to me, so they do whatever they can to make me do things for them. They will not only ask, they will plead and beg until I agree. Only that I am feeling so tired of doing that for years now, I exploded yesterday.I managed to stand my ground and make myself clear for the first time in many years yesterday.<br><br>I thought it is easier to be nice than bad. But turns out that it is harder. Because there is always a danger of not knowing when to stop, and when to say no.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
