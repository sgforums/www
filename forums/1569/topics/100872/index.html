Here's the lyrics <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The Voice Within Lyrics<br><br>Young girl, don't cry<br>I'll be right here when your world starts to fall<br>Young girl, it's all right<br>Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly<br><br>When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream<br>Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems<br>No one ever wants or bothers to explain<br>Of the heartache life can bring and what it means<br><br>When there's no one else<br>Look inside yourself<br>Like your oldest friend<br>Just trust the voice within<br>Then you'll find the strength<br>That will guide your way<br>If you will learn to begin<br>To trust the voice within<br><br>Young girl, don't hide<br>You'll never change if you just run away<br>Young girl, just hold tight<br>And soon you're gonna see your brighter day<br><br>Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed<br>It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid<br>No one reaches out a hand for you to hold<br>When you're lost outside look inside to your soul<br><br>When there's no one else<br>Look inside yourself<br>Like your oldest friend<br>Just trust the voice within<br>Then you'll find the strength<br>That will guide your way<br>If you will learn to begin<br>To trust the voice within<br><br>Yeah...<br>Life is a journey<br>It can take you anywhere you choose to go<br>As long as you're learning<br>You'll find all you'll ever need to know<br><br>You'll make it<br>You'll make it<br>Just don't go forsaking yourself<br>No one can stop you<br>You know that I'm talking to you<br><br>When there's no one else<br>Look inside yourself<br>Like your oldest friend<br>Just trust the voice within<br>Then you'll find the strength<br>That will guide your way<br>If you will learn to begin<br>To trust the voice within<br><br>Young girl don't cry<br>I'll be right here when your world starts to fall<br><br>i.c.y<br><br></div>
