            <div class='col-md body'>I thought I have totally gotten over my previous crush (the one before the current one I have been talking about here) but there is a chance I might be wrong...<br><br>Blame me for being soft-hearted...<br><br>Yesterday I was talking to one of my close frens and I finally told her the whole story, prolly cos I was feeling a bit vulnurable yesterday night so when she started to ask all kinda questions I just gave in without much hesitation. So all of the secrets came out *sigh*, I am not worried about her leaking em out but it is just weird to tell it to someone who knows both of us at the same time...<br><br>She is also very close to my ex-crush, and now she knows why I have always been helping him to chase after gals that he liked, how I have always remembered what he liked to eat, how I will always remember his bday and what cake to get for him when no one else remembers...and will always try my best to get a gift that I know he wants. She said now it makes sense why I am always spending time with him last time...she said she dunno how I can stand it, the pain of helping someone you love to find his true love whom you know will never be you...<br><br>At the end of the conversation, I told her how I am so afraid now to like the current guy, because at first she couldn't understand why I am so afraid to take the risk. But now she said she understand. And I just burst into tears.<br><br>Stupid, stupid me....<br><br>i.c.y</div>
