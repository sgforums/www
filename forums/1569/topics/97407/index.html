            <div class='col-md body'>I had my first date yesterday! Hehe. So here's the update of what happened:<br><br>Told me to meet him at 6 at this Korean restaurant. So I went there and actually met him halfway. He took one look at me (I was wearing the very fitting midnight blue dress) and said I looked really awesome. And he has this weird way of looking at me yesterday...like you know the phrase of someone looking you all over like trying to drink you in? Sumhow he gave me that feeling last night. I enjoyed it of cos  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>So had dinner, he paid for everything, wun even let me carry the plates to the table cos he was scared I would dirty my beautiful dress (yea, that's what he says) tho I told him I am not as clumsy as that. The dinner was alright, I think I was a bit nervous to really enjoy it. He looked a bit nervous too, so as usual I started talking crap to make both of us relaxed. I think it does work, the food took a bit longer to arrive but in the end it did. Hehe. So ate, then headed to the musical place.<br><br>There is no direct bus to that place so we were contemplating whether we should take a bus (change 2 times) or just walk there. He said we should take the bus because I was wearing my high heels and it is not suitable for walking long distance. But I was thinking that taking a bus will make us reach there faster...and I want to spend time alone with him longer. Plus I hate waiting for bus to come. So I told him I wanted to walk. He still argued that we should take a bus. But like I said, I am super stubborn. We ended up walking there hehe. It was almost an 1/2 hour walk but I think it was nice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So met up with two of our friends who had already arrived in the hall, the show started not longer after we arrived. It was quite a nice musical, I like the actress who performed in it because of her voice..it was those really strong voice which soared high into the sky...He said she sounded really loud, I told him it was supposed to be that way hehe...I was expecting it to be quite a sad musical but surprisingly I didn't cry. Apparently some girls who were sitting nearby were bawling their eyes out. I was touched by some of the poignant scenes but they were not tear-jerking for me.<br><br>So after the show, he brought me to supper (I just had a drink cos still full from dinner) and said he would pay for everything again. So then I had the bright idea to ask...why are you spending so much?? The whole date must have cost him around $100 at least...then he said he has always worked hard and kept all his money and he doesn't know whom he wants to spend the money on until he met me...I think that was sweet of him to say that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>So after supper, it was getting abit late (nearly midnight) so took the bus home, he took the bus with me all the way until the place I stay (tho earlier on his other frens have been teasing him, asking him to just go back w/o sending me home cos his home is so much nearer from the musical place..I could have killed those frens of his) He walked me back until the door of the place I stay and told me to take care and wish that I have had fun. I told him I wanted to meet him for lunch today but he said he is working so he doesn't really know when he would be available but he would call me when he is free...<br><br>So that's all for update...hmm quite a long one hehe...<br><br>i.c.y</div>
