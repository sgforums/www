As he was standing by the roadside, a family of bees came by in a little car and offered him a ride<br><br>Gratefully, he accepted.

When he turned the starter, the engine started up, much to Mr Caterpillar's amazement!<br><br>However, he did not say a word. The car went on for quite some distance before the engine died again. This time, it was Mother Bee who urinated into the fuel intake, and again, the car started up after that. The process was then repeated again for Baby Bee.<br><br>By the time the engine died for the fourth time, the little car was only a few kilometers from town. Not wanting to appear unsophisticated, Mr Caterpillar got out of the car without a word, and started opening the fuel cap.<br><br>In a flash, Papa Bee got out of the car. "What are you doing?" asked Papa Bee.<br><br>"I'm going to piss in the fuel intake, just like you did", said Mr Caterpillar.<br><br>"Oh, no", said Papa Bee patiently, "that won't do.

Since this is such a big event, the<br>girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would<br>like to go out and make love for the first time.<br><br>Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so<br>he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. The<br>pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy<br>everything there is to know about condoms and sex.<br><br>At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms<br>he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy<br>insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather<br>busy, it being his first time and all.<br><br>That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and<br>meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to<br>meet my parents, come on in!"<br><br>The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the<br>girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace<br>and bows his head.<br><br>A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his<br>head down.<br><br>10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.<br><br>Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend<br>leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you<br>were this religious."<br><br>The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was<br>a pharmacist."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Man who loved baked beans<br><br>Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion<br>for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an<br>embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him. One day he met<br>a girl and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would<br>marry, he thought to himself, she'll never go through with the<br>marriage with me carrying on like this, so he made the supreme<br>sacrifice and gave up beans.<br><br>Shortly after that they were married. A few months later, on his<br>birthday and on the way home from work, his car broke down.<br>Since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her<br>that he would be late because he had to walk home. On his way<br>home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked<br>beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk<br>he figured he could walk off any ill affects before he got home.<br><br>It was, after all, his birthday. So he went in and ordered, and<br>before leaving had 3 extra large helpings of baked beans.<br><br>All the way home he putt-putted. By the time he arrived home he<br>felt reasonably safe. His wife met him at the door and seemed<br>somewhat excited.<br><br>She exclaimed, "Darling, I have the most<br>wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!" She put a<br>blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the<br>table and made him promise not to peak. At this point he was<br>beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as his wife was<br>about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again<br>made him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she<br>went to answer the phone. While she was gone, he seized the<br>opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was<br>not only loud, but ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time<br>breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about<br>him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came<br>on. He raised his leg and RRIIPPP !!! It sounded like a diesel<br>engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he<br>tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would<br>dissipate.<br><br>He got another urge. This was a real blue ribbon<br>winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a<br>minute later the flowers on the table were dead.<br><br>With his blindfold still on, when he heard the phone farewells<br>he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top<br>of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when<br>his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if<br>he had peeked at the dinner table. After assuring her he had not<br>peeked, she removed the blindfold and yelled, "SURPRISE!!!"<br><br>To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated<br>around the table for his surprise birthday party.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little Johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his teacher picked him to answer a question. "Johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun, how many would be left?"<br><br>"None.", replied Johnny "cause the rest would fly away."<br><br>"Well, the answer is four," said the teacher. "But I like the way you are thinking."<br><br>Little Johnny said, "I have a question for you now. If there were three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one licking her cone, the second biting her cone, and the third sucking the cone, which one is married?"<br><br>"Well," said the teacher nervously, "I guess the one sucking the cone?"<br><br>"No," said Little Johnny, "the one with the wedding ring on her finger, but I like the way you are thinking."</div>
