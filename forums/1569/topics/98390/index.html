            <div class='col-md body'>Disappointment has always been a part of my life...<br><br>I called him again today...just wanted to talk to him. We met yesterday for a while and I thought I would give him a short call this morning...i dun plan to talk long or anything because I know he is really busy. Just a simple call to wish him good morning...that's all...<br><br>He picked up the phone and just when I was about to talk, he asked who is this and I told him that it was me. Then he sounded really irritated, said he was busy and put the phone down. I was left with the phone ringtone at the other end. Then he msged me...asked me why I have been messaging him so much these few days. I told him..I had not. I have hardly talked to him in fact...like only once or twice for the past few days. Then he asked why am I so free? i said I do not have exams until next week...then he said he was busy and asked me to stop bothering him.<br><br>Since when did I become a pest? And is asking someone if they want to go to dinner and lunch too much?<br><br>I can't even begin to describe how I felt. Just when I started to trust him too. So I said fine, I would stop messaging him. I said I would never ever message him or go out with him again. He only looked for me when he wants someone to accompany him. I am such a fool.<br><br>After so many failure and I have not learned my lesson. I would not trust my heart with anyone again. I would not trust love again. [Damn, I am crying. Again.]<br><br>i.c.y</div>
