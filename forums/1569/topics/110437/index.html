And who thinks it is a duty of a boyfren to accompany her girlfren to shop evtime? Actually I dun really care if he doesnt go shopping wif me, but my frens put pressure on me to force him to go wif me. I still din force him, but he went anyway cos I think he thinks I like him to do it. That's why I felt bad abt it.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
