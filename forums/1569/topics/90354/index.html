            <div class='col-md body'>icy, u already said it.. it was the situation that makes you feel that way...<br><br>and you DO NOT need to bother wat he thinks of the pictures at all... DO NOT KEEP GIVING YOURSELF REASON TO THINK OF HIM..<br><br>we cannot control time, situation or other people.. but we can control ourselves! you cant help it if he keep appearing at the worse time.. but if only your mind is FIXED, then nothing will suay u away from your decision. jus be FIRM!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
