            <div class='col-md body'>WHAT IS LOVE?<br><br>One  day,  Plato  asked his teacher, "What is love? How can I find it?" His teacher  answered,  "There  is  a  vast  wheat field in front. Walk forward without  turning  back,  and  pick  only  one  stalk.  If you find the most magnificent stalk, then you have found love."<br><br>Plato walked forward, and before long, he returned with empty hands, Having picked  nothing.<br><br>His teacher asked, "Why did you not pick any stalk?"<br><br>Plato answered, "Because I could only pick once, and yet I could not turn back. I did  find  the  most  magnificent stalk, but did not know if there were any better  ones  ahead,  so I did not pick it. As I walked further, the stalks that  I  saw  were not as good as the earlier one, so I did not pick any in the end."<br>His teacher then said, "And that is love."<br><br>WHAT IS MARRIAGE?<br><br>On  another day, Plato asked his teacher, "What is marriage? How can I find it?"  His  teacher  answered,  "There  is  a thriving forest in front. Walk forward  without turning back, and chop down only one tree. If you find the tallest tree, then you have found love."<br><br>Plato  walked  forward,  and before long, he returned with a tree. The tree was not thriving, and it was not tall either. It was only an ordinary tree.<br><br>His teacher asked, "Why did you chop down such an ordinary tree?"<br><br>Plato  answered,  "Because  of  my  previous  experience.  I walked halfway through  the  forest,  but returned with empty hands. This time, I saw this tree,  and  I felt that it was not bad, so I chopped it down and brought it back. I did not want to miss the opportunity."<br><br>His teacher then said, "And that is marriage."</div>
