            <div class='col-md body'>When I was very young, my father had one of the first telephones in our neighborhood.<br><br>I remember well, the polished old case fastened to the wall and the shiny receiver on the side of the box. I was too little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with fascination when my mother would talk to it.<br><br>Then I discovered that somewhere inside the wonderful device lived an amazing person and her name was "Information Please" and there was nothing she did not know.<br><br>"Information Please" could supply anybody's number and the correct time.<br><br>My first personal experience with this genie-in-a-bottle came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor.<br><br>Amusing myself at the tool bench in the basement, I whacked my finger with a hammer. The pain was terrible but there didn't seem to be any reason in crying because there was no one home to give me sympathy.<br><br>I walked around the house sucking my throbbing finger, finally arriving at the stairway. The telephone! Quickly, I ran for the footstool in the parlor and held it to my ear.<br><br>"Information Please," I said into the mouthpiece just above my head. A click or two and a small clear voice spoke into my ear.<br><br>"Information."<br><br>"I hurt my finger," I wailed into the phone. The tears came readily enough now that I had an audience.<br><br>"Isn't your mother home?" came the question.<br><br>"Nobody's home but me," I blubbered.<br><br>"Are you bleeding?" the voice asked.<br><br>"No," I replied. "I hit my finger with a hammer and it hurts."<br><br>"Can you open your icebox?" she asked. I said I could.<br><br>"Then chip off a piece of ice and hold it to your finger," said the voice.<br><br>After that, I called "Information Please" for everything.<br><br>I asked her for help with my geography and she told me where Philadelphia was. She helped me with my math. She told me that my pet chipmunk, which I had caught in the park just the day before, would eat fruit and nuts.<br><br>Then there was the time Petey, our pet canary died. I called "Information Please" and told her the sad story.<br><br>She listened, then said the usual thing grown ups say to soothe a child. But, I was inconsolable.<br><br>I asked her, "Why is it that birds should sing so beautifully and bring joy to all families, only to end up as a heap of feathers on the bottom of a cage?"<br><br>She must have sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly, "You must remember that there are other worlds to sing in." Somehow, I felt better.<br><br>Another day I was on the telephone. "Information Please."<br><br>"Information," said the now familiar voice.<br><br>"How do you spell fix?" I asked.<br><br>All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was nine years old, we moved across the country to Boston. I missed my friend very much. "Information Please" belonged in that old wooden box back home and somehow I never thought of trying the tall, new shiny phone that sat on the table in the hall.<br><br>As I grew into my teens, the memories of those childhood conversations never really left me. Often in moments of doubt and perplexity, I would recall the serene sense of security I had then.<br><br>I appreciated now how patient, understanding, and kind she was to have spent her time on a little boy.<br><br>A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half-an-hour or so between planes. I spent 15 minutes or so on the phone with my sister who lived there now.<br><br>Then, without thinking about what I was doing, I dialed my hometown operator and said, "Information Please."<br><br>Miraculously, I heard the small clear voice I knew so well.<br><br>"Information."<br><br>I hadn't planned this, but I heard myself saying, "Could you please tell me how to spell fix?"<br><br>There was a long pause.<br><br>Then came the soft spoken answer, "I guess your finger must be healed by now."<br><br>I laughed, "So it's really still you," I said. "I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time?"<br><br>"I wonder," she said, "if you know how much your calls meant to me. I never had any children and I used to look forward to your calls."<br><br>I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and asked if I could call her again when I came back to visit my sister.<br><br>"Please do," she said. "Just ask for Sally."<br><br>Three months later, I was back in Seattle.<br><br>A different voice answered, "Information." I asked for Sally.<br><br>"Are you a friend?" she said.<br><br>"Yes, a very old friend," I answered.<br><br>"I'm sorry to have to tell you this," she said. "Sally had been working part time in the last few years because she was sick. She died five weeks ago."<br><br>Before I could hang up she said, "Wait a minute. Are you Paul?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Well, Sally left a message for you. She wrote it down in case you called when she was too sick to work.<br><br>Let me read it to you." The note said,"Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in. He'll know what I mean."<br><br>I thanked her and hung up. I knew what Sally meant. Never underestimate the impression you make on others.<br><br>Author Unknown<br></div>
