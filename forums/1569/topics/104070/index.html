            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, I have another question. The guy I told you all about..he asked me to go and buy him a gift to give his mom on her birthday. He said he would give me $100 to spend on anything that I think would be suitable. I think he wanted me to buy a handbag for her, I told him to go together with me so that he can buy and I can help him to choose, but he refused to. He said he hates shopping and it wouldn't make a difference if I were the one to buy it on his behalf.<br><br>I dun feel good doing this. One thing, it is his Mom and he should be getting the present for her. I dunno his mom, I haven't even met her for goodness sake! So I told him just now that I wouldn't get it for him, unless he goes shopping with me. Do you think this is the correct way to deal with this? Or should I just stop making a fuss and just go and help him get it?<br><br>i.c.y</div>
