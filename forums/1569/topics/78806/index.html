            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="color: violet;"><strong>~ The Salty Coffee ~</strong></span><br><br>He met her on a party, she was so outstanding, many<br>guys chasing after her,while he was so normal, nobody<br>paid attention to him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee<br>with him, she was surprised, but to be polite, she<br>accepted his invitation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to<br>say anything, she felt uncomfortable, she thought,<br>please, let me back home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Suddenly he asked the waiter: would you please give<br>me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee.<br>Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned<br>red,but, still, he put the salt in his coffee and<br>drank it.<br><br>She asked him curiously: why you have this hobby?<br>He replied: when I was a little boy, I was living<br>near the sea, I like playing in the sea, I could felt<br>the taste of the sea, salty and bite, just like the<br>taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the<br>salty coffee,<br><br>I will think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I<br>miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who still<br>living there. Saying that, tears filled his eyes.<br>She was deeply touched.<br><br>That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart.<br>A man who can tell out his homesick, he must be a man<br>loves home, cares about home, has responsibility of<br>home..<br><br>Then she also started to talk, talked about her<br>faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was<br>a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of<br>their story.<br><br>They continue to date. She found actually he was a man<br>who meets all her demands: he was tolerance, kind<br>hearted, warm, careful...he was such a good guy but<br>she almost missed him! Thanks to his salty<br>coffee!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Then the story was just like every beautiful love<br>story: the <span style="color: blue;">princess married to the prince</span>, then they<br>were living the happy life...And, every time she made<br>coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as<br>she knew that's the way he liked.<br><br>After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter<br>which<br>said: My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my whole<br>life lie. This was the only lie I said to you----the<br>salty coffee.<br><br>Remember the first time we dated?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some<br>sugar, but I said salt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> It's hard for me to change so<br>I just go ahead. I never thought that could be the<br>start of our communication! I tried to tell you the<br>truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to<br>do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for<br>anything..Now I'm dying, I afraid of nothing so I<br>tell you the truth:  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> I don't like the salty coffee,<br>what a strange bad taste..but I have the salty coffee<br>for my whole life since I knew you,<br>I never feel sorry for anything I do for you.<br><br>Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my<br>whole life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> If I can live for the second time, I<br>still want to know you and have you as my whole life<br>wife, even though I have to drink the salty coffee<br>again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Her tears made the letter totally wet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>Someday, someone asked her: what's the taste of salty<br>coffee?<br>It's sweet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>She replied.<br><br><span style="color: green;">No matter how hard the road might get...walk...never give up.....   </span><br><br></div>
