            <div class='col-md body'>i help complete the story bah.<br><br>Wind<br><br>I like a girl called Leaf. Because she's so dependent on Tree, I have to be a<br>gust of Wind, a wind that will blow her away. When I first met her, it was one<br>month after I transferred to the new school. I saw a petite girl looking at my<br>seniors and I playing soccer. During CCA time, she would always be sitting there<br>looking at him, be it alone or with her friends. When he talked with other<br>girls, there's jealousy in her eyes. When he looked at her, there's happiness in<br>her eyes. Looking at her became my habit, the way she liked to look at him.<br><br>One day, she wasn't there. I felt something was amiss. I can't explain the<br>feeling except that it's a sense of uneasiness. The senior was also not there. I<br>went to their classroom, hid outside and saw my senior scold her. Tears were in<br>her eyes when he left. The next day, I saw her at her usual place looking at<br>him. I walked over and smiled at her, took out a note and gave it to her. She<br>was surprised. She looked at me, smiled and accepted the note. The next day, she<br>passed me a note and left.<br><br>Leaf's heart is too heavy and Wind couldn't blow her away.<br><br>It's not that Leaf's heart is too heavy. It is because Leaf never wanted to<br>leave Tree.<br><br>I replied her note with this statement and slowly she started to talk to me and<br>accepted my presents and phone calls. I know that the person she loved wasn't<br>me. But I had the perseverance that one day, I could make her like me. Within 4<br>months, I had declared my love for her no less than 20 times. Every time, she<br>would divert away from the topic. But I never gave up. If I decided I wanted her<br>to be mine, I would definitely use all means to win her over. I can't remember<br>how many times I had declared my love for her. Although I knew she would try to<br>divert, I still had a small glimmer of hope, hoping that she would agree to be<br>my girlfriend.<br><br>I didn't hear any reply from her over the phone, so I asked "What are you doing?<br>Why didn't you reply?" She said, "I'm nodding my head." "Ah?" I couldn't believe<br>my ears. "I'm nodding my head," she replied loudly. I hanged up the phone,<br>changed quickly, took a taxi, rushed to her place and pressed her door bell.<br>When she opened the door. I hugged her tightly. Leaf's departure is because of<br>Wind's pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay.</div>
