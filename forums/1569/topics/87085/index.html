            <div class='col-md body'>number 1:<br><br>A professor gave us a pop quiz.<br>I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions,<br>until  I read the last one: "What is the first name of the woman who cleans<br>the  school?"<br><br>Surely this was some kind of joke.  I had seen the cleaning woman several<br>times.  She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her<br>name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank.<br><br>Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count<br>toward our quiz grade.  "Absolutely," said the professor.  "In your careers,<br>you will meet many people.  All are significant. They deserve your attention<br>and care, even if all you do is smile and say 'hello'."<br><br>I've never forgotten that lesson.  I've also never forgotten her name was<br>Dorothy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Her car<br>had broken down and she desperately needed a ride.  Soaking wet, she<br>decided to flag down the next car.  A young white man stopped to help her,<br>generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s.<br><br>The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a<br>taxi cab.  She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and<br>thank ed him.<br><br>Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door.  To his surprise, a<br>giant console color TV was delivered to his home A special note was<br>attached.  It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway<br>the other night.  The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my<br>spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my<br>dying husband's bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for<br>helping me and unselfishly serving others."<br><br>Sincerely, Mrs.  Nat King Cole.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>number 3:Always remember those who serve.<br><br>In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10-year-old boy<br>entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table.  A waitress put a glass of<br>water in front of him.  "How much is an ice cream sun dae?" he asked.  "Fifty<br>cents," replied the waitress.  The little boy pulled his hand out of his<br>pocket and studied the coins in it.  "Well, how much is a plain dish of ice<br>cream?" he inquired.<br><br>By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing<br>impatient.  "Thirty-five cents," she brusquely replied."<br>The little boy again counted his coins.  "I'll have the plain ice cream,"<br>he said.  The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and<br>walked away.<br><br>The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left.  When the<br>waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table.<br>There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five<br>pennies<br><br>- You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he<br>had to have enough left to leave her a tip.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>number 4:The Obstacle in Our Path<br><br>In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway.  Then he hid<br>himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock.  Some of<br>the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked<br>around it.  Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but<br>none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.<br>Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables.  Upon approaching<br>the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to<br>the side of the road.  After much pushing and straining, he finally<br>succeeded.<br><br>After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying<br>in the road where the boulder had been.  The purse contained many gold<br>coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person<br>who removed the boulder from the roadway.  The peasant learned what many<br>of us never understand.  <span style="color: red;">Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve<br>our condition</span>.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>number 5: Giving When it Counts<br><br>Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a<br>little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease.<br>Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her<br>5-year-old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had<br>developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness.<br><br>The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the<br>little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister.  I saw<br>him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, "Yes,<br>I'll do it if it will save her."<br><br>As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled,<br>as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks.  Then his face grew<br>pale and his smile faded.  He looked up at the doctor and asked with a<br>trembling voice, "Will I start to die right away?"<br><br>Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was<br>going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some good advice to live with:<br><br>1.Do not get drunk and talk to other people's girlfriends.<br><br>2.Do not stick your fingers in cigar cutters when you're drunk just because someone said "Hey stick your finger in here!"<br><br>3.Despite what we'd all like to think, not EVERYTHING is smokable.<br><br>4.Don't throw frisbee's at lit lightbulbs.<br><br>5.Eating a one-pound block of cheese is not a good idea.<br><br>6.Don't take pills just because they are there.<br><br>7.Don't get drunk and run around naked at a shopping center.<br><br>8.Yes, petrol smells good, but don't smell it for too long.<br><br>9.It is not fun to dance on the roof despite the thrill.<br><br>10.Most cats have claws so don't blow in their face just because they make a funny face.<br><br>11.If the girl you see in a bar is hot and drunk, she probably has boyfriend that is big and drunk.<br><br>12.If you see a homeless guy that looks like he's dead, don't try to wake him up.<br><br>13.And don't laugh at him either.<br><br>14.Just because they are wearing sunglasses doesn't mean that they are blind.<br><br>15.Don't hit shopping carts with your car, as fun as it may seem.<br><br>16.No it's not fun to get drunk and hit your drunk friend in the face with a champaign cork.<br><br>17.Do not burn things in the bathroom.<br><br>18.Disposing of a used condom in the toilet bowl is never a good idea, no matter how good an idea it seems at that time.<br><br>19.Don't try the above in your girlfriend's home either.<br><br>20.Don't show up at your friend's house with a bottle of Jack Daniels in your hand; his/her parents are sometimes at home.<br><br>21.Getting drunk and knocking on random people's doors at 2 AM may result in you meeting an angry man with a gun.<br><br>22.Yes, those goofy fake wrestling moves really do hurt.<br><br>23.Don't tempt drunk friends to "Spray me with that mace, i fu**ing dare you," because if they are drunk, they will.<br><br>24.Parents rarely believe that you're using the lighter to light candles.<br><br>25.If you work at a fast food place, and someone pulls up to the drive through and gets all cockey, don't spit in their food, give it to them and say "f**k off goat fu**er" under your breath because they may be your grandparents.<br><br>26.Girls know that you're not bending down underneath your desk JUST to get your pencil.<br><br>27.Just ignore those people who are selling you crappy toys and stuff at the ferry terminal and don't start scolding at them, they probably have knives.<br><br>28.This isn't TV; the bottles don't break on people's heads, they give them concussions.<br></div>
