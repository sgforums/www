            <div class='col-md body'>One fine day, a bus driver went to the bus garage, started his bus,<br>and drove off along the route.  No problem for the first few stops -- a<br>few people got on, a few got off, and things went generally well.<br>At the next stop, however, a big hulk of a guy got on.  Six feet<br>eight,built like a wrestler, arms hanging down to the ground.  He glared at the driver and said, "Big John doesn't pay!" and sat down at the<br>back.Did I mention that the driver was five feet three, thin, and<br>basically meek?  Well, he was.  Naturally, he didn't argue with Big John, but<br>he wasn't happy about it.<br><br>the next day the same thing happened -- Big John got on again, made a<br>show of refusing to pay, and sat down.  And the next day, and the one<br>after that, and so forth.  This grated on the bus driver, who started<br>losing sleep over the way Big John was taking advantage of him.<br><br>Finally he could stand it no longer.  He signed up for body building<br>courses, karate, judo, and all that good stuff.  By the end of the<br>summer, he had become quite strong; what's more, he felt really good<br>about himself.<br><br>So on the next Monday, when Big John once again got on the bus and<br>said,"Big John doesn't pay!", the driver stood up, glared back at the<br>passenger, and screamed, "And why not?"<br><br>With a surprised look on his face, Big John replied, "Big John has a bus pass."<br><br>Moral of the story :<br>Be sure there is a problem in the first place before working hard to<br>solve one.
