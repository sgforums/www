Wat wld u do? still face it knowin u cannot cope? Or jus ignore n run away from it....<br><br>U can run but u can't hide, soon or later u will face it....e past wld b back to hunt bac e undead....</div></blockquote>why dun u see this another way?<br>There is someone who told me this before..<br>" In life.. u will always have choices.. tat means.. either u make it, or u break it. Only with this sort of attidtude then u are able to struggle through life"<br>u must understand for most of us..life isnt all that smooth flowing.. most of the time, its hard, tough, full of bad surprises and things beyond our control. Som,e people i know even say that, trying to live, is a sturggle. It is a struggle that will not end until the day u sleep inside a coffin. Tat means that even if u are able to run away from one problem, u will not be able to run away from the next one. It is better to solve it and move on, instaed of stalling on it.<br><br>Always remember ur goal in life and move towards it.. the day u lost all goals in life, can mean two things.. either u are temporary too stressed by situations, or else its about tiem for u to go somewhere in heavens.<br><br>To sum it off,<br>Live.. and find meaning in it.. Decide for urself what means the most to u, pirotize ur goals and work towards it. The main thing is to leave the world with no regrets.. long / short life doesnt matte. ^^</div>
