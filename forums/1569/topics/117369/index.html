            <div class='col-md body'>Dun really agreed with all of it.<br><br>1. If a man wants you, nothing can keep him away. If he doesn't want you, nothing can make him stay.<br>2. Stop making excuses for a man and his behavior.<br>3. If you have ANY doubt in your mind about a man's character, leave him alone.<br>4. Allow your intuition (or spirit) to save you fromheartache.<br>5. Stop trying to change yourself for a relationship that's not meant to be.<br>6. Don't force an attraction.<br>7. Slower is better.<br>8. Never live your life for a man before you find what makes you truly happy.<br>9. If a relationship ends because the man was not treating you as you deserve then heck no you can't "be friends." A friend wouldn't mistreat a friend.<br>10 Have faith in God regarding your relationship, but don't let faith make you stupid. God does things decent and in order.<br>11. Don't settle.<br>12. If you feel like he is stringing you along, then he probably is.<br>13. If he keeps changing his mind about the relationship- -take that as a BIG sign that he is unstable. Do you really want to be with a man like that?.<br>14. Don't stay because you think "it will get better". You'll be mad at yourself a year later for staying when things are not better.<br>15. Honorable men take care of their business and aren't involved in a whole lot of mess.<br>16. The only person you can control in a relationship is you.<br>17. There's only one 'reason' a man dumps you; he doesn't want you.<br>18. Avoid men who've got a bunch of children by a bunch of different woman. He didn't marry them when he got them pregnant, why would he treat you any differently?<br>19. You really do have to kiss a few frogs before finding the prince.<br>20. Always put yourself and your happiness first.<br>21. Always have your own set of friends separate from his.<br>22. Maintain boundaries in how a guy treats you. If something bothers you, speak up.<br>23. Like from the show Sex and the City, if he doesn't call, he just isn't that interested.<br>24. Be honest and upfront.<br>25. Know when to cut the cord, don't be strung along.<br>26. Don't fall for the "I'm confused role". Remove yourself from the situation to let him figure things out (but don't wait for him, move on).<br>27. If you want to have a clue as to how he will treat you, watch how he treats the WOMEN in his family (not just mom).<br>28. There's more than physical abuse, there's emotional and mental abuse. If he causes any of them....flee.<br>29. You cannot change a man's behaviors. Change comes from within.<br>30. Don't let him place rules on you that he is not willing to follow himself -- double-standard.<br>31. Don't EVER make him feel he is more important than you are...even if he has more education or in a better job.<br>32. Do not make him into a quasi-god. He is a man, nothing more nothing less.<br>33. Demand respect and if he can't give it, he can't have you!<br>34. Don't compete with other woman, but be aware that men are attracted to what they see.<br>35. If you think he is cheating, he probably is. Confront him right away and if you feel he's lying, let him go.<br>36. Actions speak louder than words.<br>37. Never let a man define who you are.<br>38. Never rely on a man for compliments, look to yourself for that.<br>39. Never borrow someone else's man.<br>40. If he cheated with you, he'll cheat on you.<br>41. Just because he says he loves you, doesn't mean that he won't hurt you and it doesn't mean that you are meant to be with him.<br>42. To use painful hard-won wisdom -- 'get it right' the next time.<br>43. Know that you deserve to be the number one person in the life of the. 1person in your life.<br>44. Love is a verb ...<br>45. Learn to give up your lifelong task of trying to make someone unavailable-available, someone ungiving-giving, and someone unloving-loving.<br>46. A man will only treat you the way you ALLOW him to treat you.<br>47. All men are NOT dogs.<br>48. You should not be the one doing all the bending...compromise is a two way street.<br>49. If you don't love self...you can't love anyone else.<br>50. You cannot mend someone else's broken heart.<br>51. You need time to heal between relationships..... there is nothing cute about baggage..... deal with your issues before pursuing a new relationship.<br>52. You should never look for someone to COMPLETE you.... a relationship consists of two WHOLE individualss..... look for someone complementary...not supplementary.<br>53. Dating is fun...even if he doesn't turn out to be Mr.Right.<br>54. NEVER give more in a relationship than you are getting out of it.<br>55. Never become your man's "therapist".<br>56. When actions and words conflict, believe the actions. Respond to the actions.<br>57. A real healthy relationship requires two people. One person can end it - but it takes two to make it work.<br>58. Don't fall for the "I'm not the loving type".. when a man loves you there is nothing in this world (within reason) that he wouldn't do for you<br>59. Make him miss you sometimes... when a man always know where you are, and you're always readily available to him he takes it for granted.<br>60. Give him his space...let him go out with his boys don't pressure him to spend time with you, You cant force a man to hang out with you.<br>61. If you wouldn't allow your daughter to be with him you shouldn't.<br>62. Never let a man know everything. He will use it against you later.<br>63. Never move into his mother's house.<br>64. Provide financially for yourself and don't depent on anyone.<br>65. Never co-sign for a man.<br>66. Never believe you have the perfect guy and he is so innocent.<br>67. Never spoil your man; let him spoil you.<br>68. Never let a man mess up your credit.<br>69. When it's time to let go; let go.<br>70. Good men should be treated like good men.<br>71. Don't play games.<br>72. Don't fully commit to a man who doesn't give you everything that you need.<br>73. Keep him in your radar but get to know others.<br>74. Compatibility in terms of educational attainment, values, beliefs, personal and career goals, and socioeconomic status, are important.<br>75. Never date a guy who wears colored contacts.</div>
