I realized that there are a lot of people here who can really emphatize with me, maybe because they have gone through this before and feel the same pain I am feeling now. I know I doesn't matter to him, it kinda hurts to think that it has been almost 5 days since I blocked him, didn't contact him and he didn't even realize it. I know I am not supposed to think of this. But I can't help feeling sad because I have no place in his heart at all. But in a way this tells me I have made the right decision because why should I care for someone who doesn't care about me? At least I know I am not wrong in letting go...<br><br>i.c.y</div>
