            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>A long time ago, there was a huge apple tree. A little boy loved to come and<br>play around it everyday. He climbed to the tree top, ate the apples, took a nap under the shadow...He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him. Time went by...the little boy had grown up and he no longer played around the tree everyday.<br><br>One day, the boy came back to the tree and he looked sad. "Come and<br>play<br>with me," the tree asked the boy.<br>"I am no longer a kid, I don't play around trees anymore." The boy<br>replied,<br>"I want toys. I need money to buy them."<br>"Sorry, but I don't have money... but you can pick all my apples and<br>sell<br>them. So, you will have money."<br>The boy was so excited. He grabbed all the apples on the tree and<br>left<br>happily. The boy never came back after he picked the apples. The<br>tree was<br>sad.<br>One day, the boy returned and the tree was so excited. "Come and<br>play<br>with<br>me!" the tree said.<br>"I don't have time to play. I have to work for my family. We need a<br>house<br>for shelter. Can you help me?"<br>"Sorry, but I don't have a house. But you can chop off my branches<br>to<br>build<br>your house." So the boy cut all the branches of the tree and left<br>happily.<br><br>The tree was glad to see him happy but the boy never came back since<br>then.<br><br>The tree was again lonely and sad.<br>One hot summer day, the boy returned and the tree was delighted.<br>"Come<br>and<br>play with me!" the tree said.<br>"I am sad and getting old. I want to go sailing to relax myself. Can<br>you<br>give me a boat?"<br>"Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be<br>happy."<br>So the boy cut the tree trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and<br>never<br>showed up for a long time.<br><br>Finally, the boy returned after he left for so many years.<br>"Sorry, my boy. But I don't have anything for you anymore. No more<br>apples<br>for you... " the tree said.<br>"I don't have teeth to bite." the boy replied.<br>"No more trunk for you to climb on."<br>"I am too old for that now." the boy said.<br>"I really can't give you anything ... the only thing left is my<br>dying<br>roots." the tree said with tears.<br>"I don't need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all<br>these<br>years." the boy replied.<br>"Good! Old tree roots is the best place to lean on and rest. Come,<br>Come<br>sit down with me and rest."<br>The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears.......<br><br>This is a story of everyone. The tree is our parents.<br>When we were young, we loved to play with Mom and Dad...<br>When we grown up, we left them...only came to them when we need<br>something<br>or when we are in trouble.<br>No matter what, parents will always be there and give everything<br>they<br>could<br>to make you happy. You may think the boy is cruel to the tree but<br>that's<br>how all of us are treating our parents, or are we not?<br><br>Please enlighten all your friends by forwarding this mail to them.<br>And<br>love your parents.<br></div>
