            <div class='col-md body'>he came to see me today. Yes. The old him, who has hurt me countless time before. The one who rejected me and was kinda on cold war with me for these two weeks.<br><br>He told me that he is now a bit calmer already. He told he was really shocked when I told him I like him the other day. Perhaps because he felt kinda 'betrayed'..cos he had always looked upon me as a confidante more than anything else. He felt like I had been keeping sumthing from him when I listened to him all this while...I told him I was sincere on helping him even when I like him because his happiness is the most important thing to me...<br><br>But now that he is calmer he said he is willing to discuss stuff with me. So I told him when I started to like him, all the things he had done, some of them he had forgotten but would always remain so clearly in my mind. After that I told him about the guy who now likes me...<br><br>So we talked for nearly 2 hours. It is definitely one of the longest conversations I have had with him. In the end, I cried in front of him when he told me to let go and give myself and the new guy a brand new chance. He told me that he admired my courage for confessing to him and now I would only need more courage to let go and forget him so that I wouldn't hurt so much anymore. He said the argument last week has made him felt really guilty and bad because he realized I have always been such a good fren to him. And he apologized finally for being so childishly, for not handling my confession a little better. But it was because he had never had any girl confessing to him before and he did not know how to handle his emotion at that moment...<br><br>And he told me that love is all about strength and courage. Esp the courage to forgive myself, to be able to love myself once more. To be able to let go and live life once again. He said he was not worthy of my love, that the new guy would do a better job loving me than he would ever do.<br><br>He said everything so gently that I just burst into tears. I had not planned to cry in front of him. I had promised myself that i would not ever do so. But looking at him, at the face I have dreamed of so often, I coudl not help myself. He held me for a while and wish me good luck with everything. And he told me our friendship was very important to him. These two weeks he had felt like he had lost a close friend and he had been worrying about how I felt. But he had to give himself sometime to cool down first after the initial shock before he could fully confront me again.<br><br>I guess I have been waiting for this to finally be able to let go. ..<br><br>i.c.y</div>
