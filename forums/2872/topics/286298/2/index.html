I’m sure that most of them are perfectly<br><br>capable of rational thought, yet they choose to fall back on the “known” moralities of<br><br>their religious traditions. This is a fall back, especially in a pluralist democracy,<br><br>because they are constantly exposed to the public dialogues about morality, but<br><br>willfully choose to ignore the knowledge of their society in favor of ready-made<br><br>moralities. It is further a failure of intellect in its simplicity: Religious morality is,<br><br>more often than not, devoid of all complexity, seeing the world in stark binary<br><br>terms. There are no difficult moral questions or conundrums, because all is obvious.<br><br>I like to think of this as a perceived “moral clarity”.<br><br><a href="http://toddshammer.wordpress.com/2006/11/04/religion-as-a-failure-of-moral-reasoning/" rel="nofollow">http://toddshammer.wordpress.com/2006/11/04/religion-as-a-failure-of-moral-reasoning/</a></div></blockquote>Wah lau this forum open liao never invite moi. Waste my sapport sia, spadey.<br><br>Ok, craps aside. I have read the entire article, though the author seems to be rooting for gay rights at the last few paragraphs, what he has mentioned do make sense (just to clarify my stand, I'm a straight).<br><br>He made me waste time opening up many Answers.com windows just to understand his text, but in essence, what he is trying to say is that people tend to justify their actions through religion rather than through logic as it is the easier way out. Using his gay example, Christians would simply look at it and say "Oh, my bible says gaying is a sin. So this is wrong up-down-left-right," instead of looking it from other perspectives, like biologically (kinda queer to me though).<br><br>Imo, I think it's that people are getting overly-dependent on their religions. Any religion, excluding cults, is created for the good of the people, which is what I believe. I was told that Islams forbidded pork and dogs because they were common parasite carriers back then. When I look at food offerings, I would think that people in the past had tried to come up with an ingenious way to let those desperate and hungry ones on the streets having something to eat, without creating a reliance for others to give them food. So by people making food offerings to their gods, it will "filter" those who are dying of hunger and the others who can survive for the next few days and may able to find alternatives to get food in the meantime, since the former wouldn't mind offending his gods as he is about to die anyway. The undesirable consequences that comes with eating those offerings would deter them from developing reliance. Then of course, you have all those karma and confession thing coming in, so that people wouldn't dwell on their mistakes, but instead begin on working to be a better person from that point of time. So basically, our ancenstors have laid such a good "infrastructure" for us to live in already, using religions and beliefs.<br><br>But like what the 21st century Man has did to Mother Earth, Man is now screwing up all the efforts their ancenstors have done. They become overly-reliant on it. They start to think that if you have faith as small as a pea, you can command a mountain to move from A to B. So some of them would pray every day to move the money from the nearby bank to his house, hoping one day it will come true. Of course, that's an extreme, but my point is there. <strong>They have turned their religion into a superstition.</strong> They decided to stop exploring new possibilities by defining anything undefined as an effect of their religion.<br><br>"Why that ger dun like me?!?!" - "Karma."<br>"So it's ok if I do bad thing?" - "You exerting karma."<br>"Why Toto never strike?!?" - "need to kowtow 108 times at some ABC temple every full moon"<br>"Why she die..." - "It's pre-destined."<br><br>If people think that way, they will never progress as a society. They simply become stuck forever in a trial-and-error loop. If this was how Thomas Edison thought, he would still be testing his bulb with the first metal he started with, then complain for the 1098th time, "haiya, here aura not good, change position tmr and try again" and die before the next sunrise.<br><br><strong>Religion, at most, should only be a guide book in people's lives, not a template for their diaries.</strong> When we are lost and on our own, we can refer to them not to determine our paths, but to guide us through ours. If copying homework in school all the time means that you are not getting the full sum out of your school fees, then living by the book from cover to back is simply wasting your life.<br><br>It maybe, just maybe, could be that our ancenstors have not expected their religions to be passed on for so long, till now. So we have issues like burning of incense papers which contributes to global warming, food rotting at altars which could possibly be enough to feed the entire Africa population, healthy dogs and tasty pork, scientists coming up with the theory of evolution which goes against the origin of Man in Christianity etc. Alas, we may have come to a road split, I suppose. From here, we may choose to firmly believe in our religion, or to be on the other side and believe in science. But what's more important would be to believe in our choice, and ultimately, believe in ourselves.<br><br>*Edited for grammar.*<br></div>

Well, I noe of an event in these world tat  tries to remove all religion and culture... tat is the cultural revolution tat happens in china...
