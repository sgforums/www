            <div class='col-md body'>An Excerpt:<br><br>"In some ways I think that the moral failings of the religious boil down to a failure of<br><br>intellect and a misfiring of imagination. IÂ’m sure that most of them are perfectly<br><br>capable of rational thought, yet they choose to fall back on the Â“knownÂ” moralities of<br><br>their religious traditions. This is a fall back, especially in a pluralist democracy,<br><br>because they are constantly exposed to the public dialogues about morality, but<br><br>willfully choose to ignore the knowledge of their society in favor of ready-made<br><br>moralities. It is further a failure of intellect in its simplicity: Religious morality is,<br><br>more often than not, devoid of all complexity, seeing the world in stark binary<br><br>terms. There are no difficult moral questions or conundrums, because all is obvious.<br><br>I like to think of this as a perceived Â“moral clarityÂ”.<br><br><a href="http://toddshammer.wordpress.com/2006/11/04/religion-as-a-failure-of-moral-reasoning/" rel="nofollow">http://toddshammer.wordpress.com/2006/11/04/religion-as-a-failure-of-moral-reasoning/</a></div>
