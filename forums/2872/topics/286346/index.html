            <div class='col-md body'>Big problems in teens and even working adults nowadays hor ?<br><br>look at "maplers" "o2jammers" "dota-ers" "wow-ers" "cs-ers"<br>of course theres more lah.<br><br>i mean look at the society now, 10 years ago where such thing didn't exist, was there more problems or is there now less problems.<br>look at it this way, people have gained and lost through it. If you guys didn't know, there are people who played video games so much, they died. Don't sound like a major problem ? think about your kids, future kids, nephews, nieces, brothers, sisters, even parents.<br>i was once addicted to some games and it took great determination to stop the addiction.<br><br>personally, i feel its a major problem. even adults cant control when it comes to many mmorpgs. maybe to the others, they dun care lah. but people die from it, i mean die from virtual things. and another problem is the buying of currency of games using real cash. like those you know what games they are la.... although some ppl will argue that you are not addicted by paying real currency for virtual currency, i feel that it is actually addiction to the game that brought you to the extend of using cash for virtual cash.<br><br>any close friends/ppl you know are addicted ?<br>what problems did it caused.<br>whats your view ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>10 years ago, we are not addicted to computer games, simply because there weren't good ones and Internet speeds weren't as fast as it is today.<br><br>Move back 10 years, there are gameboys, Digimon, Tamagochi, etc. And there are some who are seriously addicted to it.<br><br>The problems faced 10 years ago will not be much different than what we are going to face today.<br><br>10 years ago, one can spend nearly all his waking hours on that game, 10 years later, one could still do the same.<br><br>The problems are still the same -<br><br>1. Lack of physical exercise which could result in death. It's been reported.<br><br>2. Social problems. Being in contact with a dead object nearly all the time doesn't give one the opportunity to socialize with others. In the short term, some may find it hard to communicate with others, in the long term, some have actually developed a phobia to people, which requires some form of psychiatric help to help them to adjust back to normal lives.<br><br>3. Attention issues. Some can no longer focus due to the addiction. They would rather game all day than do work.<br><br>As with everything, one should limit how much time they should spend doing a particular activity. Doing too much is not good, neither is too little time spend good either.</div>
