            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I feel that being Single is more happier than married. The reason is because I love freedom, less expensive/expenses and no commitment needed.

When u eventually start working, u'll have money &amp; remember to save up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>And when u eventually start working, ur mindset about being single might change drastically. So dun be too sure yet. The significant someone might be just round the corner <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for me, I have been working for a significant number of years to date. In my opinion, I would opt to be single whenever possible. Yes, the good thing about being single is that you do not need to consider about partner's feelings &amp; free enough to roam wherever you please. Emotions will always be normal.<br><br>Some would say that lonliness will set in but i feel that given the multiple problems of a relationship, i rather battle lonliness <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My vote goes to singlehood <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
