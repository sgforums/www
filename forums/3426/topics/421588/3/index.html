              <p>I am an OMO . I used  to have relief before I decided to be
              hirer . Been a hirer for 4 yrs and with relief for 6 years . I have
              driven a taxi for for 10 years . Its tough but I still love the
              job. You need the passion and the drive to drive a cab . Otherwise
              if you are in the bz  for a short period then its better to be
              a relief.  </p>

              <p>I would think in order to stay in the trade longer, it's better to be a relief or to have a relief.</p>
              <p>OMO imho, would tired ourselves out very soon.</p>

              <p>maybe benqepson is saying about passion in travelling around with his taxi .</p>

              <p>i have mentioned to many of my friends .....</p>
              <p>I became a better person driving a cab .</p>
              <p>I became a more knowledgeable person after driving a cab .</p>
              <p>Cos i talked and learnt from different passengers .</p>
              <p>Cos i talked with more foreigners than any other profession i am in  .</p>
              <p>I became a better person cos i enjoy my lifestyle .</p>
              <p>I can watch my soccer on TV , almost every night or even midnight , be it at coffee ship , pubs , internet streaming , i love to watch soccer . And yet i do not need to see a doctor for a MC after that .</p>
              <p>Many took MC during World Cup and European Cup .</p>
              <p>I do not need that .</p>
              <p>I can play my favourite game of badminton at cck on tuesday thursday , and yet i do not need to apply leave to do that , and that i can still earn money after that !</p>
              <p>I can see my chidren in the afternoon after their schools .</p>
              <p>The only thing was that i do not see my wife very often , only after i came back from work , when she is asleep .</p>
              <p>But come to think of it , seldom see her also good ! Hahahahahah</p>

              <p>Taxi driving, to me, is just a means to an end.</p>
              <p>There's no love or passion on my part.</p>
              <p>I just love the $$ at the end of my shift.</p>
              <p>In fact, I've thought of quitting almost few months back.</p>
              <p>Peoples have been following up on me wanting me to get back to what I do for the last 15 years.</p>
              <p>I'm still hesitating and still seriously considering.</p>
              <p>The only thing I like about taxi driving is the stress free feeling at the end of my shift.</p>
              <p>No work to think about. No work to follow up. No leftover work.</p>
              <p>Best of all NO Dateline.</p>
