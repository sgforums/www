              <p>For me as long as I can earn my targetted income for my family,do what also can lah as long as it is an honest living, coming to 40 liao having half past six education wat can I expect?</p>
              <p>I agree with pool since our job is to drive,might as well enjoy wat we are doing</p>
              <p>not so much as in enjoying driving a taxi,but rather enjoy the flexible lifestyle driving a taxi can gives u</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>be it more time to watch soccer,more time to spend with family &amp; extra time to venture into other biz opportunities...all these without having to worry your boss showing u the exit door the very next morning</p>
              <p>but of course if u have at least a decent diploma &amp; have some market value,I would say you are insane to chose taxi as an alternative to wat you're currently doing</p>

              <p>Hi all gurus...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I m back in action again, being driving n driving for the past few days. Thanks for all the reply, really interesting and it give me some good knowledge and also pointer that i need to take note before I make this big decision. The reason for me to consider this option is due to my current full time work is not even providing 1k at the moment as my job is more towards commission base. And from what I see, its not going to pick up in the near future of 1 to 2 years. So that's why I need to source for a new income. For the past 10 months, I started as a hirer, but due to my full time job I only can last 2 months. Than I started my relief drive. Am driving alternate nights on weekdays and full day on sat and sunday. So more or less I know the ups and down on being a hirer and also a relief. But because I do have a car myself, So am thinking if I give up my full time job and take the wish 2.0 for 81 bucks nett per day, it can cover my transport expenses as will be doing my own business, i can sell off my car n also lower my expenses. As my hirer is charging me 50 bucks for night n 100 bucks for dayon a magentis. Have gone down to check out the rate of transcab few days ago. But the girl at the counter mention something that transcab might be putting on hold for registrating new wish until further notice. Any Guru here have anything regarding about this? Thanks again for the good advices and posting that u guys contribute. I wishes all a fruitful and healthy year ahead HUAT AH!!!!</p>

              <p>Full time job less than 1k? then driving taxi can be a good option. And it is true you will save a lot from selling your car, clever.</p>
              <p>Then is alot of cab companies bidding for COEs which is at the same basis as private car. And LTA is reducing the quotas by month which ultimately jack up the COEs. On the other hand, private car sellers are asking LTA to consider taxis as a different entity in bidding for vehicle, because with taxi in, COEs is damn high for private car leading to less business for them. I got a few car salesmen friends thinking of quitting and drive taxi too. Some become 2nd hand car salesmen. I believe LTA is consider the option now base on both political and economy fronts.</p>

              Thanks poolman for all the information, must consider properly before i plung into the hole, and also which hole to go.... ha ha ha..... as m staying in North area, pumping of CNG might be a hassle...... must weight the mileage and also time going to be wasted on travelling to station n queing up. I m currently running 280km average for night shift only. On Sat and Sun normal mileage will be 480, so it will be at least 2 pump on weekend n 1 pump for weekday...... Especially the cost of running as taxi do run a lot........
