              <p>Dear to all Guru,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently driving as a relief driver for silver cab. Thinking of giving up my full time job becoming a full time taxi driver. Would like to ask all guru which cab comapny offers the best deal for full time n if possible can advice on the daily rental? Currently m looking at 2 company, 1 transcab wish and also comfort delgro sonata. I believe there is contract for both company, n wouldn't mind waiting for a brand new cab. Please do give me some advice n really appricate it. And also another small queries, regarding about the mention post that i see, that is regarding about speeding. Is it because of Gps fitted on the car as for them to track cabby whether they r speeding?</p>

              <p><br>Hi, i am not a guru, but i suggest you think carefully before giving up yr full time job, do not think that taxi driving is the easiet way out of your current job issues, once you go into taxi driving, it maybe good for the first few weeks as you chiong all the way, but later I bet everyone here will know that at time, it become a kind of very sian to drive day after day. And that is where you start to think of going back to work and need to find group of same interest to chat up. After few years driving, you lose all your working skill and most probably will drive taxis forever.</p>
              <p>TD is the same in any job, you need to be discipline, plan well, work hard and more importantly, smart. Which ever company you take, the give and take benefits and perks are more or less an equal sum, some hv this, some dun have but got that and so on. But I believe that as long as you got discipline and all the above ethics in working, whether trans or CDG makes not much differences. But if you do not have the discipline, work hard and smart, even given a top and best Company is also useless</p>

              <p><br> Hi, i am not a guru, but i suggest you think carefully before
              giving up yr full time job, do not think that taxi driving is the
              easiet way out of your current job issues, once you go into taxi
              driving, it maybe good for the first few weeks as you chiong all
              the way, but later I bet everyone here will know that at time, it
              become a kind of very sian to drive day after day. And that is
              where you start to think of going back to work and need to find
              group of same interest to chat up. After few years driving, you
              lose all your working skill and most probably will drive taxis
              forever.</p>
              <p>TD is the same in any job, you need to be discipline, plan well,
              work hard and more importantly, smart. Which ever company you take,
              the give and take benefits and perks are more or less an equal sum,
              some hv this, some dun have but got that and so on. But I believe
              that as long as you got discipline and all the above ethics in
              working, whether trans or CDG makes not much differences. But if
              you do not have the discipline, work hard and smart, even given a
              top and best Company is also useless</p>

              <p>No point dissuading these guys. Only when they drive for a long long time then they will know , by that time , its too late to turn back.</p>

              <p>1 Scenario : 12MN Clarke Quay &gt; Woodlands</p>
              <p>One Sonata vs One Cedric</p>
              <p>Sonata rental $53 vs Cedric $40</p>
              <p>By 12.25pm , we could see Sonata reaching Woodlands in 25 minutes time .</p>
              <p>It might take 30 or more minutes for a Cedric to reach .</p>
              <p>By 12.30pm , this Sonata could be on his way to SLE .</p>
              <p>Then this Cedric just touched down at Wlands .</p>
              <p>By 1am , this Cedric maybe at 1am , then hit Clarke Quay again ....</p>
              <p>But that Sonata , already got one connection at Quay at 12.50am .</p>
              <p>one trip , 10 minutes differences .</p>
              <p>10 trips , 100 minutes , one hr 40 minutes .</p>
              <p>Meaning this Cedric will get one hr 40 minutes <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">less </span></strong>of salary per hour , compared to a Sonata .</p>

              <p><br> U have got no idea how "deafening" a cedric and crown can caused to
              your ears !</p>
              <p>And fuel consumption so high , it's back to Square-one .</p>
              <p>And this machines are so slow .</p>
              <p>1 Scenario : 12MN Clarke Quay &gt; Woodlands</p>
              <p>One Sonata vs One Cedric</p>
              <p>Sonata rental $53 vs Cedric $40</p>
              <p>By 12.25pm , we could see Sonata reaching Woodlands in 25
              minutes time .</p>
              <p>It might take 30 or more minutes for a Cedric to reach .</p>
              <p>By 12.30pm , this Sonata could be on his way to SLE .</p>
              <p>Then this Cedric just touched down at Wlands .</p>
              <p>By 1am , this Cedric maybe at 1am , then hit Clarke Quay again
              ....</p>
              <p>But that Sonata , already got one connection at Quay at 12.50am
              .</p>
              <p>one trip , 10 minutes differences .</p>
              <p>10 trips , 100 minutes , one hr 40 minutes .</p>
              <p>Meaning this Cedric will get one hr 40 minutes
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">less</span></strong> of salary per
              hour , compared to a Sonata .</p>
              <p>Got it ?</p>
