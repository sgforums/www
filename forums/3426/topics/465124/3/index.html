                  I see in this angleâ€¦most Tds after driving a while will find that CDG is still the better option if really wan to tan jiak (if they can take their â€œpax orientedâ€� policies). More calls...during bad times some calls cud be live savers (Join talkie grp is also addl costs)., easy to pump petrol, find relief, cabcharge (civil service use),,,etc all already know. If the new I40 rates are true there wl be long q waiting to sign up.

              Even those garmen policies recently are all favoring this big brother and helping the co to strengthen its already dominant positionâ€¦ Mileage/peak hour % requirement,,,CDG already fulfillingâ€¦All taxi operators must hv GPS booking systemâ€¦ rooftop signs must be centrally controlled so no abuse of on-call sign by TDsâ€¦minimum fleet size 800 to keep operator license. No more new operator license will be issuedâ€¦Those operators tat don fulfil mileage requirements not allowed to grow fleet. All these CDG already hv and attained benefitting fr economy of big fleet sizeâ€¦
              
              For smaller cos to achieveâ€¦they hv to incur costs that turn into higher rental rates and less attractive to TDs. Why need to force operators to hv expensive booking systems when they r not strongâ€¦they can cater to taxi stands street paxâ€¦Now business good and surge of TDs but downturn.. smaller cos may not be able to surviveâ€¦ end up less choice for Tds and more LL hv to come under control of this â€œpax orientedâ€� coâ€¦ So it not true tat our Garmen don hv 20/20 vision,,,they hv this for certain issues.

              Those TDs in CDG knows they are in better position to tan jiak.. Some long timers hv attachmt to co (n partly face matters) and naturally standup against any bashing or criticism of the co. To me, I need to thank those Tds supporting smaller cos (like those K5 $133 hirers) and help keeping them aliveâ€¦so that if we get pok fr co, we still hv the chance to say â€œ Only CDG got taxi meh??â€� â€¦So to me, this co can take a bit of bashing oneâ€¦

              <p><br>There is no need to announce , TransCab did not announce the new Chevy of $3.60 flag down . Quietly they launched , quietly they spray it to different portions of colour for their cab , quietly $3.60 .</p>

              <p><br>Cruel? well, this is a cruel world, I drive for all kinds of taxis, not just comfort, but i would like to say, all taxis companies have shareholders, whether it is public or local is another issue, public meaning on board the Singapore Stock exchange. You can also be a cdg share holder, this year was 0.026 cts per share, why not, a lot earn you 26 dollars only hehehe</p>
              <p>Because cdg is public listed, it must adhere to the public servicing requirement, in simple term, anwer to the public at large</p>
              <p>Ttherefore it needs to serve pax better than any other cab companies in singapore, and that is why it is stricter in term of it cabbies discipine in services.</p>
              <p>Sonata up or not up $111 is entirely business, if K5 is at 130++, people also take, what is $111, and let tell you frankly that today si ginas alway think that high rental meaning good car, good vehicle, good engine, they let the worrying on profit to come later, and that is the wrong way of doing business, which if frightening.</p>
