              <p>I remember not to long ago, my family and I used to live in fear. Each time the door bell rings, sometimes in the middle of the night, it's either postman or courier sending legal letter or letter of demand. Or debt collectors.</p>
              <p>Driving taxi is an alternative given by the gamen to savage some of the 'being boss" pride. Now I am real happy, enjoying my work and most of my problem solved.</p>
              <p>While your one finger is always pointing at others, the other four is pointing at yourself. Maybe, a change in perspective would reallly made u a happier person. Rather than blaming LKY, blaming GOD, blaming heaven, blaming life, GO GET A LIFE la!!!!!!</p>

              <p>typical new generation thinking.</p>
              <p>lately, CDG diesel goes down three times till 1.11. Until now, nobody writes about it.</p>
              <p>GST check bank into account, nobody talk abt it. and even if there is only abt 2 things. </p>
              <p>1. take it for granted - like "eng kai" like that. the government owe it to u.</p>
              <p>2. in an unappreciating way. that is MY own money,</p>
              <p>ask yourself this question, do u know any government else where who give out money in this way? In their own pocket maybe.</p>
              <p>Clark Quay or MBS flooded with Ang Mo, U people can "pick and choose". count your money till happy happy? that's all. No one give the government credit for anything. When u see a fight in Clark Quay or a Ferrari accident, straight away, without time to take another breath, blame the government for taking in all the foreigners. Without this foreigners, u guys got chance to "pick and choose"? Go eat grass la.</p>
              <p>If u think I am pawning or PAP yes man, u are dead wrong. I for one is 100% for it that LKY is not perfect. Far from it.</p>
              <p>But do we have a better choice? When u have to achieve what he had achieved, would be do the same thing?</p>
              <p>Just "tia kong" from the ground. Like to ask my pax whenever I encounter people living in Potong Pasir.</p>
              <p>This resident told me that the result why CST lost everything is due to the fact that he cannot let go. Got people who works with him for 30 over years and he dun trust and groom them. Hand his hard earn legacy to a housewife. He failed to realised that ppl supporting him doesn't mean they will support his wife too.</p>
              <p>But if I am in his shoe, with such life long legacy, will sure want to hand over to someone I trusted most. This is human nature tho some people call it nepotism.</p>
              <p>Compared to LKY, who's legacy needs more thorough consideration? with case history is Hougang, does choice of successor really matter? Or u think just hand over not my "pasar". Or like one neighbour Mr M, hand over still go around criticising and back stabbing his own chosen one?</p>
