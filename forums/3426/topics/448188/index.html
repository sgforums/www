              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Airlines operating from Singapore's Budget Terminal will soon operate from the main terminals at Changi Airport.<br><br>That's because the Budget Terminal will be closed later this year to make way for a new and improved terminal.<br><br>Travelling the no-frills way has become more popular.<br><br>Last year, one in four passengers at Changi Airport travelled on a low-cost carrier (LCC), compared to about one in five in 2010.<br><br>In fact, low-cost carriers accounted for 28.6 percent of all flights at Changi Airport.<br><br>And the outlook is bright.<br><br>Mr Shukor Yusof, Aviation Analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, said: "Our understanding is that there are moves to review the operations at the Budget Terminal because of the increasing traffic, because of the expectation that there will be more and more budget airlines that will ply into Singapore.<br><br>"I think there is no chronic shortage of facilities or any acute problems that we are having at the LCCT (low-cost carrier terminal). The numbers are increasing so fast that I think in the next few years, issues concerning the comfort of passengers, the issue of more aircraft, if you look at the budget airlines in the region, everyone is buying new aircraft, every single one of them are expanding. So within the next three to four to five years, you will have more aircraft, more passengers.<br><br>"Indeed, more passengers are flying to Singapore by budget airline, so what we have today in Changi in terms of the Budget Terminal, is good for now. But within the next few years, it would struggle to cope with the numbers."<br><br>Opened in 2006, the Budget Terminal can handle up to seven million passengers annually.<br><br>And sources say the authorities are now looking at building a new terminal to cater to future demand.<br><br>Many workers at the Budget Terminal are aware of the impending closure. Shop owners have also been informed and some say it's no surprise, as the lease for most concessions there will expire in a few months.<br><br>The Budget Terminal currently serves Berjaya Air, Firefly, SEair, Cebu Pacific and Tiger Airways.<br><br>MediaCorp understands the decision to move the carriers to the main terminals was reached a few weeks ago.<br><br>It is understood that Tiger Airways will operate from Terminal 2, possibly by June.<br><br>Provisions have been made for them to operate from Row 12 near to Singapore Airlines, Silk Air and the new Scoot airline.<br><br>Berjaya Air and SEAir will also operate from Terminal 2, with Berjaya making the shift as early as April.<br><br>When contacted, Firefly says it is aware of the move, but declined to give details.<br><br>Analysts say the expected change should benefit carriers and passengers.<br><br>Mr Shukor said: "I think it is going to be quite good for these carriers because that would mean seamless connectivity for passengers who want to hop onto another carrier at Terminal 2.<br><br>"In terms of people who are flying from Australia onwards to Europe, for example, instead of being transported from the LCCT to Terminal 2, they can just walk a short distance and go onto the next flight and that's clearly an advantage for Tiger."<br><br>Observers say when the budget carriers begin operations from the main terminals, they could be faced with higher costs. <br><br>But it is understood that authorities are working on a special arrangement with the airlines to help them address the issue.<br><br>Changes have also been made to aero-bridges at Terminal 2 to accommodate the additional flights.<br><br>Observers say it should not take more than two years for the new terminal to be ready.<br><br>- CNA/de</span> </span></p>

In 2011, Changi handled a total of 46.5 million passenger movements, a year-on-year increase of 10.7 percent. <br><br>Singapore-based carriers - Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, Tiger Airways, Jetstar Asia and Scoot - have ordered new aircraft and foreign carriers have also expressed the desire to grow their air links with Singapore.<br><br></span></span></p>

              <p>Oh, Amazing Race happening there, I did not notice, seldom go budget, day time, very hot, nite time, prefer town.</p>
              <p> And warning,  for those who want to go shee shee, pang sai or have a break at budget , do not park along the road that is outside the Q area, it is a double yellow and strictly no parking, you can get a ticket ending up having the most expensive pang sai in there.</p>

              actually BT is better,u could see the arrival time for the first 4 flght,so u decide worth the time to Q or not or just drive off to somewhere else to look for pax.
              
              All the other 3 T do not show u the next 3 flght arrival time,so u take a gamble to Q,sometimes for 1 or 2 hrs, bad luck got someone to Floral RD.
