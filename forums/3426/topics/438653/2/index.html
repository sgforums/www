              <p>The normal Sweep and pick, Q and Q, call and call, what strategy
              you want, recession affect everyone, not only we the TD, its time
              to be conservative in your approach, the theory of whatever goes
              up, must come down is alway there unless you hit space.</p>
              <p>There is certainly a shortage in pax, but not that serious,
              singapore is still very much fully employed, so people still hold
              much spending power, what is going to face TD day to day work
              are</p>
              <p>1. Pax will be more calculative on tips, fares and the
              route you take.</p>
              <p>2. There will be more kind of paxs pooling together rather than
              each take one cab.</p>
              <p>3. There will be less travelling be it business or leisure, so
              you will expect a slow down in AP trips</p>
              <p>But not to worry, we are not as bad as the west, who are the
              catalyst of this economy problem, their unemployment rate goes up
              to over 10%, just imagine what happen to their cabbies there.
              Singapore being the 4th costly cities in the world with one of the
              highest millionaires in term of asset and cash in hand, as Cabbies,
              we are very much blessed to be here at the moment. And with people
              giving up on over expensive COEs, most execs will choose to take
              taxis, so we are not that bad, some occupation are more worst than
              us, especially the electronic sector, they get retrenched very
              easily once economy is down. I think they are not doing very well,
              our manufacture sector is also down on year to year basis.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we are not bad as others, but we need to keep
              ourselve up to date, be more calm and cool toward paxs, drive with
              care, hv enough rest and exercise, do not get yourselves into
              trouble ending up with taxi licence getting gantong, those above
              40s cabbies, if you are out of caby driving, it will be quite
              difficult for you to get a job especially during such times. So be
              careful, driving happily, live simple and keep smiling.</p>

              <p>Recession is not something new, it is cyclical process of economy, without recession, that can never be a bull run, someone said it super shopping time, I will agree if the share prices are at the lowest. For Cabbies, if you can afford, buy some good dividend shares, blue chips shares like local banks, local corporation like sembcorp, keppel or even singtel and sph can offer much better dividends than FD in banks. And you might not get such a price during good times.</p>
              <p>Bro Pool has a pro active approach to thing, that's good info, however, as cabbies we need to digest it from a different perspectives than what a investors, govt or banker perceived. In any situation, there are alway pros and cons, lost and opportunity. In fact, what bro pool said is quite true, many if not, those affected will be squeeze to spend prudently rather than lavishly. However, there will also be people who got lot of cash in hand and willing to spent at recession time only, because prices are low, it is an opportunity for them, these are great vultures who had patiently waited for the time to come, and Bang! take the opportunities and harvest it when bull run arrives, not only these apply to shares and stocks, it is across the spectrum of the board in any dealing, from property to cars on and on.</p>
              <p>Take for example, peoples can be down, lost, but not out yet, it just a lost, part and parcel of life and the economy, so they got more time, in anger, they go for drinks and enjoy to forget about the dismay. People may sold their car to compensate the lost, or simply cannot afford to own a car with heavy installment anymore, sell it and take taxis, most car owners can hardly go back to MRT and buses. Some may take this opportunity of recession to travel and do what they cannot do during the hey and busy times, so you got people travelling to study or for stress relieve too. So, when you look the cons of a situation, there are also pros in it. Somehow these will balance out well.</p>
              <p>Our worry is not much on recession, people still need to travel to banks, to find job, eats, drink and to do lots of other stuff, transport is an essential item, just like buying rice, it is a norm in peoples, especially in singapore which demand fast and decisive, and comfortable travelling. In my view, recession is like in school or work, a time to rest, think and relook at what is right and wrong, nothing to be worry much. You got more taxis drivers coming in, you also have more giving up, naturally, the market will balance by itself. My worry is not recession, but diseases, thing like SARS, or other epidermic will be a total diseaster for ALL.</p>
