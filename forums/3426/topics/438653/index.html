The single currency was, however, up slightly from the 10-year-low 101.94 yen seen earlier.<br><br>The dollar was slightly lower at 76.48 yen compared with 76.50 yen.<br><br>The greenback also extended gains against the commodities-linked Australian dollar. The Aussie -- which just over two months ago hit a record above US$1.10 -- slid to 96.93 US cents late in the session, down from 98.34 cents on Friday.<br><br>On oil markets New York's main contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in November, fell US$1.16 to US$78.69 per barrel in late afternoon trade.<br><br>Brent North Sea crude for November delivery slipped US$1.32 cents to US$102.65.<br><br>Gold tumbled to US$1,599.98 an ounce by 0800 GMT, well down from the US$1,734.86 it was at by 0900 GMT Friday, with analysts saying dealers were cashing in their investments and shifting into the US dollar as a safe haven.<br><br>It was also being sold after CME Group, which runs the online trading platform for gold, said it would raise the amount of collateral for dealers trading the precious metal.<br><br>In other markets:<br><br>-- Singapore ended 1.65 percent or 44.49 points off at 2,654.31.<br><br>-- Manila slumped 4.24 percent, or 164.74 points, to 3,721.22, its lowest close since September 2010.<br><br>-- Taipei closed 2.40 percent, or 169.10 points, lower at 6,977.12.<br><br>-- Wellington closed down 0.83 percent, or 27.34 points, at 3,255.37.<br><br>-- Kuala Lumpur lost 2.50 percent, or 34.14 points, to close at 1,331.80.<br><br>-- Jakarta fell 3.22 percent, or 110.20 points, to 3,316.14.<br><br></span></span></p></div>

              <p>But not to worry, we are not as bad as the west, who are the catalyst of this economy problem, their unemployment rate goes up to over 10%, just imagine what happen to their cabbies there. Singapore being the 4th costly cities in the world with one of the highest millionaires in term of asset and cash in hand, as Cabbies, we are very much blessed to be here at the moment. And with people giving up on over expensive COEs, most execs will choose to take taxis, so we are not that bad, some occupation are more worst than us, especially the electronic sector, they get retrenched very easily once economy is down. I think they are not doing very well, our manufacture sector is also down on year to year basis.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we are not bad as others, but we need to keep ourselve up to date, be more calm and cool toward paxs, drive with care, hv enough rest and exercise, do not get yourselves into trouble ending up with taxi licence getting gantong, those above 40s cabbies, if you are out of caby driving, it will be quite difficult for you to get a job especially during such times.

              <div id="googleAds" class="ad adSpot-textBox"></div>
              <p class="indent">Oil rose  for a second day in New 
              York on speculation Europe will step up  measures to tame a sovereign 
              debt crisis that has roiled financial  markets and slowed its economy, 
              curbing fuel demand.</p>
              <p class="indent">Futures  gained as much as 2.5 per cent, trimming the biggest quarterly decline  since the global financial crisis in 2008. US
               Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner predicted that European 
              governments will intensify  efforts to contain their debt woes after 
              being pressured at  international meetings in Washington last week. The 
              European Union  accounted for 16 per cent of global oil demand last year, according to BP’s annual Statistical Review of World Energy.</p>
              <p class="indent">“If there’s a  credible plan that is 
              good enough and certain enough to restore  reasonable confidence to the 
              world then a lot of things are going to  look cheap at current prices 
              and that probably includes oil,” said Ric  Spooner, a chief market 
              analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.</p>
              <div id="adspot-300x250-pos-3" class="hidden"></div>
              <p class="indent">Crude for  November delivery gained as much as $US2 to $US82.24 a barrel in electronic  trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange and was at $US82.02. Oil has dropped 14 per cent this quarter, the biggest  decline since the three months ended December 2008. Prices are down 8 per cent this month and 10 per cent this year.</p>
              <p class="center">Brent  futures for November settlement gained $US1.42, or 1.4 per cent, to $US105.36  a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European  benchmark contract is down 6 per cent this quarter. It traded at a  premium of $US23.34 to US futures, compared with a record $US26.87 on  Sept. 6, based on front-month settlement prices.</p>
              <p class="indent"><strong>Oil may stabilise</strong></p>
              <p class="indent">“Crude  benchmarks were propped up by the rally in equity markets and a softer US
               dollar,” Mark Pervan, head of commodity research at ANZ in Melbourne, 
              said in a note today.  “Uncertainty over Europe continued to be a drag 
              on prices, but with most  of the bad news already priced in, oil markets
               could stabilise after  posting steep declines last week.”</p>
              <p class="indent">Geithner  said on ABC Television’s 
              “World News With Diane Sawyer” program that  governments at the annual 
              International Monetary Fund meetings told  European leaders that their 
              debt crisis is hurting global growth.</p>
              <p class="center">The Standard  &amp; Poor’s 500 Index added 2.3 per cent in New York. The MSCI Asia  Pacific Index climbed as much as 2.9 per cent in Tokyo, its first advance  in four days and the Dollar Index weakened for a second day.</p>
              <p class="indent"><strong>Technical support</strong></p>
              <p class="indent">Hedge funds  and other money managers raised bullish bets on Brent crude by 6.2 per cent
               in the week ended Sept. 20, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe.
               Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and options  
              combined, outnumbered short positions by 73,270 contracts, the  
              London-based exchange said yesterday in its weekly Commitment of Traders
                report.</p>
              <p class="indent">Oil in New  York has technical support around $US80.20
               a barrel, after settling above  its lower Bollinger Band yesterday, 
              according to data compiled by  Bloomberg. Buy orders tend to be 
              clustered near chart-support levels.</p>
              <p>US crude  stockpiles probably climbed
               2.2 million barrels last week as fuel demand  weakened, according to 
              the median of 11 analyst estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey before an
               Energy Department report tomorrow.  Gasoline supplies rose 1 million 
              barrels to the highest level in two  months and inventories of 
              distillate fuel, a category that includes  heating oil and diesel, 
              increased by 500,000 barrels, the survey showed.</p>

              <p><span><span>PARIS : Franco-Belgian investment bank Dexia, which
                  narrowly escaped collapse in the 2008 global financial crisis,
                  needs to dispose of another 20 billion euros' worth of bad debt, a
                  press report said on Monday.<br> <br> Business daily Les Echos, citing a source at the bank, said that
                  having disposed of about 80 billion euros (US$107 billion) worth of
                  toxic loans, Dexia now planned to offload another 20 billion euros'
                  worth.<br> <br> The source said that even though Dexia might take a loss of up to
                  10 percent on the sale of the bad assets, it would still be
                  worthwhile so as to improve the bank's financial position, at a
                  time of great stress on the markets.<br> <br> French banks have come under intense pressure to strengthen their
                  capital base given concerns over their exposure to weak eurozone
                  countries, especially Greece.<br> <br> Press reports at the weekend suggested Dexia could also be looking
                  at a tie-up with French state controlled banks.<br> <br> One report said France was planning a 10-15 billion euro
                  recapitalisation plan for five top banks struggling with the
                  eurozone debt crisis.<br> <br> The Journal du Dimanche (JDD) Sunday newspaper said the state had
                  made the offer during a September 11 meeting with top officials
                  from five banks -- BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole,
                  BPCE and Credit Mutuel.<br> <br> The weekly said the plan was rejected by Societe Generale.<br> <br> Issuing what it called a "formal denial," the finance ministry said
                  the government had held talks with leading banks on their state of
                  health but denied the bailout offer.<br> <br> All the concerned banks declined comment on the JDD report, which
                  cited sources in the Elysee presidential palace and in banking
                  circles.<br> <br></span></span></p>
