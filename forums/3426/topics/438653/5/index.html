              <p><br>I have alway wonder that without LKY, what will be like today, who knows, we could had achieved swiss standard 20s ago.</p>
              <p>Because of what LKY did, it does not imply that some other people cannot do it better than him. He had removed almost all his political foes in one night without a blink of an eyes, which ultimately make him the hero of your eyes, but didn't he privatised most state companies to as to enhance competitiveness which ultimately, removed the iron rice bowl mentality of civil servants, because he said competition give way to productivity, creativity, innovation and continious improvement. Why then, he do not allow competition in politics?</p>
              <p>In 1987, before he passed his baton go lau Goh, they already pre planned the immigration policy, but he stand behind the veil of control and let Lau Goh do the foreign immigration open gate policy to take place, the idea was to have a 6.5million peoples, but by 5.5m, look at our mrt and crowd on the street, our society and our people suffering from jobs, to housing, to all kind of crimes and funny culture. You call that mistake?</p>
              <p>Do you know the best way of ruling in the world is to rule with a velvet glove hand or so called, behind the scene, because you will not take all the shit, you only take  the good, and that is why you protray him as good and forever as good? But if in the 60s, someone other than him ruled singapore, could it be that we are better off, maybe no foreigners, maybe our birthrate will not stop at 2??? and maybe you would not have to rent taxi and alway at the mercy of taxi companies directives but instead, having a license to own your own taxi.</p>
              <p>A minister mentor, a senior minister mentor, or whatever you call it, do you believe he had ready pass on his baton and forget all about it?</p>

              <p>That time, there is also not much high educated cambridge lawyer around but a lots of kampong/village peoples, the only thing I admired him is that he took his opportunity well, in 50s, when in collectiveness, he joined force with many parties, including the communist party,  on a common goal to remove the British and gain independency after India got theirs in 1949. And I believe in the 50s, he already secretly planned his move at his oxley rise house, because he is a opportunist who pre plan his move before anyone can see it. And in the 60s, in removed all his brothers in arm who fought and championed singapore with him. Politics is not about technology, it is about power struggling, sabotaging and do the impossible to become possible, it can be as sweet as sugar and also as dirtiest as the shit house.

Seek the middle way of lesser thought of pride or glory but with utmost humility. Politician are not to be looked or gauged as idol with die hard fan, they are to be judged for by the peoples who paid him or her to be.</p>

(See <a style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; color: #ce0000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1150_2008-11-30.html">here</a> and <a style="outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; color: #ce0000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" href="http://hellosingapore.info/lee-kuan-yew/">here</a> for proof) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">He had thus entered into politics even before he became involved in the trade unions’ dispute with the British. </span></span></strong>(Polling day for the 1951 legislative elections was on 10 April, we can assume that his political activities with the SPP started months before that)</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 22px; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">If I may speculate, LKY joined the SPP initially to build up his political career there. However when the Rendel Constitution expanded the electoral rolls to include all local-born as voters, resulting in a significant increase in Chinese voters, LKY decided to jump ship and formed the PAP in 1954 because he saw that the SPP lacked the support of the Chinese working class. (So the next time LKY condemns politicians who change political parties, you know where he’s coming from)</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 22px; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">Yet the problem isn’t solely that LKY jumped ship and didn’t care to tell anyone about his great experience in his memoirs. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The bigger problem lies in the fact that LKY supported the SPP despite the fact that it was A) pro-British in both its policies and in its composition of members (mostly English-speaking upper class professionals) B) unsupportive of achieving independence (it merely paid lip-service to the idea by declaring in October 1952, its objective of Singapore achieving independence through a Singapore-Malaya merger without setting a target date)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; line-height: 22px; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LKY’s miraculous change of heart on these issues when he joined the PAP only demonstrates how the pursuit of power can sometimes make one very flexible about their beliefs.</span> Unfortunately for us, this flexibility of LKY’s did not extend to the area of political freedoms.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> This book comprises the recollections penned by the participants of the era of the 1950s, where their generation was in the forefront of the anti-colonial movement</span></span></strong>, and the work of academic researchers who have examined the historical framework and context of the period, as well as how it has been made to fit in to the country's mainstream history.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">The researchers have also examined the students' cultural expressions, whether it is in art, drama, dance or literature and found to be socially engaged, and grappling with the question of who they were as a people. The cultural explorations of that period have been forgotten or repudiated. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is revealing just how this amnesia and silence has become so set. It is also impossible to imagine the demands that age had put on this generation of youths.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">many English-educated Babas re-emphasised their allegiance to the British Empire</span></strong> and were afraid that full independence migh<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">t harm their still privileged position</span></strong>, the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> vast majority of Chinese-educated Chinese were vehemently anti-colonial and anti-imperialist.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 13px; text-align: left;"><strong>A HIGHER CLASS OF CHINESE</strong></p>
              <p>AS "sons of the soil", the Straits Chinese British Association's Straits Chinese defended their citizenship (or subjecthood) rights against the China-born Chinese and those first-generation Singapore-born Chinese who had a dual loyalty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 13px; text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The chasm between the Babas and the sinkehs (literally "guests", or recent immigrants from China) may also be illustrated by the typical occupations of the China-born Chinese which self-conscious Babas would have shunned...</span></strong></p>

              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 13px; text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 13px; text-align: left;">The key to understand Singapore politics and Singapore history from 1945 onwards is this:</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 13px; text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 13px; text-align: left;">
              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 10px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">The <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">answer lies in a historical division in Singapore's Chinese community between the babas and the sinkeh. </span></strong>The sinkeh, comprising the majority of the city-state's population, were the recent immigrants from China, or whose parents were born in China. They spoke Chinese, lived like Chinese and considered themselves overseas Chinese. In Indonesia, such Chinese were called the totok.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were Chinese more in name than practice. They were the descendants of the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners. The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge. If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another university in China. Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population, it was the babas who dominated public decision-making. In effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England than China.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example. He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political necessity. He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, but as a baba who looked to England. He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His father had given him and two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names. Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways? No. He ran it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would have aspired.</p>
