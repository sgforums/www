              <p>Practice of tipping are there for a good reason. Natually, it motivate people to provide higher standard of service.</p>
              <p>Because of greed, this extra income had been accounted into the revenue of the capitalist. Capitalist give wonderful excuses, it should/must be the quality of the person, that person should/must not be solely dependence on monetary reward to motivate his service standard. Those expecting monetary reward to perform are deem unfit in service line.</p>
              <p>The excuse can be a good one, rational and gain acceptance. The result concluded, going against the force of nature will fail, people just couldn't provide a high standard of service. Instead of admitting and amend their mistake, capitalist divert the fault to service personnel, penalise them and further profit from it.</p>
              <p>Being ill treated with such unfair policy, who can sincerely out there to provide a high a standard of service? </p>
              <p>We serve for the sick of serving, We serve for the sick of not getting punish.</p>

              <p>well, if u look at what is happening around the world. u will get the answer. Most of the time when this kind of thing happened.</p>
              <p>the state will work on a deficit budget to tie things over for the time being. Later they will have to revamp their industrials by sectors and the banking and finance system to be competitive. if they can do it, they will be like south korea. economy will recovery and have surpluses. if they cant do it, they will be like japan. a stagnant economy for over ten years.</p>
              <p>if on these stagnant stage they still cant do anything about it. They will be like the west, living on loans and eventally the loans balloon til they cannot pay up the interests then they will have the same problem like the west is facing now...</p>
              <p>anyway, why do u need to worry about the state. they have so many elites and scholars, let them go and worry about it while we take care of ourselves..</p>

              SINGAPORE: Labour chief Lim Swee Say has said the NTUC is keeping track on a weekly basis the number of workers who may be affected by potential retrenchments ahead of any slowdown in the economy.
              
              Mr Lim said: "The NTUC, together with the WDA (Workforce Development Agency), is already working with some of the companies that are beginning to see the early signs of slowing down. 
              
              "We're working with them to send their workers - those on shorter work-weeks and some of their potential excess workers - to go on training before they take any action on retrenchment."
              
              Mr Lim, who is the NTUC Secretary-General and Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, was speaking to reporters at the opening of the upgraded Bedok Community Centre (CC).
              
              The S$4 million face-lift to the 30-year-old structure saw additions like a new annexe which adds more than 950 square metres to the existing building.
              
              It is the second upgrade the community centre has seen.
              
              Mr Lim said: "As our society continues to make progress, the kind of social challenges will evolve with time. 
              
              "Right now in Bedok, we're reaching out to one in three residents. Together with the rest of the People's Association, we're aiming to increase our outreach from one in three today to one in two by the year 2015. 
              
              "We hope with this upgraded CC, we'll be able to organise new programmes, new activities, to bring (together) more residents of all ages, of all racial groups and across various housing estates including HDB and non-HDB (dwellers)." 
              
              He said any slowdown in the economy is not related to the size of the companies, but by the sector.
              
              He cited electronics, even though signs of a slowdown are not across the board in the sector.
              
              Mr Lim said: "Those in the electronics, like personal computers, are more affected, whereas those supplying parts and components to the automobile sector are less affected at the moment."
              
              However, Mr Lim said the retrenchment situation today is unlikely to be anywhere close to the numbers seen in 2008.
              
              And while the outlook remains uncertain, he said the labour movement is making necessary preparations so that when the time comes, it can launch them into action.
              
              At the same event, Mr Lim also said the review on CPF contributions will continue. This is because more Singaporeans are living and working longer.
              
              "When we call for this review of the CPF contributions, we're looking at it as a medium- to long-term structural issue. I think that will continue. Of course in terms of short-term, there'll be ups and downs," said Mr Lim.
              
              But he stressed that short-term fluctuations and longer-term structural issues should be kept separate

              <p>remember this day 22nd Nov 2011 ....</p>
              <p>Uncle Poolman declared : Retrenchments will be minimum this time around . Because most companies has got no more locals to retrench ! If they wanna a retrench locals ..... some foreigners has to follow the door out .</p>
              <p>Now foreigners will be more worried than us .</p>
              <p>Housing will be tougher for them .</p>
              <p>Renting a flat was also tough for them .</p>
              <p>PR application will be very restricted for many .</p>
              <p>Cost of living too high .</p>
              <p>It's either they bite the nails , stay on .</p>
              <p>Or</p>
              <p>Leave this country .</p>
              <p>Swiss Bank , UBS foreigners will be the most to be shown the door at the AP ! When economy downturn is bad ...... local people should be happy , the intake for more foreigners will be halted for the time being .</p>
              <p>More retrenchments , no vacancies for locals , where got vacancies for foreigners ?</p>
              <p>3 locals = 1 foreigner quota remains .</p>
              <p>Unless PAP say 1 local = 1 foreigner .</p>
              <p>Then i declared : Singaporeans , ur choice is clear !</p>
              <p>2010 Watershed Election : 40% voted against PAP because of foreigners issues . This time around , they will be very careful . It is the time they will show hand and will try to get back those lost votes .</p>
              <p>Show time PAP !</p>
