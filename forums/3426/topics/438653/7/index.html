              <p>Before cabbies talk about unemployment or employment, please remember you are consider as self employed, you are the employer, the employer and the CEO or director of you own direction. So, those unemployed one who join TD are also not consider as employed, they are just merely taking up a business, in this context, they are still unemployed. Therefore, authorites like LTA is not curbing unemployment, they are merely taking this opportunity to rise the nos of taxis so that they can improve the simple sum as above para to sustain not only present Ministers' paid but also ex ministers who had served 8 years and therefore, eligible for  their longlife pension, PENSION! leh, still got pension in Singapore, even if I drive 40 years also no pension. No wonder Ministers die die must do a 2 terms in office.</p>
              <p>You see, LTA top chiefs, NTA top chiefs and taxi companies chiefs have alot of free time for meeting lunch, golf, business dinner and even overseas retreat cum seminars, they have all the time to think on how to squeeze more out of your and me, how to make the best that people like TD will not have enough time to think of these and that or against the govt, and also, how not to make them suffer too much, hunger too much and at the same time, give them enough just to breathe above the water, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
              <p>They go overseas retreat, drink, wine and dine, then brainstorm or do mind mapping or whatever thinking guru methods on questions raise as some example stated above. And they know you and me, as TD, got no time to bother them so much, drive all days, go back tired, sleep also not enuf, sometime cannot even got time for family because you hv to tread above the water.</p>

              <p>And mind you, all these does not include medical benefits, personel insurances, annual leaves, MC, bonuses, 13th month AWS, promotion, NWC wage increases, special increment, bonuses..this come to the conclusion that if you are currently taking a 3.5k pay check with not much of a problem with your company. Remain status quo.</p>
              <p>Minister talk here, talk there, $300,000 per month + bonuses+fully paid house, car, maid, Power supply bill, h/p bills, top medical care, and also bodyguard and pension after retire. Taxi driver drives until legs pain, neck pains, heart pain, $3000 nia.</p>
              <p>Ok, fair enough, most cabbies are just O level, so ministers mostly are Master level, about 4 times above us, from A to University to higher to Master, but why their pay is more than 100 times above us??</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Before cabbies talk about unemployment or employment, please
              remember you are consider as self employed, you are the employer,
              the employer and the CEO or director of you own direction. So,
              those unemployed one who join TD are also not consider as employed,
              they are just merely taking up a business, in this context, they
              are still unemployed. Therefore, authorites like LTA is not curbing
              unemployment, they are merely taking this opportunity to rise the
              nos of taxis so that they can improve the simple sum as above para
              to sustain not only present Ministers' paid but also ex ministers
              who had served 8 years and therefore, eligible for  their
              longlife pension, PENSION! leh, still got pension in
              Singapore, even if I drive 40 years also no pension. No
              wonder Ministers die die must do a 2 terms in office.</p>
              <p>You see, LTA top chiefs, NTA top chiefs and taxi companies
              chiefs have alot of free time for meeting lunch, golf, business
              dinner and even overseas retreat cum seminars, they have all the
              time to think on how to squeeze more out of your and me, how to
              make the best that people like TD will not have enough time to
              think of these and that or against the govt, and also, how not to
              make them suffer too much, hunger too much and at the same time,
              give them enough just to breathe above the water, nothing more,
              nothing less.</p>
              <p>They go overseas retreat, drink, wine and dine, then brainstorm
              or do mind mapping or whatever thinking guru methods on questions
              raise as some example stated above. And they know you and me, as
              TD, got no time to bother them so much, drive all days, go back

              <p><br>Yes, definitely, but they do not want us to look at that figure of 2.8milllions, they want  us to look at the $28 meter fare, for us, that mean good liao. Because if keep looking at the 2.8m, we get more angry and fed up with them, they expect and also want us to look at the micro view, the lowest view, as low as possible. And to do that, they increase fuel charges, rental, give you new cars and all kind of small perks which ultimately makes you Yao and got no time to look at the 2.8m but only on the main fare meter and the smaller meter below it.</p>
