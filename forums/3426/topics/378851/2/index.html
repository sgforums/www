            <div class='col-md body'>i start my shift from 4 am to 4 pm . Currently I got relief. But come next NOvember 2009 I will be without relief. Bz from 7 am to 9.30 am is also as bad . Today  I just managed to get $60 and most pax I take is taiko. Then spend most time in the late morning to early afternoon in the AP. No choice coz estate so many empty taxi. My fuel is of course more but the worse is yet to come . Come the month of Nov and Dec 2009 the period for us taxi drivers will be worse than this .  I am speaking for the day shift .</div>

              <p>Dunno what happen ? This 3 weeks , a week before Deepavali was bad , one week after Deepavali also , 2nd week after Deepavali is also same , esp . Peak hour !</p>
              <p>For 3 consecutive days after the death of my father , which i was off for about 1 week , my 4.30pm to 8pm record is like $68 , $80 and today just $58 , what the fuck .</p>
              <p>But after 8pm , CBD they take taxis like nobody business .</p>
              <p>The Peak Hour surcharge is a cancer now , a cancer or tumour getting bigger and incurable !</p>
              <p>I had sms from Rotary telling me that , Ken Teo also , Patrick also not doing well recently .</p>
              <p>Like for Monday , i manage a modest $195 i think ....Tuesday a discipline $218 , today also did the same $226 .</p>
              <p>All i reached home at 3am .</p>
              <p>I need to readjust my method of strategy during peak hours , it dun seemed to work now .</p>
              <p>I need to stop heading to NTU , cos if NTU non pax , my next destination is doomed !! Dun mention IBP , recently IBP taxis can Q actually until the Building's loading and unloading bay , long like crazy .</p>
              <p>CBD and outside CBD also bad ....</p>
              <p>I think next few days i will hit straight from CCK towards Clementi Road , then to West Coast Pier , too outsider , new potential , along with Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal , another got pax no taxis area .</p>
              <p>Take a quick one and see how , see if it can improve my current situation .</p>

              <p>How can that be, my gahman already told sight of recovery ahead, ask the banks, ask those property agents, ask the car dealers. But only good is those white mice wardens. Like this morning at Woodleight overheadbridge near Potong Pasir tripod with camera mounted with no warden on top of the bridge. knn sitting as like the commuter at the bus stop with only a remote control, once tumb pressed $130 entering the bus lane, good money, new technic... Talking about taxi day, diesel burned more coverage of journey the collection less than $200 or even less as today $148 from 5am to 4.30am travelled 280 km, this is what taxi driving for the last few weeks. Where got paxs? more taxis...around. So night is about the same as day. Heng ah...sama sama.</p>
              <p> than why? they are telling more passegers arrival at Changi Airport. Got data about this, once the market is slow down and very quiet, alway this report surfaced.</p>

              <p>I 100% surely got pax .</p>
              <p>IBP got chance to go Sengkang , unless u are going home , u are unlucky to get to Sengkang , last night u were lucky then ? Kena Sengkang , then go home ?</p>

              <p>today 4.30pm started ...end 12am , $210 .</p>
              <p>Did i say last night that i will change my usual technic today for the sake of curbing my peak hours weaknesses ?</p>
              <p>Yes , i succeed in changing the patterns , it's simply EZ EZ to get $120 from 4.30pm to 8pm .</p>
              <p>Stick inside CBD , especially Shenton way areas is better than sticking around Orchard .</p>
              <p>Sticking around Beach Road area is better than sticking around Far East areas .</p>
              <p>Business area is definitely easier to get paxes than those shopping and eating areas .</p>
              <p>Hmm .... a bit of feelings that Festive Seasons mood is around the corner .</p>
              <p>Indeed , more people are walking around , and it's visible , and can forecast the situation after 8pm ....... dunno , maybe today is pay day .</p>

              <p><br>Yes , good tactically move .</p>
              <p>Guys , u see , Kelvin changed his usual tactic and it works , so the morale of the motion is still changed according to the changes of the environments that keep changing everyday .</p>
              <p>If u die die do the same crap everyday , expect ur income to drop .</p>
              <p>If u wait til others to change and u follow , u just lost a mile .</p>
              <p>Be ahead and be sucessful</p>
              <p>I am always thinking , always analysing , always think ahead of others , and leap more each day , others can only follow , they will never overtake me .</p>
              <p>If u are just a casual cabby , if got - take , dun have just cruise , just hope for durian drop , yes u overtook me , u'll still get lost when u are in the front . Headless .</p>
              <p>In Kelvin case , ya lor , dun waste time , pay ERP charge into CBD , get a quick one , then plan the next checkmate move ..... Checkmate , right move .</p>

              <p>in 2 weeks time ......</p>
              <p>APEC Singapore 2009 , how many of the current drivers knew that ?</p>
              <p>Yes right now we are ahead , and we already had plans , either to roll in more cold hard cash from this event  , or avoid at all cost and keep rolling in those cold hard stuff from somewhere else .</p>
              <p>What's new moves ?</p>
              <p>Airport ....surely .</p>
              <p>Shopping malls ...surely</p>
              <p>Hotels ? Defintely .</p>
              <p>Clarke Quay ? Will be a war zone .</p>
              <p>It's not that all delegates go Clarke Quay makan , just that due to the events , less taxis charging into CBD , worrying about jams .</p>
              <p>2ndly , more taxis are charging into AP , if MDT announce : " Airport T3 needs taxis , members nearby can try ."</p>
              <p>This sort of situation where taxis are more or less less saturated inside CBD .</p>
              <p>This is where we can capitalised during the 2 weeks .</p>
              <p>After that , Merry X'mas and Happy New Year .</p>
              <p>before that , Selamat Hari Raya Haji ......</p>

              <p>Eg like USA President makan with President Nathan on a Friday night upon arriving from AirForce One , at 10.30pm , will u charge into Cavengah Road into CBD or into Orchard Road ?</p>
              <p>Not me ... i foreseen Traffic closures , road blocks etc .... for the President to go back to Shangri La Hotel to sleep .</p>
              <p>Stuck inside the jam , no joke . It's like $$$ draining into the long kang .</p>
              <p>They closed 2 lanes u also cannot tahn liao .</p>
