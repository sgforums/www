            <div class='col-md body'><p>so today is the first time i took taxi since 1 year ago during my ns. because my car went for servicing , so took a cab after work and got into a prime toyota wish taxi. young TD , friendly. So i told him my destination and he is a safe driver , driving at exactly 90km/h , and brought me safely home , so suddenly his phone rang , and he use his ear piece to talk on the phone which i think is another td , and he was saying in hokkien , "today business quite okay liao , enough for me , going home early to see my son after sending this pax as my son is sick." i jsut kept quiet all the way and when reach my destination , the fee was exactly $10 , but i gave him $11 , he was very appreciative and say thank you to me. and i said to him back , thanks for bringing me home. I know business is bad due to the bad weather. Hmm i feel quite happy that i actually give $1 more to the TD , i dunno why also. haha , but i know $1 is not really a lot , but i hope it helps a little. After a tiring day at work , this incident really cheer my day up. Thanks for viewing my thread. just wanna share. =))</p></div>
