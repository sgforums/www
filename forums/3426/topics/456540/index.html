Prior to driving taxi I have been driving for more then 15 years and I also think I know the way around. Until I start driving then I realise it is different. Driving myself I can take whatever route I want. But taking pax certain place to go must take certain route or else will )*$&amp;@#^&amp; by pax.</p>
