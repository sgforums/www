              <p>And last thing to add , If you think that driving a taxi is
              really a business , your own boss , please do think again.</p>
              <p>Business good , many people , you can only pick juz one. you
              cant employ FTs to drive for u and u collect GST. Every $ that u
              make is all hard earned effort. Even if Shenton way is flooded with
              tonnes of people , LPPL you can only pick one.</p>

              <p>Quite True - and don't think you are your own boss...paxes sometime think you are their own personal drivers....pull in there right to the boat, right to the rubbish chutes lot, right the house steps....Even they cannot walk just a few step to doorstep...</p>
              <p>Don't think you are your own boss. You can only pick one and after that you make a KangChia quick turn-around back- No more paxes...</p>
              <p>Taxi Driving, tutut drivers, are all the modern age of the Old age Rickshaw Pullers in the early 1900s. Just that we have modern automobile, air-condition with some comfy setting.  However sit too long create other health problems...ha..ha..ha..</p>
              <p>Rickshaw puller, Rickshaw riders exercise too much under the hot sun and rain and suffer other health problems...</p>

              <p>you say u have comfort friends who are complaining.. then why dont u wanna hear from someone who isnt complaining? You dispute the fare structure without listening to both sides of the story . you only wanna hear what you wanna hear, how to have a discussion like this?</p>
              <p>I admit my after 8 pm sucks to the core , thats why im learning to do something abt it. why not do the same as well?</p>

              <p>On a side note, do ERPs contribute to our country lessening population, not enough babies. To avoid ERPs, go home late, no time for family, so no make babies.</p>

              <p>As long as the peak hour surcharge remains ....</p>
              <p>And pax kept hiding out until 8pm , especially those surrounding CBD .</p>
              <p>Give them a run for their money , dun take them !!!!</p>
              <p>How ?</p>
              <p>Make sure those outsde CBD don't get a cab after 8pm .... eg Sim Lim , Tekka ( those FT ) , Gateway ( those expats ) , Golden Mile , North Bridge road etc .....</p>
              <p>Make them complaint .</p>
              <p>Make them call for comfort taxis ...... cos i know Comfort taxis also shunned outside CBD bookings , esp Tekka .</p>
              <p>This way also can make Comfort discover why their implementation of new fare structures don't work long term . Even for bookings , their own drivers also dun wan .</p>
              <p>As far as i know , Tio Call Liao never take outside CBD call . Cos he will never get suspension , ting go and ting lor ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now without IR so many outside CBD problems .....</p>
              <p>With IR , god bless those areas .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am so sure there'll be another surcharges inside IR , besides the CBD surcharge .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also Sentosa surcharge .</p>
              <p>Without implementing such surcharge , i am already busy at Tanjong Pagar , and not only Vivo City , Sentosa , u siow ar ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I standby to see .... at the end of the road , who is in control ? Taxi Driver us !!!!!</p>
              <p>We will have the last laugh eventually , if we get it right with our plans .</p>

              <p>you got the point of free market....Why Transcab follow Comfort?</p>
              <p>Why?  I assume if they follow - some drivers will throw they key and join back comfort...</p>
              <p>Why? Maybe your reasoning of LanTowAdministrator powerful influence....is correct...</p>
              <p>Same like Diesel lah....You think goverment will pass on the law to run all taxi on CNG?</p>
              <p>I think the Answer is NO.....Who is going to consume Domestic Diesel supply? No demand.....Petrochemical industry can shut down....because if you process crude for higher end fuel....for aircraft. etc.... who is going to buy lower end?</p>
              <p>Also i still think COE for taxis should not be on the biddings with private car....Cost go up and our Rental cannot be reduce....Import tax for taxi is another factor....</p>
              <p>ERP for taxi should be half price or lower...to encourage public transport... Discourage Private Car on the road unnnecessary....JUST Imagine the massive jam on the road nowadays....</p>
              <p>Of course the 35% surcharge can be tweak if traffic conditions improve or otherwise like the airport scenario......CBD scenario.....</p>
              <p>If every fare of you is only CBD play....what about those drivers on the day shift....no CBD surcharge...q here and q there - waste time.</p>

              <p>The new pricing system has lessen my working hours.</p>
              <p>The peak hour charges are steep but the normal taxi charges are too cheap. Traffic jams now lasts until midnight not until 8pm. There will come a time when normal taxi charges becomes too little to cover lost time.</p>
              <p>Reduce car ownership, promote public transport, how to when at peak hours taxi fares to and fro work costs more than to own a car.</p>
              <p>Increase car pricings to last time. But less cars means less ERPs which means less revenue for the government. (maybe that's why the red licence plate hours are now extended, to make way for future ERPs revenues)</p>
              <p>I think the solution is to get more people to ride on taxis, so less cars, so less jams, commuters and drivers will be happier. See the cars going to and from work, only 1 driver and no pax. To transport 1 person to work takes one car, no sense. How to make these group of people convert to public transport?</p>
