              <p>Tio Call liao and me still having some friendly cross-fire to that 35% peak hour surcharge .</p>
              <p>He favour that 35% ..... i also favour % for peak hour , not 35 , 20 .</p>
              <p>Let's make it very clear , i can manage that 35% , but i felt 20% will pull in another 20% more commuters into taking cabs , and therefore , i will not have to Q longer at taxi stand , might not even have to Q .</p>
              <p>Again , i still think within 35% period if i can get $100 , if 20% , i will get more from 5pm-8pm . At least ..... dead places can get back to live once again .</p>
              <p>Now it's like lively places became dead zones .</p>

              <p>you gotta understand, some yrs back they reduced e COE &amp; road tax. But they jacked up the ERP rates.</p>
              <p>Such formula wun even work. Back in the 1990s, road usage i.e. ERP was low, but road tax and COE was ex. So it became a deterrant to people to even think of owning 1 car. You own liao, using it would become natural.</p>
              <p>Tat's why eventually gotta find a way to get more to take taxis, be it fare or somewhat the system.</p>

              <p>since there are so many taxis out there on the road, how come there are no price savings for passengers? too many taxis chasing fewer passengers, the fare should drop what.</p>

              makes sense.... red can reduce price... then maybe silver and smrt may follows.... then comfort also may reduce... 
              
              but taxi fare if drop is likely to be after CNY... year end drop is stupid leh... no?

              <p>i don't think cabby is choosy.  Many reasons for jurong island. I will not take booking for sure if unless i am already inside or just at the boundary/perimeter of that area.</p>
              <p>you should make a LIMO booking.  better chances of getting one.</p>

              <p><br>Not cabbies , Comfort and CityCab only .</p>
              <p>Next time u try calling SMart or TransCab .... or Taman Jurong Taxi Kiosk , or Boon Lay taxi kiosk . Better chance . And see how fast u can get a cab .</p>
              <p>U Jurong Island guys always 65521111 , then cannot get , then cursed all taxi drivers ? </p>
              <p>Comfort drivers hates going into Jurong Island .</p>
              <p>Try other Companies ..... believe me , try Smart and TransCab u can get those members near Jlan Buroh for CNg to take ur bookings .</p>
              <p>Logic , when we need CNG we go SPC Jalan Buroh , just outside Jurong Island .</p>
              <p>If u insist on just Comfort , pls prepare no taxis . Not that no taxis , they just felt there's no need to get a job inside jurong island if outside Jurng island so many call for them .</p>
