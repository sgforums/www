              <p>bro ,</p>
              <p>this one have to strongluy disagree with u liao. 35 % peak hour should stay la. come on u want it to revert to last time? $1 peak? nothing else? city charge $1 ? this kinda fare structure i dont think u can be home by 12 am.... maybe drive till next morning.</p>
              <p>Maybe im lucky to be with comfort , thats why my peak hour nap nap kali pok one. calls from pandan , tuas , paya lebar , science park , loyang help my peak hr alot. without all these calls , really dont know how to run liao.</p>
              <p>i remember last time during the old rate , where will be home at 12 or 1 am? mostly gotta tong till 3 or 4 am.</p>
              <p>My conlusion is : peak hour poor? then drive comfort. if LTA revert back to the old fare structure , U , me and everyone else will have to work more for less $, u wan that ah?</p>

              <p>Taxi are not supposed to be earning just $40 in 3 hours .</p>
              <p>Something must be causing it , why ?</p>
              <p>If i can get $100 with $1 peak hour , and $70 with 35% peak hoiur surcharge , pls go back with $1 peak hour surcharge .</p>
              <p>Now i am not saying i wany $1 to come back , i want a balance .....</p>
              <p>Just 20% ....</p>
              <p>What is Comfort's motives of 35% ?</p>
              <p>For drivers ?</p>
              <p>No , to push taxi goers back to their buses and mrt ....clear cut .</p>

              <p>Though fares are higher now, but more cabbies spend time waiting instead of doing some productive work, it's a waste of manpower resources. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>eh that $40 was a once in a blue moon thing , if u look at my other posting , i posted my rough peak hour earnings.</p>
              <p>$1 peak hour surcharge will probably benefit u guys without bookings , but to us , its a different thing altogether.</p>
              <p>Today i got a booking from edelweiss park to trader's hotel , fare was $34.50. and that booking was at 7 pm . are u able to get 34.50 based on the old rate? u drive from west to east and back to west ... maybe.</p>
              <p>what im trying to say is i support this new fare structure simply becos we make lesser trips for the same amount of money. with $1 , you have to drive like mad. maybe now u are young , so can pia , i old liao , i need the 35% hehehe</p>

              <p>u nap nap kali pok $330 then why u wanna make an issue out of the 35% leh? again i stress that making less trips with the same amt of money benefits taxi drivers as a whole. how many are young like u , can pick and go , pick and go ?</p>
              <p>very often i see comfort cabs queuing long long at IMM or Strategy , all they can do is to drive a bit further into pandan and sure got ping sound! but why they dont do that? i still do not understand. ridership may be down but the onus is on us to go find more fares , drive deeper , hide longer. Like one of the cabby today say , just have to look harder la.</p>
              <p>As for bigger picture , u and me are juz a pawn , we have no say in demand and supply , so why not look after ourselves first? and that is to have max fare for lesser effort.</p>

              <p>Like i said , peak hour $44 , from 8pm to 12am $152 .... saw the diff ?</p>
              <p>What if the surcharges adjusted from 35% to 20% ?</p>
              <p>Balance ?</p>
              <p>Commuters happy ? I am sure more will be more happy .</p>
              <p>drivers happy ? I am so sure many will .</p>
              <p>Now commuters not happy with 35% , drivers except you are happy ......</p>
              <p>If those against the 35% p/hr surcharge taxi drivers &amp; their taxis are to sent to sentosa island , sentosa will sink . hahahahahahaha</p>

              <p>lol bro , i also do street pick ups during peak hrs , where did u get the feedback that commuters are not happy? i for sure dont. intially when they revised the fare , one pax got a shock of her life , from tuas south to toh cres $54 , even i got a shock too coz i have never seen the meter like this before. but on the whole , commuters have accepted this liao la.</p>
              <p>the 35% kills if its a long distance route, if its a short one , the difference is not that great.</p>
              <p>ok if u say balance it up , fine 20% for peak and the main metre to be adjusted to jump quicker after 8 pm. seriously 8 pm till 2359 fares are too cheap. i picked a street from bayshore to clarke quay today.. no surcharge or anything , $10... thats really hard earned u know ? lol</p>

              <p>Bro , why are u worrying and worrying? u earn enough ok liao mah. 110 is really power for peak hours. Like i say , we are neither taxi companies , hell we arent even a staff of comfort or transcab . let these people deal with the worrying la please. at the end of the day , u lum your $330 sio sio in your pocket and i lum mine ( not so much as u la lol ) ok liao lor.</p>
              <p>As for more people owning cars , let me tell u it has nothing to do with expensive cab fares. it is to do with singaporean's aspirations. If fares were to be like the old rate , again the same problem arises , no TAXIS after 8 pm , all go and hide coz no city surcharge liao , wait for call. Wont this frustrate commuters into buying a car too?</p>
              <p>Right now , you and me are sitting on different side of the fence. If i were now to drive transcab , i will probably lobby your cause . if you were to drive blue , u wont even wanna raise this up at all. tio bo?</p>
              <p>so my take is fare cut or no fare cut , juz do our job , clock more clock less and juz go back to our own homes safe and sound ;)</p>

              <p>hi , what makes u think transcab or whoever u are drivin for is going to thank you? the answer is no as well.</p>
              <p>I have driven longer than you to know that yes they do make easy money from calls without sweating but did u know they also invest a lot on technology? comfort has one of the best tracking technology , if anything happens to u , they are able to dispatch help in double quick time. And if i were to kena a call thats $20 to $30 ... surely paying 50 cts is no big deal right?</p>
              <p>The 35% is to compensate us for the peak hour jams , endless crawling traffic on the highway, i wonder why u all are complainin ? lol</p>
              <p>If like KC bro suggest 20% , will the jams go away? will congestion ease? no it will still be there and worse part of all , u earn lesser , does not make sense at all la</p>

              <p>I agreed with Tio Call Liao....Non peak hour is too cheap... not only 8 pm to 2359 but also during day time... Peak hour 35% got to stay as it is reasonable as traffic snarls, and how many job can you get...during this periods...Not everyday is Sunday</p>

              <p>With more empty taxis on the roads hunting for passengers it is non-productive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's like in the past, you produce 100 burgers and you earn total of $100, you are more productive, more customers derived benefits and the economy is more productive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But now, you produce 10 burgers and you earn total of $200, you are less productive (cause most of the time your time hunting and waiting) yet you earn more than before (doesn't make sense does it), less customers derive benefits and the economy is less productive. Time spend hunting for passengers and waiting is wasted time (non productive).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More money to be made means no need to hand over shift? Can continue driving? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The reason why you see more empty taxis on the roads during peak is because it is too expensive and nobody is taking taxis. It does not necessarily mean that drivers don't handover shift and continue driving. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is evidence that not many people are taking taxis, you can see from the taxi queues forming at the airport and major shopping malls. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
