              <p>Bro , you say 730 pm to 8 pm is wasting time for taxi drivers , u implement a 20% surcharge will still be the same. Pax will still wait for watever surcharges to be over. Its the same with pax , pax wanna faster take a cab at 2345 to avoid midnight surcharges. But Most TD take the opportunity to break for coffee coz beh song to pick . So if 730 pm to 8 pm bo lang , then the TD also can take a break wad .</p>
              <p>In fact , 730 to 8 pm is i agree the quietest period in the whole 35% surcharge window but have you counted the 5 pm to 7 pm window? If heng heng those 2 hours can cover your rent and part of your diesel , so whats with wasting half an hour?</p>
              <p>Unless they increase the Base fare after 8 pm , The 35% must stay otherwise its really frustrating to go through all the jams and slow traffic for lower 'salary'</p>

              <p>Ya.. Burger as poolman said..came across few times Macdonald big and bulk orders their motocyclist delivery department cannot  take the job, alway used taxi delivered their stuffs to various fuction places. So taxi is still f**king cheap. Even like this kind of company  often exploited we taxi as their cheapest source of transportation to carryout the jobs. So who can say no to them, regulation said as long as we think we can take and got room to go in... no way we can reject them, if not they complain to LTA than you may awarded with demerit point.</p>
              <p>But who? can voice voice our's dissatisfaction.  tell me hor.</p>

              <p>In economics, the burger loss and the excess charged to consumers is called a deadweight loss, that's what monopoly does, produce at less than equilibrium demand and charge exorbitantly for it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The impact on the economy is more severe. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Agree that there are still those "quality" passengers around, but once those "quality" passengers go off, there won't be anymore "quality" passengers. By then all the commuters would have acclimatized themselves to taking MRT and buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reliance on a single source of income is detrimental for any business, for if that source terminates, there won't be anymore source of income. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Thanks for the insight but do you really think 35% is exhorbitant? to you maybe and to all those who cheong the MRTs and the buses but there are a select few who still prefer taking taxis. why? coz they hate to squeeze with the others.</p>
              <p>You and KC are lookin at the long term effects , but next year there is goin to be the IR and the RWS at sentosa and many many more which will perk up demand.</p>
              <p>By then taxis will be in such hot demand that those who support a cut in fares will be left wondering if it ever should be done. coz they will making more trips for lesser money , get stuck in the jams and get paid lesser.</p>
              <p>I gather you are an orchard goer thats why u see tonnes of cabs queuing outside the shopping malls , why dont u try being at shenton way from 630 pm to 715 pm , then come and gauge whether the demand is there or not. You cant juz look at one place where many cabs are queuing and say ohhhh long queue of taxis , times are bad, ridership is down</p>

              <p>If it's not exorbitant, then ST won't have published this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Goes to show that demand for taxis are elastic, but who am I to say so, you are in the industry you should know better. I suggest raising the fares another 50%-100%, so that taxi drivers can make more by driving less. Don't worry, there are others out there that will still feel taxi fares are cheap after this 100% increase and they are the ones that don't want to squeeze on the MRTs and buses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I am all for keeping the existing fares and even increasing it another 100%, believe me, I am on your side. Better still if they increase 200%. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxi ridership falls</span></strong></p>
              <p>FEWER people are taking taxis, but despite this, cabbies are against cutting fares to bring back the passengers.</p>
              <p>This is not the way to boost business and help drivers, said Comfort Taxi Operators' Association president Nah Tua Bah and CityCab Taxi Operators' Association president Robin Ng, speaking on behalf of five taxi operators here.</p>
              <p>They noted that cabbies were making less daily now because fewer people were taking taxis, but said lower fares - besides further chipping away at drivers' incomes - did not guarantee the commuters would come back.</p>
              <p>Some commuters, however, think differently. Civil servant Liew Nam Fatt, 40, who takes taxis four times a week, said he would do so more often if the peak-hour surcharge was cut.</p>
              <p>'Of course I will take cabs if they were cheaper. That is a natural commuter reaction, isn't it?'</p>
              <p>But there are also commuters like undergraduate Clarissa Chua, 21, who has declared she will stay away from taxis unless the fares come down - improbably - by half.</p>
              <p>The numbers confirm a fall in the number of passengers: Taxis provided 10.9 million rides for the whole of last year, a 4 per cent fall from 2007, when there were 11.3 million rides.</p>
              <p>On a monthly basis last year, January, October and November logged fewer than 900,000 rides each. No month in 2007 went below this number.</p>
              <p>The slump has hit drivers' earnings: The Straits Times understands that a driver who clocks 10 hours a day earned about $2,250 last November, 6 per cent less than the previous month.</p>
              <p>Those who drove a 'double shift', that is, more than 10 hours, took a bigger hit - their incomes shrank 8 per cent to $4,700 in November.</p>

              <p>I dun need quality pax but mass pax so that I can take as many pax as I can and go home happy. I dun need to make myself frustated to attend to pax who think that I belong to them. I ever kena with those ang mohs who think we taxis belong to them. The distance travelled is bloody near . Most of them stay at river valley area.

              <p>My proposition still is clear ...2007 August ...before fare hike .....</p>
              <p>Inside CBD , massive massive problems , demand overshot supply , resolution ?</p>
              <p>Increase taxi fleets , liberalised the industries , taxi companies can issues whatever taxi they want .....</p>
              <p>Outcome ? Still massive problems , cos those cabbies go up mountain side , dun want come down . Except for Comfort , supported by booking $3.50 , extra revenue .</p>
              <p>Reason for not coming down ? Diesel expensive . Come down same flag down , come down for what ?</p>
              <p>So 2 issues here ....</p>
              <p>Solve the CBD problems = $3 city surcharge , solve the issues , quite clear cut . Everyone's happy .</p>
              <p>Then solve the diesel expensive issue = Increase flag down , all at $2.80 and $3 . Swee swee , problems solved .</p>
              <p>Peak hour 35% ?</p>
              <p>Do we say we need that ? Do we had problems before for peak hour ? That $1 peak hour surcharge swee swee , no problem to me , never was a problem , 3 hours very fast past .</p>
              <p>What is their intention ?</p>
              <p>Answer : NEL in the red ..... NEL ridership not enough ..... bus service losing money .... they need more money to indent new fleet .....</p>
              <p>Whack 35% and push those people to fill up the MRT and buses .</p>
              <p>At the expense of taxi business , cos not their problems .</p>

              <p>Let's not talk about the rest of the fare , cos it's just nice , no loopholes .</p>
              <p>Let's focus on the diff between before 8pm and after 8pm ....</p>
              <p>I still cannot believe with 35% , i get only $44 and most gets $75 to $90 . Ok tactically i am wrong .... my fault .</p>
              <p>Without 35% , only with that CBD $3 , i can get $152 in 4 hours , someone enlighten me on this !!!</p>
              <p>Ok la , some get $75 , some get $90 ..... how many can get $152 in 4 hours ?</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>
              <p>Where did the people come from ?</p>
              <p>Why a sudden surge after 8pm ?</p>
              <p>Is it because the CBD $3 ?</p>
              <p>Is it because after 8pm , distance charge low ? Same right ?</p>
              <p>Is it because after i got many calls ?</p>
              <p>Is it because after 8pm , taxi fare is dirt cheap and everyone rush to take ?</p>
              <p>And does that benefit me ? It does , alot .</p>
              <p>So peak hour is not a problem ?</p>
              <p>Is that peak hour surcharge currently , fits nicely with the supply ? No oversupply .</p>
              <p>Does that peak hour surcharge , fits the bill nicely to the demand ? Under demand .</p>
              <p>Then there is no cancer , why is that an antidote for it ?</p>
              <p>When u are not sick , see doctor for what ?</p>

              <p>you are against the 35% , KC is against , KC is my long time friend , does it mean i have to support his stance coz i know him for donkey years?</p>

              <p>As for lobang sharing? i am not a limo driver , i do not have a walkie talkie , i got no jobs to page out , what lobang u want? from time to time if i see massive jams i will sms KC and my kakis. that is juz about as much as i can do.</p>
              <p>KC bro , seems like having a debate here can get on people's nerves , this should be my last posting. anything we can talk via sms. good luck in your forum discussion</p>

              <p>seems like my sms couldnt get to your  mobile as there isnt any reply. so i guess i have to come back here again :P</p>
              <p>you say u have comfort friends who are complaining.. then why dont u wanna hear from someone who isnt complaining? You dispute the fare structure without listening to both sides of the story . you only wanna hear what you wanna hear, how to have a discussion like this?</p>
              <p>I admit my after 8 pm sucks to the core , thats why im learning to do something abt it. why not do the same as well?</p>
              <p>Hirer or relief thats not really the point , to raise a point , you have to listen to both sides mah.</p>
              <p>I can sense the hostility from you after i post what i wanna say , if you are angry , i also bo pian.</p>
              <p>As a moderator , its better to be fair and open to all instead of juz stickin to your own points and views. If its going to be like that , why have a forum in the 1st place?</p>
