              <p>If you are driving along bedok reservoir road late at night, you better siam if you see an indian in wet construction clothes or a woman carrying a child, both dressed in red, flagging your taxi. There was another case but it's hard to imagine half a body trying to flag a taxi.</p>

              <p><br> F lar, zombies also we take, why scare ghost, like Pool said,
              actually ghost are more scare of us, that is why they go
              hiding, those who come out are actually AWOL, rebellious type,
              maybe due to deep hatre and vengeance.</p>
              <p>I believe most sighting by Cabbies are hallucination, at nite
              shift, after driving so long, sweeping and eyes tiring, every pax
              also cannot miss, the concentration takes away the mind, end up
              seeing dog also said ghost, see lampost or some object, thot it is
              pax waving. It part of our driving hazard. So, brother, the
              road can be full of cash, but the body need rest, without
              sufficient rest, you got no power to pick up all these cash, and
              worst, you start to get sick and concentrate wrongly easily</p>

              <p>Three places I've seen ghosts since I became TD</p>
              <p>1. Geylang Road,reportedly any tiem of the day, 24/7.   See so many ghosts there, all have common style, they tought they are invicible to human being and  have been seen floating from one side of the road to the other end without any regards to the oncoming traffic. They don't know that we human actually can see them and have to siam left-right and sometimes jam brake to avoid "trouble". Most of these ghosts seem to have just "arrived" in singapore, although i believe some of them were made-in-singapore.</p>
              <p>2. Serangoon Rd and Jalan Besar. Especially on Sundays and between 5pm to midnight on other days.   Similar to the ones at geylang, but in different shape and colour. Some also known to have very long arms that can reach your cars while you are driving in the middle lane while they are still standing at the road side. They are known to have daily rituals of flagging their arms to make them grow longer.</p>
              <p>3. Clarke Quay, peculiarly only on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday morning between 3am and 6am. Day time drivers will never ever have encounter them. These ghosts are known to have a very quick action to suddenly appear in front of your vehicle. According to some brave drivers who ever tried to "communicate" with these ghosts have many different types of aroma coming from their mouths, apparently depending on what spirit they follow.</p>
