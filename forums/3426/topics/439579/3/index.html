              <p>Three places I've seen ghosts since I became TD</p>
              <p>1. Geylang Road,reportedly any tiem of the day,
              24/7.   See so many ghosts there, all have common style,
              they tought they are invicible to human being and  have been
              seen floating from one side of the road to the other end without
              any regards to the oncoming traffic. They don't know that we human
              actually can see them and have to siam left-right and sometimes jam
              brake to avoid "trouble". Most of these ghosts seem to have just
              "arrived" in singapore, although i believe some of them were
              made-in-singapore.</p>
              <p>2. Serangoon Rd and Jalan Besar. Especially on Sundays and
              between 5pm to midnight on other days.   Similar to the
              ones at geylang, but in different shape and colour. Some also known
              to have very long arms that can reach your cars while you are
              driving in the middle lane while they are still standing at the
              road side. They are known to have daily rituals of flagging their
              arms to make them grow longer.</p>
              <p>3. Clarke Quay, peculiarly only on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday
              morning between 3am and 6am. Day time drivers will never ever have
              encounter them. These ghosts are known to have a very quick action
              to suddenly appear in front of your vehicle. According to some
              brave drivers who ever tried to "communicate" with these ghosts
              have many different types of aroma coming from their mouths,
              apparently depending on what spirit they follow.</p>

              <p>Picked up 2 paxs from Hougang going to AMK St. 31, 1 aunty and the other a female in the 20's. Both were chatting happily behind when suddenly along Boundary Road, the aunty asked me to drive slower as there's someone in front.</p>
              <p>I was about to overtake a bus and could see no one at all. Infront. I looked at my front passenger seat, no one leh. Sheesh now suddenly I got chills. I asked the aunty can overtake the bus or not. Both who were chatting non-stop when they boarded became very quiet and did not answer me. They maintain silence until just before I turn into AMK St. 31 when the younger female remarked loudly "he's not there anymore" and both of them began chatting away again.</p>
              <p>I did not want to asked why, just let them alight and drove off. Next week me and my relief went to Tua Peh Kong Temple and got a talisman for the car.</p>
