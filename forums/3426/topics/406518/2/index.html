              <p>U are prejudice......obviously u never read my post or my uncompleted newbie guide. If not you will know that I have been an OMO for over a year now. ^^ lol...............</p>
              <p>However, you are right to say that majority of the pple here propagate pple to become a relief over OMO.</p>
              <p>Not that being an OMO driver is bad, but it is definitely easier for a driver to start off (or to stay as a relief). Like what some pple says, OMO is no life. I have driver a 7 seater for over a year with no relief. Not that my earnings are bad, infact compared to many pple of my batch, I would say I beat their earnings flat. Of course there are some drivers here who in the past mentioned I have bookings/airport transfer blah blah blah.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is, irregardless of what kind of TD you are, your income depend very much on your mentality and motivation. With bit of business mind, you can earn good money.</p>
              <p>Sadly to say, to my observation, some drivers may not be sensitive enough why new pple are desperate enough to be a hirer. So instead of advicing them to do better or share with how to go about conducting their trade, they just whine non-stop about problems. But I must add that it is not that they dun care, they just dunno how to type it in such a way in an online community forum to show that they emphatize with hirer who faces struggle as a new guy.</p>
              <p>Seriously speaking, if OMO or being a hirer is really that bad, taxi companies would have to close shop by now. On top of that all relief will "jia hong" (idle) cause there is not enough hirer to look for relief.</p>
              <p>Therefore this is defnitely not a relief only forum. You need to read slowly and taste the caring kindness behind those broken english. And O, most important, dun believe too much of wad taxi drivers say. This is especially when they are boasting. Cause we all know that all are bull shits.....for eg, if a driver can practically avoid going to 1/2 of the Singapore Locale, bloody crap how in the world he tan jia.......</p>
              <p>Lakeview will have problem looking for drivers to fetch all their coorperate jobs offer. Cause if u tell me no one goes to places like Woodlands, Hougang, Jurong West etc, I eat noodle with my nose.</p>
              <p>And O.....usually the pros are the silent one...like submarine....if u never use sonar......BOOM!!!!! Topedoe strike!</p>
              <p>If u wan to be OMO, take the advice given here, go find a relief ...or the very least, weekend relief. Save some time for family......why sweat like slave to pay rent.....</p>

              your income depend very much on your mentality and motivation. With
              bit of business mind, you can earn good money.</p>
              <p>Sadly to say, to my observation, some drivers may not be
              sensitive enough why new pple are desperate enough to be a hirer.
              So instead of advicing them to do better or share with how to go
              about conducting their trade, they just whine non-stop about
              problems. But I must add that it is not that they dun care, they
              just dunno how to type it in such a way in an online community
              forum to show that they emphatize with hirer who faces struggle as
              a new guy.</p>
              <p>Seriously speaking, if OMO or being a hirer is really that bad,
              taxi companies would have to close shop by now. On top of that all
              relief will "jia hong" (idle) cause there is not enough hirer to
              look for relief.</p>
              <p>Therefore this is defnitely not a relief only forum. You need to
              read slowly and taste the caring kindness behind those broken
              english. And O, most important, dun believe too much of wad taxi
              drivers say. This is especially when they are boasting. Cause we
              all know that all are bull shits.....for eg, if a driver can
              practically avoid going to 1/2 of the Singapore Locale, bloody crap
              how in the world he tan jia.......</p>
              <p>Lakeview will have problem looking for drivers to fetch all
              their coorperate jobs offer. Cause if u tell me no one goes to
              places like Woodlands, Hougang, Jurong West etc, I eat noodle with
              my nose.</p>
              <p>And O.....usually the pros are the silent one...like
              submarine....if u never use sonar......BOOM!!!!! Topedoe
              strike!</p>
              <p>If u wan to be OMO, take the advice given here, go find a relief
              ...or the very least, weekend relief. Save some time for
              family......why sweat like slave to pay rent.....</p>

              <p>Indeed Lake View members dun take jobs to Woodlands , i mean it , serious .</p>
