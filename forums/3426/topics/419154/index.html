              <p><br>I said before , a bus company , should be focusing on their bus services , not taxi services .</p>
              <p>And MRT likewise , should be minding their own bloody MRT business .</p>
              <p> A conflict of public services .</p>
              <p>Not as if they are making tonnes of money , they are losing money .</p>
              <p>Why are you losing money if u are supposed to make ?</p>

              <p>To wake them up .</p>
              <p>SMRT are created to challenge the free market , to make it better , make it tougher for each individual company .</p>
              <p>But it didn't turn out to be that case .</p>
              <p>Instead , it became a tools for some people for gain personal interests .</p>
              <p>Sorry MerCab , that u happened to be a SMRT driver , cos u are one of the individual driver , not linked to them ( lone ranger ) , more Lake View than SMRT .</p>
              <p>I just said what i thought , and what i've encounter . Not really nice if u are in that circle . I mean that SATS inner circle .</p>
              <p>If STDA can manage SATS for so many years , for just a centre to provide SATS staffs home , for SMRT , i do not know why SIA / SATS have to re-tender the SATS project again ...... SMRT smaller ? No la , it's the system .</p>

              <p>Fyi, Night buses are implemented by TIBS, not SMRT.</p>
              <p>SMRT shouldn't operate public bus services. They make a mess out of it. Irresponsible company with their way of providing sub standard services. Since they are really interested in making profits only, then just go into rail and cab business, these will make money. Forget about the bus operations, let the experts handle instead, and divert their resources to better focus on these 2 aspects instead. TIBS cabs wasn't that bad last time. Don't know why SMRT can screw up the taxi operations as well, lose money, complains and now fines, year after year. I don't know other than making profits for themselves, what is their purpose of existance?</p>
              <p>Cocked up lousy bus services, cab operations can't even make it to the mark, rail operartions get lots of complains. This kind of irresponsible and selfish company should fine them some more in future.</p>
              <p>Looking at TransCab, they are doing well and expanding. Maybe they should take over half of SMRT taxis and take over SMRT Buses operations and form back <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRANS</span> ISLAND bus services, under <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRANS</span> CAB.</p>
              <p>But sadly, public transport market here isn't open and free.</p>

              <p>SMRT, TRANS, TIBS or LRT, comfort etc etc is all govt related, make or lost is still back to the same coffer, even with a fine, it will be ploughed back to the same balancing sheet. Do not let the govt fool you guys round and round.</p>
              <p>Most of these corporation are run by retired or ORDed military officers, from colonels to B generals, most are SAF/govt scholars who never do a real business in their life before. So, what do you expect, sack them??</p>
              <p>You guys already said that why after years of lost, still smrt can go on?? If it is a private corporation, long long  moved or close shop liao. But it is the govt related company, ah kong's company, how to close shop?? here do not make, there make also the same, just different strategy to create job for generals and scholars</p>

              <p>Most likely I feel that the market in Singapore is too small, very hard to make money sustain with that market share. That is especially relevant to bus and rail operations. Multimodal companies proved to be a failure. </p>
              <p>Look at SMRT, they are good in rail operations but becomes worse after taking over TIBS bus and taxi operations. Their resources are all scattered over different operations, but still focusing most on their rail business. Thus taxi and especially bus operations are negelected, resulting on poorer and pooer service standards. They should give up their bus operations and divert their resources to provide a better rail service. Likewise for ComfortDelgro, SBS Transit. Venturing into NEL only give commuters less choices on bus services, since they want to cut down duplications to save resources.</p>
              <p>That's why I prefer a one company operating rail only, that is SMRT and one company operating bus only, which is SBS Transit. In this way, there is no conflict of interests in operations and two modes of transport (bus and rail) can compete with each other for better services. Therefore, on top of a network of rail system, it can also stress SBS Transit to provide better bus services with a better bus network than rail, faster and more flexible bus trips for commutes and provide a better alternative for commuters. It also helps the bus operator to make a decent profit with the sustainable market share in this small country. Since the bus operations share market is so small, it would be better to have one operator which can at least make money and sustain for long term, rather than the influx of many players which in the end, do not make profits and leave the market promptly.</p>
              <p>However looking into the cab market share here, there is no problem for more players, since the market share is so big, even it is controlled. However it is up to the individual taxi companies to operated their taxi business. If they can't manage this business well, especially those with many kinds of other operations, it is best that they sell away their "dogs" and divert their resources to improve the business or just sell them away.</p>
              <p>I would prefer a foreign player to bid for the future lines instead. The chances of government intervention and take over will be very less likely. Keppel Corp, isn't it another GLC linked company? In no time, it will be either under ComfortDelgro wing or SMRT wing, since all are under the same entity. Anyway, I don't see the need for so many MRT lines, they are expensive to build, operate and maintain, and inflexible and likely to cause more ground and buildings structural problems if there are too many tunnels. MRT lines going through the city and very populated areas with a few stations with buses complementing and serving the rest of the areas is good enough. Our MRT is too slow because there are too many stations in one line.</p>
              <p>All these chaos are created by this govt. Not enough infrastructral supports and yet still want to increase the population, and so rapidly these few years. I really envious the Singaporeans living in the 70s and the 80s, less crowded and less stressful.</p>

              <p>I think most likely they want to expand other than just into cab operations. Afterall the issuing of taxi licenses is limited and controlled every year. I don't think they just want to expand year after year with that miserable amount of new taxis on the road. And looking at the COE supplies recently.</p>
              <p>But I would like to caution their venture into bus operations here because it is not a money making business because operations are demanding and overheads are high. I don't think they might have the right capital to stomach all that. And even if they start out, their market share is very small and it might be very hard for them to sustain for long term. Probably taking over SMRT buses will  give them a right stepping stone as the market share is sizable and yet not too big for them to be unmanageable, and those areas served under SMRT buses seriously need a major bus services overhaul. Replacement for a new player might be good.</p>
              <p>Else I think it is better for them to venture more into premium bus services. Or investing more into CNG refuelling stations and looking into other green energy sources, like electricity fuelling stations for future electric cars, or hydrogen, bio-gas, etc type of infrastructural possibilities to support green energy for the future.</p>
