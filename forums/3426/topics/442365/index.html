              To Those of Us Born 
              1925 - 1970 : 
              At the end of this email is a quote of the month by Jay Leno. If you don't read anything else, please read what he said. 
              
              Very well stated, Mr. Leno. 
              ~~~~~~~~~ 
              TO ALL THE KIDS WHO SURVIVED THE 1930s, '40s, '50s, '60s and '70s!! 
              
              First, we survived being born to mothers who may have smoked and/or drank 
              while they were pregnant. 
              
              They took aspirin, ate blue cheese dressing, tuna from a can, and didn't get tested for diabetes. 
              
              Then, after that trauma, we were put to sleep on our tummies 
              in baby cribs covered with bright coloured lead-based paints. 
              
              We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, locks on doors or cabinets, 
              and, when we rode our bikes, we had baseball caps, not helmets, on our heads.
              As infants and children, we would ride in cars with no car seats, no booster seats, no seat belts, no air bags, bald tires and sometimes no brakes..
              
              Riding in the back of a pick- up truck on a warm day was always a special treat. 
              
              We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. 
              
              We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle, and no one actually died from this. 
              
              We ate cupcakes, white bread, real butter, and bacon. We drank Kool-Aid made with real white sugar. And we weren't overweight. 
              WHY? 
              
              Because we were always outside playing...that's why!
              
              We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on. 
              No one was able to reach us all day. 
              --And, we were OKAY.
              
              We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then ride them down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes.. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.. 
              
              We did not have Play Stations, Nintendos and X-boxes. There were no video games, no 150 channels on cable, no video movies or DVDs, no surround-sound or CDs, no cell phones, no personal computers, no Internet and no chat rooms. 
              
              WE HAD FRIENDS 
              and we went outside and found them!
              
              We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits 
              from those accidents. 
              
              We would get spankings with wooden spoons, switches, ping-pong paddles, or just a bare hand, and no one would call child services to report abuse.
              
              We ate worms, and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in us forever. 
              
              We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays, made up games with sticks and tennis balls, and 
              -although we were told it would happen- we did not put out very many eyes. 
              
              We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just walked in and talked to them. 
              
              Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. 
              Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment. 
              Imagine that!! 
              
              The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law! 
              
              These generations have produced some of the best risk-takers, 
              problem solvers, and inventors ever. 
              
              The past 50 to 85 years have seen an explosion of innovation and new ideas.. 
              
              We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. 
              
              If YOU are one of those born between 1925-1970, CONGRATULATIONS! 
              
              You might want to share this with others who have had the luck to grow up as kids before the lawyers and the government regulated so much of our lives for our own good. 
              
              While you are at it, forward it to your kids, so they will know how brave and lucky their parents were. 
              
              Kind of makes you want to run through the house with scissors, doesn't it ? 
              ~~~~~~~ 
              The quote of the month 
              by 
              Jay Leno: 
              
              "With hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding, severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to another, and with the threat of bird flu and terrorist attacks, are we sure this is a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?"
              
              For those that prefer to think that God is not watching over us...go ahead and delete this. 
              For the rest of us.....pass this on.

              <p>The past is of course good to know, historian alway like to say, if you do not know history, you do not know anything. Quite true in a sense, we need to know where we come from because history makes us what we are today, it is good to let them know, but do not tell them to follow it or expect them to follow it, because our time are over, we learn from history, not follow history, we should therefore, using our past as wisdom and past it on to our son, because more importantly, what we do today, will shape their future.</p>
              <p>I believe most of us during our young time had in a way forced to listen to our father and grandfather old time stories, at that time, most of us would had felt, alamak, so lor sor, knn, everytime talk about their last time, sian bo, come on men, now is new era already. You will end up saying last time police wear short leh. This will also apply to your son thinking when you talk to him now, he might think my old man start to talk old story again, aiya, just listen to satisfy him.</p>
              <p>So to convey your last time life to your son, you need to be tactical and gel well with today scene. You hv to be nimble enough to give good real example so that they understand, produce question for them to ponder, young peoples like quiz, guess and questions, it can be both way of questioning, just like recently my son asked me, why last time people can gave birth to so much babies, now, one also very difficult, or alternatively, you can ask your son, Do you know why last time, people gave birth to more babies than now?</p>
              <p>The answer combined all you hv quoted above, because last time, people got no hp, no computer, no games, some even no TV and people sleep early as there are less light and more poor people, so when nothing to do, they make love.</p>
