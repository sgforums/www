              <p>Mr Pool, in all cases the Prosecution has the ultimate discretion to charge or not to charge. the court does not have the power to order the Prosecution to charge a person.</p>
              <p>as in that case, the transaction did not go thru, where is the evidence of illegal prostitution? there is only evidence of cheating.</p>
              <p>in your fren's case, there is evidence of cheating, for the illegal betting the evidence has to come from the person who run away rite? or your friend admit to it. even then the Prosecution can choose to close one eye. who can force them to prosecute?</p>

              <p>honestly speaking, it's your friend's fault</p>
              <p>for example, my friend and i go and rob the bank, before that we agree each person share half of the money. after robbing the bank he dont share with me, do you think i dare to report police? no, right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's why that farker dare to cheat your friend. $25k, go calculate. who wont run away with that kind of money?</p>
              <p>you dont worry which police department will investigate. your friend want to report or dont want to report we leave it to him. afterall he will need to assist the police in the investigation and not us. Go to court to be witness - also not us but him, so tell him that. the decision is his.</p>

              <p>2. that if during caning, the medical officer decides that the prisoner is unfit to     be continued to be caned :</p>
              <p>    (a) the matter is reported to the court, which can choose to remit the caning or increase the jail term in lieu of the strokes not carried out.</p>
              <p>OR</p>

              <p>ans: Correct!</p>
              <p>2. that if during caning, the medical officer decides that the prisoner is unfit to     be continued to be caned :<br><br> (a) the matter is reported to the court, which can choose to remit the caning or increase the jail term in lieu of the strokes not carried out.</p>
              <p>ans: the court only passed the sentence of how many strokes to cane the accused, after that the discretion is with the prison authority. if the doctor recommends that the accused cannot take it anymore (halfway thru the canning) , all the remaining strokes are canceled. the prison don't have to seek the court authority for this. no increase in jail term</p>
              <p>however, if before the caning starts and the doctor found that the accused cannot be caned at all for medical reasons. the prison need to inform the court to amend the sentence to jail only without any strokes. jail term can be increased by the court.</p>
              <p>you can confirm this with the prison authority but i doubt they will tell you. this is a matter of practice.</p>

              <p>managed to download a pdf file of the criminal procedure code 2009. covered in section 286.dun know need permission or not, but anyway i reproduce it below.</p>
              <p><strong>Procedure if punishment cannot be inflicted under section 285</strong></p>
              <p>286.—(1) Where a sentence of caning is wholly or partially prevented<br> from being carried out under section 285, the offender must be kept in<br>custody until the court that passed the sentence can revise it.</p>
              <p>(2) That court may —<br>(a) remit the sentence; or<br>(b) sentence the offender instead of caning, or instead of as much of<br>the sentence of caning as was not carried out, to imprisonment<br>for 12 months or less, which may be in addition to any other<br>punishment to which he has been sentenced for the same offence.</p>
              <p>once again, thanks to pandachen.</p>

              <p>Hi Pool,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>knowledge is power, but sometimes ignorance is bliss :)</p>
              <p>hope we can learn from each other as much as possible</p>
              <p>i notice you dont understand about evidence to be used in court. the law of evidence is divided into Criminal and Civil. i specialized in criminal and criminal procedures. next time we meet at yew tee, can discuss with you again.</p>
              <p>cheers</p>
