              <p>piggy , not that we dunno .....</p>
              <p>we knew all routes ....</p>
              <p>We scared the route we took might not be the route u prefer , thus more money , maybe yes , maybe no .</p>
              <p>So LTA instructions , ask Pax which way they prefer us to drive .</p>
              <p>For me , i always asked this way : " Miss/ Sir , Sengkang ( from Suntec ) , which way u prefer ? KPE or CTE ? "</p>
              <p>That's all ... the key word " prefer " .</p>
              <p>I know cabby keen to use : " Go by which way ? "</p>
              <p>Which gave commuters the impression we dunno , we knew .</p>

              <p>Cheating is defined in Section 415 Penal Cap 224:</p>
              <p>Cheating<br>415. Whoever, by deceiving any person, whether or not such deception was the sole or main inducement,</p>
              <p>fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person,</p>
              <p>or to consent that any person shall retain any property,</p>
              <p>or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to any person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to “cheat”. <br>[51/2007]<br><br>Explanation 1.—A dishonest concealment of facts is a deception within the meaning of this section. <br><br>Explanation 2.—Mere breach of contract is not of itself proof of an original fraudulent intent. <br><br>Explanation 3.—Whoever makes a representation through any agent is to be treated as having made the representation himself. <br><br>the punishment depends on whether the charge is under Sec 417 or Sec 420 of the Penal Code Cap 224.</p>
              <p><br>Punishment for cheating</p>
              <p>417. Whoever cheats shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both.</p>
              <p>Cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property</p>
              <p>420. Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.</p>
              <p>(Previously the max under Sec 420 was 7 years, now increased to 10 years)</p>

              <p>in the case of bounce cheque, this is illustrated in the penal code as follows:</p>
              <p>(d) A, by tendering in payment for an article a bill on a house with which A keeps no money, and by which A expects that the bill will be dishonoured, intentionally deceives Z, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to deliver the article, intending not to pay for it. A cheats.</p>

              <p>On a lighter side of things, i wish to recommend Master Pool, if he has time, to play this Nintendo NDS lite game. You play the role of a defense lawyer and has to find clues and evidence to help your client to get acquitted in court of law.</p>

              <p>in the case of bounce cheque, this is illustrated in the penal code as follows:</p>
              <p>(d) A, by tendering in payment for an article a bill on a house with which A keeps no money, and by which A expects that the bill will be dishonoured, intentionally deceives Z, and thereby dishonestly induces Z to deliver the article, intending not to pay for it. A cheats.</p>

              <p>i understand the cheque can be cancel, if that is the case it still shows no intention to pay, can be civil action for owing money. instead of speculating why dont your friend confirm with the bank what is the reason for the bounce cheque.</p>
              <p>if the bank cant tell your friend then ask him to go ahead n make police report. the police can ask the bank why cheque bounce.</p>
              <p>but has your friend decided to tell the whole story to the police?</p>

              <p>No need to be so formal. i come here to make friends. just call me Tan will do.</p>
              <p>i agree with your friend - make police report also may backfire, but it is this kind of situation that the bad guy gets away and there is no justice.</p>
              <p>hope your friend can find a solution soon. advise him to bet with Singapore Pool only, safer.</p>
