              <p>Newbies come in with different form,</p>
              <p>The ones who find it the most difficult to drives Taxi are those who had never touch a steering wheel for years, or since passed their driving license, as such, it is better for you to learn and handle the car first, today, may taxis come with turbos, you hv to be careful on handling it, see so many dash into lamppost, walls, other vehicles and up kerbs etc etc.</p>
              <p>Once you get the feel of the cab, then start to take fare. Most newbies come from 8 to 5 jobs kind of environment, a sudden switch can be exciting but also stressful, learn to be steady and calm, most importantly, tell pax honestly that you are new and ask for direction, but more importantly, you must be able to handle the cab. Spend sometime driving around with it first.</p>
              <p>Once you get the pax, the destination, on the meter and whatever surcharges, off you go, I can tell you that at that moment of ferry the pax for your virgin trip, those theories in classroom is history.</p>

              For this, I don't agreed on JDI, the statistic by CDG on their hirer, 60 per cent including me was with either CDG or city cab since day one becoming TD......
              
              With more perk and benefit offer by other companies nowsday, people tends to do their sum and decide on which company to drive with......and some having some bias opinion with CDG decided to leave....

              <p>With more perk and benefit offer by other companies nowsday,
              people tends to do their sum and decide on which company to drive
              with…...and some having some bias opinion with <span>CDG</span> decided to leave….</p>
              <p><span>CDG</span> never is a training school for TD,
              have u wonder why they tends to be the largest taxi company in
              Singapore?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>With TC capabilities, they can’t be largest?</strong></span> Why those city cab
              limo drivers choose to join the pioneer batch of <span>TC
              MERC</span> fleet….and leave <span>CDG</span> with all the
              lobang?</p>
              <p>TD training is everyday Otr, learn and learn by yourself,
              experience every possible encounter, that should really be your
              training school…...</p>

              Just annoyed by the words trained by CDG 100 per cent, Cause they teach me nothing all these years.....maybe me by wording cannot express clearly....thousand of apologies....
              
              Statistic is just figures, anyway TD always have their free way, by saying they monopolies the markets those time also unfair statement cause those privatised companies not existing yet.....using present situation to penalized someone last time is not very fair, correct me if I'm wrong on that....
              
              As for TC, I stated that they can be the largest also, with their annual report each year from union gas, maybe they had the abilities to acquire CDG also, but who's stopping them? Why they had to let go the last 50 fleets of new MERC to CDG?
              
              A lot of things is ???? But for Taxi Uncle, ti ko liang, ti ko cho, correct? Hahaha

And for those in 50s like me and some ah kongs here, whereby our childrens also grew up, married and bear our grandchildrens, enjoy Taxi driving while it last. The youngs today driving is unlike our time, we can survive in those day due to lower cost of living, less cabs, and cheaper fuel with years of booming economy from 70s into late 90s,</p>
