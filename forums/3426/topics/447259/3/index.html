              <p>1) Good Mapping (GPRS)</p>
              <p>2) Many MDT(IVT) calls, with the above mapping, it is easier to

              <p>3) Better workshop (for serivicing)</p>
              <p>4) Many diesel kisoks around the island. ( diesel at higher
              discount )</p>
              <p>5) Cashless payment (eg NETS, CREDIT CARDs) with faster
              clearance.</p>

              <p>Perhap I should rephrase it, what I meant is that if there is a chance, certainly those below 2k job is not a chance, if given a chance to take a job of 3k and above you can consider the switch, the govt projection in real wage increase in the 10 years will be 30% of what is been paid now inorder to sustain the minimium std of living, as I read the news, when NTA president asked our PM about Taxi Driver rental, whether he can do something to lower the rental or absorb the fuel tax inorder to make TD a better prospect or at least in line with the working class and society.</p>
              <p>The reply was, Taxi driver is not a employer and employee base kind of relationship where the laws of employement and engagement apply, we will see what we can do to TD.</p>
              <p>From here, you see how the govt react to TD, "to see or look into/about it" is not going to be work because my believe is that if the working class move up the ladder of society, we taxi driver could be left far behind slavering all the way, there need to have a framework to set TD in a right direction, be it a regulation or system, we are all matured Singaporeans , approx 50 thousands of them in this trade, be it limos or relief all included, within it our families can consitute another 100 thousands more, all eligible to vote, for that, I hope the PM can seriously look into this layman trade and do the best for us, it will be a win win situation for all.</p>

              <p>CDG doesn't care if you kena summon by LTA for smoking, wearing inappropriate attire or get booked for speeding. All this they leave to LTA enforce and will take no action against the driver if LTA is handling them. No warning letter etc etc, but they will cooperate with LTA by retrieving any data.</p>
              <p>They only take action if public complains to them, and unless it's a case of assault, fare-cheating or something where the driver is clearly not at fault, CDG is very quick to take sides with the pax. Even your so called episode with the woman going Changi North, is considered your fault under CDG's policy.</p>
              <p>For accident, it's the standard everywhere. 1st in a year - warning, 2nd - termination. This is acceptable.</p>
              <p>Overcharging is under LTA, but if serious, especially if reported in the press, that's a red card offence.</p>

              <p>CDG now operates fully as a cash cow. As long as your earning money for them, it's all well and good. The moment you become a liability, they will have no hesitation in terminating you.</p>
              <p>Eg: You hirer for 3-5 years. You pay $3k or more a month for the cab. For that amount you can easily pay for a brand new Mercs private car installment and have lots of change.

              <p>But if you owe 3-4 days rental, they'll chase you worse than Ah Long. Everyday got call to pay. You cannot suka suka tell them you clear slowly, they give you a time frame, usually ask to pay in 2 halves. You cannot make it, they repo the cab. And after you clear the arrears, they will also tell you, sorry hor, now you only can become relief, no more hirer - policy.</p>
              <p>They are always at the upper hand, even the 'benefits' they offer when you 1st sign up, is not a problem. You drive 5-6 months only also no problem, whatever they have given you, is already made back.</p>
              <p>You cannot comply or struggle to pay, never mind off you go, there's already a new batch just out of the academy, more than willing to take your place.</p>
              <p>They never owe you anything as far as they are concerned, just look at their handbook for hirers and relief. Everything they already cover themselves. You take it or leave it.</p>

              <p>Of course I'm not saying CDG is totally bad. I also drive their cab. They of course have some good points like cheaper diesel, many pumps, quick repayment of cashless etc.</p>
              <p>For myself I feel, when you drive for them, you must keep you eyes open and not place total faith that they will do their best for you. Maybe as a new driver/hirer/relief, some think the world of CDG and are easily swayed by their marketing and promotions. Some even feel a sense of loyalty, that they must defend CDG against other companies or drivers, who mock them.</p>
              <p>True some drive for them for donkey years with no complaints, because they can stomach whatever policies CDG implements. But for those who can't, then they realise, hey how come things are quite different to what I thought or was told they were?</p>
              <p>For me, I am more than willing to demand from CDG whatever I think they should be doing or promising. They like to harp about how good and big they are, and how strictly they deal with errant drivers. Therefore I also don't tolerate if the vehicles aren't in good shape and will never let the workshop off for any slipshod job. Any other thing that I rightfully think they should do and aren't I won't be slow to complain and demand.</p>
              <p>Afterall they don't owe me or pancan me, why shouldn't I do the same?</p>

              Bro JoeRaj, Agree most of your true facts, except this rental things....
              
              We can't possibly compare taxi to pte car, of course in term of paper calculation, you are right, but we TD had to drive to earn that dollars, in other words, all rental or overhead in actual facts is borne by the pax....if we drive, than only got $ come in and pay whatever we want, but if we don't drive and earn that $, how to buy a pte MERC, unless we are as successful as JDI....hahaha
              
              Many of our peers like to compare the amount of $ we had pump in to the company, we ask ourself a question? Are we self employed? The answer is NO! We actually are daily worker, if you work, than got $, if not, we still had to lose that rental....and if really cannot takan, return and out you go from TD......Bo jiu beh one....
              
              I pay approximately $45k for my whole last year rental, that amt of course can buy any car in the world.....but as a daily worker like what I had say, we can't get this $45k in 1 month and don't talk about 1 day.....So think about that, how to maintain a pte MERC where it cannot generate income for you.....

                  Long. Everyday got call to pay. You cannot suka suka tell them you
                  clear slowly, they give you a time frame, usually ask to pay in 2
                  halves. You cannot make it, they repo the cab. And after you clear
                  the arrears, they will also tell you, sorry hor, now you only can
                  become relief, no more hirer - policy.</p>
              <p>They are always at the upper hand, even the 'benefits' they
                  offer when you 1st sign up, is not a problem. You drive 5-6 months
                  only also no problem, whatever they have given you, is already made
                  back.</p>
              <p>You cannot comply or struggle to pay, never mind off you go,
                  there's already a new batch just out of the academy, more than
                  willing to take your place.</p>
              <p>They never owe you anything as far as they are concerned, just
                  look at their handbook for hirers and relief. Everything they
                  already cover themselves. You take it or leave it.</p>

              <p>Bro JoeRaj, Agree most of your true facts, except this rental
              things….</p>
              <p>We can’t possibly compare taxi to pte car, of course in term of
              paper calculation, you are right, but we TD had to drive to earn
              that dollars, in other words, all rental or overhead in actual
              facts is borne by the pax….if we drive, than only got $ come in and
              pay whatever we want, but if we don’t drive and earn that $, how to
              buy a pte <span>MERC</span>, unless we are as successful
              as <span>JDI</span>….hahaha</p>
              <p>Many of our peers like to compare the amount of $ we had pump in
              to the company, we ask ourself a question? Are we self employed?
              The answer is NO! We actually are daily worker, if you work, than
              got $, if not, we still had to lose that rental….and if really
              cannot takan, return and out you go from TD…...Bo jiu beh one….</p>
              <p>I pay approximately $45k for my whole last year rental, that amt
              of course can buy any car in the world…..but as a daily worker like
              what I had say, we can’t get this $45k in 1 month and don’t talk
              about 1 day…..So think about that, how to maintain a pte
              <span>MERC</span> where it cannot generate income for
              you…..</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, you're absolutely spot on.  We are daily rated workers as well, many ppl don't realise that.</p>
              <p>Maybe I should have phrased it better, meaning to say that the 3k rental we pay, it's justified for us to demand the taxi companies always ensure good vehicles for us, esp for CDG because they like to harp they are No 2 in the world.</p>
              <p>As you said, although we pay 3k a month, we would not be able to afford a Mercs, because without the cab, we won't be able to generate the total of 4k and over, that would cover rental and our salaries.</p>
              <p>But what I had hoped from CDG since they definitely aren't losing, because of high rentals, that they be a little more accomodating and understanding when hirers fall into arrears. My friend had taken a brand new Skoda after getting his TVDL. Drove for more than 4 years, then because he wanted to switch, fell into arrears. Yet Silver allowed the amount to balloon to over 3k. They didn't come after him like sharks. After taking the cab back, they minused the deposit and arranged a monthly repayment scheme, which he was able to manage.</p>
              <p>There's no way CDG would ever do something like this.</p>

              <p>Gentlemen, please do not look at yourself as daily contract workers, and if want to know, I am one of these contract workers, when I go shipyard or on board to work, the timing is fix and must be on time, even breaks are controlled, get scolded by suprintendents or captain or chief engineer also must go on once contract for work were agreed. Then, at the end of the contract, you get paid, sometime, due to corporate accounting issues,  have to wait for weeks before releasing it to your account.</p>
              <p>TD take cold hard cash, can take breaks as and when they like and necessary. Can engage relief to take over them, can even go home sleep and bath or have sex<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I think you guys knows what a corporate world look like, most of you are from there and switch to taxi driving, should knows the differences.</p>
              <p>Cdg is a typical corporation, as usual, the top man needs to answer to shareholders, profitability is the key for him to stay on, and to make profit from their Taxis business, the only way is to squeeze the hirers, as simple as that, so if you are in arrears, they will definitely chase after you.</p>
              <p>Big gives them the economy of scale in operation, got many calls with big customer base, for individual going pte like JDI, it is therefore the risk factor, there are 2 types of risk takers, one is like JDI, confident (by his posts only) and able to apprehend the transport market of singapore well, knows the in and out of the trade, I call these people, a knowledgeable risk taker.</p>
              <p>Another type of risk takers are people who see people do and earn, they also want to go in without any knowledge of the risk and the market condition, good luck if they make it and sail along with good networking, but when they get OBKed, they do not even know what hit them and instead keep blaming something out of ordinary</p>
