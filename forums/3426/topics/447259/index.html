              <p>Hi all brothers here, hope somebody can help or give some advice to me...</p>
              <p>Juz passed my TDVL exam on the 6th Feb... now in the process of waiting LTA to issue me the TVL licence. At present, I have a 9~5 job but pay super miserable... Intend to quit &amp; go into Taxi trade.</p>
              <p>Made some enquires with a few Taxi companies and personally went down to CDG recruitment Centre this afternoon. Machiam a gong kia.. told by by the front-desk lady i need to produce her my TVL licence b4 registering with them. This is the rough details i gathered from a 2 companies:</p>
              <p>1) CDG Sonata - $102/mth; no contract; 3yrs and below; muz wait 2~3 mths</p>
              <p>2) PREMIER SilverCab - $101; 3 mths contract; 2nd-hand; gaurantee ~1mth</p>
              <p>CDG does not reimburse my STA course fee as I did not sign with them prior to the course. Unless i opt for a manual gear cab, then they willing to reimburse. Need to attend the MDT, basic Svc training &amp; auto-gear short lesson.</p>
              <p>PREMIER SilverCab every month has 2 types of incentives: (i)No accident +$50 (ii) GIRO deduction smoothly +$150. The -ve point is they may not have so much booking. He (Colin) said they use walkie-talkie.</p>
              <p>In between the 2, probably i will choose one. I prefer CDG partly becos with the MDT &amp; huge amt of customers' bookings, i think it shud be ok. Moreover, people on the street tend to take note of those CDG Blue/Yellow cab easily n identify them straight away. I m afraid while driving SilverCab, i may got miss out.</p>
              <p>I may have to settle for SIlverCab as the waiting time is much shorter. Would appreciate bros here may give some advice n pointers to me. Thank u very much...</p>

              <p>I havent started driving Taxi yet still waiting for call from CDG (signed up in Nov 11 for 4 plus year old Taxi still waiting for call ) you can do 2 things to make your life easier</p>
              <p>1. Invest in GPS , eastgear has a promotion of Houlux 62F for S$199 with live traffic i bought one very nice for cabby.</p>
              <p>2. invest in smart phone like iphone or any android phone, get those data plan ( 12 gb one i think) from starhub.singtel or m1 , download "singapore map" by street directory (look for street directory on iphone/android market) this one gives you route also address of the location/business</p>
              <p>3. learn to use them as a tool make your life easy, taxi compnay doesnt matter what matters how you are willing to ply your trade work hard&amp; smart will make transion to this trade</p>
              <p>this is just advice from a newbie to another newbie , good to share knowledge seniors can correct me where i am wrong</p>

              <p>WTF, just jump in la. die die lor. Bt Panjang kanna go Jurong East. By right should know the way, but suddenly come, everything also "gabra"</p>
              <p>lucky pax was kind enough to guide me, give my virgin trip to him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MDT easily? kanna current call, was staring at the fucking MDT for so long, wondering where the hell this place is and by the time I realised, 15 secs gone and out came a "You have rejected one job".</p>
              <p>Later on, decide to whatever come in, just press "5 mins" first and slowly take my time to use road directory to find it. Upon reaching the pax, another problem arise, "where is that place he want to go?"</p>
              <p>So with road sweeping, u only got 1 problem, with calls, u got 2, locating the pax and then his destination.</p>

              <p>but i always say ... $2.30 ...not tempting to me</p>
              <p>say u take 10 mins to reach the pick up point... u asked urself.... 10 mins of your time worth $2.30 ???</p>
              <p>can u use the 10 mins to earn more than $2.30 by sweeping ?</p>

              <p>No offense but reading some posts in this thread, it's no surprise taxi companies like CDG can more or less do as they please, be it how they treat drivers who may owe them rental or made some mistakes, or how they can send COE prices rocketting with newer vehicles, set new fares etc.</p>
              <p>Whatever you think or consider them, there's no doubt they are still tops in marketting themselves and creating a positive image to the public and unsuspecting new drivers.</p>
              <p>I'm saying everything they do is wrong or has an ulterior motive, they definitely have some plus points. But as long as they can continue to lure newbies to into hirers, they are in a Comfort zone.</p>
              <p>I'm saying that all newbies should be hirers, but like in any job, you'd normally expect to start slow or from an easier learning point and gain knowledge along the way. You won't expect joining a new firm to be put directly incharge of running the show when you've got no prior experience.</p>
              <p>Anyway that's my view, and to each his own I suppose.</p>

              <p>Let me part answer some things you suggest, maybe if got time next time, I explain my view.</p>
              <p>You go for their training? Is it free?</p>
              <p>Their current and advance booking, their NETs and credit card, is it an FOC service? Do they earn just a pittance from it? CDG has at least 50k calls a day, usually more. They used to earn 40cts and 50cts from current, now 30 and 40cts. To make up the shortfall, they've now made advance levy up to $1 from 50cts. Just taking the 30cts as the standard, that's $15k a day, or 180k alone a month before overheads. Even with NETs and card, they definitely will get a cut.</p>
              <p>Will touch on the rest later.</p>
