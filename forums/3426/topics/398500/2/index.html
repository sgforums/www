              <p>yeah agree with Poolman. Prime indeed will impose the surcharge From Mon - Sat  Except Sun from 6 am to Midnight.</p>
              <p>Sian why dun include Sunday and PH and  the timing is not 24hrs ?  Tds working on this day will try to avoid to go to MBS if they can .</p>

              <p>Scholars can say whatever they want. It means nothing. They are experts at pointing fingers and proclaiming their high morals, but have this habit of quietly following and taking advantage of every profitable situation they see.</p>
              <p>We like to talk loud loud. The scholars quietly do it under the table, somemore in a private room. Then they come out of the room and say "Oei, cannot do this, its very bad." Later choot pattern, say must increase rental and shit. Take away our hard earned money.</p>

              <p><em>The head of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, said a surcharge should not be imposed if a handful of taxis were colluding not to go to MBS.<br>'There are over 20,000 taxis in Singapore; it can't be that all of them will want to do that,' he said. 'There should be enough taxis which will go where there is business. After all, there are still complaints from taxi drivers that it is difficult to make money nowadays.'</em></p>

              <p>I have read his statement many times and still believe he is on the taxi side. Unlike straight talking people like us, these government people cannot anyhow talk. They frequently like to say things in a roundabout fashion. Sometimes it results in misunderstandings because our english is not to their standard. Basically I believe the ST reporter was asking him whether he thinks all the taxi drivers are boycotting the MBS becoz there is no $3 surcharge, and he instead asked how can all 20,000 taxi drivers "collude" and put up a unifying no show. He is answering in a roundabout fashion. It is like giving an answer without saying the answer directly. Its very common when you are dealing with these kind of people.</p>
              <p>If the government did not like the $3 surcharge, it will not be implemented and somemore so soon. That is why I say they are on our side.</p>

              <p><br>When it concerns a surcharge of any kind, the standard response will be NO. Of course we want it to go up, but can you imagine the consumers begging taxi companies to increase the surcharge? No way right? CASE tell them to vote with their wallets, ok lor, dont take taxi lor. Go buy a car lor, see who win lor.</p>
              <p>Once again, can you see CASE answering in an indirect fashion? They seem to be supporting the consumers, but this kind of answer from them also hints that they may be thinking along the line "No money dont take taxi lor. Nobody is forcing you." Just like what Comfort call center always like to tell us "Its ok if you dont take calls without destination, many others will take"</p>
              <p>Maybe the trishaw riders can go Q at MBS. Flat fare no surcharge of any kind. Cheapos who find the $3 surcharge expensive can take them.</p>
