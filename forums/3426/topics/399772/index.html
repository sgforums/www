              <p>My advice, join Comfort. Forget about SMRT.</p>
              <p>Comfort Azera is diesel, SMRT one is CNG+Petrol.</p>
              <p>Trust me, join only Comfort if u are new. Dun waste time with SMRT.</p>
              <p>Feel free to try SMRT at ur own peril.</p>

              <p><br>First SMRT is one of the 2 oldest Taxi Company in SIngapore. (they used to be known as TIBS)</p>
              <p>2nd they have Taxi Academy class</p>
              <p>3rd they advertise in newspaper</p>
              <p>4th whenever newspaper need news about TD, they interview CDG and SMRT first.</p>
              <p>so pple dunno think SMRT very good until they join ................ then they realise they no difference from small company. u will begin to realise why pay money to a big company when all their staffs and work system work like small company.</p>
              <p>I dun wan to go further about their services. It maybe my luck is bad and I keep meeting pple who drag their feet. On top of that they have good front counter service at Woodlands and that about it.</p>
              <p>So I ask myself at the end of the day why should I contribute my rent to a company that fair like this in the market?</p>

              company.</p>
              <p>SMRT claim TD is their partners and they took care of them. Look
              at the bloody mess they make in the market with the wadever group
              they support. They just lost the counter at Resort World and now
              Woodlands Transport has taken over. They lost Airport Limo counter
              and if I am not wrong, the SATs job etc all going to be gone (at
              June is it Poolman?).</p>
              <p>If they are good, why they lose all the counter within 6 months
              of operation. They are big company right? Should have a lot of
              manpower with brain juice right? So why such things happen? SMRT TD
              dun wan to support their counter (did they bother to ask why or
              they let the wadever group run the show until they dunno wad is
              happening on the ground.)</p>
              <p>At any one time, u see their airport counter at Terminal 2.
              bugger more than 3-6 pple in the counter all doing nothing. Most of
              the time sit around dunno do wad. Whenever I go there, wad I see
              them is talk talk talk.</p>
              <p>From being the 2nd largest taxi fleet they drop to 3rd rank. Who
              know one day Silvercab will over take them.</p>
              <p>I dun wan to go further about their services. It maybe my luck

              <p>I also forgot to mention. If wan cab they sure have cause their cabs all idle. Especially cabs like Azera.</p>
              <p>Comfort need to wait for a while. Newbie think they need establish company to assist them, so SMRT becomes an obvious choice.</p>
              <p>So my advice, go comfort or other company like transcab. Drive relief for a while then get a car.</p>

              <p>If just because of waiting time and u being so desprate due to
              reason such as jobless for a period of time and sign up with SMRT,
              then u will realise at the end of the day, u trap urself.</p>
              <p>Remember a saying "yaogui" (hungry ghost aka beggar) cannot
              choose. They put chicken there with a trap and let u step in. After
              biting then realise it is a skinny chicken.,,,,</p>
