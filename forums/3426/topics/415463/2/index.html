              <p> When I enter Suntec area all my calls come from Beach Road, Golden Mile, and as far as Mustafa. Ting 3 times and my MDT suspend liao. When I enter Havelock area all my calls come from Robertson Quay, G.H., and sometime give me Sentosa! Ting 3 times, MDT suspend again. No chance for calls inside CBD.</p>
              <p>Rumours outside say CityCabs gets more and better calls, complain to operators and they say "Comfort drivers say City gets more calls, City drivers say Comfort gets more calls....blah, blah, blah."</p>

              <p>OK this is my views on being a CDG LV member. From 02 , i have been a beach road member and Islandwide member all the way till 2007until recently i joined LV, so membership &amp; walkie fees to me was never an issue .</p>
              <p>The problem with CDG calls are the destinations , if u are a hardcore supporter of the IVT in CBD , u will always almost get a job to the north which to me is one way ticket , a ticket to hell and also, you can get an incredibly long job &amp; worse X2 X3 X4 stops. So far my record is tuas to pasir ris , loyang to cck and tuas to hougang , do you know how tiring it is?</p>
              <p>Yes you need skill and experience to catch LV calls but once you get into the groove , you can start rocking. if you dun even wanna try , how can you blame the system? everything is set there for you , town to town calls , cbd to cbd , its whether u wanna work on it or not.</p>
              <p>My first day at LV wasnt a pleasant one , others beat me to it why? coz i was too eager to press the walkie and call out an eta but slowly i learn how the game is played. I wont say im a good player , just a very average one who can survive on walkie.</p>
              <p>Yes , basically one can survive on CDG calls but u are at the mercy of the caller . Uncle sengkang , after that punggol , uncle amk then yishun . 3 years in CDG , i hear this almost every week, not sick? maybe not you but i am.</p>
              <p>And i also like to add for all new birds who wanna join LV , please build up your reputation as  (1) one who gives accurate ETA (2) one who is not taiko (3) one who beats all the other opponents flat. otherwise life is going to be very tough for u.</p>
              <p>One member here joined and without consulting 05 on how to go about things &amp; made a mess out of the jobs. Now his reputation is in the drain , everytime he call out an eta , there will be challengers why? coz people know his ETA beh zhun , confirm can fight.</p>
              <p>Walkie calls can be very fun and exciting but it all depends on how u see it . If u want bao jiak , bao xi kia , everything 100% bao, then dont join.</p>

              <p>Brother Poolman, I have some queries on LV too. 1) Can I share my id no. with my hirer. (i.e. Can he use it as well in the day shift, if I allow him to?) 2) Also, do we have alot of very good lobangs where we can take part in like SATS(e.g. on days when I can work right up to 4+am) (in Nov &amp; Dec-I can), without having to fight for it like taking calls, 3)What is $5/- plus meter, does it include the CBD $3/- surcharge?, 4) Would I be able to get a 2nd hand walkie-talkie for about $80/-?,&amp; lastly 5) Will a newbie like me have a chance to take a good inter-city calls with so many good and experienced drivers like many in this forum here!(i.e. Are there so many inter-CBD calls compared bwith Comfort for e.g.??)</p>

              <p><br>Answer : U can share an id with anyone , no limit to any taxis . As long as this id user pay the member fee .</p>
              <p>Answer : Being a Lake View member , u are entitle to take up SATS jobs , in or out of staffs . If u want to . .</p>
              <p>In short  : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$5 plus meter , meaning booking fee $5 , instead of $3.50 and $2.50 respectively . Lake View did not ask for it , regular customers of Lake View knew it , it's a traditonal method for fast cabs .</span></p>
              <p>$5 plus meter , if in cbd , u can charge CBD $3 , holiday surcharge also applicable , peak hour surcharge also applicable</p>
              <p>U can have my personal walkie for $80 if u want , with charger and battery .</p>
              <p>Motorola i205 , most popular walkie for juniors .</p>
              <p>We have abundance of inter city calls , not plenty , it's abundance , what we lacking are capable drivers sometimes to fit into the demand . Lake View are a hot property in town right now .</p>
              <p>In some circumstances , we the management , had decided to set up a Q-ing system for some sensitive call locations .</p>
              <p>But the lads at Lake View , are like a football team , selfish ones are out , now we all work hand in hand together , u faster , u go , i wait , cos sure have .</p>
              <p>U go u go ......</p>
              <p>If u dun believe , ask Twenty 98 .</p>
              <p>He is the lastest recruit now .</p>
              <p>He joined Lake View , telling my boss , has been following me since 2 years ago , and his friend also a member , brought him in .</p>

              <p>I kenna scheme B 4-5 times a night. But I still get my 3-6 CBD bookings.</p>
              <p>CDG gives u bookings from out of town to somewhere near town. LV dont have this because they specialize only in town jobs. For those super hot CBD &gt; CBD town jobs, you need to wait nearby and ambush the calls or queue up. Based on experience, u dont end up earning significantly more than playing CDG calls. Why? Because it is all about anticipation, and fast fingers. U hear the LV annoucement, quickly press PTT before the auntie even finish talking. If u can do this every night n got patience to ambush the pax, then u earn more with LV. Otherwise CDG is much better option. Relax relax see a nice booking, just click 3 or 5 minutes, and the job is yours. No need to drive like a mad man to the destination. For those hot CBD jobs in LV, if you cannot make it in 0.5 minutes, u lost the deal. Think about it, fucking half a minute to reach destination. Basically if u are not there waiting for the pax to call, u lost the job. And to earn this $5 + $3 + meter, u need to wait there for 10-15 minutes. So in the end is LPPL right? How many people can do this consistently every night? You need to be fucking good at anticipating calls in LV to extract the max value from your membership and walkie. So if u are not experienced or lack the determination n patience to earn that extra few dollars, then just go with CDG.</p>
              <p>Nice CBD calls will come from comfort, just wait abit, reject those rubbish calls from Far East, Shaw Centre, Mustafa and Race Course Road. Long term wise, it is less stressful, u get to earn the same big $$$ consistently every night, no need to fight with those LV ambush parties, and save on your walkie and LV subscription. Remember u must take at least 1 nice call from LV every night to cover your membership. With CDG, its already in your rental. So go figure.</p>

              <p>So far CDG calls, under 5 minutes for CBD calls is no problem one. LV under 3 minutes is good thing? Think about it, if the pax want fast, they belong to those 'no show' types. These kind of pax will grab the first empty taxi they see. Does not matter if from LV. They want fast mah. So book 2 cabs, see who come first. Take the first empty cab that comes. As a taxi driver, is this the kind of bookings u want? If the pax cannot even be bothered to wait 3-5 minutes, then these bookings are considered very hard to take. For those less than 3 minutes kind of calls, the only way is to ambush the caller. This sort of routine is meant for a very special breed of cab drivers. If u feel shiok about this kind of competition, then LV is the right place.</p>

              <p>What you say is very accurate. Choice of taxi companies is personal. It makes some difference, but not too much. CDG got many calls, but sometimes u want a call and the MDT is silent. Main thing after factoring in your skill n luck is making good money and not feeling completely drained of energy from all the driving. I think transcab is a good company, but hey its also about luck. I do not have the luck to find a transcab hirer around my place. So I go with whatever taxi company the hirers around my place offer.</p>

              <p>Yes 5.20, 3.50 call, they take 0.50. 2.50 call they take 0.40.
              Its still better than no bookings. CDG gives me many calls, like on
              sundays. How to survive on just 3.00 flag down? So on Sunday and
              public holidays, I need many calls, wherever the passenger
              sends me. Weekdays they gave me CBD calls. 3-6 current bookings
              inside CBD or about $3 levy. If I take LV, its an additional
              overhead. I need to cover the extra $2 daily or $1 if
              walkie shared with hirer. But so far all my hirers dont use
              walkies. If they got lobangs, it all goes straight to their
              handphone.</p>
              <p>Becoming a LV member only makes sense if the taxi company
              got no or very few calls.</p>
              <p>Unless LV can provide a flood of calls between
              midnight to 6am, there is no point becoming a member if you are
              driving for CDG.</p>
