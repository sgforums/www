              <p>And i also like to add that those really raw new birds should fine tune their commercial building and hotel knowledge in town first before taking the next step up to join LV. otherwise , life is going to be very tough.</p>
              <p>If you do not know the place and you have to fight for call , how are you going to arrive at the pick up pt? by the time u ask for help , too late already.</p>
              <p>so get your map out , look at commercial bldgs in shenton way , orchard , hotels around the town area.</p>
              <p>do some homework. this one noone can help.</p>

              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">hi Bro ALN, sorry, paisa, the figure i gv is just base on my own estimation, i never know how many taxi the  taxi coy have,  i even dun bother to find out, cos i join the coy, not base on how many taxi the coy hv, what i want to point out here, is to our new bro &amp; sis tds to compare between what a typical taxi coy with so many taxi and a small small radio call station without taxi can do but some of the thing that typical taxi coy cannot do, let them go and decide whether the money they pay is worth or not. example A, i at tuas6.30pm take pax going town, control broadcast , advance booking 7.30pm town to airport, is true i need to bid for the job(MDT must bid also)., but who know i may end up getting the job and continues my job after the present one but typical taxi coy MDT, they only give u the advance job where at that time yr location u are, they wont give u a job of point B when u are at point A. Example B,  control broadcast at 6.25pm, advance booking at 6.30 hotel xxx to hotel xxx, just five min also consider advance booking not current booking, but typical taxi coy, their advance must be at least 30min be4 time.example 3, at midnite , take one pax, dun know the location,while driving, member sos, where is here blar blar, straight away, got reply from member, is there blar blar, imagine if u are driving alone at night and  friend all sleeping liao, no one to ask, call operator, wait for them to pick up the call, by the time may even end up at jb oledi, GPS, hv to stop and di di di, then follow the gps and pax well think that u r very unprofessional, dun know the location.radio group , member sos, 100 over member can help u immediately .</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">LV dun kapo from anyone, all join on own account, cos they know maybe the little bit of money they pay is worth for it. like we say "ç‰›ä¸�å–�æ°´ï¼Œä½ æ€Žéº½æ ·éƒ½æ²¡åŠžæ³•é€¼å®ƒä½Žå¤´“ã€‚</p>

              <p>Poolman is out of date coz he dont drive for comfort. Its been a long time since I kenna Woodlands and Yishun calls from CBD. You get those destinations from CBD street flag downs.</p>
              <p>I know some taxi drivers can do 10 calls every night. 20 also can. If I drive their taxi, its possible too. Not possible with mine. Its a standard comfort taxi.</p>

              <p>Poolman is wrong again. To earn my $36, my mileage is similar to your 20 km. But only during weekdays with all those surcharges. If you can hit that amount on Sunday and public holiday, then I need to brush up liao.</p>
              <p>I have not been to Woodlands, Yishun, Marsiling, CCK, Bukit Batok and Tuas for a while. Mostly East Coast, River Valley, Holland, Bishan, Sentosa Cove, Telok Blangah, CBD, Bukit Merah, Tiong Bahru.</p>
              <p>I did it without using any radios. So my cost is lower than Poolman. Just a standard comfort taxi. No tricks used. 3-6 calls every night. I call it a day at 12.30am. Pump full tank and sleep. Mileage is always &lt; 290km.</p>
              <p>Yes I sometimes kenna tai-ko places before. MBS &gt; Sungei Kadut &gt; MBS during peak hour. No problem what. 2 hrs work for $82 taxi fare fetching keleng workers and their boss. To tai-ko place and back to CBD. Its wonderful business. Or today, I kenna Hitachi Tower &gt; Owen Road &gt; Hitachi Tower. No problem what. Very good trips as far as I know.</p>

              <p>TCL , u saw that ? F1 never go woodlands from his MDT , i think something is very wrong between comfort &amp; citycab .</p>
              <p>Maybe his MDT super duper .</p>
              <p>Everyone at Lake View scared of MDT , saw that ? He doesn't have lousy calls , 4x places what Tan said to you ? First 3 calls all go Punggol , in a single night . Maybe rubbish from Ah Tan ?</p>
              <p>So maybe TCL should switch to Citycab ...... all rotten trips all went to Citycab , maybe , hahahaha</p>
              <p>I think lion should drink coffee and learn a few tricks from this f1 .</p>

              <p>Everyone at Lake View scared of MDT , saw that ? He doesn't have lousy calls , 4x places what Tan said to you ? First 3 calls all go Punggol , in a single night . Maybe rubbish from Ah Tan ?</p>

              <p>Seriously, between Woodlands, Yishun and Punggol -</p>
              <p>Punggol / Sengkang is not too bad. From Collyer Quay &gt; Puggol / Sengkang &gt; drop pax n fly back to CBD can be done within 30 mins. For $6.50 plus meter, I am ok with that. The diesel does not cost much. Woodlands and Yishun are a different story because 1 hr is required, but I have never gotten this destination from CBD calls. Punggol / Sengkang / Elias Rd yes. I only need 30 mins to return to CBD from punggol / sengkang. Elias rd slightly longer at 45 mins.</p>
              <p>Your LV calls may be more steam, but I considered the effort needed to grab those calls every night and still find the CDG MDT made it alot easier. I just want to hit that $xxx amount asap and close shop. But if 90% of LV calls are $5 plus CBD plus meter, and you get flooded with those calls between 8-11pm from Mon-Sat, then let me know. This is a significant advantage over CDG MDT liao.</p>

              <p>ok la mai argue liao.</p>
              <p>i sum up for all those who wanna join la.</p>
              <p>LV Pros -  70% Super solid calls (city within city jobs), 70% of jobs with desinations, $5 + metre jobs ( not often but have ), advance jobs in 15 mins time , option to do SATS , MBS staff pick up, real time traffic , airport pick N go info.</p>
              <p>LV cons - Super solid calls must fight call , who is fastest gets it . Fight call need to be fast , slow drivers can forget about it.. No competitors then job will be confirmed to you. Must put up with some tai ko members , must put up with some members who like to talk cock &amp; sing song. must put up with some barbaric members .</p>
              <p>CDG pros - confirm job , yours mean yours , no fight call, where also got call. Very little if not no traffic &amp; airport info.</p>
              <p>CDG cons - 70% lan jiao calls, no $5 + metre jobs. Hardly got any swee advance job coz all taken up by the pets of call centre. No need to put up with anyone , U work N drive alone.</p>
              <p>I am not a LV recruiter nor am i a CDG hard core supporter now, this is the fairest assessment i can give.</p>
