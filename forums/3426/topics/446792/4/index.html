              <p>BCL u be mod. You got just the right mix of sensibility. Just be aware that some ppl can test certain ideas by seeing the moderators response. Thread locks, thread deletion tells a mountain of stories. What is NOT said is sometimes louder that things that are said.</p>
              <p>Forums became popular because of the content. If too much gets revealed, some will not like it. If there is nothing much revealed, people may just leave because of boredom. Striking the balance is impossible. But if u can help it, sometimes it is good to 'zhao keng' for a while, then cover it up.</p>

              <p>If Moderator can delete post(s), edit threads then, then count me in (if I am elected <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">)... if simplying <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>for show ONLY</strong></span> with a Moderator status but your hands are tired down.... then what is a point of having a Moderator title ?</p>
              <p>I, personally, in cyberspace, have been a <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">channel owner</span></strong> in galaxynet before, a long way back to 1997. (Bro BCL can vertify that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, I knew him from there anyway...)  Hence,  Moderator is just like an Ops.... If an Ops is just a 50-100 access points, then what is the use ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>I'm not suggesting that I should be given more access points (if elected<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">).  But by the meaning of being a channel moderator meant that you are <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">sharing some of the responsibilities</span></strong> of the owner, ie, Mr Poolman. <span style="color: #008000;"> <strong>It is a charity job.... no revenues, no benefits... only work... </strong></span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Moderator for a taxi forum should ideally be a taxi driver.</p>

              <p>Must also be commited to spend 1/2 an hour a day to view the forum</p>
              <p>Moderator cannot be someone who always say "throw key"</p>
              <p>Moderator cannot always come in and say "ai ni kwang kong hor tia meh ...member" :)</p>
              <p>Based on what I have seen , my vote goes to BCL, JDI and Bowah.</p>
              <p>Their postings has always been impartial.</p>
              <p>And lastly, moderator has to be unprejudiced aka cannot be anti-cumfcuk</p>

              <p>Yes Mr JoeRaj....</p>
              <p>As what I have stated all along... I'm not a TD now.... every souls here knows I've turned Pte Limo recently (Sep 2011).  Initially, when I started foruming in SgForums, I was still a TD then, back in May 2010.</p>
              <p>I'm here to share with fellow forumers with some of my hands-on experiences, what they probably need to do (when accident occurs, when looking out for a potential hirer, when any related TD or Limo matters arised from this forum).  As you can see, I'm seldom a thread starter.... which means I'm here to contibute and give my opinions if needed to any TDs or whoever that need a quick opinion.</p>
              <p>Somebody did asked me why I am sharing so much about my experiences to the forumers here.  Well, I'm not a person that hides secret, if my post(s) can assist somebody who requires opinions and within my knowledge, I will share, but will not comment on sensitive issues (like it happened last night).</p>
              <p>I feels happy when fellow forumers comes in and said... JDIL, you done a great job posting quality replies and with funny pictures (it enlighten the stressful mood after all day on the road).  I felt good too and assisting them to destress with some funny replies.  </p>
              <p>Being a Channel Moderator here, have never crossed my mind.  I'm a frequent contributor of posts and I'm happy that my efforts (with funny pictures) have been recognised but I am definitely not seeking for any recognition to be promoted to the next level, sharing with the responsbilities with Mr Poolman.</p>
              <p>Hence, please do not act as though you are the rightful Channel owner dedicating me to the post, this year or next year.... or next next year or never...... </p>
              <p>How will you feel when a newbie (with 145posts) comes in and give such remarks on somebody who have contributed 6,755 posts, majority to this Channel, prior to this post?</p>
              <p>You are duly respected for your years in this industry and have been in the Pte Limo sector for many years.  And I never expected that you could make such sentence on me with such a great respect on you.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I couldn't bothered much becos, there are definitely forumers who likes or dislike me which is perfectly fine.  As it is only a cyberspace interaction, I can live with it w/o disturbing my sleep 2night. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It was never my intention to insist or demand that you or anyone become a mod. I just felt simply with the votes reflecting the main support for 3 persons, I just hope that the one who doesn't get it, will still have a chance later on, because all 3 are among the best contributors here.</p>
              <p>Of course I failed to take into consideration that any 1 or all of them could reject the post, but I do hope that they would agree if asked.</p>
              <p>I have been here just a few months, but it's clear to me that the information that all 3 of you share is invaluable and a great plus for this forum.</p>
              <p>To have any 1 of you play a bigger role, is definitely a plus not a minus. But of course this involves time, and all 3 of you also have other responsibilities, so as much as any of you may want to, it might not be feasible based on your schedules.</p>
              <p>I hope this clears the air.</p>
