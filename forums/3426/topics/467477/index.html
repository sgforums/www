              <p>I had called for a taxi with NTUC Comfort and received a confirmed SMS that a taxi will arrive within 3 to 5 minutes. </p>
              <p>I had waited for more than 8 minutes but the taxi did not turn up and I decided to flag for a taxi along the main road.</p>
              <p>Should I call up the operator not to complain but to inform the operator that the taxi did not turn up to cancel the booking ?</p>

              <p>So in a restuarant waiting for food to arrive  or Q at macdonald for more than 10 minutes, did you complain</p>
              <p>So at govt aqencies like LTA, ICA,  IRA, town council and so on take a number and said about 15 minutes but 20minutes later still not your turn, you want to complain?</p>
              <p>So if you plane deleted by 20 minutes, you want to complain??</p>

              to some memeber wanted to comment on TS
              
              please note he was there waiting already,  it was the confirm taxi still have not shown up
              
              as mentioned 3-5min
              
              So TS decided to take a taxi that come along, not fault of him
              
              The taxi driver who was late should have call him if he is going to reach later then
              
              the est state timing to let pax knon he is on the way
              
              if not it is also no fair to TS to wait without knowing if the taxi is on the way to pick him
              
              or otherwise
              
              to any taxi driver, if you are going to be late for your booking, prepare to take risk
              
              your pax will board any other taxi
              
              vice verus, pax should be there waiting once you call for a taxi, cause we taxi driver
              
              does not like to be kept waiting while pax take their own sweet time to come and also 
              
              be prepare to lose your taxi if you are late

              <p><br>Then just take lor, why need to post here and there just because of it, it only create anguish in most TD who like it or not, get no shows here and there that had become a norm in our trade, day in and day out.</p>
              <p>And nobody like a no show, be it late by a few minutes or not, that can be sudden twist of events on the road, for me,</p>
              <p>if I am late due to jam or road work or looking for U turn, I will call the pax, and the option is for him to wait for me or call another cab, that will settle the issue.</p>
              <p>Of course the minutes we pressed is our preferences, if we are late, we takes the consequences, but is certainly not nice to see one cab coming out with pax you know is the caller.</p>
