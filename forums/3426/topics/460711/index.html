Then I saw him holding a smart phone. My mind is telling me he must be the prankster cos he did not cancel my job so when I tell him pax cancel the job he look suprise and he go check my number plate so see whether is the cab he book.</p>

Then I on his phone and the CDG apps still running and I go in saw my taxi number and the call is still on and not cancel.....HOR SEH LIAO....I fuck the CB upside down grab him throw him inside my cab then on the child lock. After that I start meter telling him I am going to send him to the mata chu....Wah that CB start to tolong tolong uncle me until he like want to cry like that.</p>
              <p>So I ask him where he want to go...he says Yishun...ok lah can send me home....So I $#*%@#&amp;% him all the way from ECP to Yishun.....reach there $17.75 he give me $20....So I ask him how? Still need to change or not?

              <p>Pls la some of you make this into a major criminal case.</p>
              <p>This is not kidnapping for ransom which attracts the death penalty, not even abduction which carries jail and caning.</p>
              <p>At the most this is wrongful restraint but that too must have certain elements, and I don't think this incident meets the necesarry ingredients for that charge to stand.</p>
              <p>Definitely not theft of handphone either.</p>
              <p>But yes maybe an offence under LTA rules and regulations, so hammer you gotta learn to be satisfied with fucking a person verbally rather than resort to such acts. Remember 2 wrongs never make a right.</p>
              <p>Prank calls to taxi companies are not a criminal offence, the police will not launch an investigation into such things, they might mediate if you call them down, but no real action on their part as this is a civil matter.</p>

              <p>Prank calling is an offence. Police take a serious view on this.
              That kid might have grown up making prank calls to police. Now he
              is using his skills to call taxis without paying call charges.</p>

              <p><br>It is not so much of an attraction to calls volume, it is more on the psychological effect of a TD. When we start our engine, we like to start busy, and all this talkies, calls, many street paxs tends to make us strive on, it gives a sense of belonging as a Taxis driver. It is like, I am doing a real job men, with calls, talkies calls, blue tooth, paxs here and there, it give you a feeling of you are the man and the boss.</p>
              <p>And that is also why people like hammer like to hear the ting ting ting..sound, it give him the feeling that he is wanted and needed. To take the calls or not is another issue.</p>
              <p>And everyone of us got our bad days, no paxs on the street, no calls, no talkies ping ping piang piang, AP and everywhere long Q, see the MDT also fed up, see the taking lagi fedup, so end up lan sai lah, go home sleep better.</p>
