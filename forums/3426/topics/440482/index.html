              <p>The word TAXI come from it plural form of Taxes, it is a french word, and it represent taxation, meaning a costier mode of transport, and because it is costier, the service will be better and more privacy. The pax who paid extra to board the taxi have the right to ask you to lower or upper the aircon, turn left, turn right, sit in front or rear seat whichever availiable and to their liking, they can also ask you to off the cam facing them, because it valid their privacy which they paid for, other than your own radio, which they can also ask you to lower down the volume if they feel dizzy or need a rest, and as a service provider, you oblige to reasonable request make by them, afterall, they are paying.</p>

              My honest opinion, I find it amazing that taxi drivers ourselves are denying our own rights to protect us.  So, do we continue to allow taxi drivers to be robbed and killed even though it only happens once in five years for now. How many more taxi drivers must die before things will change.  It is only logical and right that CCTV should be installed in every taxi.  Why? For the obvious reason of being robbed, customers refusing to pay. As a taxi driver myself, I can just walk into any taxi and at the end of the trip not pay a single cent for the ride. What you going to do, beat me up? What happens after that? The victim becomes the violator of the law for assault.  Right now, our society is still humane and sane.  But come on, let's not kid ourselves, how long can this last, the amount of people going to casino and losing their pants, we all know that going to the casino to pick up customers is becoming a ritual for TD who drives at night.  Don't you all think we should start a petition or start to do something together to protect ourselves?
