              <p>Tips for driving thru floods, what i learn in the army anyways,</p>
              <p>Firstly if water level is above battery, fuse box and air box, don't even think of attempting going thru.</p>
              <p>If got other route to avoid, then don't be a hero and try go thru..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Drive thru only when u know how deep the water is. Can do this by looking at the lampost or anything that is fixed which u can take as a height reference.</span><br><br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Drive slowly and steadily, driving too fast might cause water to splash into engine compartment, going into fuse box, cutiing all electricals. Or worse get into airbox and get into engine. (Expensive to rectify) the air intake on many cars is low at the front of the engine bay and it only takes a small quantity of water sucked into the engine to cause serious damage. All engines are affected, but turbocharged petrol and diesel engines are most vulnerable. Also driving too fast will cause your tyres to aquaplane, making you lose steering controls.</span><br><br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">As you drive slowly through standing water, keep the engine revving by slipping the clutch, otherwise water in the exhaust could stall the engine. If u drive automatic gear car, switch to "Sports" mode, shift down to lower gear and don't shift gear, just rev at that gear all the way thru. For Wish can "drag" on "Sports/Manual" mode, but on some cars no matter what gear u put into still will shift up if rev too high, from wht i try before Hyundai does that, so don't know if Sonata the same.</span><br><br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If engine die in heavy rain, don't open your bonnet while waiting for tow truck. Rain will soak the electricals making it difficult or impossible to start.</span></p>
              <p>Don't drive through fast-moving water, your car could easily be swept away.<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>After driving thru the flood, test your brakes, pump it a few times to get water out, especially true for cars with rear drum brake like Wish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the time i see people panic and stop their car in the middle of the flood, most panic because they drive thru too fast and the water splash over windscreen, look scarry. Another thing makes them panic and stop is when water start leaking from side of door.</p>
              <p>Once u stop and engine idle, the chances of water getting in from exhaust is higher.</p>
              <p>Last time what i did for manual, was downshift to 1st or 2nd gear, rev all the way but not until red line lah, keeping left foot on break to control speed while still maintaining rev</p>

              <p>If got other route to avoid, then don't be a hero and try go
              thru..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Drive thru only when u know
              how deep the water is. Can do this by looking at the lampost or
              anything that is fixed which u can take as a height
              reference.</span><br> <br> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Drive slowly and steadily,
              driving too fast might cause water to splash into engine
              compartment, going into fuse box, cutiing all electricals. Or worse
              get into airbox and get into engine. (Expensive to rectify) the air
              intake on many cars is low at the front of the engine bay and it
              only takes a small quantity of water sucked into the engine to
              cause serious damage. All engines are affected, but turbocharged
              petrol and diesel engines are most vulnerable. Also driving too
              fast will cause your tyres to aquaplane, making you lose steering
              controls.</span><br> <br> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">As you drive slowly through
              standing water, keep the engine revving by slipping the clutch,
              otherwise water in the exhaust could stall the engine. If u drive
              automatic gear car, switch to "Sports" mode, shift down to lower
              gear and don't shift gear, just rev at that gear all the way thru.
              For Wish can "drag" on "Sports/Manual" mode, but on some cars no
              matter what gear u put into still will shift up if rev too high,
              from wht i try before Hyundai does that, so don't know if Sonata
              the same.</span><br> <br> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">If engine die in heavy rain,
              don't open your bonnet while waiting for tow truck. Rain will soak
              the electricals making it difficult or impossible to
              start.</span></p>
              <p>Don't drive through fast-moving water, your car could easily be
              swept away.<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>After driving thru the flood, test your brakes, pump it a few
              times to get water out, especially true for cars with rear drum
              brake like Wish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the time i see people panic and stop their car in the
              middle of the flood, most panic because they drive thru too fast
              and the water splash over windscreen, look scarry. Another thing
              makes them panic and stop is when water start leaking from side of
              door.</p>
              <p>Once u stop and engine idle, the chances of water getting in
              from exhaust is higher.</p>
              <p>Last time what i did for manual, was downshift to 1st or 2nd
              gear, rev all the way but not until red line lah, keeping left foot
              on break to control speed while still maintaining rev</p>

              <p>Got simple one:</p>
              <p>See flood, don't be hero. If your car stuck in the flood, the company will squeeze you to death to pay for the damages. Also think of your income opportunity loss if car in workshop.</p>
              <p>Just wait for water to recede and if see many heroes pass the flood then you proceed. Best if meter running, but in Singapore it actually very fast lah.</p>
              <p>Got once I was stuck in flood before hand over. Panick and quickly call hirer. Old hirer uncle just told me the above and he said handover to him also he want to sit at kopi tiam.Nbz :)</p>
