              <p>From iTODAY:Stage set for Euro 2012 battle</p>
              <p>Ian De Cotta | 31 May, 2012 6:00 AM</p>
              <p>F&amp;B chains to stay open later in fight for fans' money</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE- Football fans across the globe are counting down to the start of Euro 2012, which kicks off on June 8 in Warsaw with the match between Poland and Russia.</p>
              <p>Co-hosted by Poland and the Ukraine, the 16-team tournament ranks second to the FIFA World Cup in terms of popularity and will feature some of the game's biggest names squaring up in compelling matches.</p>
              <p>An equally fierce battle is shaping up between some of the biggest food and beverage (F&amp;B) chains in Singapore hoping to rake in the dollars.</p>
              <p>The big boys have thrown down the gauntlet - paying up to S$50,000 to StarHub, which holds exclusive broadcast rights in Singapore - to pull in the crowds for the three-week tournament that ends on July 1.</p>
              <p>Backed with promotions from the two biggest beer companies here - Tiger Beer and official Euro 2012 sponsor Carlsberg, who are also running a contest to send a fan to the June 28 semi-final match in Warsaw - most outlets will stay open until 6am every matchday.</p>
              <p>St James Power Station is pulling out all the stops, installing a S$100,000 gigantic LED television at their beer garden, while Harry's Bar will have an equally large projector screen at CHIJMES.</p>
              <p>Even Hard Rock Cafe has entered the fray and unlike previous big football tournaments, it will for the first time show all matches until the July 1 final in Kiev.</p>
              <p>"We don't usually stay open late, but the demand from our patrons has been really great and we are planning big to make this a month-long party," said Natalie Wee, Hard Rock's marketing manager.</p>
              <p>For fans who have not taken up StarHub's Euro 2012 package, priced between S$58.85 before April 30 and subsequently S$69.55 - or $10.70 more for those from SingTel's mio TV - they can get the action in the heartlands, with McDonald's showing selected matches at all its 24-hour outlets.</p>
              <p>Pasir Ris-Punggol Member of Parliament Teo Ser Luck also told TODAY he is planning public screenings for his constituency.</p>
              <p>"Euro 2012 will be closely followed by many Singaporeans. We hope to screen some of the matches at the community centre in my constituency," said Teo, the Minister of State for Trade and Industry, and North East District mayor.</p>
              <p>St James has forked out a total of S$50,000 to screen the matches at five outlets there and also at Clarke Quay's Shanghai Dolly and Marriott Hotel's Living Room, which they also own.</p>
              <p>"I think the pricing is reasonable because we usually attract about 5,000 people in total at our St James outlets for big matches and based on our previous experience, we are able to cover the cost," said Gordon Foo, the company's director of operations.</p>
              <p>Besides showing all matches at CHIJMES, Harry's Bar has scheduled selected games at their Riverside and Boat Quay operations, paying a total of S$21,000 to StarHub.</p>
              <p>Marketing manager Andrea Teo said: "Our focus is at CHIJMES because I don't think many people will come to town during the weekday as McDonald's will be having live screenings in the heartlands and it will be convenient for many fans."</p>
              <p>Not all F&amp;B establishments have bought into the Euro 2012 event.</p>
              <p>With the midnight and 2.45am starts to the matches, normally sports savvy microbrewery restaurant Brewerkz has decided to give it a miss.</p>
              <p>Said Brewerkz events coordinator Thomas Huan: "The matches start late and near our closing times. The timing does not give us much to plan for and we've decided to pass."</p>
