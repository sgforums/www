              <p>ya , I was once waved by the marshall to cut into the lane( no entry to taxi ) , but I refused because law is law and also it will  create misunderstanding among us.</p>
              <p>Also if  you  kena paz who want to go to budget terminal from airport queue, lan lan have to go also . Marshall will tell you you can come back again and not need to queue again , just put on hazard light and jump queue. How will those td know you are not jumping queue!!!</p>
              <p>And there are those td pretending to go toilet break in T2 , they will just drive thru the long queue and park by the left and right side near the cafe , go to toilet and straight filter out to join the queue again. Imagine they bypass the long long long queue... should you give way to them? NO no no!!!!</p>
              <p>Those who jump queue to join T1 queue by making U-turn hoping others will give way to them thereby  risking themselves of accident by forcing in. Should you give way? No no no no !!!!</p>
              <p>Any more tricks , please input.</p>
              <p>I hope more harsher fines to those td who jump queue to teach them a lesson or they will never learn.</p>
              <p>Hope all of us do our part  and we will never see fighting and bullying among us.</p>
              <p>How sad to see this situation among us.</p>

              i am gonna say 2 things.
              
              first, actually i think its good everyone see all the 'bad' things during good times. becos those naive, follow rules ones need to learn now. why? becos when bad times come, you will do the SAME THING to someone else (maybe even more hiong, more zhek ark!). it is not what if, it is just a matter of when you are gonna do it yourself when you too become hungry. some might say throw key throw key, but how about your family, your children? correct or not, those old birds?
              
              second,  those old birds will know there is actually only one rule in Taxi Driving. in chinese is called, Smart Ones Take to Eat. meaning, if you can manage to put it in your mouth and chew and swallow and fill your stomach without pain or problem, it means YOU WIN. right old birds?
              
              i secretly hope the infighting and bullying and taking advantage will become worse and worse, so the weak ones will get out, leaving the fewer strong ones to feast in 'comfort' muaahhhaa
              
              oh btw, exposing the steal eat ones, only prove you are not smart not able enough, cannot do anything, can only watch and despair...

              yes its not fair. yes its rude. yes its ugly.
              
              but yes his stomach is filled before those other 100 behind him. 
              so he must doing something right?
              
              one day, you might become like him (or worse), you might not think now, but one day the bad times will come back, then we can say.
              
              by then, what do you think if that same driver see you do this thing to others, but cannot stop you and can only go online and 'complain and discuss'? what do you think of him then? strong...or weak?

              there are very very few lines of work where someone can say, the End justifies the Means. Mata is one of them. whack the criminal becos order-keeping is their prerogative.
              
              TD is another. eat first eat fast becos filling that stomach is their prerogative.

              <p>Quening is part of a social ethnic, first come first serve, first in, first out, however this is not govern by any laws, not only taxi Q, if you jump Q at some sales and people complain about you, the police also cannot do much, cos there is no laws governing jumping Q, we got to get that into the picture, it is only a matter of principle, a social aspect that one expect the other to behave and be discipline enough to Q up. If you end up laying your hand on someone who jump Q infront of you, I can say, going to police station, you will be on the wrong side of laws.</p>
              <p>Everywhere you go, there will be some smart and unethical peoples wanting to jump Q, could be desparate for a seat in the cinema or shows or simply buying something cheap, no differences in TD, afterall, we are also human, be it hungry to pay rental or loans/debts or to satisfy one ego that he is the smartest, TD do jump Q once and then, you can hardly remove this bad habit, but we certainly must reduce it from happening.</p>
              <p>Psychologically speaking, once a TD managed to jump Q, he feels proud and full of pride, something that he can do it and the rest 100 stupid cabbies were fooled by him, and if someone warned him, he will be agitated, because he did something wrong.</p>
              <p>Man needs disciplinary rules and laws to be civilise and discipline, that is why we got laws and orders, i would said it all voice down to the marshalls at the AP, all those 4 terminals are their playground and responsibility, if they can wake up and do not get overly excited over a long AP passenger Q, control the flow as according to the system and way of taxis built and mend for, no problem. But if you allow TD to go in another way, you create loopholes for TD to exploit.</p>

              someone might talk ethics whole day long now.
              but when bad times come back, see who got bother talk ethics or not.
              
              Treat every roadside customer like a virgin. only the First Scorer counts. 
              Second prize onwards all get only a growling stomach.
              But even if Passenger in your backseat is still not the safest, that pax can still jump car. 
              So dont be yaya even if you score first. Maybe you scoring free kick you dont know yet.
              
              The only reason people queue is they worry the social penalty for not queuing is worse. 
              But if there is a BIGGER worry looming, like growling stomach, then no need to worry about that stupid penalty anymore.
              
              My suggestion is to learn all these desperation techniques during the good times. even practice them once a while to thicken your skin. becos even YOU will need to apply them like an experienced Master when bad times really hit. muaahhhhaaa

              <p>That situation is different. I used to see that same guy wave us to go in straight.</p>
              <p>I wonder if we report to the airport aux police guy that this particular person cut Q, will they impose a fine to him? I wonder....</p>
              <p>Airport shld redesign the dr way, or put a big sign saying: $500 fine in additional to that No-entry sign.</p>
              <p>I also hate this kind of TD. Once I saw a TD cut Q just before me, I slow down to let him pass me while I try to use my handphone to capture him with video, but unfortunately, my old phone cant works. Luckly this guys saw me and drove pass the pick up bay. knn..</p>
              <p>even if it is not me, Someday, somehow, someone will video your immoral &amp; unethical actions and send the file to LTA, U tube or Stomp.</p>

              <p>If says when the AP queue is merry-go-round fast when u go via the proper queue only takes you 5 mins then if the TD cut queue ok lah. Cos really it will expediate the boarding process and the paxs no need wait so long.</p>
              <p>But if says the queue is moving slowly and we are all waiting for 30 mins like that to pick up pax then I think it is not justifiable to cut queue loh.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>No way to argue if you are to queue at AP. If the queue us inside the so call taxi queue route, you still can challenge them. If you meet these TD who cut queue at a blind spot or at double yellow line or even in Toilet of T1 or T2 where queuing the others TD could not even see. How to fine them? Will you wait for the police? LTA to answer the offense you thing is wrong??? On other situation for example, do you complain the vehicle that cut your lane at highway or normal road to TP/LTA??? Nowadays so many this kind of SELFISH and HUNGRY road users on the road, I also pek chek, what to do? Blame who? I blame our greedy govt. That's why I try to queue only at taxi stand with box. Kana summon then you think worth to work so hard, let the ppl that ohkong you get good yearly bonus? I used to like to queue AP, Â now no way. Time is precious for us TDs.</div>

              <p>As said again, cutting Q is not an offence in the eyes of singapore laws, no lawyers, non police will want to take on a case on cutting Q, that is why ethic and graciousness come into play, if we do not have that, that everything will go chaotic.</p>
              <p>AP spend money to build Taxis Q lanes which they can build shopping or extend the terminal to earn more money, if they never really control it, that is their lost.</p>
              <p>The ironic of Taxi driving is that at the end of the month, huat or no huat, somehow, for me, still the same same, he who cut Q may get simei one, and the other gets Novetel, and we are all bros and sisters plying the same trade, you do not and cannot become a millionaires just by driving taxis, that is a fact, you huat today, you also sometime do not huat on the other days, at the end of the month the intake look the same, earn more, spend more, earn less, spend abit less. I see colleagues who drive day and nite to make few thousands per month but still want to borrow money, I see some drive a few hours, enough for the day, keep and go home play games or sleep, still manage to pass thru life happily. And I believes bros and sisters here also had seen this type of life.</p>
              <p>Being a poor man myself, if someone wanted to cut Q, so be it, what can I do, and how much can he earn from cutting Q, a millionaires or a hundred fares?Got a fren who cut Q, knock into a private car, argued with comfurt, refuse to admit wrong, comfurt take away his 1k and sacked him, and that passenger he took from cutting Q is just from Taka to orange groove. Worthy??</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is someone cut your queue in AP, things may happens this way. He get a trip to Tuas or you get a trip to Mariam Way. He just got the last passenger in that terminal or you have to wait 30mins to more than an hour to go Tampines Ave 7 or Simei Rise. Or worse case, it spoils your day of driving in that shift. Never also allow the front taxi in queue at any taxi stand if he reject a passenger to board his taxi  because of choosing destination. If you not shoik, challenge him and embarrass him, nobody will do you justic not even any TD behind you.</div>
