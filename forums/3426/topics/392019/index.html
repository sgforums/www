              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Where most taxi drivers would compound the offence and
              readily pay a fine, a limousine cabbie accused of over-charging his
              customer is instead claiming trial to his charges in the Subordinate
              Courts. </span></p>
              <p><span>Mr Lee Ngiap Han, 54, is charged by the Land Transport Authority
              (LTA) with obtaining a S$20 fare from a passenger last September, which
              would have otherwise cost S$9.40. <br> <br> But Mr Lee, a taxi driver for more than 10 years, is contesting the
              charge as he claimed to have entered into an agreement with the pick-up
              location on the price.
              <br> <br>MediaCorp understands that he may not be alone, as a number of
              drivers have also entered into an agreement with the hotel in Marine
              Parade. <br> <br> Such private agreements are not unheard of in the industry, but the
              Courts will now have to rule on whether such agreements are in
              contravention of the Road Traffic Rules, and an offence under the Road
              Traffic Act.
              <br> <br>Mr Lee, who drives a Comfort Mercedes, is said to have charged
              S$11.60 more during the trip from Marine Parade to Changi Airport. <br> <br> Besides the over-charging charge, Mr Lee also faces a charge of failing
              to set the meter in motion during the same trip on September 5.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee, defence lawyer Tan Hee Joek and the LTA attended a pre-trial conference on Thursday. 
              <br> <br> The trial is scheduled to be heard next Friday. If convicted, Mr Lee could be jailed up to three months or fined S$1,000. 
              <br> <br> If convicted on both charges, he could also risk losing his vocational licence.

              <p>Hum i think those that has spare cash to engaged a lawyer should do so as to test the system. Government agency is not always right. Think if can voice out ,voice out cas sometime scare of little thing , end up we always at the losing end. If the diver is telling the truth and has been play out by the pax , it is really unfair to him. Firstly , he is a limo driver , so charging limo per trip pick up price , pax already has been given a discount , but of course if agreement was not make b4 pick up , than it should be meter fair .</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">MediaCorp understands that he may not be alone, as a number of drivers have also entered into an agreement with the hotel in Marine Parade.So</span> looking at it , i think high chance the pax playing punk , need a cab but not happy with the fare , so just take , pay and complain later. So if this is the case , than who is safe guarding taxi driver. </p>
