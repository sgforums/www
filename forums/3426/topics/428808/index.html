              <p><br>Ya, especially when we have a hot day, kenna lousy paxs and location, at home get scolded by OC , quarrelled with frens, lost in soccer and suddenly this type of SOB keep honking you for nothing but his own stupidity. Knn, if got pipe, i go whack the bugger. But now old liao, temper more cool.</p>
              <p>I bet if his front is a private Merc or BM blocking, he dun even dare to honk, then see TD like very good to bully, knn. As I said, our bros will not come out and scold someone for nothing, you think so free ar? not leisure ride hor, need to cover rental, Gas and feed the family ok.</p>

              <p>To the left of the transcab wish in the photo is the entrance and exit to a new basement public carpark that connects to the MBS museum and eating place.</p>
