              <p>Hi all taxi shifu, just signup to the forum and say hi to all, intend to start and go into this trade in the next 6-12 months time, just a short intro myself, I'm 38 married with 2 kids both pri sch 9yr and 12yr, working in a F/B industry, wife is a thai working as a supervisor in a restaurant,</p>
              <p>currently staying at woodlands ave 6 4rm flat, Main reason to consider going into this trade is able to work in flexible time, maybe  probably can earn more than what I'm earning now at 2k, the 2 company that I'm going to consider is between this 3, SMRT / Transcab , silver , SMRT is the priority mainly becos is 5mins from where I'm staying, the other 2 is mainly becos of the cheaper rental, looking forward to be a hire 1 man driving, in the meantime hope to make some new friends over here.</p>
              <p> Thanks for reading. </p>

              <p>Hi, it's still early for me to decide which company I would go for, yes I would probably go in to one man driving for a start, and I really don't mind driving and handle all by myself if I can sustain the cost and at the same time can steady earn 50% more than what I'm getting now, I'm quite ok with it,</p>
              <p>long working irregular working hours is ok with me as I'm one of those broke that start working at the age of 11 till now , all along my work is those f/b service line that work early early go home late late type, I choose to be one man driving is because suka suka can start in the afternoon till am or eveing till next morning,  or vice versa like that..</p>
              <p>If I can bear the cost and make a decent earning without sharing the cab with someone else then it's good for me, and of course if my one man driving is not going to work out for me or it's not sustainable,  I will definitely reconsider others options,  but for a start I will go try as a one man driving. </p>

              <p>Yes that's one of the concern really is , unfamiliar with our routes, by the time comes I will have a final decision on that, and I will make sure before I make any decisions I wi go pay a visit to tua ya, di ya peh for their prediction and ask for a tailsman first ha, but in the meantime any advice is good for me , thanks</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking there's currently a former auntie cabby whos been working at the same company as me,  she stop driving cos she got suspend for 1 year that's why she comes in to f/b for the time being, in fact I have told her when I'm coming out to drive maybe me and she can become a working partner as she is staying not quite far from me sambawang so, there are always options around, but a visit to tua ya peh first is definitely a must.</p>

              <p>Yes trying to looking at making friends to seek to hear opinions advice over here ,whether is one man driving 2 or 3 man driving is still considered making a living as a taxi driver,the difference only down to a person choice or preference , I only hope that whichever choices I start out in the near future whether I'm in a one man or a partnership drive, please do not start to alienate me with groups, I'm just here to make friends ,</p>

              <p>Route not familiar a bit difficult. During your free time go to
              the map online and study. Even I free I also browse the map and
              explore different routes to improve my knowledge.</p>
              <p>Yes thanks,  this is what I'm trying to do at home during free time, using the streets directory as a learning tool first and doing visualize, for now this is something I can practice atm , </p>

              <p>Hi all taxi shifu, just signup to the forum and say hi to all,
              intend to start and go into this trade in the next 6-12 months
              time, just a short intro myself, I'm 38 married with 2 kids
              both pri sch 9yr and 12yr, working in a F/B industry, wife is a
              thai working as a supervisor in a restaurant,</p>
              <p>currently staying at woodlands ave 6 4rm flat, Main reason
              to consider going into this trade is able to work in flexible time,
              maybe  probably can earn more than what I'm earning now at 2k,
              the 2 company that I'm going to consider is between this 3, SMRT /
              Transcab , silver , SMRT is the priority mainly becos is 5mins from
              where I'm staying, the other 2 is mainly becos of the cheaper
              rental, looking forward to be a hire 1 man driving, in the meantime
              hope to make some new friends over here.</p>
              <p> Thanks for reading. </p>

              <p>2k means total income of 2.4k less 800 for cpf which can be used to pay for house and medisave. On top of that, there is leave, mc, hospitalisation insurance, etc.. and pay increments, tips, and promotion/better opportunities.</p>
              <p>Think yours is a borderline case in terms of taxi driving vs being employed. Main thing bad abt tds is income may not be steady due to things like illness and vehicle inavailability.</p>
              <p>Could consider being a super-relief or part time first and see how.....</p>

              <p>I will read and heed the comments and advice from the seniors over here,  I have the VL now and at 38 I think it's better to start early than wait, I may be in the F/B but in these trade I'm surrounded by 90% of fw ft, I want to change a different trade, before I start I will definitely find a few of my friends to guide me be my mentor and learn from them , it's not going to be easy but I will try, </p>
              <p>I join this forum to make friends and I hope can learn some useful knowledge from the taxi shifu here, and lastly I'm definitely not looking or expecting a 7k pay check.</p>
