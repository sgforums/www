              the quantum and the period of this long distance surcharge can be varied higher or lower, longer or shorter or certain fixed timings. the point is can this (or maybe with  adjustment or modification) ease the complaints of pax kenna interviewed and not getting picked up?
              
              there is one possible thing, i dunno how this surcharge might apply for bookings. imagine:
              meter $3 + booking $3~ + city $3 +  peak $1~ + long distance surcharge $3/10km..if from downtown to woodlands or pasir ris or tuas, wha start meter alone with surcharges can already easily $15++!! OO

              what you highlighted is all quite on the dot. theres a few things tho.
              
              first, you can call in to blacklist the play punk numbers. once blacklisted, good luck to them next time!
              
              second, the problem with penalizing the customer for noshow or cancel is tricky becos most of the time, its very difficult to establish truth or pin fault. even the driver have witness or proof, the customer will still argue back and then the customer will start blame driver, and then vice versa. if this debate will never end, then why start it in the first place? and all for a few tens of cents? or even a few dollars? then how many cases will pending forever?
              The Coy will tell the Driver, when you press accept a call, you should know you are taking on calculated risks, so its your own pasar from then on. not happy? throw keys? ok fine! but go every Coy also the same mah.
              
              third, every Coy is also trying to avoid penalizing their own customers for fear those customers will spread word and then start to jump boat to another Coy. in other words, the Coy rather keep both all the good and bad customers in their own basket (and watch some of them misbehave), than to share any part of that basket with someone else, becos they worry they might lose the whole basket eventually..in business terms, black or white customers are still good customers if they are paying customers. sad but true. 
              
              the fact that this noshow or cancel thing has gone on for so long unchecked, means that they still have no guard or foolproof solution against it.
              
              lastly, you said other service industries implement some sort of systems, but those are based on deposits placed. if no deposits, means no obligations either way.
              
              as for authority intervention, but this is out of their purview. they are only concerned with rules and regulation, not business interests or business conduct.

              first what you are suggesting is not really tackling the problem of interviewing or ignoring passengers head on. what you are suggesting is actually increasing the general fare.
              
              second, when the fare is increased, the problem of interviewing and ignoring might only worsen, becos even more will be at stake, whether someone heads downtown or send u to Holland!
              
              third, at the same third the interviewing and ignoring gets worse, the number of customers might also drop becos of the general price increase. some drivers, especially day, will complain they suffer.
              
              so theres a certain possibility this might become a triple whammy!

              <p>The no-show thing should be tagged to the phone number over a period of time. Say 6 months if there is more than 2 no-show, that number blacklisted cannot book anymore during 6 months or suffer some kind of penalties.</p>
              <p>No show, assuming the taxi arrives within the 5-10 mins, reflects badly on the character of the caller.</p>
              <p>Or the no-show surcharge is also good. The surcharge will be applied on the next time they do the booking.</p>
