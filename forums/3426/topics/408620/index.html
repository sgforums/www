            <div class='col-md body'><p>why so expensive rental with a oil sucker engine and TD still want to take them, wonder how can they make money? I was at Sheraton hotel lobby waiting, then a chrysler came in and the doormen ask him to wait outside, there was a old folks function going on, about 5 minutes later, many old folks came out and took taxis, he was left cold outside. I notice when the doormen recommended chrysler to the old folks, even the old folks don't want to take. See already, also want to cry.</p></div>

              <p>There was once around midnite, I waited at the dbs building taxi stand,  then one chrysler cab came, my heart told me, chialet liao as I wont take this kind of cab and pay more for nothing.</p>
              <p>Then 1 guy stand behind me, I asked the guy you may have that taxi, that guy took it. Wow...finally one taxi came...and I paid for my normal fare!</p>
              <p>Chrysler shouldnt queue together with other taxi or even take passengers at the taxi stand. They are too expensive to take!</p>

              <p>A few times i tried to siam when i saw a chrysler moving into the TS with me but of late, i realise they can be a huge source of entertainment; watching those paxs moving their panicky eyes around mentally counting if the chrysler will land on their turn. Then some will feign ignorance and stand still, afew will graciously extend an arm to the queue behind. All waiting for the hero to step forward and open that black door. Phew!</p>
              <p>But i think they shouldnt be queuing at TS, especially those 'heartland taxi stands' in town. They were introduced to serve a different kind of clientele so they should be at the St Regis or Ritz Carltons doing the airport transfer or corporate jobs to build their contacts and not sending Mr Huat to Geylang..</p>

              <p>i cant recall if RWS is one lane or not. is it har? coz i remember one time the coordinator ask the chrysler to fuck off coz he is holding up the entire Q of taxis. i was maybe abt 10 taxis away.</p>
              <p>anyway this RWS stand sucks , the design is wah lao eh terrible. boarding and moving off time is so damn slow.</p>
              <p>But based on meter and on demand and on timing , chryslers may not be that expensive. say if pax take from outram road ( outside CBD ) to bukit batok at 10 pm , this hour only ghost will stop for pax right? fare should be abt $22. take from CBD , call + city also come to the same.</p>
              <p>so if u are in CBD and wish to book taxi , might as well walk out of CBD and wait for chrysler hahaha</p>
              <p>i think the term 'expensive' comes in during peak hours , inside CBD &amp; midnight.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, very long Q, but only few paxs, usually I by pass and go VIvo city to pick up, there many paxs, tho no surcharge, but certainly, more faster.</p>
              <p>RWS is unlike MBS, the car park is damn big and lots of tour buses and local buses, there are many way to get out of RWS by public transport, such as the mono rail to vivo, so many peoples will takes the other mean of transport out, unlike MBS, they need more taxis there.</p>

              Sunday evening at MBS Hotel taxi Queue. 
              First two Chrysler,  third was Red, I was fourth.
              Nobody was at the queue. All waiting outside, hoping that someone will take those black.
              Waited for a min. Indian family comes to me , I ask them to take the first.
              (Red was very close to the black no chance of moving out)
              Instead they prefer to wait at the side.
              
              
              
              I kept a distance from the third cab, hoping that somebody will come to me again.
              Knn bell boy ask me to move closer to the Red wish.
              I tell him sorry, I'm leaving this place.
              From rear view mirror I noticed the cab behind me also choose to leave.
              (move closer don't know need to stuck for how long)

              <p>That is why we hated Chrysler at any taxi stand , most likely , nobody taking theirs , and they still got the fucking cheek to remain in the Q .</p>
              <p>That day i fucked that Melayu Shrysler driver la , told him to move out at Funan . But he still thick skin , dun move .</p>
              <p>How u expect Uncle Poolman to drive a Chrysler ?</p>
              <p>If others kept centre finger me ?</p>

              <p>Ha ha... Now then I understand the logic of making them wear a vest.  No fish, prawn also good.. (No bulletproof vest, waiter's vest also good)</p>
