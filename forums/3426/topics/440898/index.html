              <p>I told the story to FT , FT asked why Ah Seng so sissy , don't whacked her back ?</p>
              <p>Ya hor .....</p>
              <p>Must have reasons behind .</p>
              <p>I mean if it really happened to me , inside my cab ... if there is evidence i was whacked , til like bleeding , she siow liao .... i surely whacked her until she call me father !</p>
              <p>Nevermind what Police say , i don't tell anything to useless Police one , i'll tell the judge , self defense .</p>
              <p>Singapore Police protect FT one , Singaporeans report they cannot do anything one .</p>

              <p>I really hope after this article was published , Police need to answer to Singaporeans on why no assistance was given to Ah Seng , and AfroAmerican pussy can get scottfree once again in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>What about i slapped until that AfroAmerican bleeds .... if she dun pay my taxi fare ?</p>

              <p>Firstly, report on cabby begin abuse, cheat, rob .... etc on a raise. Many of such cases are reported to the Police but seem nothing can be done. ( or..... cannot be help)</p>
              <p>Then our dear MP voice out seeking protection for cabby.</p>
              <p>After some "wayang" discussion, a new Security Plan is born. There will be tons of excuse why the SPF unable to handle it, but the hidden reason is because once SPF is handling, means it is "FREE"</p>
              <p>So, they will outsource it to a Private Security Company. This Private Security Company got all reason to collect a fees, and it always seem rational.</p>
              <p>We, Taxi Driver are left with Helpless and Fear, so lan lan will join their Security Plan. Which mean, got to pay a Security Fees. (Protection Money)</p>
              <p>With the nos. of Taxi Driver in Singapore, this "Protection Money" can be a multi million of revenue, big business you know.</p>
              <p>What you guys think about this Conspiracy Theory, any simiarity? Aren't we are living in such situation todays.?</p>

              Police will always hands off because it is not a criminal act. It will be considered a civil case, so the only way is to sue her. Honestly that is what our nta or what those association lacks. They should have a lawyer to help us tds get these f**k pax. No point just give discount on merchandise only. Help the tds figt for our rights or help us get this bullies. 
              
              Ok on the other hand same laws applies, we the tds can wack her back, she have to put a civil case to sue us. So wack her back. F**k man my blood boils seeing this bastard ft

              <p>if i'm ah seng, sure very ultra upset! that's the frustration of us, cabbies on the road. pax unreasonable, wrong but dun wanna admit.</p>
              <p>to be fair, i think he was given good n rational advice. got evidence or witness? if not stakes are high n odds are stacked against him.</p>
              <p>read somewhere abt criminal psychology: normal people usually dun choose extreme measures.... if they do, wat's the motive? the IO will surely wonder if there was severe provocation, somemore female using physical approach!! unless of course accused has personality disorder or had exhibited such behaviour before without provocation.</p>

              <p>Without any of the above, it will become a report for record only. Hence, the police will tell you, "There is nothing we can do"</p>

              Ah Seng did reported 999 , Police turned up ...... then she turned the table around and said she worried kena robbed so she practise self defense also .
              
              Self defense until Ah Seng got slapped with numerous scratches on his face , and self defense needed during Living Day Light , and in Singapore ?
              
              Bizarre .... it's an insult to Singapore as well as SPF also .
              
              And she self defense until Ah Seng can call 999 for assistance ?
