              <p>if  a man is single bachelor and drive taxi, there's a very high chance Game Over!</p>
              <p>if his friends want to recommend him girls, but the moment they find out his job, game over!</p>
              <p>if
                   his neighbours and neighbourhood people like retail shops and 
                  coffeeshop or foodstall find out that man's job, their face change 
                  faster than anything. one day smiling, next day like owe them money, no 
                  more smile no more friendly. sometimes they look also don't look, last 
                  time meet will still wave and ask how are you, now like too busy to 
                  greet, eyes never see anything, like invisible..</p>
              <p>if go to dating events, everything can be ok and smiling and 
                  friendly..then until talk about job, immediately game over. sometimes 
                  the other party will suddenly keep very quiet, or raise hand ask for 
                  change partner also have. sometimes they pretend to go washroom, but 
                  never come back to sit same table, or the organiser come over quietly 
                  suggest you another 'potential match' somewhere else.. then switch until
                   no one will to be your 'potential match'..but the organiser still can 
                  smiling face suggest maybe come back next time better chance haha!</p>
              <p>if
                   really very lucky you meet someone willing to go out with you for 
                  something simple, maybe dinner or show, maybe they will show face 1-2 
                  times, then after that busy. call no answer, sms very late reply. got couple 
                  times agreed long before hand and bought and paid already, but last min 
                  message say cannot make it or family no allow, so suggest ask someone else take over..half hour before starting!  they won't even tell you their FB so they won't need add you. 
                  they will never show you their friends or intro you when you 
                  accidentally meet some her friends or relatives..they will just smile 
                  lightly lower head and push you to hurry like you in rush.</p>
              <p>some old colleagues or old friends long time no see, once they 
                  find out maybe from others, will not only not greet or smile, but will 
                  slant eyes look at you like you are some dirty animal. sometimes the 
                  look is distaste sometimes the look is despise.</p>
              <p>To drive Taxi, i 
                  think the man better get married first. Even better, if have children to
                   lock in the woman. theres a few cases i hear, the woman, sometimes 
                  foreigner, still run away after some time even they say they already 
                  know the man is taxi driver.</p>
              <p>i know some people may say it must be me problem, i can be very ugly or no manners.
                   actually several times tried before, we already talked a lot and even went out more 
                  than a few times, everything is fine, nothing went wrong, but then when i
                   say out..the outcome is always the same. they will like abandon ship 
                  suddenly. there can be no different in how i look, how i behave, i am still the same. the only difference if i reveal sooner or i reveal later, is just that sooner or later only.</p>
              <p>there is only one time, a passenger ask me if i interested to look for life partner. but that passenger is a slighly plump 40 yrs old PRC who is going to RWS. so i think not much hope already. if i want to get married have children, i have to change my job or change my story, other words, lie. but how long can paper cover fire?</p>
              <p>above is my own personal experience, may or may not apply to 
                  everyone, i know some of you maybe lucky or skillful meet the right one who accept you, so please do not react like crazy if not your taste. if you
                   have something to share, then welcome.</p>

              <p>i am going to say 3 things, accept or not accept up to ownself</p>
              <p>1st thing don't put yourself across like you are married with wife and children, looking down on these single matters, like they are nothing or past tense. imagine you are single with no woman, no children, no friend to intro you. talk like you are the same level, not from another level. don't talk like usain bolt after he finish the race and win gold and set world record. talk like everyone who is still at the starting line.</p>
              <p>2nd thing, before you have chance to flash any your money, they already close their door in your face. how many gold bars got what use?</p>
              <p>3rd thing, don't take extreme example, like crown prince drive taxi. take normal example, normal man with normal savings and background drive taxi. not ugly man. not handicap man. not super man. just normal man drive taxi looking for partner.</p>

              <p>Singapore wife maybe a bit difficult, but foreign wife is not a problem, some foreign women are much better than Singapore women, just that they might not have that kind of earning power as Singapore women.</p>
              <p>I ever met a singapore woman pax who give me a bad impression about how they look at us,</p>
              <p>Bowah: Hello, good afternoon Miss</p>
              <p>SG woman: Bukit Panjang petir road</p>
              <p>Bowah: eh miss, so I go steven road, bke, then BP.</p>
              <p>SG woman: Go by Diary farm, not BP, you taxi driver all like to cheat</p>
              <p>I was like huh??</p>
              <p>Bowah: Excuse me? why you said that?<br><br>SG woman: Ya mah, if good and reliable, no end up as taxi driver correct, peoples said all TD young time never study, never work hard, cheat here and there, drink here and there, that is why end up driving taxis, why? cos cannot work on any other job.</p>
              <p>Bowah: Oh I see, yes yes, we are cheater, lousy people, Singaporean who take taxis are also cheater and lazy type, because if rich, drive own car liao, or richer, can get personnel driver, most of them must have not done well, that why end up taking public transport like taxis and having to meet cheater taxis drivers, so pathetic hor.</p>
              <p>SG woman: See, you people also never learn to respect your pax, said thing like this</p>
              <p>Bowah: Respect is earn, not given, from the time you board. I had given you full respect from greeting to smiling, but did you greet back? No harm intended, I think I am in a way more respectful of myself than you.</p>

              <p>if  a man is single bachelor and drive taxi, there's a very
              high chance Game Over!</p>
              <p>if his friends want to recommend him girls, but the moment they
              find out his job, game over!</p>
              <p>if his neighbours and neighbourhood people like retail shops and
              coffeeshop or foodstall find out that man's job, their face change
              faster than anything. one day smiling, next day like owe them
              money, no more smile no more friendly. sometimes they look also
              don't look, last time meet will still wave and ask how are you, now
              like too busy to greet, eyes never see anything, like
              invisible..</p>
              <p>if go to dating events, everything can be ok and smiling and
              friendly..then until talk about job, immediately game over.
              sometimes the other party will suddenly keep very quiet, or raise
              hand ask for change partner also have. sometimes they pretend to go
              washroom, but never come back to sit same table, or the organiser
              come over quietly suggest you another 'potential match' somewhere
              else.. then switch until no one will to be your 'potential
              match'..but the organiser still can smiling face suggest maybe come
              back next time better chance haha!</p>
              <p>if really very lucky you meet someone willing to go out with you
              for something simple, maybe dinner or show, maybe they will show
              face 1-2 times, then after that busy. call no answer, sms very late
              reply. got couple times agreed long before hand and bought and paid
              already, but last min message say cannot make it or family no
              allow, so suggest ask someone else take over..half hour before
              starting!  they won't even tell you their FB so they won't
              need add you. they will never show you their friends or intro you
              when you accidentally meet some her friends or relatives..they will
              just smile lightly lower head and push you to hurry like you in
              rush.</p>
              <p>some old colleagues or old friends long time no see, once they
              find out maybe from others, will not only not greet or smile, but
              will slant eyes look at you like you are some dirty animal.
              sometimes the look is distaste sometimes the look is despise.</p>
              <p>To drive Taxi, i think the man better get married first. Even
              better, if have children to lock in the woman. theres a few cases i
              hear, the woman, sometimes foreigner, still run away after some
              time even they say they already know the man is taxi driver.</p>
              <p>i know some people may say it must be me problem, i can be very
              ugly or no manners. actually several times tried before, we already
              talked a lot and even went out more than a few times, everything is
              fine, nothing went wrong, but then when i say out..the outcome is
              always the same. they will like abandon ship suddenly. there can be
              no different in how i look, how i behave, i am still the same. the
              only difference if i reveal sooner or i reveal later, is just that
              sooner or later only.</p>
              <p>there is only one time, a passenger ask me if i interested to
              look for life partner. but that passenger is a slighly plump 40 yrs
              old PRC who is going to RWS. so i think not much hope already. if i
              want to get married have children, i have to change my job or
              change my story, other words, lie. but how long can paper cover
              fire?</p>
              <p>above is my own personal experience, may or may not apply to
              everyone, i know some of you maybe lucky or skillful meet the right
              one who accept you, so please do not react like crazy if not your
              taste. if you have something to share, then welcome.</p>

              <p><br>Amibition is good, but there are 2 types of ambition.</p>
              <p>First, the status type</p>
              <p>Many peoples have big ambition and to reach there, they would have to throw many other peoples away, including close friends and relatives, they will have many enemies from here and there before they attained what they ambitioned for, and then, they go for further ambition, till the day they see their own coffin, maybe then a tear will drop.</p>
              <p>Second, the happiness type</p>
              <p>This is our TD ambition, to have a happy life, monks and many other simple easy going people all have this ambition in life, to be happy and less problematic in life, after all, keep climbing the ladder of ambition is at time, a waste of life.</p>

              <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
              <div class="field-item even">
              <p>Last Sunday afternoon, I was greeted by a barrage of tweets and SMSes.</p>
              <p>“Ey, you conduct that poll in today’s paper ah?” some friends asked. “Where you find these ridiculous girls?”</p>
              <p>They were talking about a poll I had been assigned to do.</p>
              <p>We had to ask 50 female graduates and undergraduates whether they'd date a blue-collar worker.</p>
              <p>This was in response to a comment by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman 
              Shanmugaratnam who had called on Singaporeans to rediscover the pride in
               blue-collar jobs and regard them as core to the workforce.</p>
              <p>“We cannot just be a society of real estate agents, insurance agents,
               bankers and office workers,” he said, and urged Singaporeans to change 
              their attitude towards blue-collar jobs.</p>
              <p>“You need to be a society where customers treat blue-collar workers with respect and that requires some attitudinal changes.</p>
              <p>“A society where a mother is quite happy when the daughter says, ‘I’m going out with a waiter'."</p>
              <p>For the record, I found the women on the streets of Singapore. And all 50 women we polled  said "no".</p>
              <p>If they were inclined to say yes at all, they were quick to tag on 
              conditions: "Must be rich lah, so can support me. Must be quite smart 
              also lah. Oh, good looking also. And must have car lah, not motorbike.”</p>
              <p>And in the end, they said "no".</p>
              <p>Since its publication, this poll has taken a life of its own this week, having been  hotly debated online.</p>
              <p> In the 400 or so shares since, comments have ranged from the 
              withering ("Got degrees, so what? You can do housework or not? Can cook 
              or not?" or "University people are full of it.") to people agreeing with
               the women we polled.</p>
              <p>To me, doing to poll was in itself eye-opening.</p>
              <p>There are deeply held prejudices and stereotypes:</p>
              <p>The caricature of a blue-collar worker is that he's not supposed to be rich.</p>
              <p>He is not supposed to be intelligent.</p>
              <p>He is the downtrodden, the world-weary.</p>
              <p>He doesn’t speak French, or quote fancy-shmancy novels.</p>
              <p>Meeting 50 girls all of whom whole-heartedly refused to date a blue-collar worker left me a little stumped.</p>
              <p>I never expected to be met with the full force of degree-brandishing arrogance.</p>
              <p>I can understand some of their concerns.</p>
              <p>Some told me, a little incredulously: “Why you ask me this sort of question? Where will I meet a blue-collar worker?”</p>
              <p>I fear that now, divisions in our society are drawn not with sticks 
              in the sand, but with rolls of paper – degrees, diplomas, certificates 
              that supposedly quantify your worth.</p>
              <p>I chose to work as a waitress after my A levels. I came home reeking 
              of soy sauce, but I also made new friends -  friends, I am sad to say I 
              would otherwise have never met because of my growing up in an all-girls'
               school, and then in a junior college.</p>
              <p>Maybe its time to rethink how our society has fractured into little 
              pockets - with the twain hardly meeting. Should we have more 
              opportunities to mix as students? Does it call for more education so we 
              can see "the other side" and disperse these strange notions of 
              differentness?</p>
              <p>Having been nurtured sparingly by a cloistered school life, I rarely 
              got to mix with people outside my tiny social circle. I only caught 
              glimpses of them. And I was wary, at first - like most of the girls I 
              spoke to probably were.</p>
              <p>But that's what happens when you don't know what to expect. You have 
              nothing to lean on but bogeyman-like preconceptions. Maybe this poll is a
               revelation that we still have some way to go before we finally achieve 
              that borderless society DPM Tharman is looking for.</p>

              <p>To TS, my take on this:</p>
              <p>TDs hv very low social status in eastern society. Which girl wanna marry someone she's going to be ashamed of?</p>
              <p>We dun offer a sense of security to the girl either. With meagre income which can be disrupted anytime due to illness or licence suspension, no cpf for housing nor medisave for illness. End up, maybe the girl hv to support you and bear all the bills.</p>
              <p>Think...if you are the girl, would you pick a TD??</p>
              <p>Have lah, maybe if she is really really desperate! But then, would you want her?</p>

              <p>i dont know who, but i ever hear this say TD as low as or lower than toilet cleaner?</p>
              <p>the moment a guy open mouth and reveal he is TD before he even can explain temporary relief or occasional part time, if he is single, it is as good as asking to be shot in own foot. he wear how nice, attitude behave how good, wallet how thick also no defend</p>
              <p>imagine the news article can put 100% girls interviewed say NO. 100%, 50 out of 50 penalty kicks all fail. some fly over, some miskick, some goalie hop</p>
              <p>so if want to have even chance to meet someone who can consider to accept, have to meet 51 and above, then maybe still got a tiny tiny bit hope. but i have problem even meeting 5..or even just that 1!</p>
              <p>i wonder how many single TDs out there..into 40s..then 50s..then 60s..70s</p>

              <p>Perhaps TS is still very junior and  had underestimated Love and TD, there are many who married foreign wife and live happily, better than those who married rich or good social status guy, but end up seeing husbands with other women also lan lan keep quiet.</p>
              <p>Most blue collar wifes are more peaceful and happy with their marriage and love life, suffering is sure to have, but suffered with happiness is rare.</p>
              <p>A blue collar's wife will alway knows her husband will return home for food and sleep with his family, a rich man's wife will alway end up waiting alone in the middle of the night worry and thinking if her hubby is having sex locally or oversea.</p>

              <p>Brudder ONG, pls do not despair over small upsets n give up yr route to happiness. Perhaps u didn't meet the right ones over the yrs, being a TD is nothing to be shameful n nvr cast any doubts abt that.  I'm sure u'll find yr partner if u can get pass yr self consciousness. </p>
              <p>Gd luck n may the force be with U :)</p>

              <p>i have tried very hard. i have really tried. i dare say almost 100 
              different times. from complete sincerity in the middle of the night to 
              spending a lot A LOT more than what a normal guy would think normal, 
              sometimes my friends think i am crazy, but i told them i must try to 
              find out. but all roads lead to the same outcome. even really truly ugly
               and really ill manner girls, i tried everything you can find in the 
              dictionary. the only difference is delaying the inevitable, either 
              sooner or later only. but the outcome is always the same.</p>
              <p>Rejected. openly rejected or quietly rejected.still Rejected.</p>
              <p>the good ones will never say more than a few sentences.the medium
               ones will keep giving you excuses until they find better ones. the only
               girls still willing to force a smile in front of you and make friends 
              are those trying to earn your money - the lousy ones. but after you turn
               your head, they change 180 degree. i ask my friends spy check, not 
              once, not just one girl, really 100% every one. i really dont understand how some TD still so stupid think they got gf from outside or night spots and pay them everytime? everything is FAKE, foreigner or local no difference, except foreigner knows to smile outside for show, maybe because they still want to earn money or afraid someone will sabo them secretly</p>
              <p>i
               am not saying TD is shameful, its real work no harm people no break 
              law. I am saying people especially female give me this strong message 
              they feel shameful for the TD who think they themselve is not shameful 
              meh? Theres is this saying: Ugly is ok, But if know Ugly still go out scare people then is not ok.</p>

              <p>Taxi
               Driving is not even a career path for those who want to find life 
              partner and have family. its only for earning food on table, pay bills. 
              best is for those with women are already fat and ugly and old and 
              nowhere to run. talking about taxi driving is like talking about which mop to mop the floor. its not even a profession.</p>
