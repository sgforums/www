              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>wa so much news after my last time. so ok i tackle one by one</p>
              <p>One. Everyone also approach the counter buy Toto. I also. but Not Everyone approach that counter buy Toto WILL strike Toto when final results out. So dont use that 1 Toto winner story over cover everyone approach the counter. Some people never approach the counter, never strike Toto but still save or make a lot of money elsewhere. So Doesn't mean approach counter is winner. also Doesn't mean dont approach is sure loser.</p>
              <p>Two. The point is not the White Collar vs Blue Collar. Can also be Purple vs Orange. The point is Taxi Driving is not very well accepted as girl's ideal life partner 'career' if i dare even activate that word. I have friends who are in other Blue Collar line like crane operator, shippers, contractors. no problem. but several single Taxi Drivers i met all same problem. some 30s 40s 50s 60s. all advise is give up earlier is better than keep hoping and then vomit blood.</p>
              <p>Three. I do other things apart from TD because i tried to keep myself away from becoming like those old uncles ahpeks smoking and chitchatting at airports or kopitiams. But the impression people have of TD is the same universal see no up. I dont want to comment how i look how my communications or how my personality but People usually cannot believe i related to TD until they see me sit in the Driver Seat holding the steering wheel. Thats how far apart my image is from TD. So i know its not the nature of the job affecting me. its just the Job Title.</p>
              <p>Four. I think some people are confused about the point of my post. I am not talking about TD as a way to earn food on the table or pay bills. That one is no problem at all! I am not shy of picking up passengers, horning them keep pestering them until they board mine. or kanna f left right centre for no reason. kanna horn or disturb by other road users, esp private. Those are all nonsense, as long as everytime I feel like I want to off engine right now in the middle of the road, I can count more notes in my wallet than before I start engine in the carpark. The rest i forget the moment i beep beep lock the driver door. If everyday is positive count and my body in 1 healthy piece, I think as a TD I would be MORE THAN CAN MAKE IT SEAH! Only those experience TD will know what i am talking about. Those dont know one, then i will amen..:)</p>
              <p>Five. Dont tell me about investing my TD money. or chase paper. or corporate world. you have no idea what i did. and still doing. so lets just leave that. This post is about how TD image will negatively impact someone impression if that person is keen to find reliable trusting life partner and have family. So far most of the stories I hear about single TDs, mostly come to no good end. Either short term or cash term hahaha xD</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Taiwan Ex-President Chen Shui Bian ever commented this when asked by reporters what he feel he achieved in life..."I have nothing except Money."</p>
              <p>when asked what I do, the moment i say Taxi Driver before adding Part time or Relie... Already Game Over.</p>

              <p><br>First and foremost, you must understand and clear about what is globalisation of today in term of workforce, today is a collarless workforce, if you go around and tell pple about blue and white, I think most will think you are living in the past.</p>
              <p>In the west, the office pple are flocking into asia, why? because they are overloaded, those on the shop floor are actually finding job with ease, and many are getting higher paid than office pples, why? because of the demand.</p>
              <p>The global knowledge economy do want a desktop office guy anymore, what it wants is like an enginneer, can do the paperwork and yet can be on the field of work, this type of people is on high demand and get paid well.</p>

              I do not entirely blame it on her, as said, in any incident, we
              must learn to look beyong the face value, what causes such
              behavorial is interesting in a way that you may come to fully
              understand why sg gal alway look themselves higher than others (not
              all).</p>
              <p>The society, the education and the equality of gender, a country
              base on meritorcracy and not experiences or the know how, create
              many local women with a "I am higher than you mentality" and that
              is also why, fewer and fewer get married or even have a bf, so to
              speak. As long as the policy failed to teach our women folk on how
              to be a wife and gf, tease their bf and how to serve their husband
              well, it will alway create proudness and
              <strong>arrogance.</strong></p>
              <p>You look at the jap, taiwan, philipines, korean, thai or
              even malaysia and viet, the women there knows how to serve their
              men well, in fact, some overly well.</p>

              Well, i believe thats true to a certain extent, but its also the culture that breeds judging and in fact the education that makes ppl judge this way. The thing i find about singaporeans in general, is that they always think "they know" i dunno why but probably because they study more or they got the cert= know more mentality. So they misjudge their position and tot that they are in a position to judge. In the end it breeds the kind of passenger that bowah you got. Point is, not a TD dont judge a TD. TD dont sell looks, so there's absolutely no nid for TD to flower vase. Somemore it is a down to earth job but probably the meritocratic system made ppl look at them this way. But yet they forget how desperate or how much they wish for a cab, during peak, during bad weather, when they rushing etc. This is in fact a very spot on outcome of the kind of ppl being bred in sg... feel bad for u guys man.

              said 1 short sentence you met your wife when you TD but you never
              say what you do, how you do it after that? then what's the point?
              so what you read with pleasure?..or what you believe? or you
              thought you only 1 gf so your wife must also stick to 1 bf? haha
              typical TD reaction..go round and round, never to the point...</p>

              <p>actually at the last page i already not interested already. i was just trying to find out how many clone buddys that silvre and keepchange have and who they really belong to,  their master will step out to help them once he cannot tahan. can immediately tell the master jump out with all guns blazing and tone will not be objective and very directed very personal attacks. all those comments about me i really want to laugh, dont know me at all yet still can comment until like have dragon have tiger. once you lose your objectivity, you are telling the world you are only mediocre.</p>
