              <p>Singapore wife maybe a bit difficult, but foreign wife is not a
              problem, some foreign women are much better than Singapore women,
              just that they might not have that kind of earning power as
              Singapore women.</p>
              <p>I ever met a singapore woman pax who give me a bad impression
              about how they look at us,</p>
              <p>Bowah: Hello, good afternoon Miss</p>
              <p>SG woman: Bukit Panjang petir road</p>
              <p>Bowah: eh miss, so I go steven road, bke, then BP.</p>
              <p>SG woman: Go by Diary farm, not BP, you taxi driver all like to
              cheat</p>
              <p>I was like huh??</p>
              <p>Bowah: Excuse me? why you said that?<br> <br> SG woman: Ya mah, if good and reliable, no end up as taxi driver
              correct, peoples said all TD young time never study, never work
              hard, cheat here and there, drink here and there, that is why end
              up driving taxis, why? cos cannot work on any other job.</p>
              <p>Bowah: Oh I see, yes yes, we are cheater, lousy people,
              Singaporean who take taxis are also cheater and lazy type, because
              if rich, drive own car liao, or richer, can get personnel driver,
              most of them must have not done well, that why end up taking public
              transport like taxis and having to meet cheater taxis drivers, so
              pathetic hor.</p>
              <p>SG woman: See, you people also never learn to respect your pax,
              said thing like this</p>
              <p>Bowah: Respect is earn, not given, from the time you board. I
              had given you full respect from greeting to smiling, but did you
              greet back? No harm intended, I think I am in a way more respectful
              of myself than you.</p>

              <p>if  a man is single bachelor and drive taxi, there's a very
              high chance Game Over!</p>
              <p>if his friends want to recommend him girls, but the moment they
              find out his job, game over!</p>
              <p>if his neighbours and neighbourhood people like retail shops and
              coffeeshop or foodstall find out that man's job, their face change
              faster than anything. one day smiling, next day like owe them
              money, no more smile no more friendly. sometimes they look also
              don't look, last time meet will still wave and ask how are you, now
              like too busy to greet, eyes never see anything, like
              invisible..</p>
              <p>if go to dating events, everything can be ok and smiling and
              friendly..then until talk about job, immediately game over.
              sometimes the other party will suddenly keep very quiet, or raise
              hand ask for change partner also have. sometimes they pretend to go
              washroom, but never come back to sit same table, or the organiser
              come over quietly suggest you another 'potential match' somewhere
              else.. then switch until no one will to be your 'potential
              match'..but the organiser still can smiling face suggest maybe come
              back next time better chance haha!</p>
              <p>if really very lucky you meet someone willing to go out with you
              for something simple, maybe dinner or show, maybe they will show
              face 1-2 times, then after that busy. call no answer, sms very late
              reply. got couple times agreed long before hand and bought and paid
              already, but last min message say cannot make it or family no
              allow, so suggest ask someone else take over..half hour before
              starting!  they won't even tell you their FB so they won't
              need add you. they will never show you their friends or intro you
              when you accidentally meet some her friends or relatives..they will
              just smile lightly lower head and push you to hurry like you in
              rush.</p>
              <p>some old colleagues or old friends long time no see, once they
              find out maybe from others, will not only not greet or smile, but
              will slant eyes look at you like you are some dirty animal.
              sometimes the look is distaste sometimes the look is despise.</p>
              <p>To drive Taxi, i think the man better get married first. Even
              better, if have children to lock in the woman. theres a few cases i
              hear, the woman, sometimes foreigner, still run away after some
              time even they say they already know the man is taxi driver.</p>
              <p>i know some people may say it must be me problem, i can be very
              ugly or no manners. actually several times tried before, we already
              talked a lot and even went out more than a few times, everything is
              fine, nothing went wrong, but then when i say out..the outcome is
              always the same. they will like abandon ship suddenly. there can be
              no different in how i look, how i behave, i am still the same. the
              only difference if i reveal sooner or i reveal later, is just that
              sooner or later only.</p>
              <p>there is only one time, a passenger ask me if i interested to
              look for life partner. but that passenger is a slighly plump 40 yrs
              old PRC who is going to RWS. so i think not much hope already. if i
              want to get married have children, i have to change my job or
              change my story, other words, lie. but how long can paper cover
              fire?</p>
              <p>above is my own personal experience, may or may not apply to
              everyone, i know some of you maybe lucky or skillful meet the right
              one who accept you, so please do not react like crazy if not your
              taste. if you have something to share, then welcome.</p>

              <p>Since you can write so well, you might be better off working as a senior technician in a taxi workshop company. Your job would be to find fault with taxis and write good reports.</p>
              <p>Sorry. Just ranting. Life is like that. Other members gave you suggestions. You wrote a good post but working as a Taxi Driver. I cannot write as good as you but better than most taxi drivers here. I AM A TAXI DRIVER AND PROUD OF IT.</p>

              <p>i couldn't agree with TS, Taxi Driving is not that bad as he mention.</p>
              <p>Taxi Driving would lead to it if one is not careful, like,</p>
              <p>1) The nature of our work, althought we meet people, but we do not actually face to face with people. In time, we will neglect our appearence, we will look sloppy , messy hair, unshave.... etc.</p>
              <p>2) We do communicate, but only limited to certain line. Hence, in a long run, we couldn't even able to do a simple conversation with people. </p>
              <p>I do communicate with some TD while on queue, little do they notice that i don't even understand what they trying to say, even we are using the same language (hokkien).</p>
              <p>3) Personality will become dull and lifeless, just like our job.</p>
              <p>It is not the Job Title that turn people off, but is it the nature of job that would lead us to...... below average.</p>

              <p>i think you lack self confidence and if you feel being a TD is a loss to your beliefs and findings so far...then stop lying to yurself and get that job that you feel will earn yu the proper rights...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are you still driving td if "CANNOT MAKE IT" attitude...why doing the same shit all over again???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look in the mirror and use your TD money to first establish your so call likely foundation that will make the so call gals look up to you as per your findings had shown...maybe get that degree course...work in that cooporate world...its all up to u..no one force you to be what you want to do...U DO IT TO YURSELF...</p>

              <p>wa so much news after my last time. so ok i tackle one by one</p>
              <p>One.
               Everyone also approach the counter buy Toto. I also. but Not Everyone 
              approach that counter buy Toto WILL strike Toto when final results out. 
              So dont use that 1 Toto winner story over cover everyone approach the 
              counter. Some people never approach the counter, never strike Toto but 
              still save or make a lot of money elsewhere. So Doesn't mean approach 
              counter is winner. also Doesn't mean dont approach is sure loser.</p>
              <p>Two.
               The point is not the White Collar vs Blue Collar. Can also be Purple vs
               Orange. The point is Taxi Driving is not very well accepted as girl's 
              ideal life partner 'career' if i dare even activate that word. I have 
              friends who are in other Blue Collar line like crane operator, shippers,
               contractors. no problem. but several single Taxi Drivers i met all same
               problem. some 30s 40s 50s 60s. all advise is give up earlier is better 
              than keep hoping and then vomit blood.</p>
              <p>Three. I do other things 
              apart from TD because i tried to keep myself away from becoming like 
              those old uncles ahpeks smoking and chitchatting at airports or 
              kopitiams. But the impression people have of TD is the same universal 
              see no up. I dont want to comment how i look how my communications or 
              how my personality but People usually cannot believe i related to TD 
              until they see me sit in the Driver Seat holding the steering wheel. 
              Thats how far apart my image is from TD. So i know its not the nature of
               the job affecting me. its just the Job Title.</p>
              <p>Four. I think some 
              people are confused about the point of my post. I am not talking about 
              TD as a way to earn food on the table or pay bills. That one is no 
              problem at all! I am not shy of picking up passengers, horning them keep
               pestering them until they board mine. or kanna f left right centre for 
              no reason. kanna horn or disturb by other road users, esp private. Those
               are all nonsense, as long as everytime I feel like I want to off engine
               right now in the middle of the road, I can count more notes in my 
              wallet than before I start engine in the carpark. The rest i forget the 
              moment i beep beep lock the driver door. If everyday is positive count 
              and my body in 1 healthy piece, I think as a TD I would be MORE THAN CAN
               MAKE IT SEAH! Only those experience TD will know what i am talking 
              about. Those dont know one, then i will amen..:)</p>
              <p>Five. Dont tell me about investing my TD money. or chase paper. 
              or corporate world. you have no idea what i did. and still doing. so 
              lets just leave that. This post is about how TD image will negatively 
              impact someone impression if that person is keen to find reliable 
              trusting life partner and have family. So far most of the stories I hear
               about single TDs, mostly come to no good end. Either short term or cash
               term hahaha xD</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Taiwan Ex-President Chen Shui Bian 
              ever commented this when asked by reporters what he feel he achieved in 
              life..."I have nothing except Money."</p>
              <p>when asked what I do, the moment i say Taxi Driver before adding Part time or Relie... Already Game Over.</p>

              <p>But, hey life is not a bed of roses. Not all girls are the same. True there will be set backs along the way while trying to get one as a gf. Maybe TD in the old days does not require a PSLE certificate. But the educational standards of today TD are way much better then the good old days.</p>

              <p>Bowah: Oh I see, yes yes, we are cheater, lousy people, Singaporean who take taxis are also cheater and lazy type, because if rich, drive own car liao, or richer, can get personnel driver, most of them must have not done well, that why end up taking public transport like taxis and having to meet cheater taxis drivers, so pathetic hor.</p>
