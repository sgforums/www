              I wash my Taxi at SPC MacPherson now, they wash and wipe very clean, $3 only, Dettol clean interior additional $1. Go for the night wash, the guys are Malaysian who wash car, india man wipe car and windows with two cloth alway resin after one car wipe finish, china man wipe interior. All very hardworking. Try one time and see, I last time wash my taxi at the next door Caltex, but the boss yah..yah.. china man there also same as the boss so I jump ship.

              One year back used to go SPC Bukit Merah Central, charge $5 for Wash Wipe and Vacumm. Now don't go there as I stay at North. Caltex Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 also not bad. 
              
              As for MacPherson SPC, car wash about 15 to 20min including wipe bcos it's small fuel station.

              <p><br>Hi Brother, yes, I am a super relief, not only for west, many parts of singapore, I was formely sailing and also work on ship engine as labour, now abit old, with family, I stopped, so become super relief, I still got contract once a while to work on ship, so somehow become a contractor, hard dirty, hot, dangerous and demanding work, no more young singaporeans work in such condition anymore. But the paid is good. I had tried to get a permanent job, but very hard to get a job above 2k, i need at least 2k to hold a family of 4, plus my old mother and father, which my 2 married sisters also help to take care. Knn govt, said jobs for singapore, only those 800 to 1.2k job, how to survive??? paid house and bills, family see doctors, eat grass liao. Sometime, i survive on one packet of nasi lemak per day only, skinny and black like charcoal who care??. Bo bian, CB govt just never feel the ground.</p>
              <p>I also went to west coast pier there to downloan cars, per car is $5, drive from ship to park at carpark, must be very skill and fast, but very competitive, there are gangs there earning their living, only if one gangs sick or never turn up, then you get the chance.Then I got to know this crown taxi hirer who told me to take up taxi, I told him that I sometime got contract to work in ship, he told me to be super relief, as super relief, u need to be flexible, it is better for you to join at least 2 n above companies, like this you got more choices, unlike permanent relief who somehow can gel with their hirer, super relief meet different hirers, some damn good, some damn niao chee one, you have to control, bo bian lah, earning a living mah. As time goes by, after you learnt, you start to have a group of hirers or even reliefs which you like and put them as your favorite, super relief for this group is more than enough for me, if you are good, they will recommend you to others and so on.</p>
              <p>As for rental, you need to bargain for it, those old bird no need to talk, standard one, super relief rental must be lower than normal relief by at least 20%, if not, no need to talk, and if like those last minutes (within a week or 2 types) you can bargain lower, cos they are desparate mah, but if they need to go hospital, pity them, give them normal rental fees to cover them. Like this lor</p>

              <p>Sorry Bros quick pick, even sept and december sch holiday, i am booked in advance by some hirers already, very hard to gel up with you, tomorrow, i go shipyard contract job, then next week relief for a silver cabby who went china holiday with his china gf, following week, a 65yo cabby comfort crown, he go operation.</p>
              <p>Hey bros, your price not bad, as i said, the more urgent they need you, the more u can ask for discount, you know lah, just tell them actually i got work but then you come and ask for help, give discount lor. Like last minutes cabby go holiday or looking for us to cover their new year like hari raya, deepavali, sure they give good discount, cos happy mood mah,  crown for 24 hr shift can get $35 to 45 from some old drivers,  very ching chai one, as for sonatas and wishes, your price is good enough. As super relief, you need to go back to basic, check car before drive, any discrepancies, inform hirers, if not end up lots of arguement. Rental rate for us is same as demand and supply, once there is high demand like during sch holiday where lots of cabbies go holiday, ask for better discount. Older cab also ask for discount, cost eat more diesel. As a trade, never tell others what each hirer charge you, once you set the price, it is more or less the price taken, if next year, same hirer ask you again, ask for $5 down, cost car older by a year liao...like this lor</p>
