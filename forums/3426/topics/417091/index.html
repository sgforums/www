              <p>A very bad xperience last sat . night ,picked a lady pax from tiong bahru plaza to lengkok bahru she was talking on phone all the way when reaching lengkok bahru asked her which way since there r two ways to go kept on talking so i turned  right then she asked me why did u turned when i turned so  i reversed n followed her way but made  a small mistake of telling her u should direct me instead of talking on the phone she became angry due to the argument when i reached infront of the coffe shop she refused to pay me n got down n walked n i  got down to ask for payment suddenly five guys were infront of me she must have sms them while arriving ,i was taken by surprised n this is my unlucky day n dont know if i could walk away ,unexpected.</p>
              <p>I dont want to be a hero n bang my head against  the wall by talking  back to them so i just apologised n told she dont have to pay n tried to get away n drive my taxi .but i was told not  to go n  one guy pushed me i said sorry  n told them that i  just cari makan (earning  aliving )n this lady dont want to pay me ,the lady  shouted many times  on top of her voice n whith many guys behind her ,i said oh my god why is  this happeng to me today ,i got a  chance to get in the cab quickly closed the door n locked it n drive away with the guys trying to  open the door while kicking it ,A GREAT ESCAPE i thought or it wouldnt be the worth for  a mere 5 dols to get whacked . Still shaking after the incident  managed to drive through the night thinking of all the gang fights that happened recently n xperience to remember .</p>

              <p>CDG cabbies usually dont argue and dont shout. Because if they are like that, CDG will kick them out sooner of later due to pax complaints.</p>
              <p>These fucking gangsters should try boarding some Prime or Transcab or Silvercab taxi uncle's cab. I am quite sure this lady pax plus her gang friends will get the hammering of their life. We need more aggressive TDs around. Big sized, vulgar and who love to fuck pax who give trouble.</p>

              <p>you did the right thing in handling the stuation, but you did the wrong thing by not reporting them. when you drive to a safe distance you should immediately call police. its drivers like you who scare got problem allow this type of gangs cheating people to thrive. its apparent that the lady wants a free ride and she has friends she meeting lost of losers cannot afford to pay cab don;t ttake cab type waiting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we should take the war to those gangs. one fine day i go tio bahru picj trouble with them. then call police on the spot. get a handphone ready to call police only. take them to court and sue them pants off.</p>

              <p>A very bad xperience last sat . night ,picked a lady pax from tiong bahru plaza to lengkok bahru she was talking on phone all the way when reaching lengkok bahru asked her which way since there r two ways to go kept on talking so i turned  right then she asked me why did u turned when i turned so  i reversed n followed her way but made  a small mistake of telling her u should direct me instead of talking on the phone she became angry due to the argument when i reached infront of the coffe shop she refused to pay me n got down n walked n i  got down to ask for payment suddenly five guys were infront of me she must have sms them while arriving ,i was taken by surprised n this is my unlucky day n dont know if i could walk away ,unexpected.</p>
              <p>I dont want to be a hero n bang my head against  the wall by talking  back to them so i just apologised n told she dont have to pay n tried to get away n drive my taxi .but i was told not  to go n  one guy pushed me i said sorry  n told them that i  just cari makan (earning  aliving )n this lady dont want to pay me ,the lady  shouted many times  on top of her voice n whith many guys behind her ,i said oh my god why is  this happeng to me today ,i got a  chance to get in the cab quickly closed the door n locked it n drive away with the guys trying to  open the door while kicking it ,A GREAT ESCAPE i thought or it wouldnt be the worth for  a mere 5 dols to get whacked . Still shaking after the incident  managed to drive through the night thinking of all the gang fights that happened recently n xperience to remember .</p>

              <p>Me think personal assessment of the onsite situation is also important, if there's no confidence in gaining the upper hand then have to escape. </p>
              <p>The gang was too near, they could have also trashed up the taxi also. No choice, think that's the only thing to do, if call police, they will arrive late also, nothing much to do, worst still, maybe have to cruise around with them to look for the gang members, waste of time, could be put to use to earn money. Really no choice.</p>

              <p>Fight them? Call police??</p>
              <p>Easier said than done lah...</p>
              <p>SSirajiii,that might be the best choice as I would have done the same thing... No one should call you chicken or selfish.</p>
              <p>You are always at the loosing end no matter what, Its not the same when you bump into these situation outside, where you can remmember their faces and due with them later to your own advantage... I know cos I was young before...</p>
              <p>And always <span style="color: #993300;">REMEMBER</span>, those who hang around with gangs will always never go out alone especially go out of their own territory cos you see all those recent slashing incident?  Its more than just plain random target...</p>
              <p>One of these days, one of them may be the on the news headline kena slashed...</p>
              <p>Sorry Ive side-tracked abit...</p>
              <p>So This is also why I always said, if got choice, who wants to be a TD?</p>
              <p>No sick leave, no employers CPF contribution, now year end coming, AWS also smell nothing, where the F is our 4.5 mths bonus??</p>
