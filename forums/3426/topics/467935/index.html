              <p>SINGAPORE - Singapore cabbies are the worst in the world.</p>
              <p>They don't know the way to destinations, they disappear when it rains, and they are picky when it comes to choosing customers.</p>
              <p>That's what an expat who has lived here for three years claimed.</p>
              <p>In a blog post titled "Singapore has the worst taxi drivers in the 
              world", he detailed all the bad habits that he thinks make taxi drivers 
              here the worst he has ever encountered.</p>
              <p>His views have attracted a firestorm of criticism from netizens.</p>
              <p>They blasted its author, marketing executive Chris Reed, calling him biased, arrogant and just plain wrong.</p>
              <p>Some retaliated by calling him rude names. Others resorted to racist remarks.</p>
              <p>"He not happy he can **** off. We don't need his kind here," one netizen posted.</p>
              <p>Even local celebrity blogger Mr Miyagi got into the act.</p>
              <p>He created a graphics, which featured Mr Reed's picture, warning taxi drivers to avoid picking him as a passenger.</p>
              <p>"It was done with tongue firmly in cheek and for fun. I don't think 
              it'd help any cabby. I felt Chris' rant was just that, a rant, and 
              warranted a response just as ridiculous," said Mr Benjamin Lee, also 
              known as the blogger Mr Miyagi.</p>
              <p>The New Paper tried contacting Mr Reed for a response about the backlash, but he did not respond.</p>
              <p><strong>In marketing</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Reed, who is the regional partnerships director (Asia Pacific) of 
              marketing agency Partnership Marketing, had his blog posted on the 
              website of business magazine Singapore Business Review on July 23.</p>
              <p>In it, he ranted about taxi drivers not knowing their way around and 
              how that's the real reason for asking passengers which route they want 
              the taxi driver to take, not because they are offering passengers a 
              choice.</p>
              <p>Mr Reed claimed that this happened 75 per cent of the time he took a cab.</p>
              <p>"My response is two-fold: You're not new to Singapore, you have lived
               here all your life, and it's your bloody job to know the way!" he 
              wrote.</p>
              <p>"They want to be told the way even though it's their job and they 
              are... being paid for this service! Why don't they take responsibility 
              and know the routes?" he added. And who's to blame for this 
              incompetence?</p>
              <p>In Mr Reed's view, it is the driver, the cab companies and even the Government.</p>
              <p>Clearly, the taxi companies "do not train their taxi drivers", Mr 
              Reed argued, because if they did, they would know their way around 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>He listed a number of examples of him being taken to the wrong 
              places. For instance, a taxi driver took him to Suntec when he said he 
              wanted to go to Novena Square, he claimed.</p>
              <p>He argued that the Government has a part to improve taxi service 
              because if nothing changes, Singapore's taxi drivers will continue to be
               the "world's worst taxi drivers and continue to be the black mark on 
              the tourism and business marketing of our otherwise amazingly run city 
              state".</p>
              <p>Not surprisingly, Mr Reed's comments drew strong reactions from netizens.</p>
              <p>Netizen Cassiopeiia wrote: "The lack of empathy in your article is 
              appalling... It is presumptuous of you to assume that anyone who is a 
              taxi driver must be experienced and familiar with the roads by virtue of
               his age and nationality."</p>
              <p>Another netizen, Red, wondered whether taxi drivers had a problem 
              understanding Mr Reed's accent and so drove him to the wrong location.</p>
              <p>"Remember, many of these taxi 'uncles' do not have English as their mother tongue," said Red.</p>
              <p>Communications specialist Justine Moss, 45, who has lived in 
              Singapore for 14 years, felt that taxi drivers were only being "polite" -
               and not because they did not know their way - when they asked if their 
              passenger had a preferred route, something which she appreciated.</p>
              <p>Said Ms Moss: "I actually think Singapore taxi drivers are fantastic,
               they are the salt of the earth! If they ask you which way you'd rather 
              go, I think it's because they don't want the passenger to accuse them of
               deliberately taking a longer route and chalking up a higher fare."</p>
              <p>But she agreed with Mr Reed that it was "frustrating" not being able to get a cab when it rains or when taxis change shift.</p>
              <p>"But that's how things are. You can't have taxi drivers working 24 
              hours. It's the same in Sydney. Try getting one after 3pm or after 
              lunch," she said.</p>
              <p>As for taxi drivers not knowing the way, Ms Moss has some sympathy 
              for them as they are "usually new or have been laid off", and she is 
              "happy to look up the directory and direct the driver how to go".</p>
              <p>Besides, Sydney and Kuala Lumpur have their share of taxi drivers who do not know their way around, she claimed.</p>
              <p>Marketing consultant Ian Grundy, 47, also did not have an issue with taxi drivers asking passengers for their preferred route.</p>
              <p>"One thing I can say about Singapore taxi drivers is that they are safe. It's not the case in every country.</p>
              <p>"You don't feel that you're taking your life in your ands when you get into a Singapore cab," he said.</p>
              <p>"The other good thing is that Singapore drivers don't expect to be 
              tipped. Tipping should be given for good service and is not something to
               be expected."</p>
              <p>He added: "I live in Loyang and I fly once a week, and whenever I 
              take a taxi at the airport, I apologise to the driver about the short 
              distance he has to travel. Nine out of 10 say it's okay, it's not a 
              problem."</p>
              <p>"It's how you engage them," said the permanent resident, who has lived here for 12 years.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers The New Paper spoke to said every industry had its black sheep.</p>
              <p>A TransCab driver in his 50s, who wanted to be known as Mr Lim, said:
               "Perhaps Mr Reed had some bad experiences, but it is a minority of 
              cabbies who are like he described."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Difficult passengers</strong></p>
              <p>Instead, taxi drivers very often have to put up with difficult 
              passengers, both foreign and Singaporean, who do anything to avoid 
              paying fares.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said: "Some tell us to take any route we like, but when we 
              reach the destination, they insist on paying only $10 instead of the $15
               shown on the meter.</p>
              <p>"They'll say they usually pay $10 and accuse us of taking the longer route.</p>
              <p>"Some foreigners have turned nasty after drinking. I've had several 
              instances of middle-aged passengers of a certain nationality who use 
              vulgar language and swear at me for no reason. They were trying to pick a
               fight.</p>
              <p>"That's why I say, don't talk if the passenger doesn't want to talk. 
              Otherwise, speak as little as possible to avoid trouble," said Mr Lim.</p>
              <p>As for rainy days, it's true that it is harder to get a cab, Mr Eric Ng, 49, a Comfort driver, told The New Paper.</p>
              <p>He explained: "Many of the older drivers have problems with 
              visibility and would rather pull over somewhere than run the risk of 
              getting into an accident.</p>
              <p>"And when it rains, there are more traffic jams, so the cabs are stuck in traffic, and that's why it's so hard to get a cab."</p>
              <p>When contacted, National Taxi Association president Wee Boon Kim told
               The New Paper that all aspiring taxi drivers must attend the mandatory 
              six- to seven-week Taxi Drivers' Vocational Licence (TDVL) course 
              conducted by the Singapore Taxi Academy, as required by the Land 
              Transport Authority.</p>
              <p>They are taught road safety, routes and landmarks, defensive driving and customer service.</p>
              <p>Existing drivers are also required to attend a refresher course 
              focusing on the rules and regulations and routes of new 
              landmarks/buildings every six years before they can renew their TDVL.</p>
              <p>This is to "ensure they keep abreast of new developments", said Mr Wee.</p>
              <p>In addition, some taxi companies also conduct in-house training to 
              upgrade their drivers' skills and knowledge, especially in the area of 
              customer service.</p>
              <p>"We thank the writer for his feedback and NTA would continue to work 
              closely with our industry partners to improve and enhance the taxi ride 
              experience," said Mr Wee.</p>
              <p>SMRT Taxi's integrated services deputy director, MsEunice Lui, told 
              The New Paper that its new hirers and relief drivers have to attend an 
              additional compulsory course with it before they can start driving for 
              SMRT.</p>
              <p>"During this course, cabbies are given customer service training. 
              Instructions include asking passengers for their preferred routes, if 
              any, before moving off," said Ms Lui.</p>
              <p>She added that SMRT cabbies receive regular updates on new routes and buildings.</p>
              <p>Transport expert Associate Professor Lee Der-Horng, from the National
               University of Singapore, agreed with Mr Reed that the Government and 
              taxi companies could do more to "level up" the service standard to that 
              of Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>
              <p>"Tourism is very important to Singapore, and for tourists, time is precious because they can see more attractions.</p>
              <p>"I feel very sorry for tourists waiting in a queue wondering why 
              empty cabs go by, or why there are hardly any cabs, and the ones that 
              arrive at the stand are 'on call'," said Prof Lee.</p>
              <p>He added that Singapore has the "most complicated fare structure in 
              the world", which can be confusing for tourists, and called for a 
              simpler fare structure.</p>
              <p>In a blog update on Aug 3, Mr Reed reiterated that his comments were 
              only an "opinion" and that if he did not care "passionately" about this 
              beautiful island he calls home, he would not have gone to the trouble of
               writing it.</p>
              <p>He stressed that "only a minority" of taxi drivers let down the Singapore business and tourism brand.</p>
              <p>Still, Mr Reed is not without some supporters. Public relations 
              consultant, Mr Tang Li, 38, agreed wholeheartedly with the issues that 
              Mr Reed has raised.</p>
              <p>He said that Mr Reed's post has served to highlight the "inefficiencies not normally associated with the Singapore brand".</p>
              <p>"I've lived in London, Hamburg and Madrid, and I've had better service from taxi drivers there.</p>
              <p>"There simply is no incentive for taxi drivers to do better because 
              many of them are in this line not by choice. So they perform the bare 
              minimum while being squeezed for rentals by the taxi companies."</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Reed's complaints</strong></p>
              <p>They have no idea how to get to the destination.</p>
              <p>Why does the "change shift" sign give taxi drivers the right not to pick people up?</p>
              <p>You can't get a cab when it rains, despite there being 26,000 taxis.</p>
              <p>Why do the posh black limos, red and the black and yellow top taxis not take "card"?</p>
              <p>Why do some of the cabs that do take "card", turn around and say they only accept cash?</p>
              <p>Why are 25,000 of the 26,000 taxis always at Changi Airport?</p>
              <p>Why doesn't the Government allow non-Singaporeans to become taxi drivers?</p>
