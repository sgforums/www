              <p>Bro, if aircon is drawing current from your battery, high chance you car will stalled again. Battery of the car is use to start the engine, once the engine running, the alternator take over and supply electricity to aircon,radio,power window,spark plug,power steering,water pump and same time charge the battery.  If your aircon depend on battery, that mean your alternator is having some problem and your car will stalled again.</p>

              <p>Best is to insist the better 2 tyre of same thread goes to the front during the scheduled servicing.</p>
              <p>Avg 300 km a day will hit 9000 km per month, i.e. almost like the necessary tire rotation for private car. </p>

              <p>And you think those ah tiongs are good? this is singapore, no choice, lan lan, want to earn sing buck with permit, if in china, bro hammer is a dead person already.</p>
              <p>But having said that, why not use the reverse tactic, like me, instead of getting fed up with them,  I buy tea or coffee, bread for my mechanic, talk to him nicely, chit chat about his work and understand him better, once clicked, they do swee swee for you, can even tell you other problem. You rough with them, end up having to come workshop again with this spoil and that damage, life is like that one, respect is better than hurt, you disturb the cook, better not to eat what he cooks for you, you disturb TD, prepare to pay a bit more, the TD can play with you too, you go rough with mechanic, god bless you.</p>

              There is once i discover a semi deflated tyre after alighting a pax at AMK.
              
              Quickly drove to AMK servicing centre nearby, in hope to get it patched.
              
              The botak SA after assessing the condition, put me next on the Q to get the tyre replaced!
              
              I was back on the road soon, safely.  All thanks to his decisive action.

              <p>Wow, u had this same problem too about the battery issue &amp; died &amp; got to call tow truck. Most of my other TD frens also encounter this issue but when they go to Jasmine, she F them off saying "only their vehicles got problems" other vehicles all no problems one. Wow....<br><br>But fellow TD bro hammerhammer8888, one thing I wish to highlight hope u can take as an opinion but it's not against u la. Can see alot of other TD bros here are concern about u providing u good advice not to use fist to resolve matters, this I also agree with them cos it doesn't solve issues at the end of the day as u still got to see those ah tiong eventually &amp; they may do something bad to ur vehicle, u never know right? And by the time u know, it may be too late already too. Anyway, I also have no right to say u can't use fist, it may be a good way for u to get things resolve. Sorry if I comment too much.<br><br>By the way, I have sent u a PM link, hope it helps u. =)</p>
