              <p>Well, i sincerely believed that u have lots of experiences to share.... worked in the ship, drive a casket van, now a dedicated full time taxi driver... </p>
              <p>In any jobs, it is all voiced down to.... "Are we going to get paid, and, if so, by how much"... Why i switched from TD driving doesn't happened overnight, it takes alot of planning and motivation.... At the least, the remuneration returns are better than driving as a TD, hence decided to jump... In Singapore, when the standard of living and increasing inflation is inching higher every year, we need to counter the cons by working wise &amp; smart.</p>

              <p>Certainly, but when one talk, one must know the audiences, if a doctor use his language to talk to a group of cleaners, nobody is going to appreciate or for that matter, do not know what the fark he is talking about. So, at this junction, on a taxi forum, you and me should know who are the audiences.</p>
              <p>No man is higher than the other man, all men all born equal, just that some of them decided to eat, live and shit differently. And to that, they need to strive higher and higher, at a cost.</p>
              <p>Planning and motivation is good, to be risk averse or not is up to individual. In Singapore, the standard of living did not increase for many peoples, including TDs, it is not swiss of standard of shake legs and money come living yet, but the cost of living had increased, and since cost of living had increased, how then can the standard living be increased, in fact, the standard had dropped to slave and sloughting all day and night kind of living.</p>
              <p>Being wise and smart is good, and you are said to be wise and good, because many are not wise and smart, just like out of a group of ugly men, you could be the most handsome one, but are you truly handsome?? in anothe words, are you truly wise and smart??</p>
              <p>And on the other hand, beside using your smartness and wises to earn your living, did you use it to help others to gain the respect of a wise and smart handsome man. But of course life is up to individual, you choose to take the risk or not, it up to individual, just be humbe, help others in need within your capability of smart and wise, perhap I think you can be a better person not only inward self, but also outside of self.</p>

              <p>any person who goes next door, asking for advices, i will always share my knowledge with them, w/o holding back the trade secrets.  Tat is me.</p>
              <p>in a driving career, regardless u are employed as a chauffeur or drive like a Pte Limo or Taxi driver, our objectives are the same. putting food on the table. correct?</p>
              <p>sharing with forummers that a limousine driver can make "slightly" more is not a bad thing, as it also motivates a driver to look up the career ladder rather than to drive w/o a proper objective... if u guys think that i am a busy body.... then i shall not share anymore... no issue to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
