              <p>To me, everybody must be clear about the word "road
              hogging".</p>
              <p>It is must be relative to the speed limit. If you insists that
              overtaking at 80+ on a 70 kmph road is hogging, then I would like
              to do 150 also cause I think I can handle that too!</p>
              <p>Else to the ace drivers who wanna do 150, everyone else is a
              hogger.</p>
              <p>As for road etiquette, I would suggest some go take training on
              how to horn, the correct way.</p>

              <p>2 sec rule is for a safty clearance between car</p>
              <p>when 1 got 4 sec or more clearance, and a car is tailgating, i will shift for him. </p>
              <p>when i got 2 sec or less clearance, i'll let him continue to tailgate. I will even slow down for a 3 sec clearance, for safty reason.</p>
              <p>I have a set of etiquette to follow, do you have?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tailgating is irritating, i agree</p>
              <p>Tailgating with horn and video is even more, knn ccb</p>
              <p>Can you change others behavior?</p>
              <p>I can change.......... me and myself only.</p>

              <p>Singapore car horns and lights very expensive, if no use, a total waste of what they paid for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>In part of this world, where horning and high beam are use extensive, it become part of their courtesy campaign, country like India, horning is like saying Hi, excuse me, high beam meaning, Hi, how is your day. At least they know that the only communication available between vehicles is the horn and beam.</p>
              <p>I think govt should put it in that way to promote horning better. But instead, many of us become horny.</p>

              possible, and (b) every vehicle shall at all times be driven in such 
              manner as not to obstruct vehicles moving at a faster speed. Breach of 
              that Rule is an offence under Section 131 of the Road Traffic Act, which
               attracts a maximum penalty of a $1,000 fine or 3 months’ imprisonment

              <p>Speed limits and keeping safe distance must be respected and observed, no?</p>
              <p>Why hv speed limits then?</p>
              <p>Wanna push boundaries, fine, but know when to stop!</p>
              <p>A lot of hotshots only know their wheels can speed without being aware of the dangers speeding can cause. Can they control their cars in all eventualities and not harm innocent road users?</p>
              <p>Everbody think they are better than the speed limits, right?</p>

              <p>I think it is not fair to display the road hogging rule and not show the speeding rule.</p>
              <p>If vehicles are not allow to exceed the speed limit, then how can you overtake a vehicle travelling at the speed limit?</p>
              <p>You are going personal by saying that Taxi drivers are immatured, hope you will refrain from those comments.</p>
              <p>But you are extremely immatured and ignorant by bringing a point out of context. (I shouldn't be saying this, but need to prove a point)</p>
              <p>By the way, I do not advocate blocking a tailgater, or having road-hogging behaviours because the other party may have his own reason for travelling above the speed limit. See my other earlier comments.</p>
