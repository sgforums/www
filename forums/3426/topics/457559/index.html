              <p>Was sending a hongkong female pax to AP today at 4 plus and was chatting happily going down sheares bridge in lane 1 towards fort rd when suddenly someone blared his/her horn continuously at me.</p>
              <p>Checked rear view mirror and almost cannot see his/her bonnet. Looked at speedo, was doing 80+ (speed limit is 70 there) and slowly overtaking numerous vehicles on lane 2. So no problem, ignored and continued chatting.</p>
              <p>Driver behind continued to work on the horn. Really damn loud and irritating! Hand really started getting itchy around my handbrake.</p>
              <p>But the thought of my nice pax needing to catch a plane and my relief's rice bowl flashed across my mind.</p>
              <p>Just before the 80 kmph speed limit sign, thought driver may really be in a hurry and cannot liao, driver is so cockup that my arse may be kissed any minute.</p>
              <p>So gave way</p>
              <p>Guess what, as he/she was passing me, saw a pair of female hands holding a tab or ipad trying to stomp me!!??!!</p>

              <p>To the cockup (saw car was SJH xxxx and either a lancer or silphy as wasn't paying much attention then) who may be reading this or any newbie driver....</p>
              <p>Uncle is going to advise only this once, no more.</p>
              <p>Get your facts before you assert your rights on the roads else things may get real ugly.</p>
              <p>Whoever gave you the impression that tailgating can pressurised the front driver to give way? You can get badly hurt (even with airbag), pay more insurance subsquently and may even be slapped with a lawsuit!</p>
              <p>If you think you can win by tailgating a taxi, do it somemore and find out. This kind of stunt may only work on triangles or on those whose wheels are more precious than their wives.</p>

              <p>All these speed are sort of culture set by local drivers including us, the TD, but if you look closely, expressway max is only 70 to 90km, so what is the problem?? Yes, our grandfather road.</p>
              <p>As TDs, we are already stress out by paxs, location, destinations, calls, rentals, workshops, breakdown, these and that, to add more on expressway is so uncalled for, once hit expressway, I relax liao, maintain the normal cultured speed, careless what is coming, unless subaru or white honda</p>
