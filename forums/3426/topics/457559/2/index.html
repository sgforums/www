              <p>Of course we also hv to understand life in singapore, most would agree with me that it is a fast pace and stressful one, therefore, all these act of tailgates or etiquette can get disorientated, end up with frustrating peoples who do funny things out of the normal.</p>
              <p>A society that alway want to be nos 1 in this and that will certainly breed class differentiation such as tail gating and expect you to give way even if you are beyong the speed limit of the lane and the other lane are empty.</p>
              <p>You do not see such act in the 70s or 80s, but it start to come about as the society progress more on economy, $$ money and reputation rather than on social consciousness and good civil.</p>
              <p>Of course as you move up north, the pace of life is slowly and singaporeans, as visitor or tourist will then to have a happier mood with a better manner on the road.</p>

              <p>To me, everybody must be clear about the word "road hogging".</p>
              <p>It is must be relative to the speed limit. If you insists that overtaking at 80+ on a 70 kmph road is hogging, then I would like to do 150 also cause I think I can handle that too!</p>
              <p>Else to the ace drivers who wanna do 150, everyone else is a hogger.</p>
              <p>As for road etiquette, I would suggest some go take training on how to horn, the correct way.</p>

              <p> And that part of me is call a short burst of temper at that moment wch i usually cools down using my formula of 10sec. lun lun lun....10sec things becomes more rational after 10sec.(This 10sec i learn from one phychiatrict friend one hor...cos he tell me based on case study most murders and rash act are committed because of the first 10 sec)</p>
              <p>Otr, singaporeans only can eat soft not eat hard type of people one...simple hand gesture like sorry(salute) or putting your hand out of window to signal a wait sign  do make so much wonder in making making other commuters otr to relent and give way to you.</p>
              <p>Same for Bro techo case. Not sure if u had indicate in your signal light to go left...but if you did and took a longer time to go left due to the traffic condition that you describe than im sure the reaction and situation will be much different</p>
