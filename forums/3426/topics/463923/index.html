              from the last year 2012 Dec with the christmas,  follow by the new year
              
              plus the start of 2013
              
              It's very abnormal if i would compare for the past 2 years
              
              The low period mentioned by poolman may not just the normal low
              
              in fact the low was slightly lower than the normal we have experience from the past
              
              many people are missing( the communter who took taxi) plus the increase of the 
              
              number of taxi on the road,  26k in 2010 vs 28k in 2012

              for those CBD warrior who are already experience will continue to survive in this trade
              
              for the less experience, may need to master a bit more about sweeping for now
              
              preparation fr the down turn in case if it happen thought our papaya trying to cover up

              <p><br> This is so true, i'm trying to learn all these everyday.
                  
                  Pick up working class pax, i always try to ask if they can claim, usually after what time then they can claim cab, etc...</p>
              <p>Still learning which shopping center go 24hrs MacDonalds, which got Cinema, where all the 24hr coffeeshop in heartland.. Must also know roughly what time midnight show end, what show is showing.. 
                  
                  Sometimes those popular shows many people will go watch during first day opening, like the other day Plaza Sing so many pax queueing for cab, but most cabs including me just pass by never queue, thinking nobody, end up u turn back.</p>
              <p>Then CBD also during times where most cabby go for break, which building got people just knock off work.
                  
                  Of course for me OMO got chance to try different timing, 5am where in CBD got pax go Pasir Ris, 430am pax got Jurong West St.81, 12mn once CBD surcharge no more which office building outside CBD got people just finish work. 6am Sunday morning where in Pasir Ris find pax bring me back to west side.</p>
              <p>My weakness still weekdays morning peak still unable to get pax pattern. 1-4pm also still lost, roam around aimlessly.. Hahaha..</p>
              <p>So many things to learn, if body can go without sleep i try 24hrs liao.. LoL</p>

              <p>I am sorry, but I must express my deep disappointment to see taxi drivers publishing their daily details and takings, and even worse the whole monthly statement.</p>

              <p>So many ppl pour thru this forum, and when the authorities and public look at it, they don't see or care about the hours driven, they look at the figures, wah nearly 400 bucks, cut here and there, easy easy 250 a day, plus minus 1 month that is well over 4000 maybe even 5000. And this is the low period....what about the good period.</p>
              <p>So you think when other taxi drivers complaint, they will look at these kind of figures and say, these taxi drivers talk cock, plain lazy, just want things easy, when normal taxi drivers who follow this pattern can score well above the average salary.</p>
