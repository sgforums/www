              <p>I reply to this thread, not to find fault or tekan anybody.</p>
              <p>Just to raise awareness of certain issues that should already be understood in order to maintain some level of privacy from the wrong prying eyes.</p>
              <p>As for Poolman, the advise not to tekan, be envious or whatever, but to highlight a danger.</p>
              <p>It's 1 thing to share your own experiences and methofs, but it becomes a whole different ball game when newbies start trying to follow based on that.</p>
              <p>LTA not really concerned with old timers, they know their tricks of trade and so long as no complaints and not caught, they might turn a blind eye to such activities.</p>
              <p>But when newcomers, the very ones they are training start or want to emulate such things, then it becomes a challenge to their authority.</p>
              <p>To solve the problem, they need to find and make an example of the 'Indian chief'.</p>
              <p>And lastly we have seen some newbies in here (not Ct or others who genuinely seek help), who have their own new concepts on taxi driving. They are not keen to be advised or told what to do or not to do, except by the proper authorities.</p>
              <p>The methods and advise given here goes against what they are taught (or brainwashed). It just needs 1 of them to make a complaint or simply send an enquiry, no need to LTA, just CDG.</p>
              <p>CDG we know, have thier own concept of drivers they want, what we advise most times go against their SOP, it just needs someone there to ask LTA to look into the 'tactics' so proudly praised by newbies.</p>

              Bros, this is my sentiment also.. any non-TDs looking at the forum posts will think we are having a dam good time (esp. if their own income is low and they hv to take taxi)... and word get around.. wat  policies do you think the co, authorities, Iras will implement then??
                  .,,,,    '''  ,,,,                                
              That was why I started a thread Taxi Taxi Everywhere to show the other side of the picture, even though I myself is doing relatively well in the current conditions. But apparently this thread didn't go down well with some members or didnt get the intended response...                     ,,,     
                  ..                                ,,,
              I sincerely urge all members that are doing well not to publish their earnings in such details.. spare a thought for those not doing so well, having health problems or just simply having other goals in life other than making big $$$.. ,,,,    ,,
                ,,, 
                  
              When you post such details, mileage, time , $, costs etc.. deductions, calculations can be made.. and leave no room for low income earners (who are happy with their own earnings) to manuver and they face family pressures.. all these issues, fellow TDs shud know very well... many TDs I know are on certain financial help schemes..
                  .      ...,,,,
              If wan to motivate Newbies,, there are many other ways.. the $ figures pls do it in meetings gatherings and not in black n white... thank you.

              <p>Ideally speaking, the best way to advice newbies, sad to say if there is an option, is ask them to leave taxi driving trade if possible, especially those younger ones with family and kids.</p>
              <p>But then, taxi driving is what the job market called a luring trade, meaning, any layman on the street who enter taxi trade will at first feel the joy of it, the joy of having a vehicle, a joy of having no one above him to control him and the joy of freedom and less politics, but as time goes by, age and idlisim set in, and suddenly, they found themselves aged, unable to go back to the working life, seeing his old friends, relatives get promoted, earning more with lots of benefits, can be detrimental to their mentality.</p>
              <p>Most taxi drivers with working wifes will know that most of their wife thru the years are now earned more than them and provided with CPF and other benefits too.</p>
              <p>But then on the other hand, we also need local youngs to carry on our TD, otherwise without newbies, nobody is a lau chiao here</p>

              <p>With regard to the thread, everything have it up and down, if there is no down, how can there be up,  the laws of whatever goes up must come down within this earth is nothing phenomenon, it is natural.</p>
              <p>And when you learn to look externally rather than internally within your own trade, not only TD is in the low period, many other jobs and businesses are in low period, and some are worst than us,  so we are not the exceptional.</p>
              <p>Therefore in time of downturn, do what any person on the street do during a downturn, spend less, smoke less, eat less, flirt less, keep fit to reduce medical or medicine cost, and you should be able to upturn the downturn</p>

              <p>As said again, almost all peoples are in low period, not only taxi driving, and that is why I go sailing, which is more global in a sense.</p>
              <p>Most people from christmas to NY would had overspent their money, leaving a large hole in their pockets, and although the economy is not vibrant, the stock market is having a bull run, these translate into people moving money into stock market more than spending on the street.</p>
              <p>If you look at chinatown decoration for this coming CNY, low budget red bags, these already tell you that business are also not doing well in and around chinatown.</p>
              <p>By and large, as someone said, the increase in taxis on road can also lead to 10 cabs looking for 1 pax rather than 2 cabs looking for 1 pax,</p>
              <p>whereby in good time, 10 paxs looking for 1 cab.</p>
              <p>And with the recent poor or average performances from manufacturing side, from marine to chocolate companies, you will see many expatriates being sent back home, and coupled with the reduction in foreign talents and workers, we will see less paxs.</p>
              <p>When govt after the watershed election told us that we need to trade off with our economy inorder to reduce foreign peoples, and that is exactly what is happening, companies now unable to get cheap labour, moved out.</p>

              Let me explain to u.
              When the rear wheel went over the stop line u kenna already.
              Beating traffic light does not mean u hv to cross the junction.
              Many drivers have misconception or misinterpretation of what constitue beating traffic light.
              Traffic police should be more forthcoming to explain to the public on this issue.

              <p><br>What you can do if you get camera flashed at red light while stopping, you go out of your cab, on your double blinking lights, open the front bonnet, wait for the next redlight, it will flash again, then bend down to inspect the engine, the tyres, wait for the next redlight and flash again..you can do it a few times</p>
              <p>So when traffic police summon come in, you tell them vehicle breakdown in the middle of the junction and engine got problem, I try to start it, but cannot, finally when managed to start, slowly move to one side, told my company and send it to repair the brake... sorry sorry...</p>

              <p>Ideally speaking, the best way to advice newbies, sad to say if
              there is an option, is ask them to leave taxi driving trade if
              possible, especially those younger ones with family and kids.</p>
              <p>But then, taxi driving is what the job market called a luring
              trade, meaning, any layman on the street who enter taxi trade will
              at first feel the joy of it, the joy of having a vehicle, a joy of
              having no one above him to control him and the joy of freedom and
              less politics, but as time goes by, age and idlisim set in, and
              suddenly, they found themselves aged, unable to go back to the
              working life, seeing his old friends, relatives get promoted,
              earning more with lots of benefits, can be detrimental to their
              mentality.</p>
              <p>Most taxi drivers with working wifes will know that most of
              their wife thru the years are now earned more than them and
              provided with CPF and other benefits too.</p>
              <p>But then on the other hand, we also need local youngs to carry
              on our TD, otherwise without newbies, nobody is a lau chiao
              here</p>
