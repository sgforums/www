              <p><br>Earn 2k, CPF takes $400, left with 1.6k, company contribute about $320 into your CPF, total CPF $720. Indirectly speaking your real total wage cost to a company is $2320, but to be frank, in today context, cash in hands is the best way of living, therefore many earning 2k and above are still on Q for a cab.</p>
              <p>I can summarises TDs into 3 categories</p>
              <p>1. The by passer: These are people holding Taxi license, they will come into the TD trade as and when their own job is going thru a low period of time, or it is a interim period for them to look for other job. TD provided that interim earning for them.</p>
              <p>2. The Real TD: These are the real ones who only objective is to drive taxis and make a living out of it, you notice these peoples do not like to fool around, focus and be objectives. Time to drive, they drive seriously, time to relax, they relax wildly.</p>
              <p>3. The old bird: These are long timer in taxi driving, most of them had lost touches with the labour market and the economy at large, for them, they can survive whatever low period hitting the taxi market, and that driving is boring and as easy as ABC, they tends to look for side lines out of taxis driving, be it a runner for some stations or insurance agents, housing agent runner etc etc, it helps to leviate their income, otherwise it will remain stagnate just by driving.</p>
              <p>As such these peoples tends to hold certain interest in whatever they do, for that matter, we cannot blame them, because they are mostly doing networking to get clients from taxis brothers.</p>

              <p>Brother, do not alway think you are the only one suffering or slogging in the past 2 years, in fact, all of us here are struggling to make a living in the past years, each one of us have our own unique problems, history untold and saddness regretably unspoken.</p>
              <p>The way in teaching the newbies is not about telling them about your past or income or your emotionally history, it is about adaptability and the ability to change with times, which is getting narrower every minutes of time, you look at crown, for many years, there was no changes, and then suddenly all kind of taxis on the road with 1 year, a new one come in, new rental, new policies and new fares. New gadgets in the market like GPS, smartphone, this pad that note had bring about a different revolution in taxi driving. There is 3 important thing to learn as newbie.</p>
              <p>1. The roads, prominent places and dare to venture into uncharted area, the likes of lengkok empat or coronation or bishopgate road etc can help one to challenge any other roads.</p>
              <p>2. The service and communicating skill, the need to brush up your service skill, most are from backline workforce and now doing a direct frontline with pax call for the need of good communication and manners, once that is achieved, roads can get easier, ride can get smoother and mood can get better.</p>
              <p>3. Be a relief first.</p>

              just few words to say after reading
                      
              Newbie - - i feel that time are different now compare from the past,
              in the past , taxi driving would be like a last things that most people would want to be
              maybe the kind of demand there and then are different, and the past newbie would
              really listen to the old bird advise
                      
              now i can see the younger(early 30s) people have different thought when they 
              want  drive taxi especially, most even actually paint a beautiful picture of the future
              liao  so even when they post questions in the forum, most would have decided
              what they  want liao
                      
              OBK/low period -  this trade (taxi driving) is just like any other trade, have its up
              and  down season in a year, it is never a forever peak trade and many just did not 
              have  the understanding of it
              so when OBK time, not use to it liao, some may even quit the trade
              especially such thread or post suddenly got so many, wonder is it really this way?
