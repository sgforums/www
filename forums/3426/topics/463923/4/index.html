              <p><br> You are actually a very rare type, almost extincted in TD of
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>What I see in you is that you alway fight for your rights, that
              is good, but then you must understand that this world is not a fair
              world, it is a problematic world full of distrust and also trust.
              Therefore in searching for your rights, which you have all the
              right to do so, you tends to hit the walls at times. You are a
              person who do not like to be control but rather in control. A
              good heart man with an erratic anger at time, but mostly at the
              wrong time. And of course, a good sense of ah beng humor like
              me...hehehe</p>
              <p>Having said that, not much TD dares to do what you are doing,
              why? Because most, as sole breadwinner, have a family to feed
              with no back mountain to support. So, I guess you, having a good
              back mountain to hold, dare to do the different.</p>
              <p>So, I can only categorize you into one more place,</p>
              <p>4. Past Time Taxi driver. This type of driver are already self
              sufficient, with or without driving is not really a matter of
              concern, but a way to pass time and also help to generate some
              extra income rather than staying at home and wait for papaya to
              drop and spiderweb to form.</p>

              <p>I also got a lot of friends semi retire in their 30s. We marry young, buy house young cos we see the rising trend in housing. Once settle our housing there is not much to worry about. In Singapore the 2 big ticket items are house and car. But overall our standard of living is ok. Food is cheap. Transportation is cheap. Everything is managaable.</p>
