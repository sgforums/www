              Had a terrible experience at your SMRT taxi today. 
              
              I normally avoid your taxi after the SMRT train insentience. But I got tricked this time. 
              
              Taxi had a blue advertizement on it making it look like comfort taxi. 
              
              After waiting for half an hour for taxi at star hotel (Because my black berry had no battery so could not call).
              
              After driving for a while taxi driver un happy that either he did not get a a passenger to the airport. Or did not like my face, decided to dump me. Called out after riding for few minutes if I can pay by cash (I had all the cards). 
              
              I said not sure, asked me to get out of the taxi. OI refused. He made a police complaint on me and through me out. With not enough money, and dead phone. I am so sad that i get treated like this.
                      
              In Singapore every thing is reliable and works except SMRT.

              <p>This evening, pick up an ang mo pax from the club.</p>
              <p>The moment he boarded my cab, start to complain to me.</p>
              <p>Told me last night he came back from oversea, board a red cab at AP.</p>
              <p>After helping him load his stuff, the driver ask him if he got cash which he replied he have.</p>
              <p>His next question is how much cash he have.</p>
              <p>This angmo said that he is dam pissed off and decided to unload his stuff and take another cab.</p>
              <p>I reasoned out that that driver might not have cashless facilities and would like to make sure first but he said that even if that is the case, he should not have ask him how much cash he have with him.</p>
              <p>He is very suspicious of this guy and think that maybe he is part of a syndicate who wants to rob him later.</p>
              <p>He said this guy drives a red car and is very immaculately dress in a white shirt with a red tie driving a cab with the number 599x. I hardly meet a red cab driver who is even decently dressed, not to mention the word immaculately.</p>
              <p>To me, this guy is just plain tactless, what u guys think?</p>

              <p>Cash or credit card im fine. But too bad the current cab im driving right now doesnt have cashless facilities ( Already apply with office for the past 2 mths still no news...dont know what the fuck they r doing?)...so end up i got to fit into different mode of driving as before.</p>
              <p>Anyway i understand why some tds still prefer cash...some in need of money....some have cashflows problem...thousands and one reasons...hard to state all here</p>

              <p>This evening, pick up an ang mo pax from the club.</p>
              <p>The moment he boarded my cab, start to complain to me.</p>
              <p>Told me last night he came back from oversea, board a red cab at
              AP.</p>
              <p>After helping him load his stuff, the driver ask him if he got
              cash which he replied he have.</p>
              <p>His next question is how much cash he have.</p>
              <p>This angmo said that he is dam pissed off and decided to unload
              his stuff and take another cab.</p>
              <p>I reasoned out that that driver might not have cashless
              facilities and would like to make sure first but he said that even
              if that is the case, he should not have ask him how much cash he
              have with him.</p>
              <p>He is very suspicious of this guy and think that maybe he is
              part of a syndicate who wants to rob him later.</p>
              <p>He said this guy drives a red car and is very immaculately dress
              in a white shirt with a red tie driving a cab with the number 599x.
              I hardly meet a red cab driver who is even decently dressed, not to
              mention the word immaculately.</p>
              <p>To me, this guy is just plain tactless, what u guys think?</p>

              <p>Sounds like this ang mo got harassed in other Asian countries and was cautious, in Singapore because of the Chris Reed article.</p>
              <p>Put yourself in his shoes first. You travel to a foreign country. You land safely and manage to get a cab. Taxi driver asks whether you got cash. Off course you got cash in your currency but you need to exchange it to the country currency that the taxi driver accepts.</p>

              <p>Had a terrible experience at your <span>SMRT</span> taxi today.</p>
              <p>I normally avoid your taxi after the <span>SMRT</span> train insentience. But I got tricked this time.</p>
              <p>Taxi had a blue advertizement on it making it look like comfort
              taxi.</p>
              <p>After waiting for half an hour for taxi at star hotel (Because
              my black berry had no battery so could not call).</p>
              <p>After driving for a while taxi driver un happy that either he
              did not get a a passenger to the airport. Or did not like my face,
              decided to dump me. Called out after riding for few minutes if I
              can pay by cash (I had all the cards).</p>
              <p>I said not sure, asked me to get out of the taxi. OI refused. He
              made a police complaint on me and through me out. With not enough
              money, and dead phone. I am so sad that i get treated like
              this.</p>
              <p>In Singapore every thing is reliable and works except

              <p>Avoiding SMRT was your first mistake. Never judge a book by the cover. Chriss Reed Taxis! are the best! They provide London Taxi Service at Singapore rates.</p>
