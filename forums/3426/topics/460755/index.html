              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically what i wanted to ask is, i took cab few weeks back to send my gf home and then i go home myself... so basically 2 destination. Then when reach my gf place, she not feeling well so i ask cabby wait for me while i send her up... so in order to so called make the cab feel safe i dont run with the fare, i pay up the first trip fare first... then tell him to wait for me...</p>
              <p>So after i came back down and got back into the cab, i realised that the uncle reset the meter liao... in the 2nd i pay 2 times the starting charge.... and the peak hour charge...</p>
              <p>is it supposed to be like that? or i kana cut carrot head le?</p>

              <p><br>that does not hurt me... but that should not stop me for finding out the proper way of doing such things in future. How you want to do a good deed by giving free rides thats your issue aint it? Im just here to find out how i should have done/communicated properly for i assumed that he wont off and on the meter.</p>
              <p>The way you say things, is as though me as a passenger is either being a miser or trying to make thing difficult for cab drivers, but i hope you do realise that im trying to understand firstly how things work, 2ndly, i know there are bad passengers but i've met my own fair share of not so nice cab drivers.</p>

              every min waiting is about 0.293 cents
              
              remember after the first 10km every 350m fare is 0.22 cents
              
              starting a new meter fare , the 1st km is free , then follow by 400m 0.22 cents
              
              let's say, the starting meter is $3.2 which mean is 11mins of waiting time
              
              then also you travel 1km + 9km with 400m jump which is about $5.00 instead of 10km 
              
              which is about $6.30
               
              So please do the math sum and see who lugi, you or the taxi drivers

              <p>TS, give and take lah...</p>
              <p>You probably saved cost incurred on the waiting time.</p>
              <p>And dun forget, if dun stop meter, you hit fare stage 2 quicker @ $0.22 x 1.5 for every 350 metres instead of 400.</p>

              <p>It's all depends on how to tell the uncle. Like got once pax tell me. Uncle can wait for me a while? Keep meter running I need to run some errand. Then he proceed to pass me money which is more then meter fare then I just wait for him and after trip then settle balance more I return less I collect.</p>
              <p>Well if pax tell me uncle can I pay the fare first and you wait for me later I want to continue go XXX place ok? Then I just settle and wait for him restart meter.</p>
              <p>Or if he ask the same can pay fare first and whether I can wait and take him to XXX later? Then also stop meter collect fare and restart later.</p>
              <p>So what is the exact word you use to ask the TD? Cos got different way of asking and different ways we interpret the pax intention.</p>

              <p>Like that the TD buay gam liao....cos like that means continue meter leh. But wait or start meter again almost same one. Cos if restart meter then it will run slower cos if continue and the distance travelled is more then 10km the tariff 2 rate will kick in and meter jump faster. Depends on the destinations also.</p>
