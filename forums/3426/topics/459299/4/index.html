              <p>Singapore had recently named again as one of the least corrupted nation of the world, LKY is an advocate of this clean and anti corruption nation that he had nurtured and cultured, he once said, "You can take whatever you want in Singapore, but make sure it is legal and well documented" and that how he took our saving, money and labour legally, so to speak.</p>
              <p>And he honored this recently award to the CPIB, the courts, the rules and laws of Singapore (meaning Singaporean) for recent cases of corruption you see on papers, it a stone that kill all corruption and to put every tom and dick as head or business people into perspectives, dun mess with Singapore, that is his message.</p>
              <p>And that message would had transform into all goverment agencies, from Income tax, to ICA, to SCDF, SAF, LTA, Home affair.,...and so on. Singapore is full of opportunities for business people, you can be a billionaires or drive ferrari around, but make sure you do your homework, as a cambridge trained lawyer, he takes it laws by laws.</p>
              <p>LKY is very particular about rules and regulation, it takes the courts, the parliament, the govt, the lawyers, the judges, the cost,  the peoples to painfully lay out the framework of a set of rules and regulations and also the penalties for not following it for each and every offences, do you think they are going to just let it rot???</p>
              <p>Singapore one thing good is that, it is not unlike other countries, especially those 3rd world ones, all countries have set up systems, judiciaries, laws and regulations, but not many can match Singapore in following it.</p>

              <p>Last night was a real disappointment.</p>
              <p>Thought I cannot under estimated the power of the Straits Time. Last time, put the MDT on BREAK mode, decide to give LV full support. Was expecting nothing less than a chaotic night. Minimum, at least 8 blue notes.</p>
              <p>Remember when I was in food business, just a little writeup in the Sunday Times food column, the next day, the queue was dam bloody long. Need to prepare 10 times the usual amount and every bit and pieces was sold out within 3 hours. And that queue lasted for one whole month and since then, there is always queue.</p>
              <p>That's what I am expecting last night.</p>
              <p>Anyone see any difference? IMHO, not a single bit.</p>
              <p>Just like a normal Friday, busy but still manageable. Honestly, the effect of the writeup was ZERO.</p>
              <p>Apart from the regulars, maybe one or two new destination, that all.</p>
              <p>What u guys think?</p>
