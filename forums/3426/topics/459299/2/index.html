              <p>If I book an advance with the legal rate and cannot get a cab, 8+3+3.20, then someone told me, can call this nos but have to give at least more than the legal rate, what do you think will be the reaction? </p>
              <p>I can't blame business people like TD, because our main purpose is $$, now why LTA control the fare even we as business people, who will alway take more than less, like a chicken rice seller he can say tomorrow my chicken rice goes up $4 per plate, because of this and that, and the govt will not bother about it, because it is up to him, if no one eat his chicken rice, that is his problem, if business boom, good for him, we can tax him more.</p>
              <p>But Taxis is alway and will be a public transport, and when you talk about public, you look thru the spectrum of the whole population, from student to CEO, from the poorest to the richiest, and if these CEO and richiest can control the taxis movement by adding more on top of the legal fares, in a long run, some people in cck or yishun will not get a taxis.</p>

              <p>Marco and Micro meaning, bigger and smaller picture, this are use by most business and politician, even economist use it, they like to compare it from both of this perspectives, micro is more of an individual toward an individual career, family and group of friends or the surrounding only. Whereas Macro, is an eagle eye view, a bigger view of all the smaller view. And because it is a bigger view, it tends to be more complicated but provide you a clear picture of the issue</p>

              LTA should go ask pax why they offer $ plus meter.
                  Then lta will then know how cock up or how stupid lta policy is.
                  taxi driver don't create such matter.
                  stupid lta should ask themselve why? why taxi companies cannot fulfill pax demand even after many years of fine system, todate how much fine have they collect from the  taxi company including cdg smrt for not meeting the call demand.
