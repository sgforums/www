              </p><p>now then i notice it is a debate about "protecting LV Taxi Stand"</p>
              <p>i do not have any issue with any Taxi Stand. Indeed, Taxi stand practise are closer to the heart of Taxi Driver. i like it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Issue like $8 + meter, those think it is alright to charge even the booking is less then 1/2 hr, taxi company can over ride LTA cos Taxi fares is set by Taxi Company, not LTA, their Taxi stand got good relationship with LTA............ etc</p>
              <p>continue your perception, do as much as you can, advertise loudly here (or anywhere), it is legal ............</p>
              <p>all the best to you, when you been called by LTA to drink kopi, LTA officer will tell you the TRUTH.</p>

              <p>The Govt is also in favour capitalism except in areas where they
                  have a monopoly - they don't entertain competitors.</p>
              <p>Let give another analogy.</p>
              <p>Take 2 illegal bookies Ah Beng and Ah Seng</p>
              <p>Ah Beng does football betting - he operates at a coffee-shop in
                  AMK mainly.</p>
              <p>Ah Seng does horse racing, he also operates from a coffee-shop
                  in AMK (opposite to Ah Beng's place)</p>
              <p>Who will get arrested first and why?</p>
              <p>Ah Beng - bo bey chow will get arrested anywhere from 2 weeks to
                  1 month after starting operations, Ah Seng might be be able to last
                  months and even years (yes, I know some football bookies who still
                  are operating from cofee-shops).</p>
              <p>Why? Because horse racing/betting is totally monopolised by the
                  Govt, they will never entertain a competitor.</p>
              <p>Football betting is so widespread and Singapore Pools doesn't
                  cover all games, and their odds are not industry standard, they
                  don't have a monopoly, therefore no immediate pressure.</p>
              <p>Same for taxi - LV services do not compete with CDG and another
                  companies, they are offering an extra or a premium, it does not eat
                  into the  regular client pool/pax that other taxi companies
                  are offering, therefore a) it's not illegal and b) it's a service
                  that only certain types of pax prefer or want - hence they have to
                  be allowed to operate.</p>
              <p>But if LV ever became the dominant player then Govt will step in
                  with the rules</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>when monoploy is illegal, they allow competition, but they must have the biggest share, to take the call and control.</p>

              I not fr lakeview, am speak for the netural
              
              from my point of view as TD, there is nothing wrong with taxi stand operations (ie plus + meter) . if pax willing to pay more to secure a cab, its a win win situation for both pax and TD. Pax gets home faster, TD earn a little more. 
              
              but from other TD's POV, they will question that if Taxi stand can do it, why cant Comfort, TC, SMRT introduce similar booking system. 
              
              Jealousy is part of human tendacy. Some TDs will first envy taxis from certain Taxi Stand k standby at one hidden corner in the city, when call comes, k just one, two turn reach pick up location liao. Best all quality calls that within city or to nearby estate).  then they start to camp ard a corner n waits for call lor. Chut the same pattern. 
              
              but then they kenna chase away or summon by LTA enforcement officers. They grumble why some k wait n they cannot.... Human character is like this. Once see others k do something gd, they also want, but when find out they cannot do it like others, they grumble, they complain...
              
              LTA officers actually know the operation of Taxi stand inside out. But when no one complain, they act blur, let the system runs. But when someone complains (k be from TD, or Taxi Co), actions need to be taken.
              
              Boss unhappy say why like that, not in my control. No good.  Peng kia says ok ok,... sort the matters out, give boss back the control. Boos happy, peng kia's ass safe. 
              
              Thats how goverment works. (a recent reference is the cancer guy living with two dogs, when no one complains, two dogs stay. One CB kia complains, one dog leaves the house).
              
              I know majority of the forumers here are from the same Taxi Stand. Its good to see one another defending the Stand policy. But is the policy of plus + meter legal?  
              
              You say it is legal but laws, controlloing agency says illegal.. then how? who wins? you should know...
              
              Just my thoughts, no harm to lay low for the time being. When the wind dies down, everything back to normal. then plus until you song hahaha

              <p>Early this year , 1st January 2012 , a group of Limousine drivers from one clolourful Limo group was caught touting for $10 plus meter jobs at MBS .</p>
              <p>This not enough to catch the attention of LTA ?</p>
              <p>10 over colourful members was fined , guntong , suspension , terminated by their respective taxi company once they convicted to tout and despatch commuters base on $10 plus meter .</p>

              <p>Please lah guys, this is not kindegarden whereby there are jealousy, today enemy, tomorrow friends, we are all mature adults, let be focus, rules is a rule, everyday in day out, many cabbies are caught doing funny stuff, from picking up at bus lane to overcharging to $$+surcharges+meter to speeding to illegal u turn and so on.</p>
              <p>The priority to all these is because we all wants to earn a better income while working less, it is natural for all to think like this, but there is alway a risk to everything, like the share market, how much risk do you want to expose, 10k, or all your saving, higher the risk, higher the return.</p>
              <p>As mature people, like each decide on how much risk each individual or group want to take, all I can said is that if the same risk can make you a millionaire or billionaires, go ahead, give it a try, but if that same risk is of $10 or $5 which is not going to make you even a thousandaire. You figure it out.</p>

              <p>I was informed by controller , all who cannot get a cab , ask
              them how to get a cab !</p>
              <p>Like CDG and TransCab , we proposed Advance Booking ,
              surely have , max 30 minutes , wait for the guys to come down from
              ulu housing estates .</p>
              <p>That's all it happened .</p>
              <p>That's the magic of human interaction , friendly human touch
              .</p>
              <p>It's all about doing a bit more to help .</p>
