              <p>Actually LV or any other licenced call centres are good, one way or the other, they help to ferry peoples around specifically, LTA knows that they need these calls centre to dilute the taxis population, and also, give pax alternatives and better choices in times of needs. If not they would not had given the licence.</p>
              <p>But key of LTA wanted is control, not that call centre are not audited doesn't mean they can go out of control and LTA will still go on and give them licence year after year out of old time sake and let the systems and structure rot by itself, as an authority and the in charge, they need to put a stamp on it.</p>
              <p>They are not going to mind where is your customers or your coconut trees, that is your business of operation, what they mind is the system and structure of Taxis industry in Singapore, if anyone goes beyong the limitation, they are really to kick ass, no jokes, and as usual when thing happen, call centres and their bosses will just act blur, like any other kind of jobs, the workers or the drivers are the best lamb to slaughter.</p>
              <p>So, the ever truth say or horse say in forums, nets, kopitiam, public and so on about I can get this amount and that amount on top of the normal amount is not going to help we, the taxi brothers much, it will only stir up the picture and get attention, which is bad for us.</p>
              <p>And like going for a spa or massage with girls or simply eating some food, we must alway know how to wipe our mouth, nobody is going to know what is the understanding  transaction between pax and you, if you wipe your mouth, but if that pax is a LTA officer, then I can only wish you the best of your endeavour in near future.</p>

              <p>The 'Authorities' increase the fare to weed out those who could have opt for mass public transport. The fare increase roll back to higher rental, and of course higher taxes, and the TD is left with no difference in earnings. But they bear the curses from cummuters for the fare increase.</p>
              <p>Now if there is a unofficial system where those who can pay more ($xx plus meter) will get to sit in a taxi, which is on the same premise as the above scenario, then it will also in a way solve the problem. Meaning those who can afford will get to sit in the Taxi. The irony with this system is that both Pax and TD are happy.</p>
              <p>Is not it how all system works?</p>
              <p>COE, highest bidder gets the car.</p>
              <p>HDB prices escalating, cash rich people gets to own them,</p>
              <p>ERP, can afford then go ahead and pass the gantry,</p>
              <p>...so many ecomic examples.</p>
              <p>Then why is it that the $xx plus meter is condemn by the authorities? </p>
              <p><strong>Because it does not roll back to higher rental, and of course no higher taxes.</strong></p>

              From the exchanges of opinions here,
              
              I can guess who is from LV and who is not.
              
              I sense something drastic will happen if not ST will not come out with such report.
              
              True, LV is filling in the demand gap 
              
              Supply and demand always rule
              
              Bottom line is LTA decides on how the game is being play or technically speaking the rules that all TVDL holders have to follow.
              
              They want to create an equal playing field for all Taxi companies.
              
              The choice to call which taxi companies is up to the customer.
              
              I sense Walkie talkie group could be  a thing of the past...my feeling
              
              Taxi companies may have a say on this and could be urging LTA to take actions.

              <p>The Govt is also in favour capitalism except in areas where they have a monopoly - they don't entertain competitors.</p>
              <p>Let give another analogy.</p>
              <p>Take 2 illegal bookies Ah Beng and Ah Seng</p>
              <p>Ah Beng does football betting - he operates at a coffee-shop in AMK mainly.</p>
              <p>Ah Seng does horse racing, he also operates from a coffee-shop in AMK (opposite to Ah Beng's place)</p>
              <p>Who will get arrested first and why?</p>
              <p>Ah Beng - bo bey chow will get arrested anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month after starting operations, Ah Seng might be be able to last months and even years (yes, I know some football bookies who still are operating from cofee-shops).</p>
              <p>Why? Because horse racing/betting is totally monopolised by the Govt, they will never entertain a competitor.</p>
              <p>Football betting is so widespread and Singapore Pools doesn't cover all games, and their odds are not industry standard, they don't have a monopoly, therefore no immediate pressure.</p>
              <p>Same for taxi - LV services do not compete with CDG and another companies, they are offering an extra or a premium, it does not eat into the  regular client pool/pax that other taxi companies are offering, therefore a) it's not illegal and b) it's a service that only certain types of pax prefer or want - hence they have to be allowed to operate.</p>
              <p>But if LV ever became the dominant player then Govt will step in with the rules</p>

              <p>Simply put it, if LTA is to come out and said, well, its ok, it about demand and supply, it about business whereby paxs are willing to pay more without any obligation to get to where they wanted, so we leave it to the ground and market force to decide.</p>
              <p>Do you know what will happen? limo not included,  a group of cdg, a group of TC, a group of silver, and so on will start giving name cards, calling customers, jio their customers to book them, each provide better and lowest fares on top of normal fare to lure customers in, every taxis will wait for calls at parks or inside CBD..you see the chaos created?</p>
              <p>Therefore, the objectives of LTA is control, once out of control, we all become like malaysia or thailand or even viet cabs...base on supply and demand, can suka suka</p>
