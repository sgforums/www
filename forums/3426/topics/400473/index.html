              <p>They are basically about two people taking cab rides with some kinda nokia gps and a cam in hand and look at the routes the taxi driver took in comparison with their gps and once the driver took a route that goes a longer distance than what their nokia gps indicate, they will basically accuse the driver of cheating... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>u get off we can start a new $3 + $3 + $3.50=$9.50 trip,rather than waste precious time going longer routes and earn 20cents + 20cents....</p>

              <p>Talking abt GPS,try using it at the junction of middle rd &amp; bencoolen st towards selegie</p>
              <p>it will tell u to turn right if u wanna go sim lim square</p>
              <p>then u will find yourself driving into the oncoming traffic</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>imo GPS is useful when driving around places like tuas &amp; lim chu kang</p>

              <p>Even if that pax is a high income earner, he also wouldn't want to be cheated. I'd rather pay a cabby extra tips than have him cheat me by the same amount of money. Not shiok ma if the cabby bui steady.</p>

              <p>F lar,</p>
              <p>Some people always think what they know is best but, they are like a frog in a well.</p>
              <p>I ever took one pax from opposite Amara Hotel to Boat Quay. He said I am so tired I want the shortest way. So, I went maxwell, club street, eu tong seng, merchant.</p>
              <p>Reached merchant he kept f.... me and said I bullshit. Wanted my I/C and Car number. He want to report me. I told myself, "He siao liao, kenna the wrong guy".</p>
              <p>I said no problem, we go police station to make a report. He said OK we go. Straight I lock the doors and move of to eu tong seng. I ask him again, I give you one more chance. You sure wanna to report, if don't want, you alight here at Chinatown and start walking. I don't want your money. He said, go report. Ok I drove to Cantoment Station and there was a sentry at the road side.</p>
              <p>I told the policeman the situation, straight away the policeman ask the guy to pay the fare and alight then take another taxi to Boat Quay. The stupid guy kept saying no, no, I just want to go to Boat Quay. The policemen kept asking him to pay up and alight. The guy say he wants to pay. I told the policeman, this type of people let him keep his money. Just get him out of my car.</p>
              <p>At last, the policeman lost his patience, told the guy " my last advise to you is get out and take another taxi." lan lan he get out.</p>
              <p>Hey to all pax, you want to be funny, act smart. I will have the last laugh.</p>
              <p>He was lucky I don't want his money. If not he still have to pay. $12 plus to Boat Quay and back to Cantoment.</p>
              <p>Mind you, the next guy won't be so lucky. Straight to bukit merah NPP and I will make sure a report is recorded and you still pay up.</p>
              <p>If you tell me you don't have money, or not enough. I will still take you. But want to be smart, you have to be smarter then old uncle. I ever took two guys around 20 yrs to jurong west street 42 for just $12 at 3a.m in the morning. They flag my taxi and ask me " Uncle how much to Jurong West, I said 20+. Ooh, we got only $12 can you take us. I think for a while and said Ok. They were truth to me in the first place so just help them. Lah</p>
              <p>Pls lah, you think we like jams, longer routes. Go start driving and you will know.........</p>
              <p>Time is money to us.</p>
              <p>Talking about turns, you want faster and shorter, definitely a few more turns. Go and look at sg maps. Straight roads are always longer. Kiang, mai gei kiang.</p>

              <p>F lar,</p>
              <p>Some people always think what they know is best but, they are
              like a frog in a well.</p>
              <p>I ever took one pax from opposite Amara Hotel to Boat Quay. He
              said I am so tired I want the shortest way. So, I went maxwell,
              club street, eu tong seng, merchant.</p>
              <p>Reached merchant he kept f.... me and said I bullshit. Wanted my
              I/C and Car number. He want to report me. I told myself, "He siao
              liao, kenna the wrong guy".</p>
              <p>I said no problem, we go police station to make a report. He
              said OK we go. Straight I lock the doors and move of to eu tong
              seng. I ask him again, I give you one more chance. You sure wanna
              to report, if don't want, you alight here at Chinatown and start
              walking. I don't want your money. He said, go report. Ok I drove to
              Cantoment Station and there was a sentry at the road side.</p>
              <p>I told the policeman the situation, straight away the
              policeman ask the guy to pay the fare and alight then take another
              taxi to Boat Quay. The stupid guy kept saying no, no, I just want
              to go to Boat Quay. The policemen kept asking him to pay up and
              alight. The guy say he wants to pay. I told the policeman,
              this type of people let him keep his money. Just get him out of my
              car.</p>
              <p>At last, the policeman lost his patience, told the guy " my last
              advise to you is get out and take another taxi." lan lan he get
              out.</p>
              <p>Hey to all pax, you want to be funny, act smart. I will have the
              last laugh.</p>
              <p>He was lucky I don't want his money. If not he still have to
              pay. $12 plus to Boat Quay and back to Cantoment.</p>
              <p>Mind you, the next guy won't be so lucky. Straight to bukit
              merah NPP and I will make sure a report is recorded and you still
              pay up.</p>
              <p>If you tell me you don't have money, or not enough. I will still
              take you. But want to be smart, you have to be smarter then old
              uncle. I ever took two guys around 20 yrs to jurong west street 42
              for just $12 at 3a.m in the morning. They flag my taxi and ask me "
              Uncle how much to Jurong West, I said 20+. Ooh, we got only $12 can
              you take us. I think for a while and said Ok. They were truth to me
              in the first place so just help them. Lah</p>
              <p>Pls lah, you think we like jams, longer routes. Go start driving
              and you will know.........</p>
              <p>Time is money to us.</p>
              <p>Talking about turns, you want faster and shorter, definitely a
              few more turns. Go and look at sg maps. Straight roads are always
              longer. Kiang, mai gei kiang.</p>

              <p>They did this test for courier services on mythbusters in USA. Where a well known package courier service has planned all its routes for its delivery vehicles to take only right turns along all its delivery routes. Right turns only because USA is left hand drive, and right turns are not usually subjected to traffic light conditions. So the same applies in Singapore, but since singapore is left hand drive, we should be going all left hand turns.</p>
              <p>They found out that despite routes being much longer when the all right turn routes are used. It takes a shorter time to complete, and less fuel consumed. But it applies mainly to delivery trucks. Cars well didn't show an outstanding difference in fuel consumption only.</p>

              <p>C'mon.... It's the Cabby's Taxi... Like it or not.... Not happy? Get out of Taxi...... Seriously there are alot of cheapos nowadays which like to go the Fastest and Cheapest way....... Let me ask u cabbies , is that possible? And , Taxi business is different from Hair salon. Hair salon , Standard prices. Student - $6 , Senior Citizens - $7. But , Taxis , completely different thing. Why? Ur fare depends if there's any jam or heavy traffic , causing the Taxi to slow down...... U think they cabbies like to cheat? Try being a cabby for a day and u would know Time is the most important ingredient in Taxi business.</p>
              <p>If they are really that Cheapo and couldn't even afford to fork out extra few bucks , then why care to take the Taxi? There are choices for them. Buses , MRT , etc. It's cheap and affordable like FUCK.</p>
