              <p>C'mon.... It's the Cabby's Taxi... Like it or not.... Not happy? Get out of Taxi...... Seriously there are alot of cheapos nowadays which like to go the Fastest and Cheapest way....... Let me ask u cabbies , is that possible? And , Taxi business is different from Hair salon. Hair salon , Standard prices. Student - $6 , Senior Citizens - $7. But , Taxis , completely different thing. Why? Ur fare depends if there's any jam or heavy traffic , causing the Taxi to slow down...... U think they cabbies like to cheat? Try being a cabby for a day and u would know Time is the most important ingredient in Taxi business.</p>
              <p>If they are really that Cheapo and couldn't even afford to fork out extra few bucks , then why care to take the Taxi? There are choices for them. Buses , MRT , etc. It's cheap and affordable like FUCK.</p>

              <p>so if one passenger is cheapo, you brand all the passengers as cheapo? one bad apple made all the apples bad?</p>
              <p>not happy get out of here? the same can be said of you too, if you are not happy with the passenger, why still continue working as a taxi driver? why earn a living when you are not happy with the passengers you drove everyday. there are so many occupations out there. just like if you do not like to serve customers, then why the heck stick to it, go change jobs that doesnt require you to serve customers.</p>
              <p>so next time if you go to buy a car, and your car costs only $50,000, the salesman suan you say wah this cheapo can only afford a $50,000 car. not enough money dun buy car lar, better take mrt and buses. I am using an analogy, relax even if you dun agree. </p>

              <p>i dont have a lot of cheapo paxes on board my cab. i dare say that most of my paxes are problem free. Attitude of the TD plays a part too. i have found out in my years out there that being polite is the key thing . sir ,/ maam/ miss , smile, say thank you , sorry ( if in the wrong) i can tell u pax will not wanna find problem with u.</p>
              <p>As for cheapo pax , how is one branded??</p>
              <p>(1) Booking a cab and then hop onto the next available without cancelling &lt;&lt; knn this is the worse breed of pax.</p>
              <p>(2) Standing outside an  ERP gantry frantically trying to flag a cab down when they know , only a crazy TD will stop for them.</p>
              <p>(3) Hopping onto a cab , keeping quiet and when TD ask which route, they say anything but when TD goes his way , halfway will ask uncle why u go by this way?? &lt;&lt; knn</p>
              <p>anything else to add on? haha</p>

              <p>This incident happened long ago. Just before 6.00am, a woman flagged me and asked "Uncle, still got midnight charge?". I said: "Nevermind, just hop in".</p>
              <p>I also came across people standing at taxi stand just before 8.00pm waiting for the peak hour to end before taking cab. Normally if I am the first cab, I'll drive off once it's 8.00pm. I rather take other pax than this cheapo.</p>

              <p>wow u got the right attitude as a TD, congrats. what u said is very true. the most is you bear with the pax for 30 mins or more and once destination reached, pay up and off to the next pax.</p>
