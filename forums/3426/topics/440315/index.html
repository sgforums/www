              tat day one British pax was happily chatting wif me........ he asked alot abt the taxi matters in Spore n whether hw much i earn in 1 month etc etc...........
              
              later he told me tat he was a taxi driver in London n he was on short holiday in Spore........
              
              he asked me hw much my taxi rental is per day n i replied "$100 dollars" he was shocked as he pay only $500+ Spore dollars for his WEEKLY taxi rental in London.
              
              he commented tat Spore hotel rooms r so expensive, office n condo rental so expensive, others tin so expensive like London but taxi fares so DIRT CHEAP but rental so expensive here !!!
              
              he said "Hey Brother, the taxi companies in Spore r really blood suckers man!"
              
              he added "They making crazy money but u guys(TDs) r making peanuts man!"
              
              he continued "Oh my God, I'm making good money in London n my taxi rental is cheaper than yours!"
              
              he tipped me S$10/- after the trip on top of the taxi fare n he said "Brother, tis is wat u deserved!"
              
              now u all understand especially the non TDs ple here, why a Spore taxi company can bought over a transport company in London many years ago n set up many bus n transport companies all over Asia!!!
              
              but the many miserable taxi uncles who r driving for tat sucker company for the past 30 years still only stay in a HDB flat n struggling 2 pay his Medisave n daily expenses over the years.............

              <p>When a big organisation behaves like a blood sucker, it tells me that there is a high chance they needed all that money to feed their 'supporters'. Without their 'supporters' support, this organisation stands a very high chance of going bankrupt.</p>

              <p>Of course lah...you know how difficult to take London Taxi license or not!!! I stay there for a year in 2002 and get to know some cabby there. Average time to take a full license is 3-4 years. And the test not as simple as ours. You think what? Go register get passwork, then go home online click all the quiz in an hour book excursion then go STA click click on the computer can pass if cannot pay money afternoon come back click then pass ah? Not so easy leh.....They got theory and practical. YESS practical which you must drive in the city for an hour with a tested and you must really know all the streets and buildings and landmark. Dun believe next time you go london take out a map and ask the driver to name you any building on any street he can do it!!!!</p>
              <p>Although they earn more but cost of living is much higher. Last time I stay at Grimsby Grove somewhere near Upton Park, 1 bedroom in a townhouse cost me GBP 50 then, now is easily double and the rental is count in WEEK!!! And to watch a EPL match will set you off easily GBP100++ inclusive of tickets, drinks, makan.....and this is second tier EPL team like West Ham, Charlton, Fullham....If you want to watch Arsenal, Chelsea...easily 2-3 times the amount provided you can get tickets from the touts because their tickets are sold out for 2-3 seasons ahead.</p>

              <p>Although they earn more but cost of living is much higher. Last
              time I stay at Grimsby Grove somewhere near Upton Park, 1 bedroom
              in a townhouse cost me GBP 50 then, now is easily double and the
              rental is count in WEEK!!! And to watch a EPL match will set you
              off easily GBP100++ inclusive of tickets, drinks, makan.....and
              this is second tier EPL team like West Ham, Charlton, Fullham....If
              you want to watch Arsenal, Chelsea...easily 2-3 times the amount
              provided you can get tickets from the touts because their tickets
              are sold out for 2-3 seasons ahead.</p>

              <p>tat day one British pax was happily chatting wif me…..... he
                  asked alot abt the taxi matters in Spore n whether hw much i earn
                  in 1 month etc etc…........</p>
              <p>later he told me tat he was a taxi driver in London n he was on
                  short holiday in Spore….....</p>
              <p>he asked me hw much my taxi rental is per day n i replied ”$100
                  dollars” he was shocked as he pay only $500+ Spore dollars for his
                  <span>WEEKLY</span> taxi rental in London.</p>
              <p>he commented tat Spore hotel rooms r so expensive, office n
                  condo rental so expensive, others tin so expensive like London but
                  taxi fares so <span>DIRT CHEAP</span> but rental so
                  expensive here !!!</p>
              <p>he said “Hey Brother, the taxi companies in Spore r really blood
                  suckers man!”</p>
              <p>he added “They making crazy money but u guys(TDs) r making
                  peanuts man!”</p>
              <p>he continued “Oh my God, I’m making good money in London n my
                  taxi rental is cheaper than yours!”</p>
              <p>he tipped me S$10/- after the trip on top of the taxi fare n he
                  said “Brother, tis is wat u deserved!”</p>
              <p>now u all understand especially the non TDs ple here, why a
                  Spore taxi company can bought over a transport company in London
                  many years ago n set up many bus n transport companies all over
                  Asia!!!</p>
              <p>but the many miserable taxi uncles who r driving for tat sucker
                  company for the past 30 years still only stay in a <span>HDB</span> flat n struggling 2 pay his Medisave n daily expenses
