              <p>19 Jan 2011<br><br><strong>NTU student uses empty bag ruse to cheat cabby of $23 taxi fare</strong></p>
              <div class="big_pic"><img src="http://static.stomp.com.sg/site/servlet/linkableblob/stomp/537558/thumbnail/ntu_student_disappears_without_paying_cabby-thumbnail.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="500px" height="300px"></div>
              <p><br>A cabby is disheartened after encountering a passenger who disappeared 
              without paying the fare for her trip from Sengkang to NTU. She left her 
              bag in the taxi as a pledge that she would return with money but never 
              did.<br><br>When the cabbie felt that something was amiss, he checked her bag and found only rubbish and crushed paper inside.<br><br>It was then that he realised he had been duped by an irresponsible passenger.<br><br>When STOMPer <strong>Al</strong>, the cabby's son heard of the incident, he was filled with anger and disbelief.<br><br>Al says:<br><br>"I would like to relate an incident which happened to my father. He was cheated by a cab-fare con, who is an NTU student. <br><br>"On
               Monday, January 17, at 9:59am (as indicated on fare receipt), my father
               picked up a passenger from the Compass Point taxi stand in Sengkang. 
              The passenger was a young Chinese girl dressed in white top and skirt 
              and she was carrying a light grey handbag. <br><br>"Her destination was NTU. <br><br>"This lady passenger told my father to speed up as she was running late for her morning class. <br><br>"Upon
               arrival, (at 10:38am as printed on receipt) at NTU on Nanyang Drive, 
              this lady passenger informed my father that she had insufficient cash 
              for the taxi fare (which came up to $23) and assured my father that she 
              will return with the money in a while. <br><br>"She then said that she would leave her handbag in the taxi as an assurance. <br><br>"My
               father waited for a full 15 minutes but this lady passenger did not 
              reappear. At that instant, my father realised that he had obviously been
               conned by this passenger. <br><br>"As such, he decided to check the 
              handbag which the lady passenger left at the backseat, only to find 
              trash and crushed papers stuff inside it. <br><br>"Sad to say, my father
               has been a victim by a cheater and the most appalling thing is that 
              this cheater is student of NTU, a tertiary institution that is well 
              ranked globally. <br><br>"This is a very dishonest incident, which makes me feel very disheartened and filled with outrage. <br><br>"I am ashamed to be associated with my alma mater".<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>21 Jan 2011<br><br><strong>Yet another fare cheat in NTU: Student uses same bag ruse to cheat cabby of $22.50<br></strong><br>STOMPer <strong>Stevenado</strong> is alarmed to learn that his cabby friend had been cheated of $22.50 cab fare by a student who is apparently from NTU.<br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"My taxi's friend just got cheated with the same trick - <a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/ugly_commuters/537558/ntu_student_disappears_without_paying_cabby.html">leaving empty bag behind</a>. <br><br>"He picked up a young girl, about 20 years old from Compass Point in Sengkang. <br><br>"She looks like a student. She is a bit plump, fair and has short hair. She told him to head to NTU. <br><br>"The
               fare was about $22.50. When they reached the destination, she claimed 
              that she does not have enough cash and needed to borrow from friends. <br><br>"She told him there are some expensive crystals in her paper bag and will leave it in the taxi. <br><br>"After
               waiting for 15 minutes, my friend opened the bag. He found two pieces 
              of goreng pisang, some tissue paper and an empty plastic box. <br><br>"I want to remind all taxi drivers to beware of such cheats. <br><br>"CRIME DOES NOT PAY!"<br><br><img src="http://static.stomp.com.sg/site/servlet/linkableblob/stomp/539482/data/taxi1-data.jpg" alt=""><br><br>Source:<a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/ugly_commuters/537558/ntu_student_disappears_without_paying_cabby.html"><br>http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/ugly_commuters/537558/ntu_student_disappears_without_paying_cabby.html</a><br><a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/539454/another_student_use_leave_bag_ruse_to_cheat_cab_fare.html#commentSection">http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/this_urban_jungle/539454/another_student_use_leave_bag_ruse_to_cheat_cab_fare.html#commentSection<br></a></p>
