              <p>Because now MBS has got a new alighting point . In the middle , before Car Valet .</p>

              <p>I also will be pissed if drivers kept ignoring my command to go to AlightingPoint .</p>
              <p>Alighting paxes pls proceed to middle lane , not the extreme left lane .</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Marshall look like chasing the goat, the duck or hen in the farms. I felt too many Marshalls and Coordinators at the MBS Lobby. They are confused too, I mean they are over-stuff. The guest at the lobby there are also confused. I dun think any TD like to pick and drop there only the limo TD bo bian. The problem there will not solve. Now the Casino sÂ glass entrance outside is doing a new lane as whasaline AP T1. Bear with it if you happens to go there again.î�„</div>

              <p>American hire and fire is like eating, for them, it is normal. However, we asian see it as something bad, embrassing and lost of dignity. Unions in Singapore chia sai one lah, so far, what did our taxi union do for us??? nothing ? cannot even help us to lower fuel prices or rental, see bosses like king, very pro management type. I joined just for rebate and linkpoint at NTUC, and also apply scholarship and bursary for my kids.</p>
              <p>The right to hire and fire is equal to the right to work or resign, just like you hv the right to throw keys, taxi companies also hv to right to ask you to go. Nobody owes nobody a living, that is the true aspect of this world, especially created by our capitalise mindset govt.</p>

                              <p>American hire and fire is like eating, for them, it is normal.
              However, we asian see it as something bad, embrassing and lost of
              dignity. Unions in Singapore chia sai one lah, so far, what did our
              taxi union do for us??? nothing ? cannot even help us to lower fuel
              prices or rental, see bosses like king, very pro management type. I
              joined just for rebate and linkpoint at NTUC, and also apply
              scholarship and bursary for my kids.</p>
              <p>The right to hire and fire is equal to the right to work or
              resign, just like you hv the right to throw keys, taxi companies
              also hv to right to ask you to go. Nobody owes nobody a living,
              that is the true aspect of this world, especially created by our
              capitalise mindset govt.</p>
