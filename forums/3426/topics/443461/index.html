              <p><br>Transcab start off with a boom in CNG period due to high petrol cost, I remember many private car also start to install CNG tanks.</p>
              <p>In business, when there is a different in application and the approach toward a same trade, for us, it is taxi business, that will anchor a different way of management. The supply chain is critical in these sense, the boss have to consider, the stations, the maintenance and the rental fares. He must also make sure that the set up attract drivers of either new or from competitors. Wish is not a cheap car, it is japanese, and in private, it is more expensive than a sonata, and japanses parts are not as cheap as korean.</p>
              <p>With a rebate on incentive given back to driver every month, it act both as an attraction to drivers and also a discipline on those who pay rental late (no incentives). With the reduction in new cab on incentives, I sense a problem with their rental fees, being the lowest in 2.0cc cab, transcab may not find it not viable anymore as their competitors still strive in their business with a higher cost of rental fees which mean higher profit margin.</p>
              <p>There could be a target or KPI not achieved, and my prediction is the profit KPI, which translate into the cost of operation from buying cabs, paying high COEs, maintenances, taxation, stations, staff remuneration and many more against rental fees, and that is why EPICA come into the picture at $125. And when you got EPICA, you need different a total different workshop and set of peoples to maintenance it. And that, at the moment could ate more into the cost of operation.</p>
              <p>The arguement here, for the sake of it, is that CNG rebate is given back as a monthly rebate, rental is at a crown price, can they sustain in a long run. Fares changes is not going to earn Transcab a single cents, it is all for the cabbies, in that sense, the red might be thinking, if I implement and agree to the fare change structure as the likes of cdg and smrt or better, can I increase your rental fees to that of cdg or smrt??</p>
