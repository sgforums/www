              <p>It's not about me picking on other TD lah. If you want to go home or go jalan jalan with your wife then dun pick up fare. To me it is unethical loh. Pax pay for the journey not to listen to you and your wife talk right? Unless you are alone and on the way home and want to paid trip home I got nothing against it. But if there is other onboard means that you are not in a position to take up any fare as you are already off duty and is spending time with your wife so prepare to forgo any paid trip to anywhere. Although I admit I am not an ethical TD because I choose my fare and I chase people down if they step on my tail. But I chase them down I dun owe them any reason. But I will not do such cheapo act.</p>
              <p>This morning I also chase 2 youngster down and nearly beat them up. KNN smoke ciggarette and puff out in my taxi I buay song liao. Tell them nicely I dun want to take they come #$^^*@$ me. Chase them down they dun want so I go down and drag them down. They dun scarm sure got beaten up by me. Anyway I dun need this job to survive. Want to revolt my TVL I also like that. Better got excuse to sit at home shake leg.</p>

              <p>Tell you lah. Not easy to prosecute lah. First the victim that got beaten up have to lodge a magistrate complain then the police will investigate. Then there will be a mediation process before the pre trial conference. The key is when the victim want to pursue the case he/she must pay min a few thousands for legal fee and if he/she lose that case then your legal fees he/she also must foot about 80%. So when you ham tam the fellow make sure you have more $$$ then him/her if the case went to trial. And usually you pays more for a lawyer higher chances you win the case. So in the end the magistrate will just ask the victim to accept the medical compensation and close the case.</p>
              <p>Last time my wife's ex also ganna jia liat from me. KNN I make him knee down in front of her and bang his head on the tarmac. In the end I dun even compensate him a single cent. I tell him want go all out fight the case with me. The magistrate see also also shake head. Sad to say the law protect the riches here. I am not rich but at least I am not poor. So if you want to whack you also must see the other party background. But of course dun whack until he very jia liat until die. Then police will come knock on your door liao....</p>

              not siding anyone, just saying a fair word.
              
              to whomever TDs that bring wife, bring mistress, bring gf, bring extra luggage, be it in front seat or in back boot, technically speaking, when a customer board a cab, this customer is not just paying for the destination, he or she is also paying for the journey, factors like safety, peace of mind and privacy. even entertainment if they want to listen to certain radio stations along the way or some songs in their mp3 that they hope can plug into the invehicle stereo. some take taxis to pass time or cool down or collect themselves before an event like an interview, some to avoid sweaty crowds, some just feel like talking to a stranger longer without a fixed short destination. i ever met before an older woman who sang old 30s 40s chinese tunes from journey start to end, i dont understand a single word and she sang really loud next to my ears, but shes still not shy. then she told me shes a singer for those old style bars and needed the privacy that she cannot get in buses and trains. 
              
              often TDs overlook these little details, assuming they are cheap frills and not part of the ride itself. they are actually an integral part of the ride, just that they are not spelt out literally. thats another problem with SG, what is not said is often assumed, thats not so bad but whats bad is, what is assumed is usually in whose ever favor making that assumption!  If someone brings along a cute daughter or a big stuff toy, the customer happens to enjoy and accept the style of that journey, then thats pure good fortune for the TD. but dont mistake that as being right! can anyone imagine sharing a table inside a fast food restaurant with its manager sitting right next to you of all places, chewing noisily on the same food that you paid for but the manager's on the house? thats why theres staff corners and staff quarters.
              
              some people might counter to say, china taxi often have wife and gf sitting inside so whats wrong. but the irony of that situation is, they are there to help ensure the safety of their husbands and bf who are the TDs! their presence is also some sort of an assurance to the outside customers that this is a legitimate taxi with a proper TD system!
              
              to TS, on the other hand, in times of need and when theres urgency and theres no other available transport, then your family member has to start to weigh or narrow down his or her priority. which is more important to him or her: the destination or the journey? if its the destination, then once boarded, there shouldnt be complain because the journey has already been accepted the way it is. if journey is also important, then shouldnt board at all. just wait for the next available ride. case close.
              
              hope what i say wont offend anyone in particular. just my own 2 cents.
