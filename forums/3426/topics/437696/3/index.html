Time is around 1am in the morning. I ask her which part she just says reach then tell me. So when I reach Jalan Bahar the muslim cemetry there I want to ask her then suddenly I dun see her in my rear view mirror (All the while when I check my mirror she is there). KNN that time I very scare leh. Dunno what to do. When reach Lim Chu Kang Road just pass the junction suddenly she ask me pull over. I see the mirror again but bo lang leh....so I turn back my head and realise she is slouching on her seat lah. So I pullover let her alight. End up she is passing supper to her bf doing guard duty at the LCK camp. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>As for TS issue about wife on board, I can make it into 2 points,</p>
              <p>1st, officially speaking, paxs are customer, and as  direct customer service provider, we have to as much as reasonable, satisfy the customer, if you wish to go further and delight customer, by all means. If you go down to the protocol, we need to ensure our vehicle is in ok condition, clean and comfortable, on the other hand, we also need to ensure that we are in good shape, alert,  and at all time, have a safety mindset on the road. Knowing that Taxi is one the most Taxing transport on land here, we definitely expect customers demand privacy, faster and a comfort journey to their destination. So, if you are with family, you can switch to busy to ward off unnecessary flag down issues, and not matter whoever complained, you are protected and have your right. With a family member and a green for HIRE sign on top is certainly not encouraging.</p>
              <p>Different countries have their own way of driving taxis, each own culture, and for Singapore Taxi, the culture of having family member on board with pax is not a norm. If so, all of us will be doing the same and that can  end up with lots of problem, like pple said about China or india taxis, before going there, we already know such culture exist, so when we met one, no problem, cos it is a norm, but if a tourist is to come here and see such action, what will he or she thinks? Oh, singapore taxi same like india and china style, they drive with their family member on board.</p>
              <p>2ndly, unofficially speaking, it is a give and take issue, pax can choose not to take, if paxs start to take taxi with family member on board, then it will inculcate the trend that having member on board is ok, if so, 4 paxs together will be unable to take your taxis, and with a FOR HIRE sign on top to ply the road, you are basically not ready for hire. Of course, if mutual agreement can be reach, no problem, just drive on, but not all paxs are the same, they are the customers, and by the laws of business, customers is alway right. Turn left, you turn left lor, even you know it wrong, you just do as they said, nothing will go wrong.</p>

              <p>I do agree.</p>
              <p>If U want to fetch ur wife somewhere, pls switch to off and busy and expect to fetch a paying customer even with discounts. In short -&gt; "not pro" or in short, yao-gui..</p>
              <p>Want to do business, swee swee.. U are a taxi driver. make sure you do a taxi business. Not blur the lines, and fetch this and that, and compromise..  Still ask people to give n take.</p>
              <p>Imagine going to airport, pick up passenger, but no space in boot, cause you just fetched your daughter plus her two big luggages. so U ask passenger to put luggage on her lap and you give her $10 discount, boleh??</p>
              <p>Know your stand, Else, how to expect people to respect you.</p>

              <p>As for TS issue about wife on board, I can make it into 2
              points,</p>
              <p>1st, officially speaking, paxs are customer, and as  direct
              customer service provider, we have to as much as reasonable,
              satisfy the customer, if you wish to go further and delight
              customer, by all means. If you go down to the protocol, we need to
              ensure our vehicle is in ok condition, clean and comfortable,
              on the other hand, we also need to ensure that we are in good
              shape, alert,  and at all time, have a safety mindset on the
              road. Knowing that Taxi is one the most Taxing transport on land
              here, we definitely expect customers demand privacy, faster and a
              comfort journey to their destination. So, if you are with family,
              you can switch to busy to ward off unnecessary flag down issues,
              and not matter whoever complained, you are protected and have your
              right. With a family member and a green for HIRE sign on top
              is certainly not encouraging.</p>
              <p>Different countries have their own way of driving
              taxis, each own culture, and for Singapore Taxi, the culture
              of having family member on board with pax is not a norm. If so, all
              of us will be doing the same and that can  end up with lots of
              problem, like pple said about China or india taxis, before going
              there, we already know such culture exist, so when we met one, no
              problem, cos it is a norm, but if a tourist is to come here and see
              such action, what will he or she thinks? Oh, singapore taxi same
              like india and china style, they drive with their family member on
              board.</p>
              <p>2ndly, unofficially speaking, it is a give and take issue, pax
              can choose not to take, if paxs start to take taxi with family
              member on board, then it will inculcate the trend that having
              member on board is ok, if so, 4 paxs together will be unable to
              take your taxis, and with a FOR HIRE sign on top to ply the road,
              you are basically not ready for hire. Of course, if mutual
              agreement can be reach, no problem, just drive on, but not all paxs
              are the same, they are the customers, and by the laws of business,
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">customers is alway right. Turn left, you turn left lor, even you
              know it wrong, you just do as they said, nothing will go wrong.</span></p>
