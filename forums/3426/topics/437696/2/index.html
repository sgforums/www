              <p>It's not about me picking on other TD lah. If you want to go
              home or go jalan jalan with your wife then dun pick up fare. To me
              it is unethical loh. Pax pay for the journey not to listen to you
              and your wife talk right? Unless you are alone and on the way home
              and want to paid trip home I got nothing against it. But if there
              is other onboard means that you are not in a position to take up
              any fare as you are already off duty and is spending time with your
              wife so prepare to forgo any paid trip to anywhere. Although I
              admit I am not an ethical TD because I choose my fare and I chase
              people down if they step on my tail. But I chase them down I dun
              owe them any reason. But I will not do such cheapo act.</p>
              <p>This morning I also chase 2 youngster down and nearly beat them
              up. KNN smoke ciggarette and puff out in my taxi I buay song liao.
              Tell them nicely I dun want to take they come #$^^*@$ me. Chase
              them down they dun want so I go down and drag them down. They dun
              scarm sure got beaten up by me. Anyway I dun need this job to
              survive. Want to revolt my TVL I also like that. Better got excuse

              <p>not siding anyone, just saying a fair word.</p>
              <p>to whomever TDs that bring wife, bring mistress, bring gf, bring
              extra luggage, be it in front seat or in back boot, technically
              speaking, when a customer board a cab, this customer is not just
              paying for the destination, he or she is also paying for the
              journey, factors like safety, peace of mind and privacy. even
              entertainment if they want to listen to certain radio stations
              along the way or some songs in their mp3 that they hope can plug
              into the invehicle stereo. some take taxis to pass time or cool
              down or collect themselves before an event like an interview, some
              to avoid sweaty crowds, some just feel like talking to a stranger
              longer without a fixed short destination. i ever met before an
              older woman who sang old 30s 40s chinese tunes from journey start
              to end, i dont understand a single word and she sang really loud
              next to my ears, but shes still not shy. then she told me shes a
              singer for those old style bars and needed the privacy that she
              cannot get in buses and trains.</p>
              <p>often TDs overlook these little details, assuming they are cheap
              frills and not part of the ride itself. they are actually an
              integral part of the ride, just that they are not spelt out
              literally. thats another problem with SG, what is not said is often
              assumed, thats not so bad but whats bad is, what is assumed is
              usually in whose ever favor making that assumption! If someone
              brings along a cute daughter or a big stuff toy, the customer
              happens to enjoy and accept the style of that journey, then thats
              pure good fortune for the TD. but dont mistake that as being right!
              can anyone imagine sharing a table inside a fast food restaurant
              with its manager sitting right next to you of all places, chewing
              noisily on the same food that you paid for but the manager’s on the
              house? thats why theres staff corners and staff quarters.</p>
              <p>some people might counter to say, china taxi often have wife and
              gf sitting inside so whats wrong. but the irony of that situation
              is, they are there to help ensure the safety of their husbands and
              bf who are the TDs! their presence is also some sort of an
              assurance to the outside customers that this is a legitimate taxi
              with a proper TD system!</p>
              <p>to TS, on the other hand, in times of need and when theres
              urgency and theres no other available transport, then your family
              member has to start to weigh or narrow down his or her priority.
              which is more important to him or her: the destination or the
              journey? if its the destination, then once boarded, there shouldnt
              be complain because the journey has already been accepted the way
              it is. if journey is also important, then shouldnt board at all.
              just wait for the next available ride. case close.</p>
              <p>hope what i say wont offend anyone in particular. just my own 2
              cents.</p>

              <p>Cannot lah. Sit at home mum will nag. Wife will nag. So must go out jalan jalan. My friend also sometimes says I use the taxi for leisure and earn some pocket money and is depriving others of earning a living. LOL</p>
              <p>Aiya who ask the car to be so expensive. So it's more ecomonical to use my taxi as own transport, No need worries about road tax, insurance, servicing etc. Although paying more then a regular car but dun forget you save on depreciation if you change car every few years. I got a neighbour more solid. 9am send daughter to work, then go a few rounds come back around 12 noon same time with me. Evening go out again and come back earlier then me. Weekends completely not driving. Just change his sampan to new Sonata. That uncle more idle then me leh....</p>

              <p>My 2 cents on this thread.</p>
              <p>I can understand why hammer8888 is angry. His wife was not informed by the TD that he got a pax in front seat. This TD should inform the pax and ask if acceptable or not. This is basic courtesy. There is a saying, people who pay money are the boss. One must always treat the boss well. So hammer8888 got a reason for his anger.</p>
              <p>By then, I can also see the point of view from Mercab and BCL. Just live and let live. Driving cabs is tiring enough. Some more a sampan. Money is never enough. Unfortunately everyone is born with a different temper. Everyone reacts to different things.</p>
              <p>Just like hammer8888, my wife also kenna this once before. She also boarded a cab which already got a pax inside. She simply commented - like that also can ah? But neither me nor my wife got angry.</p>
              <p>But hor, I consider this cabby who fetched hammer8888's wife lucky. If a kwai lan pax took this cab with a pax. It is a simple matter for him or her to just alight and walk off without paying. WTF can this cabby do? His salah got repaid with another salah. Both equal out. You think the cabby dare make police report? Of course not. So my conclusion is this. Dont try this tactic as a cabby. Heng heng bo tai ji. If kenna bastard pax, it will be the last time he try picking up pax with a pax already on board without informing people.</p>

              How to prevent GHOSTS from entering my taxi? 
              
              I'm a free thinker. I dun put or place any "Toa Peh Kong" mini-statue, "Fu" or lucky charm or any blessed objects inside my taxi. My taxi is completely empty other than a box of tissue paper and air freshener.
              
              Let me relate a few incidents -
              
              (1) I picked up 1 male Chinese pax after midnite at AMK hub unofficial taxi stand near S11. His destination is a semi-detached house at Yio Chu Kang. As we r abt to reach his house, he told me "Uncle, there's sometin I must tel u b4 I alight. If not, I wil feel very uncomfortable." He told me tat b4 he boarded my cab at AMK hub, he can see a small n very young Chinese girl with long hair sitting at the back of my taxi. I can remember very clearly tat b4 tat pax boarded my taxi, he was smoking n he lok at my taxi in a strange manner. As I was the 1st in queue, he boarded my taxi n sat beside me in the front. After he alighted at his house, I also smoke with him n he sweared tat he did not lie to me after I asked him several times not to joke with me. He said tat he have "yin-yang" eyes n he can see ghosts very often.
              
              (2) I picked a male Chinese pax ard 3pm at Jln Besar n he was sitting at the rear. Also jus as he was abt to reach his destination at CBD area, he told me all of a sudden! "Uncle, jus now I feel tat there's sometin inside yr taxi." He begun 2 explained to me tat even though he cannot see it, but he can "feel it". He then told alot of temple n medium stuffs which I tin r true.
              
              (3) Another 2 times, my Malay paxs on 2 different trips told me tat sometin is nt rite abt my taxi n it's gives them a eerie feelin.
              
              I tin there's no reasons or benefits 4 my paxs 2 lie 2 me. Also there's no way they can gang up n tell me lies. Any bros here can recommend any blessed objects tat I can put inside my taxi 2 ward off ghosts or bad luck? Also I believed many other bros have ghosty encounters too. U like 2 share?
              
              
               16 Jul `10, 5:14PM 
              
              
              
              .
              
              also i heard from bus drivers tat at certain bus-stops, esp on the last bus, they can always see ghosts. their colleagues also see ghosts inside the buses on many occasions. actually everywhere n anywhere in tis world, there r ghosts, even in broad daylight...........
              
              some of the ghost stories i heard from my paxs made my hair stand! there r also many of my paxs who ask me "Uncle, i heard u all taxi drivers have alot of ghost stories 2 tell, pls share leh"
              
              7th month Hungry Ghost festival is also around the corner..........

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Walan not that I do not believe you. But I never saw ghosts before. I never once had a pax who commented that they saw ghosts inside my car. Maybe next time I should ask for permission to spend one night inside a dead man's smashed beyond repair comfort taxi at level 4 in loyang? I heard got many ghosts there? Once I went there and asked the white haired abit gila gila security guard downstairs if I can drive up and see if there are any ghosts at level 4. He told me cannot and get lost because against company policy. :)</p></div>

KNN that time I very scare leh. Dunno what to do. When reach Lim Chu Kang Road just pass the junction suddenly she ask me pull over.
