              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span><em>Should Singapore do away with traffic lights and signs, in a bid to rid the roads of virulent bad driving?</em><br><br>Counter-intuitive
               as it sounds, such a move has borne results. In the Dutch town of 
              Drachten, removing street rules and directives resurrected road users' 
              "ability to be considerate", reported the late traffic guru Hans 
              Monderman, co-founder of the "naked streets" initiative.<br><br>In 
              recent months, concerns about unsafe driving habits here have been in 
              the spotlight, following the two Rochor Road junction crashes and a 
              string of cyclist deaths. Just this week, Law and Foreign Minister K 
              Shanmugam's Facebook post on his own close brushes broached the 
              question: Have our driving habits become worse?<br><br>More fundamentally, why?<br><br><strong>IS IT CONGESTION?</strong><br><br>One
               could blame road congestion for fuelling the impatience manifested in 
              annoying traits such as tailgating, cavalier honking and lane-weaving. 
              Or it may be that there is "too much construction with confusing 
              diversions", as one respondent to our poll said.<br><br>But there are 
              other cities with worse traffic snarls, like New York, Bangkok or Ho Chi
               Minh, yet seldom does one witness the aggressive "retaliation" seen 
              here. <br><br>Private driving instructor KC, who frequently travels to 
              Jakarta (another city with perpetual jams), said drivers there are a lot
               more "civilised" even though traffic conditions are much worse. "As 
              long as they can brake in time and there's no accident, it's okay. They 
              don't speed up and show you the middle finger just because you (honk) or
               move into their lane," he said.<br><strong><br>ME FIRST</strong><br><br>Rather, many drivers interviewed by TODAY feel the problem is a self-centred attitude behind the wheel.<br><br>Full-time
               national serviceman Josh Lim, who holds a driving licence and cycles on
               roads, said there is a sense of "what's mine is mine", hence the 
              reluctance to give way. "It's about 'I want to get home first' or 'get 
              off the roads because you don't belong here'."<br><br>Another private 
              driving instructor, who declined to be named, said he frequently 
              encounters drivers who speed up when they see his students signalling to
               switch lanes. "Just a few seconds' difference, but cannot. Maybe they 
              think it's 'lose face'."<br><br>Ms Joyce Phua, a private tutor, added that "sometimes it's easier if I don't signal".<br><br>Ironically, being sticklers for the letter of the law could be causing us to throw manners out the window. <br><br>"If
               you hit someone from behind, you are at fault straight away; doesn't 
              matter what the driver in front did," Mr KC said, adding that there are 
              no explicit laws against bad habits like not signalling.<br><br>Some 
              agree it makes drivers almost "self-righteous", citing the example of 
              road hogs who don't give way when they see that other cars want to 
              overtake. "They think they don't need to give way just because they are 
              not doing anything 'wrong'," said banker Andy Lim, 29.<br><br>The knock-on effect? A frustrated driver may retaliate.<br><br>Cabby
               Tan S H, 48, recalls one incident when the driver behind began flashing
               his headlights furiously from "at least 100 metres away". And just as 
              Mr Tan was about to give way, the car swerved and passed him on the 
              left, the driver gesturing menacingly.<br><br>He then cut back in front 
              of Mr Tan's taxi and started "braking on and off until our speed was 
              about 60kmh in the first lane", the cabby recalled. "I almost knocked 
              into him a few times."<br><strong><br>STICK OR MORE CARROTS?</strong><br><br>Several of 
              those who commented on Mr Shanmugam's Facebook post on Monday, like 
              Adeline Wong, feel that "enforcement is seldom seen nowadays". 
              Businessman Tay Seng Quan said this makes errant drivers bolder as 
              there's a belief that "getting caught is a low risk".<br><br>"After some time, people 'monkey see monkey do', so you get more bad driving habits," said the 53-year-old.<br><br>TODAY
               asked the police about this perception of fewer traffic cops on the 
              roads but they were unable to comment by press time. Singapore Road 
              Safety Council Secretariat Senior Manager Mark Chow, however, pointed 
              out that "traffic police can't be everywhere all the time".<br><br>Other than the calls to step up enforcement or make penalties stiffer, are there out-of-the-box solutions worth pondering over?<br><br>Recruitment
               specialist Jacee Liau suggests rewarding good behaviour instead. 
              Although motorists currently enjoy rebates to their insurance premiums 
              for every consecutive year they do not make claims (up to 50 per cent), 
              this "reward" does not directly encourage good driving habits or 
              gracious behaviour.<br><br>There could be "mystery" traffic cops going 
              around year-round, spotting "model drivers" and rewarding them with 
              "merit points", the 28-year-old suggests. When a driver accumulates a 
              certain number of points, he gets a cash reward or a rebate on the road 
              tax.<br><br>The difficulty to this idea, obviously, is the huge deployment of manpower resources.<br><strong><br>MANDATORY REFRESHERS</strong><br><br>Businessman
               Eng Yi Yuan, 29, suggested lowering speed limits on expressways during 
              peak hours, citing how the speed cameras along the Kallang-Paya Lebar 
              Expressway tunnels "work wonders". "When everyone is stuck at a lower 
              speed, no one is in a position to get into accidents. There's no 
              excessive acceleration, so no sudden braking."<br><br>Another oft-made 
              call is for periodic refresher courses, as driving instructor KC noted: 
              "Very often, you see that the serious accidents involve seasoned 
              drivers, not new ones. So it's not a skill problem, but complacency."<br><br>Some
               still feel more emphasis should be placed on new drivers: Make it more 
              difficult to get a licence, and have a yearly re-assessment by the 
              traffic police for the first three years.<br><br>Mr Eng said drivers 
              should be made to sit through a lecture before they can renew their road
               tax. "You show pictures of traffic accidents in the past year, analysis
               of how inconsiderate driving leads to accidents, and interviews with 
              victims saying how their lives have been affected," he said. "You might 
              not be able to influence everyone but it should improve things."<br><br>Other
               discourteous driving habits, such as road-hogging by slow-moving or 
              heavy vehicles - often driven by foreigners - should be addressed. Some 
              feel that those holding foreign licences should re-sit the driving test,
               rather than be allowed to convert their licence by passing a basic 
              theory test.<br><br>USE VIDEO FOOTAGE<br><br>As more car-owners are 
              installing mobile cameras in their vehicles, one view is that the 
              authorities should consider a whistle-blowing channel. Making sure any 
              driver can "weed out" bad hats would keep most on their toes.<br><br>Still,
               there are those like accountant Betty Lim who feel that 
              "self-regulation" is the only way. "Until we become a country that 
              appreciates tolerance, no amount of fine or demerit points will change 
              the way we drive," she said. <br><br>Indeed, as the Drachten experiment -
               since replicated in several European cities, including Ejby, Denmark; 
              Ipswich, England; and Ostende, Belgium - shows, "common-sense" driving, 
              by way of friendly gestures, head nods and eye contact, could be most 
              effective.<br><br>Unsafe could be safer, as Mr Monderman put it: "The 
              many rules strip us of the most important ability - the ability to be 
              considerate. The greater the number of prescriptions, the more people's 
              sense of personal responsibility dwindles." While it would be unfeasible
               to roll out such an urban experiment island-wide, perhaps a pilot in a 
              small neighbourhood could surprise us with its results. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com">TODAY</a></span></p>
