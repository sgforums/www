              <p>In life, you win some, you lose some.... But, in this case, you lose a bit but stand to gain a lot.  For Friday, even if you just drive from 6 - 11pm, $30 rental is nothing.</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Thanks for your comments... But I am facing one problem here... I am currently working on a 5 days week and therefore on Friday ... that means even I take over the car but can only start driving from 6 pm onwards..... to 10 ~ 11 pm.</p>
              <p>That means I need to pay at least $4 for parking the car over at the carpark at my workplace....</p>
              <p>Thus my Friday earnings to me is just to cover for the half day rental + parkings for the next 3 days at my house  HDB carpark.....</p>

              that driving part time and full time is very much different.. like
              my relief who only drive for me saturday full day, he already feel
              quite sian liao.. if he were to drive full time, i think he would
