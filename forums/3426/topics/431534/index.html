              <p></p>
              <p>Any comments !!!</p>
              <p><a href="http://motoring.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20080106-43801.html">http://motoring.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20080106-43801.html</a></p>
              <p>
              </p><p>AS MR A.L. Tan's cab comes into sight, an A4-size handwritten sign on his dashboard is what a potential passenger will see first.</p>
              <p>'Not 35% surcharge peak hour', it says.</p>
              <p>He has resorted to waiving the surcharge after last month's cab fare hike.</p>
              <p> 'I used to make up to $130 during peak hours,' said the cabby of 15 years in Mandarin. 'Then the customers were scared off and I couldn't even make $10!'</p>
              <p>Cabbies complain that passengers are disappearing during morning and evening rush hours. What used to be a $2 flat surcharge for travelling between 7am and 9.30am, or 5pm and 8pm, is now calculated as 35 per cent of the metered fare.</p>
              <p>A passenger travelling from Ang Mo Kio MRT station to Choa Chu Kang's Lot 1 Shopping Centre pays about $14 outside peak periods. Slap on the surcharge during peak hours and the fare is now $19.</p>
              <p>Although cab companies are optimistic that the recent fare changes will raise drivers' incomes, cabbies themselves are not so sanguine.</p>
              <p>Most of the 20 cabbies The Sunday Times spoke to say that passengers are more receptive to the 30-cent higher flag-down fare, but baulk at paying the peak-hour surcharge.</p>
              <p>Of the 10 passengers The Sunday Times spoke to, seven said they now avoid taking cabs whenever possible, especially during peak hours. The others said that they still take a cab at least once a day.</p>
              <p>Property agent A.C. Yeo, 54, said she now takes the train to work instead. A cab ride from her Bishan flat to her office in Toa Payoh used to cost her $6.50 during peak hours. Now, it has gone up to about $8.</p>
              <p>To encourage more passengers to catch taxis during peak hours, some cabbies such as Transcab's Mr Tan have come up with their own strategies.</p>
              <p>Comfort cabby B.P. Pang, 52, is giving out discounts together with his business card in the hope of increasing his passenger base.</p>
              <p>For a $27.40 trip from Tampines to Cecil Street, including peak-hour and Electronic Road Pricing surcharges, Mr Pang charges his passenger $21, giving him a 23 per cent discount.</p>
              <p>He usually gives discounts only to customers whose fares exceed $20, in the hope that they will call for his cab in future.</p>
              <p>'I used to get at least six customers during peak hours, now I don't even get two,' said the cabby of three years in Mandarin.</p>
              <p>Comfort cabby Jack Ng, 47, admits to touting at bus stops for potential passengers. Down goes his windscreen as he drives by and yells out: 'Taxi, taxi, no surcharge.'</p>
              <p>He said in Mandarin: 'Many people have turned to buses and trains since the fare hike. So I try my luck at bus stops and tempt them with my cheaper fare, without the surcharge.'</p>
              <p>Even with his new tactic, Mr Ng says he takes home about $80 a day, a 30 per cent dip from before. But he is optimistic that business will pick up as more customers are asking for his phone number and calling him when they need rides.</p>
              <p>Sales manager Maria Woo, 35, for example, has become Mr Ng's regular passenger, ringing him for a ride during peak hours. She takes a cab at least five times a day for business meetings.</p>
              <p>'He doesn't charge me the 35 per cent and the on-call charges, saving me up to $65 a week!' she said.</p>
              <p>Asked if it was legitimate for cabbies to offer customers discounts, a spokesman for Comfort, Singapore's largest taxi operator, said that cabbies are essentially their own businessmen.</p>
              <p>She added: 'It is their prerogative to give discounts to their customers should they so desire.'</p>
              <p>While some cabbies are fighting the passenger drought, others are using the lax period to take longer breaks at coffee shops.</p>
              <p>SMRT cabby S.K. Tang, 50, said: 'Driving around looking for passengers is just costing me more diesel.'</p>
              <p>Comfort cabby D. Ghing, 60, said cabbies are now trying to 'out-drive' each other for passengers.</p>
              <p>'Customers are like Hollywood stars now - one passenger flags, four cabs will zoom in,' said the cabby of 25 years. 'It's a dog-eat-dog world here.'</p>

              <p><br>eg if u are at Hilton Hotel .... for the cabby , i just drive straight into Lucky Plaza , i got that $3 City CBD surcharge .</p>
              <p>Hilton ? $0 surcharge .</p>
              <p>Now u know why Fireice cabbies treated her transparent ?</p>
              <p>Yup that $3 trick .</p>

              <p>As for Fireice call Comfort hotline for a cab .</p>
              <p>Very hard , why ?</p>
              <p>Booking fee $3.50</p>
              <p>Comfort levy $0.50</p>
              <p>Levy's GST $0.07</p>
              <p>Cabbies' nett income $2.93 .</p>
              <p>Some Comfort cabbies prefer go Lucky Plaza picked that nett $3 paxes .</p>
              <p>If i were Fireice , i will call Silver .</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>
              <p>Silver now got $0.50 fuel surcharge , plus $3.50 booking fee , they very hungry for bookings . Any bookings will do .</p>
              <p>Silver cab do not need to pay Call Levy , what they get from paxes , is 100% profit , unlike that phui taxi company .</p>

              <p>A reminder to Singaporeans , we cabbies actually do not favour too much that 35% peak hour surcharge .</p>
              <p>Some are with it , many do not agree on it .</p>
              <p>A bit out-of-date , but refresh a bit .</p>
