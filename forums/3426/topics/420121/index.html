              <p><br>Taxi is also part of the car population to be control under the COE, perhap it will be better for Taxi to be categorise on its own, like Taxi COE, that can change as per demand of taxi on the road, and  our rental will also change with it, because COE was low, people gain from buying car, but taxi hirers still paid the fix amount, that is not flexible. For today, COE is high, as a taxi driver, I gained because people will forgo car and take public transport that include Taxis.</p>
              <p>And in the news you heard that less and less L learners are taking up driving licence, and those driving instructors are looking to change jobs, so are those new car salesmen, some will loose job soon, and most properly, become TD, cos they hardly can go on with another similar job at mid age, nor does other companies want them since our govt love young foreigners so much.</p>
              <p>I believe there will be a surge in hiring market for taxis, firstly, there will be more and more new intake, secondly, as the population age, more will come in to take up this trade, thirdly, the outlook for taxi driving is attractive and good provided you work hard, cos we have a good economy and improvement in tourism. You can even sense it, after so much advices from us to tell newbies not to take up as hirer, they still go ahead and be one, cos they want to secure it and think that relief is not stable.</p>
              <p>For 25,000 taxis, we will hv 50,000 active drivers including the reliefs, and if 100.000 are preying to become one, all taxis will be out, and taxi companies will be very happy, they will start to apply for more taxis. For us, already a taxi drivers, be it relief or hirer, we may need to beef up our discipline and hold on to our trade more firmly, cos if you have a few thousands on the waiting list, any wrongdoing, the taxi companies will not hesitate to terminate us to get a nice young newbie.</p>
