              <p>It all depends on the amount of good connecting trips i get inside cbd if i were to decide to pay and go in</p>
              <p>For example i get an advance booking inside cbd abd the next destination is also in cbd..</p>
              <p>So why not pay? Its all depends on situation for me.</p>

              <p>I agree, every trade got its own set of hardships. Maybe your trade is not listed in sgforums. So why not go in and create a forum for your trade and complain there if you want. If you do not like to complain! fine.</p>
              <p>This is Taxi Driver forum. A place where taxi drivers come in to discuss or complain as you like to call it, about their problems.</p>

              <p>From the respones I gather here, the $3 CBD surcharge is just to
                  compensate or reimbursed TD in a limited way after deducting all
                  the ERP charges from them which can ended up usually more than
                  that.</p>
              <p>For the earlier part (5 to 8pm), this surcharge may ot be even
                  enough to over the cost of the ERP and drivers still have to endure
                  high traffic and long queue and what takes only 3 mins to get to in
                  other time slot, might takes up to even 5 times to get to the
                  pax.</p>
              <p>With this, is it still worth it to enter the CBD zone at this
                  time or as Poolman says, he can easily get the total net worth of
                  his meter reading just queueing at LOT1 cos no ERP deductions.</p>
              <p>That's the purpose of my thread cos if this is so, the $3
                  surcharge the government is "giving" us doesn't work to bring taxi
                  in at that time when it's most needed.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, after 8pm, more Taxi are available as no ERP
                  charges by that time and the TD can get the maximum value of that
                  "reward" for coming in. This make it worth the while for coming
                  in.</p>
              <p>The current scheme only serve to re-imburse TD, not fully, for
                  the lost, I am thinking a incentive might works better.</p>
              <p>Because of my more relax working habit, I used to enter the CBD
                  around 7.30 or 8 but lately because of "money no enough" I start
                  work a little bit earlier and instead of getting motivated by
                  "early bird catches the worms" or higher earning, I really get
                  pissed off by so much ERP charges which in the end, ended up
                  LP-PL.</p>
              <p>Now I just ply on the outskirt or wait to find pax to pay for my
                  ERP charges.</p>

              <p>Bingjames , u weren't in the trade yet to realized the importance of that 8pm to 12mn cbd surcharge .</p>
              <p>Just make it simple ...... what will happened if now , cbd do not have $3 surcharge ?</p>
              <p>The cbd will be like a town with zombies for taxis after 8pm .</p>
              <p>The 8pm city surcharge was implemented to encourgae drivers to serve those people inside the cbd .</p>
              <p>Back in the early 2000 , til 2008 , there weren't any $3 , the demand for taxi was so big ... call also no taxi one.</p>
              <p>Complaints after complaints ..... we cdg drivers just want call only , no call no take one .</p>
              <p>Others ? No perks , they dun come in one </p>

              <p>i think i am one of the newest drivers here and the least qualified to offer any insights onto the TS's point.</p>
              <p>Its true that TS point does act as a "not so desirable" incentive to go in to the CBD for booking calls.  I have been analysing the points:</p>
              <p>You have to go through many gantries that may amount to more than $3 - I thought for the booking to come in, you should be in the vicinity and likely that you have already passed some if not all the gantries (either via touring around or via previous passenger drop offs?).</p>
              <p>Besides, assuming you paid $3 to go in, in the end you get $3 CBD surcharge + $3.30 booking + Meter Fare, isnt that a good deal? even if you breakeven and dont earn any CBD surcharge and get $2.30 as booking fee (loss of $0.70) for a ready passenger just on the next few streets, is not so bad at all also right? or would you rather drive around with uncertainty and loss diesel and time?</p>
              <p>seriously, if it was me, i wont mind just driving nearby to pick up and loss/gain abit of $ rather than tour around and waste time and diesel and maybe end up even no passenger for the next 20 min.  Of course ideally is our previous passenger brings us in the ERP and bears all the charges and we soon soon take a booking nearby and hit jackpot but it doesnt happen this way all the time.</p>
