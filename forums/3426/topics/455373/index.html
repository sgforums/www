Go Jurong Point see see crowd, havent reach Taxi stand one guy pop out of bush stop my Taxi, drunk indian guy, then suddenly one more friend come in taxi, say go Kian Teck, lucky i know the place, nearby so ok lah .</p>
              <p>Half way driving then think wah jia lat what if kena rob at Kian Teck there. Reach there lucky nothing happen they pay and go.</p>
              <p>Dunno where to go next so just drive Yew Tee, pinoy couple stop me ask go AMK ave 5, lucky know. </p>
              <p>Total $30+, go home liao cos need to wake up early go buy season parking.</p>

              <p>Then try go town, slowly drive from Boon Lay Way minor road all the way, missed 2 passenger cos cannot see! Then realise i never wear my contact lens! At night a bit blur!!!!</p>
              <p>Ok nvm drive slowly, must remember buy contact lens next day. After mifdnight, Bay View Hotel pick up couple go Sembawang. Then drive slowly down Upp Thomson Road go back town, Thomson Rd pick up one go Bukit Batok. Drive back town check out where all cabby go queue. Near Somerset pick up couple go Bukit Batok then Pioneer Mall. Then go home, think better get contact lens then drive next day.</p>

China Man don't know english so much. He say Tampines. I say, WHAT?? he say, Tampines St 41, scared wrong info, i on my phone GPS show him the road name. He confirm.</p>

              <p>Go Harbor Front, very quite thought call it a night, near Alexandra pick up 2 Myanmmar guy go Kian Teck, just nice after that can go home. Drop them, end up pick up 2 gerls one go Bangkit then the other go Woodlands CheckPoint, stay johor. First time go checkpoint, taxi stand got many queue up also ah!</p>
              <p>Decide must go liao, put busy go Toh Tuck pump gas wash car, go back..</p>
              <p>OMO not easy to earn for newbie, must be discipline and start early. I bit busy in day doing other business, so 9pm-4am only enough cover rental and fuel, wash and maybe $20-30 profit</p>

              <p>Sorry i think I got lost here a bit.</p>
              <p>TS is saying he is a hirer, correct?</p>
              <p>TS is also an OMO hirer, right?</p>
              <p>TS hirer, OMO, start only at night, and start only from 9pm onwards until maybe morning 3-4, correct?</p>
              <p>So if this is correct that means TS is only driving to cover rent and use vehicle as tpt for self?</p>
              <p>Of course there's nothing wrong, but I do find it strange to do it this way. Why sacrifise so much of sleeping time to do this, plus when you gotta work in the morning? </p>
              <p>Is is good for health? Either way if seeking for profit, starting at 9pm for night relief is already very touch and go, usually very difficult to cari makan, to start at 9 for OMO, that's really stretching it very far.</p>
              <p>Just my point of view</p>

              <p>At night he takeover from 8pm and drive rental til 12mn , go home sleep .</p>
              <p>All because Merc rental $123 , diesel cheap .</p>
              <p>Taxi morning hard to get , expensive .</p>
              <p>CEO expensive to buy a car .</p>
              <p>All in all , he lost $40 everyday , but considering morning sent so many people , worth it .</p>

              <p>LTA and their bright ideas again. Sounds very nice on paper, but is it workable in reality and for a majority of TDs?</p>
              <p>If must have 2, who is gonna take responsibility as the hirer? Who to sent the car for service, repairs, etc? Who is gonna be in charge of paying rental?</p>
              <p>Who gonna cover rent when 1 party is sick, on holiday, etc? Why should the burden fall on the other driver for the 1st driver problem?</p>
              <p>How to set the timing? How to find partner that is likeable and able to work together? Is LTA fonna force hirer to take reliefs that cannot gum or vice versa? Or what if still cannot find, some stay ulu place, not many drivers available. Like that how?</p>
              <p>Where to keep and send the vehicle? Why should 1 driver have near at home, and the other must travel if both party have equal rights as joint hirer? </p>
              <p>What if really cannot, will taxi company be happy to collect only 1/2 rental from 1 driver? Of course not. </p>
              <p>I dunno, got so many things to draft and plan, I think is just a another fanciful plan the LTA staff think of to please their bosses and the Minister, so it looks beautiful on paper. They get a promotion for this, the shit is forced on us and later the whole thing is scrapped after a few months or dies a natural without further mention.</p>

              <p>CNG should be fine for me, beacuase I hardly hit 300km daily, except weekends close or slightly exceed, and the few dollars differences between CNG and diesel can buy the conveniency of owning the car fully really interest me, but I have to find a discount card for the petrol. I'm really tempted to take up the 2.0 Wish, but the way Transcab handle things really hold me back from making the commitment. Really a tough decision to make.</p>
              <p>Just another stupid question: How would you compare the car performance between 2.0 Wish to Sonata? </p>
