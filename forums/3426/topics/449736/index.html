            <div class='col-md body'><p>Took a call this morning from Upper Changi to AP. But the pax says ask me detour to Bayshore to pick up something from someone. I tell pax I got other engagement so very rush for me. Then when we reach Bayshore there are a few empty cabs waiting at the taxi stand. I propose to pax why not they hop on another cab to continue their journey and I dun charge them the fare but they refuse. I dun understand why as they are not in a hurry and there are other cabs around that area. Will you take another cab in this kind of situation? For me I will as I know the driver is in a hurry and I am not being short charged and still save on booking fee so is a win win situation for both parties. Just feel the pax is being inconsiderate and do this on purpose to me.</p></div>

              <p><br>eh no, problem does not lies with the amount being cheaper anot... because if some audit very tight de will kenna...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>becoz from suppose from Point A go Point B then Point C... They have a rough guage of the cost... If receipt amount is too far off from the amount, then it will be abit hard to explain... Some companies de audit realy like to pick problem with ppl but then again, it's part of their jobs &gt;__&gt;</p>
              <p>and of coz, possible that some boss just like to find problem... "Taxi fare got so cheap meh?" then will start to find problem -___-</p>

              <p>Took a call this morning from Upper Changi to AP. But the pax
              says ask me detour to Bayshore to pick up something from someone. I
              tell pax I got other engagement so very rush for me. Then when we
              reach Bayshore there are a few empty cabs waiting at the taxi
              stand. I propose to pax why not they hop on another cab to continue
              their journey and I dun charge them the fare but they refuse. I dun
              understand why as they are not in a hurry and there are other cabs
              around that area. Will you take another cab in this kind of
              situation? For me I will as I know the driver is in a hurry and I
              am not being short charged and still save on booking fee so is a
              win win situation for both parties. Just feel the pax is being
              inconsiderate and do this on purpose to me.</p>

              <p>Calls is best for those on OMO, they got all the time to play around, they are also good for early morning advance calls</p>
              <p>For those with shift type, 2 hrs before closing, better dun mess with calls, put on change shift, stop and ask is a better option. Everytime get angry or frustrated over calls, rushing to change shift or against time for other personal appointment, it can get your blood boiling at high pressure, in days, months and years to come, take care</p>
