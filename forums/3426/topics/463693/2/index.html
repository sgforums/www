              This reminds me my first day after collected keys to my brand new nissan taxi (nice no.). Felt quite excited ..like taking my first motorbike on the road after getting bike license. After a few trips landed near Ap so head to Q, happen to choose T2, was driving slowly looking for Q then saw arrivals sign. Proceeding to pickup point,, then got horn by taxi behind n later complained to taxi guide.. The taxi guide shouted go and Q and point the way out.. I asked where to Q ar..The taxi guide just stared at me in disbelief and just keep pointing the way out..lol,,
              Later turned round to Q at t1 (easy to find) and found out from other TDs the T2 Q..
              '
              At end of day, wanted to have a nice no. to record in log book ,, keep circling round my area until mileage read 388.. hahaha. Those TDs at nearby taxi stand wondering why keep seeing this taxi?? lol
