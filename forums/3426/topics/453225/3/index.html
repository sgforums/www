              everything. PRdriver do not worry you are not alone, i around for
              some time, slowly learning and finding up things but i keep to
              myself becasue i know most singaporeans cannot accept outside
              competition. my advse to you from my expirence, if you allready
              driving license go change to here first, then go apply for citizen
              if you can, then take up taxi license not cost to much and can easy
              they will give many tips to help you pass even if you not sure
              english. dont be stop by others talk, let them enjoy their own, you
              earn your own nothing wong. i call luckytaxi becasue when i first
              start work here moor then 10 ears ago, everything was nice then
              things start to go down and down until now i have great difficult
              finding work even with all my certicates. then i was lucky i appeal
              my citizen approved last second and my family ask me try taxi. so
              far now i can feed my family and pay for own house so do not
              dscourage so fast. if you have pr means you shall be here no one
              can force you go</p>

              <p>sometimes PRs are taking advantage,they got nothing to lose applying for PR status,it's a means to safeguard themselves if they get sack or if they want to job hop!or even can apply for citizen and then think driving taxis can make a lot of money,then they will try their luck!after that if things do not work out ,they can always convert back to their own citizens again!eg.China sportsmans like badminton,ping pong.even Indians they can have dual citizens.another eg football players one fr Brazil and one fr Croatia.all go back already!they have no intentions of settling down here permanently!</p>
