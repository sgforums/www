              <p>Giving all you have might not be a good idea, especially when you mention that you dunno those who are involved and you are only visualising. Worst still, u even mentioned that it doesn't concerned you so u can just blabber and if ppl dun like it just bed the comuter screen?</p>
              <p>Giving opinion and advise itself is a skill, giving the right advice, at the right time, to the right person, at the right place certainly need more than sincerity and helpness which I presume you are offering.</p>
              <p>As an example, after Poolman put this post that the whole thing in settled, just what u mean by "tree fall monkey run"? Who is the tree u refering to and who are those monkeys? Or are u using a wrong senario?</p>
              <p>If the whole thing is already settled, why is there a need to bring up the Prime taxi example? Are u suggesting that Bob should be like the other taxi group boss and axe all the the "trouble maker"? that's why tree falls and monkey run?</p>
              <p>This post to me is really not only unnecessary and posted at very bad timing and really in the league of being a "shit stirrer" cos everything settled liao, u dig up again. If this post comes before the one Poolman posted, it might be read in a different light.</p>

              <p>That's the "gees" of the whole story. U not real. Thinking that u can hide behind keyboard and "talk cock". If you think you can do that and get away with it, you are dam farking wrong man. This forum is meant for real people talking about real things in life and their work and now we are having a real problem that needs real people to give real ideas to solve it and not to talk cock and un-related stuff here.</p>
              <p>I am glad u remember me and my absence is felt. Me hiding? I login in sgforum everyday for this past year and never missed reading a single thread. I dun post because i dun want waste time increasing post count, almost 4000 post in half a year, most of them talking nonsence and yes- you are right - trying to act like a teacher.</p>
              <p>It really takes alot of effort to think and put up a quality, constructive and responsible post that I will be answerable at anytime, anywhere and I will standby to it and not asking people to bend their computer screen if they dun like reading.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">So you mean at any point of time, a thread need to close for </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">seek</span><span style="color: #3366ff;"> of closing?........</span></span></p>
              <p>Quoting your word, with yr England like the above, (btw, did u actually meant "sake"), besides the grammatical error, I really dun understand what this sentence means and the relation to this post or thread - any of you guys know?</p>
              <p>With such powderful England, 4000 post in 6 months is a "real" achievement in itself.</p>
              <p>Still dare mess up with me? Bet u get Poolman to close the thread. U think he will do it for u?</p>
              <p> Anyway, it's your limited comprehension of the English language that leads you to what you are now. I already stated that you are not the one I am talking about and we are on the same camp, trying to convinced Poolman against the idea  and there you are barking at me, I dunno for what? Obviously you dun really understand English!</p>
