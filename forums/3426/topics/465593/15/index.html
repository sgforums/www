              <p>Hi, welcome back and welcome in</p>
              <p>Before I proceed, perhaps what message are you trying to say in your this interesting picture?</p>
              <p>are you saying that I am also<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">å¼ºè¯�å¤ºç�†? or I </span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">è¶Šæ��è¶Šé»‘?</span></p>
              <p>or for that matter <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; color: #333333;">æ²‰é»˜æ˜¯é‡‘ or </span><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; color: #333333;">æ— å£°èƒœæœ‰å£°?</span></p>
              <p>as a moderator from the Limo forum and a very distinguish and highly respect forum member here, I look forward to your comment or even lecture but I expect more substance from you rather than this beautiful picture with "no head, no tail" for just name calling.</p>
              <p>As the saying go - <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">æœ‰ç�†èµ°ç‰‡å¤©ä¸‹. every of my post here is subject to people's scrutiny.</span></p>
              <p>A few questions first Mr Limo Mod, but think properly before you answer cos whatever your answer is also being view by yr limo group and the general public and your reputation and standing is at stake.</p>
              <p>1. Is it this sgforum's rule that LV matters are not supposed to be discussed in?</p>
              <p>2. Is there any provision for exception?</p>
              <p>3. Is the role of a moderator supposed to police the forumers here? Not only that was not done, he was even the instigator and chief attacker in this case right?</p>
              <p>4. As erigo said it and u quote his post from there, does the fact that photos of the LV22 posted on his very own facebook give this moderator the right to publish here and exposed him as well as his personal details? I thought forum also got a rule of "no personal attack"?</p>
              <p>5. When he heard that Poolman might give way, he can post comments that "even poolman give in, I will still go". Isn't that really "shit stirring" at it's max and it comes from the very moderator who is supposed to ensure the best intergrity of this forum</p>
              <p>Everything stated here is in black and white. Did I accuse him of doing something that he didn't?</p>
              <p>One thing is certain, 100% of the members here, including myself should agree on , I <span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">ä¸�ä¼šå�šäºº, I dunno how to go with the flow, but is there any untrue or false accusation in what I said?</span></p>
              <p>So for that matter now, where do u stand and what is yr objective?<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">è›‡é¼ ä¸€çª�? Oops! you are a mod, at least must give u some respect.</span></p>
              <p><span style="border-collapse: separate; font-family: Helvetica; line-height: normal; border-spacing: 0px; font-size: medium;">å®˜å®˜ç›¸æŠ¤? You are most welcome to take stand for whichever side but please - let whatever comments you made - make sense and be worthy of the respect I had in you. I am sure you can do better than the Pot/kettle pic right?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Btw, did u really read through all 14 pages to comment or you just "bark" randomly?</span></p>
