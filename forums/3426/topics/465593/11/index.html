              Looking at exchanges between BJ/RBS cud not resist saying something:
              
              
              Good England not an issue here,, this is afterall a TD forum, most can still understand whether grammatical/spelling correct or notâ€¦ more important is the content.
              
              
              Difficult to de-link forum and real-life. Forum is just another form of communication like discussing on talkie/phone (without so much costs). If the ppl  u r communicating with includes ppl you knowâ€¦ how not to mix with real-life? If completely de-link real-life and forum why spend so much time and thinking/feeling in the posts tat I see? 
              
              
              On the topic, not appropriate for me to comment as LV outsider but now that the dust seemed to hv settledâ€¦say wat I tot lahâ€¦Iâ€™m also in the camp of those saying its not worth to put so much on-the- line, at stake... for a small fry. But the decision was aldy made (n he knows best) and seems cannot be persuaded to changeâ€¦so those lending support (see also they are directly affected â€œvictimsâ€�) shud not be categorised as shit-stirrers.  
              
              
              Not all tcss posts lahâ€¦who don tcss one? No tcss where got fun? Somore RBS is tcss thread starter lehâ€¦just be need to be bit sensitive to those unable to "escape" TD lor..hahaha

              <p>That's the "gees" of the whole story. U not real. Thinking that
              u can hide behind keyboard and "talk cock". If you think you can do
              that and get away with it, you are dam farking wrong man. This
              forum is meant for real people talking about real things in life
              and their work and now we are having a real problem that needs real
              people to give real ideas to solve it and not to talk cock and
              un-related stuff here.</p>
              <p>I am glad u remember me and my absence is felt. Me hiding? I
              login in sgforum everyday for this past year and never missed
              reading a single thread. I dun post because i dun want waste time
              increasing post count, almost 4000 post in half a year, most of
              them talking nonsence and yes- you are right - trying to act like a
              teacher.</p>
              <p>It really takes alot of effort to think and put up a quality,
              constructive and responsible post that I will be answerable at
              anytime, anywhere and I will standby to it and not asking people to
              bend their computer screen if they dun like reading.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">So you mean at any point of time, a thread need
              to close for</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">seek</span> <span style="color: #3366ff;">of closing?........</span></span></p>
              <p>Quoting your word, with yr England like the above, (btw, did u
              actually meant "sake"), besides the grammatical error, I really dun
              understand what this sentence means and the relation to this post
              or thread - any of you guys know?</p>
              <p>With such powderful England, 4000 post in 6 months is a "real"
              achievement in itself.</p>
              <p>Still dare mess up with me? Bet u get Poolman to close the
              thread. U think he will do it for u?</p>
              <p> Anyway, it's your limited comprehension of the English
              language that leads you to what you are now. I already stated that
              you are not the one I am talking about and we are on the same camp,
              trying to convinced Poolman against the idea  and there you
              are barking at me, I dunno for what? Obviously you dun really
              understand English!</p>

              <p>How real am I?.........you never know........some forumers over here got my contact number, ask them how real am I lor...... to meet or not to meet is very subjective, I had enough of friends and kakis driving taxi, today I just lost another friend of mine, CDG Mercedes driver, 8x5 Steven Sng, pass away this morning in sleep.........Very sad........last week another CDG Mercedes driver 6xx2 also surrender his IC........at my age, knowing lesser friends is better.........I'm happy some newbies find new friends thru this forum, driving taxi cannot be alone 1, but do I need to make new friends again?

              <p>If Poolman really locked this thread, than episode end, we move on.......if remain unlocked, everybody still got the right to put in their post.........pardon me if my England really that bad, that make you think that I'm asking Poolman to close the thread, you jiak pa liao, since when I ever beg Poolman, I always ask Poolman don't lock, don't lock, ended up, he always locked........<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></span></p>

              <p>You want quality thread to participate, taxi forum might not be suitable for you.........I highly recommend News Discussion Lounge forum, you can go put in all your powderfull England and who's know, someone might be clapping and cheering for you..........</p>

              <p>I felt this thread is very good discussion material. It highlight on the problems of those taking calls and then unforseen circumstances came in.</p>
              <p>Like u got a sudden stomach upset that u need to go or a sudden accident or traffic jam that prevent you from performing the task.</p>
              <p>In fact, if you think LV problem is not permissable here, you can change the title to a more general one as most ppl taking calls, be it company's or LV's also got such problems.</p>
              <p>Is there a more humane way for the call station to handle such issue instead of suspending?</p>
              <p>I myself got this similar issue when I first started. Got a booking and I got half an hour to reach there. From my calculation, I should have enough time. The Zero5 private me and ask if I can do it in time and suddenly I hesitate and become unsure.</p>
              <p>Then, just to be sure the customer get to be served on time, I asked him if can get someone else to do it. Before he even get to do that, the first time he mentioned was that he had to suspend me. I was like "WTF, i just making sure the pax got the best service and do I deservce that?"</p>
              <p>Then I said, nevermind, I do it myself. and I did it, 10 mins to spare too.</p>
              <p>Since then, I make it a point, never be such a good guy, never report even if u cannot do it. Either get yr kaki to do it for you or die die just do it. After all, late u kanna suspend, report u also kanna suspend, might as well fight till death, there is still chance if u try instead of giving up.</p>
