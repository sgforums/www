              it was other LV68 member that saw "live" of what no.22 was doing

              but because he believe poolman was a nice person and feel that poolman don't deserve 
                  
              to be betray by no.22 doing, so LVxx was trying so hard to ask me for kopi as LV68
                  
              want to talk to me about what no.22 was doing my back which lead  to request me

              maybe some forum member may feel it is LV internal problem
              
              but i believe with member having a clearer picture, than comment would be more fair
              
              today, i never bother to check about no.22 still inside LV or not
              
              cause time will tell about it. 
              
              only surprise, the very early victim, LV425 still no sign of him yet.  maybe he has fire
              
              enough in the early thread, no more bullet liao.
              
              ever wonder the earlier thread why he so hot on no.22? because he already kena by
