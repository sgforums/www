              Dear Seniors... Found this ad from EBAY.... Under search key taxi... Looks like someone wants a piece of our cake... But is this legal...?
              
              YOUR SHOPPING WHEELS FESTIVE SHOPPING PERSONAL DELIVERY
               
              Seasons Greetings!
               
              But first, the bad news. With the recent taxi fare hikes and the unreliability of our aging MRT system, not forgetting the steadily-increasing population thatâ€™s jamming up all our transport systems, the days of serious planning to avoid wasting unnecessary time and money travelling from point A to point B seemed imminent.
               
              We, at Your Shopping Wheels, aim to provide a cheap and hassle-free means of home/locations delivery for your festive shopping after a tired dayâ€™s of shopping in town when getting on the sardine-packed MRT with your bags of bargains seem like a nightmare with not a cab in sight! And when you finally flag one down, the whole year-end sale appears to be a cruel joke when all the savings you enjoyed only moments ago are sucked away by the fare hikes, peak hour/holiday surchargeâ€¦
               
              At just a call away, weâ€™ve a modest fleet of 2 vehicles at your disposal; a spanking clean and new Fiat Doblo passenger van with a 3m x 2m storage space and a sleek Mazda RX8 Sports with a 2m x 1.5m boot space. To ensure the original condition of your purchases when they reach your destination, itâ€™s important to have accompanying passenger/s throughout the journey and so, weâ€™ll throw in a complimentary ride home for you! And now, the good news. Our equally-modest flat ratesâ€¦

              <p>This pirate taxi driver needs to meet our nightmare paxs. Those merlion type lah, those fare runaways. Since he operate pirate taxi, we should encourage and tell people that they should just engage their service, and walk off after the trip. No need to pay him. What the fuck can he do?</p>

              <p>Lta wheels turn slowly on some cases but others can be quick. I used to work for a registered pvte limo that ferried pilots for their training courses amongst other duties. Suddenly 1 day this trips stopped, a smart alec driver decided to start his own service and for lesser price. Within a week after my boss complained, LTA made 3 ambushes for them, they escaped but were called up and told in no uncertain terms, if caught they would be charged in court and expect to lose their licenses, because no insurance coverage for these type of services without LTA approval. Vehicles also willbe impounded and may or may not be seized depending on circumstances of the case and the court's decision.</p>
              <p>I like this Shopping wheels service. New Fiat van - Not PZ, nice. Mazda RX8 - power.</p>
              <p>Will look great at the LTA pound at Tuas West, side by side near the sea somemore!</p>

              <p>If they are indeed registered as Private Limousine companies.... there are little we can do about it....</p>
              <p><strong>Only issue is the insurance policy</strong>.  If they are only insured by the private car insurance, not the commercial ones, than, they can get their ass kick.</p>

              <p>Dear Seniors… Found this ad from <span>EBAY</span>….
              Under search key taxi… Looks like someone wants a piece of our
              cake… But is this legal…?</p>
              <p><span>YOUR SHOPPING WHEELS FESTIVE SHOPPING PERSONAL
              DELIVERY</span></p>
              <p>Seasons Greetings!</p>
              <p>But first, the bad news. With the recent taxi fare hikes and the
              unreliability of our aging <span>MRT</span> system, not
              forgetting the steadily-increasing population that’s jamming up all
              our transport systems, the days of serious planning to avoid
              wasting unnecessary time and money travelling from point A to point
              B seemed imminent.</p>
              <p>We, at Your Shopping Wheels, aim to provide a cheap and
              hassle-free means of home/locations delivery for your festive
              shopping after a tired day’s of shopping in town when getting on
              the sardine-packed <span>MRT</span> with your bags of
              bargains seem like a nightmare with not a cab in sight! And when
              you finally flag one down, the whole year-end sale appears to be a
              cruel joke when all the savings you enjoyed only moments ago are
              sucked away by the fare hikes, peak hour/holiday surcharge…</p>
              <p>At just a call away, we’ve a modest fleet of 2 vehicles at your
              disposal; a spanking clean and new Fiat Doblo passenger van with a
              3m x 2m storage space and a sleek Mazda <span>RX8</span> Sports with a 2m x 1.5m boot space. To ensure the original
              condition of your purchases when they reach your destination, it’s
              important to have accompanying passenger/s throughout the journey
              and so, we’ll throw in a complimentary ride home for you! And now,
              the good news. Our equally-modest flat rates…</p>

              us today, but save us in your phonebook, just in case. Or drop us a
              <span>SMS</span> enquiry.</p>
              <p>We accept bookings from 6pm to 1am from Mondays to Fridays and
