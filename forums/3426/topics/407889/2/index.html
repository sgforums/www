              <p>I am surprised that the Taxi companies dont do more to educate taxi drivers on what is the procedure like for such instances and how or what the taxi driver can do with regds to this.</p>
              <p>Simply put into layman's term for easy understanding, when a customer goes up into a cab and gets driven to a destination, it is a service provided by the driver/company whatsoever and a fee has to be paid upon arrival of destination.</p>
              <p>Lets say, you go to a restaurant, due to some disagreement with the pricing or some unhappiness with the service rendered, you refuse to pay. What do you want the police to do? Arrest you for what?</p>
              <p>The taxi companies cant be bothered to brief their drivers about such issues and the avenues that they have to lodge a complaint? Oh wait i forget, they just sit down shake leg and collect rent for their vehicles.</p>

              <p>first of all,if i were that policeman i would knock on door despite protests from hotel staff.i would simply brush the hotel staff aside and question lost tourist.</p>
              <p>after that i will corelate on tourist info with taxi and taxi company on the spot.</p>
              <p>if all tallies well...i will arrest tourist for cheating.and if hotel staff  makes noise...i will arrest them also for obstruction of justice.</p>
              <p>if a tourist murderer killed someone and ran into that hotel....i wont stop at the receptionist just cuz the folks at counter said no admittance.</p>

              <p>The cabby lady posted some comments on the incident. This is one of her comments she put which i like to verifty/share with our bros here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>The police I.O. in charge did called me few times today but because of
              new legislation laid down in January 2010 as what the District Judge
              had told me, it was the LTA's empowerment for non-payment of taxi fare
              issue.
              <br><br>On LTA's policy, taxi company should tried all attempts to claim
              the taxi fare from passenger for the taxi driver. Upon exhausted on all
              attempts, then taxi company to write in to LTA, only then LTA will take
              actions from there.
              <br><br>For all the above paper procedures, approvals, etc. etc, how long
              will it take? If passenger local, ok fine but when passenger is a
              foreigner, why can't police have the authority to pursue the case in
              such situation? Since you laid down such legislation but why so vague?
              Not only I feltd helpless but the I.O. in-charge too.
              <br><br>I.O. wanted to help me very much but because of all the so called
              proper procedures, limited authorizations and the new legislations
              laid, had made this pursuit difficult for the Police.</em></p>
              <p>Wah... is it really so difficult just to collect our rightfully fare with these "smelly leg paxs"??</p>

              <p><br>I think the TD had already apologise to the ang mo on using the hp. To me, once you apologised, you admitted your mistake, and that make you become a prey for the ang mo or any other pax. If you read probably, that lady driver keep apologising, as tho she is kowtowing to the ang mo, that makes the ang mo look more greater. My suggestion is that, unless you are really wrong or offended someone, then apologise, dun anyhow apologise to something that you did not do wrongly, because once you apologised, you admitted your mistake, and the laws look into it.</p>
              <p>The TD driver is not smart enuf, must had been scared by the ang mo outrage, need to stay cool, dun need to apologise, just ask for the fare to be pay, if he said that she used the hp, tell him that is another issue, please paid your fare, if you want to complain about my hp incident, you can complain thru my company.</p>
              <p>For the police, if you give them a statement that you apologised to the ang mo for using the hp, the police will put it in a way, that in the first place, you are wrong, and being wrong, you are now trying to recover your losses, which they dun really give a damn.</p>

              <p>The cabby lady posted some comments on the incident. This is one
              of her comments she put which i like to verifty/share with our bros
              here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>The police I.O. in charge did called me few times today but
              because of new legislation laid down in January 2010 as what the
              District Judge had told me, it was the LTA's empowerment for
              non-payment of taxi fare issue.<br> <br> On LTA's policy, taxi company should tried all attempts to claim
              the taxi fare from passenger for the taxi driver. Upon exhausted on
              all attempts, then taxi company to write in to LTA, only then LTA
              will take actions from there.<br> <br> For all the above paper procedures, approvals, etc. etc, how long
              will it take? If passenger local, ok fine but when passenger is a
              foreigner, why can't police have the authority to pursue the case
              in such situation? Since you laid down such legislation but why so
              vague? Not only I feltd helpless but the I.O. in-charge too.<br> <br> I.O. wanted to help me very much but because of all the so called
              proper procedures, limited authorizations and the new legislations
              laid, had made this pursuit difficult for the Police.</em></p>
              <p>Wah... is it really so difficult just to collect our rightfully
              fare with these "smelly leg paxs"??</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Quoted for the truth.</p>
              <p>At least the cabby made an attempt to understand what the procedure is other than blaming the sky and sea for everything on earth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So why do taxi companies not educate their drivers more on how the procedure is? Still no answer to this question.</p>

              seykai, your comment is totally uncall for... what you mean by
              
              "no wonder, most people here got no taste, most dun even know how to use fork and knive, doubt they even got table manners...."
              
              As a member of this forum, esp the Taxi Drivers Thread, I for one felt insulted.... 
              
              Believe an apology from you is appropriate........ since you are one "with taste, know how to use a fork and knife and got table manners"......
