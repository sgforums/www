              <p>STOMPer <strong>Celine</strong> was shocked when a Caucasian man who boarded her cab refused to pay the
              fare. The passenger was apparently frustrated that the STOMPer was
              talking on the phone while driving.<br><br>The STOMPer claims that she
              was talking on her hands-free set and even helped the passenger load
              his luggage inside the taxi boot.<br><br>Celine recounts this unpleasant incident:<br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">On 11 August 2010 at 9.32am, a Caucasian man boarded my taxi from Changi Airport Terminal 3 to go to Changi Village Hotel.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">I helped him load his luggage inside the boot all by myself. He didn't offer to help even though I am a woman.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">During the journey, my handphone rang.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">As
              it was an urgent call, I apologized to the passenger and told him that
              I needed to answer this call but the passenger kept quiet. </span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">After which, I answered the call on my bluetooth hands-free set.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">At Changi Village Hotel, I again assisted the passenger to unload his luggage.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">At
              this point of time, he grabbed his luggage and shouted that he will not
              pay the taxi fare as I was on the phone throughout the journey.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">Despite
              my countless apologies and explanations, he continued to insult me and
              refused to pay the taxi fare of $13.80. Thereafter, he walked into the
              hotel to check-in.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">Shocked by his actions, I called Comfort and the police. I informed him that I had called the police.</span><br><br>"The passenger <span class="Apple-style-span">mentioned arrogantly that he had "no time for my nonsense" and left. </span>T<span class="Apple-style-span">here was nothing I could do to hold him back.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">Police
              arrived and approached the hotel staff to enquire about the passenger
              but they said they were unable to help without a written letter from
              the police. </span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">Traumatized
              by the incident, I proceeded to file a police report. However, I was
              told to lodge a complaint at the Subordinate Courts, who in turn
              directed me to go to the Land Transport Authority and Comfort.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">I spent the entire day filing complaints and seeking redress but  nobody helped me, just because he was a foreigner.</span><br><br>"<span class="Apple-style-span">Where’s the justice?"</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

              <p><br>Ya, you and me and all of us pay Gst, pay bills, pay taxes so that our police force get well paid, and look at how they protect us??</p>
              <p>Even if you cannot get excess to the hotel room, at least request the reception to make a call to the person to come down for questioning, i believe the police have that right. This type of chao ang mo must teach them a lesson, fare is one thing, but on principle dun treat us like free stuff. If we dun get to the bottom of this, bet this chao ang mo will go back his country and boost that to everyone there that singapore can get free taxi ride..just make some noise and act tough, you get free taxi ride.</p>
              <p>What do you expect from aussies, history said they are decendent of British prisoners.</p>

              by credit card when he reached Changi Airport. I told him that I

              <p>I could understand his frustrations but I have already
              apologised to him and asked him to check with his wife if she has
              some SGD $$ since he is meeting her at the arrival hall. In the
              end, pay with a $50 note.</p>

              <p>Nothing the hotel staff can do without official warrant from the police. It's not like they can go to the room and drag the ang mo down. It's the same that police cannot just come into ur house and search ur stuff just because some stranger accuse u of stealing his stuff.</p>
