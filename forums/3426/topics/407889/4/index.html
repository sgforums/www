              <p>Yes we cabbies must deal with free loaders who refuse to pay fare. However be aware of this commonly used tactic on cabbies, hawkers and spas.</p>
              <p>At the end of their taxi ride, or after finish makan, or after a massage, they simply walk off. As if nothing had happened. This tactic is ALWAYS applied on those who service customer first and ask for payment later. They like to target those who provide 100% service only kind of jobs. That means you cannot accuse them of theft as no physical object was removed.</p>
              <p>I can tell you from experience, that if you are the nice nonviolent kind of person, these cheats will love you and keep targeting you.</p>
              <p>The only effective method is really to hammer them if they refuse to come back and pay. The cheat is running off. You call police also no use because the person is gone and you got no proof of the crime. Yes beat them up, since this kind of pax always operate alone. Always be ready to unbuckle seat belt, lock up taxi and give chase within 3 seconds.</p>
              <p>It gets tricky if you are a male driver and the cheat is a young sexy lady. I leave it to you to figure out how to deal with this situation. Nice cabbies will get one black eye after another if they keep fetching this kind of pax.</p>
