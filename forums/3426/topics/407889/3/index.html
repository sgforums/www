              <p>my line is - if people dun even know how to use their tools to eat ( in this case, driving a taxi for their livelihood) and have the appropriate attitude in making their living.</p>

              <p>Firstly, can you define ignoble for me?  Sorry, I'm not very well education, hence my England not powderful.</p>
              <p>(Ok, above is a joke.  But, I really don't know what ignoble means until I check up dicktionary.com. <strong>Thanks</strong> for teaching me a new word today. I meant it.)</p>
              <p>Secondly, I feel you are being very harsh to Celine when asking "can't taxi drivers chit-chat on
                                          the phone when no passenger on board.?"  It was reported:</p>
              <p><strong><span>"As it was an urgent call, I apologized to the
                                          passenger and told him that I needed to answer 
                  this call but the
                                          passenger kept quiet."</span></strong></p>
              <p>Hence, if the passenger is not happy about it, he can voice it out then.  He's just being a (forgive me) <strong>bastard</strong> by just keeping quiet about it.</p>
              <p>I don't know what is your job function.  Let's just assume that you work in a office.  What if one day, you're in a meeting and someone related to you called from the hospital.  (I'm not cursing you.  Shit happens.)  <strong>I would love to hear you tell your manager that the person in the hospital can wait, while you stayed to finish your meeting.  Afterall, that's your job and you're paid to attend the meeting.</strong></p>
              <p>Let's be sympathetic towards Celine.  In my opinion, the only thing that she erred is trying to provide a good service by helping an ang mo unload his luggage, despite being a lady herself, even before collecting payment.  I don't even want to suggest that he's got a big body frame and perfectly able to unload his luggage himself, although that's most possibly the case.  In fact, even before the handphone incident, which occurs after they left the airport, the ang mo already displayed his attitude by not even offering to load his own luggage at the airport. </p>
              <p>What happens to the "Ang mo are gentlemen" image?</p>
              <p>Ok, I don't really like to get into the flame bait between you and Donsan (I think)... but your arguing for the sake of arguing without checking the facts is really... "Major Face-Palm" moment...</p>
