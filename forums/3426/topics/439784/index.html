              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;">Subj:     Revenge
              On A Cabdriver (S17, S611)</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;">         
              From Scott's Joke Archive on 5/31/97</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;">      and
              From: gattica30 on 9/26/2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> A successful businessman flew
              to Vegas for the weekend to</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> gamble.  He lost the shirt
              off his back, and had nothing</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> left but a quarter and the second
              half of his round trip</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> ticket. If he could just get
              to the airport he could get</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> himself home.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> The businessman went out to the
              front of the casino where</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> there was a cab waiting. 
              He got in and explained his</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> situation to the cabbie. 
              He promised to send the driver</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> money from home, he offered
              him his credit card numbers,</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> his drivers license number,
              his address, etc. but to no</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> avail.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> The cabbie said (adopt appropriate
              dialect), "If you don't</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> have fifteen dollars, get the
              hell out of my cab!"  The</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> businessman was forced to hitchhike
              to the airport and was</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> barely in time to catch his
              flight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> One year later the businessman,
              having worked long and</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> hard to regain his financial
              success, returned to Vegas</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> and this time he won big. 
              Feeling pretty good about</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> himself, he went out to the
              front of the casino to get a</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> cab ride back to the airport. 
              Who should he see out</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> there, at the end of a long
              line of cabs, but his old</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> buddy who had refused to give
              him a ride when he was down</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> on his luck.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> The businessman thought for a
              moment about how he could</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> make the guy pay for his lack
              of charity, and he hit on</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> a plan.  He got in the
              first cab in the line, "How much</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> for a ride to the airport,"
              he asked? "Fifteen bucks,"</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> came the reply. "And how much
              for you to give me a blow-</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> job on the way?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> "What?! Get the hell out of my
              cab."  The businessman got</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> into the back of each cab in
              the long line and asked the</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> same questions, with the same
              result.  When he got to his</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> old friend at the back of the
              line, he got in and asked</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> "How much for a ride to the
              airport?"  The cabbie replied</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> "fifteen bucks."  The businessman
              said "ok" and off they</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> went.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> As they drove slowly past the
              long line of cabs the</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> businessman gave a big smile
              and thumbs up sign to each</span> <br><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier;"> driver.</span></p>
