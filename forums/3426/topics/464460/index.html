              <p>Ya loh never chop him also. If got money problem say loh. Want to pay me installment say loh. What I tulan is the attitude. In the first place he cham siong with me says $120 I will take it. Not says this says that. Offer me ridiculous amount like $80. I not beggar ok. Min $120 cos that's what TC charge for bumper damage. Waste my time talking to him. People is like that one lah. Talk nicely no use one. Must $*#&amp;$%@# come out then scare. If private car I sure chop. Anyway I show pic to TC accident department this one can do 100% claim. No need to put money for excess. Incentive not affected.</p>

              Ya...seems only cdg or ntuc insurance hv anything to gain... or they need yr report to help the 1st car's case? or there's injuries in behind cars? need more witness ? then they are wasting yr time.. I wonder wat can they do if u insist on not reporting?
              
              Just some weeks ago, I was involved in a 4 car pile-up AP towards Tuas on PIE near P Lebar exit. It was downslope and suddenly jam infront... one yellow taxi hit my back side and I almost hit front car...there was no injuries... so reported company since private settlement not possible with so many cars involved..
              
              One week later... received letter from TP asking me to make a report at nearest NPP... I think my passengers made a report to claim behind taxi (they mentioned it but I thought they were joking),,, so need my report as sort of witness... I also wonder wat can they do if I don wan to waste time and report? My veh rear bumper was only slightly dented and their luggage are those hard-casing type...I think the jerk is even less than aircraft baggage handling/landing...knn wan to claim??

              thks this a good link, but I see its said that all accidents shud be reported to police? I remember this revised to only report to police when hit and run, damage of public properties and injuries involved... 
              
              Then for private settlement also hv to report to insurers? I hv never reported private settlement cases to co/insurers.. maybe need to change?
