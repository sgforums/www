              <p>I am new to cabby.sgforum.com. Through this informative forum and so many supportive Lau jiao here, I've decided to try my hands a being a relief TD.</p>
              <p>However, lately I've seen quite a number of unnecessary remarks from people I've not seen lately but with amazingly high number of post. And somehow the friendliness environment in the forum is being disturbed. If this is going to carry on, we will see good supportive people to start leaving this forum as it will create more tension being here.</p>
              <p>Is it possible to keep it the way that only TD and those TD wannabes are allowed to post here.The rest just read only. Because there's no point in letting some teenagers ( i think they are that age) spoil the bond created in this forum.</p>
              <p>After reading some of those post, I felt they are just arguing for the sake of arguing. Not constructive criticism. So I proposed that for new registered person, before they post, either they provide TD details if not, post is not entertained.</p>
              <p>Will it work this way?</p>

              <p>U can private message Poolman. He is sort of the operation guy for the LV member <strong>in this forum only</strong>. LV is quite big and there are many other branches (I think from what I have gathered).</p>
              <p>To answer Samuel Lee, I believe this forum can be tweak for closed members to viewing only. It largely depend on the owner to see how he want to run the forum.</p>
              <p>To rock star, you have put forth a good idea. However, I think it is also fair to say on the part of TD, we need to make adjustment too. In a forum where pple talk, usually 2 parties decide to take it a little too far.</p>
              <p>By closing the current forum to public, I feel that it reduce both the interaction and the abilities of new drivers to fully appreciate the situation they will be facing.</p>
              <p>We can certainly make one closed forum for TD only, but that will take some settings. Building a community takes time. TDs alone cannot make a good community as we will be segregating ourselves from reality and the public. Though the public at large do not fully understand our plight, I think it is fair to say that some of their concern has some ground given how TDs behaved in the past.</p>
              <p>I hope this forum can be a medium to share with the public the problems and thoughts TDs have in their mind. And thereby make them more reasonable in the future when they board a taxi.</p>
              <p>This forum need to be tweaked. I have the experience on forum and community managing. You can go to the forum I used to moderate long long time ago. <a href="http://www.sghalflife.com">www.sghalflife.com</a> and <a href="http://www.sgdod.com">www.sgdod.com</a>. I am no longer involved in these 2 websites. But u can see tweaking the forum is not a difficult thing to do.</p>

              <p>Hi Mr TD La2534,</p>
              <p>Your comment on non - TD to make replies actually is actually an advantage to TDs.  From Pax on view, we love to share our opinions ( eg. your thread on Marina IR surcharges, I am the 1st to reply and give you my views ).  As Taxi is a mode of Public Transport, many readers (non-TDs) of the Forum are also interested the daily discussion that could understand the operations and potential difficulties the cabby may face.</p>
              <p>Of course not all replies to the TD thread are positive.  Some merely gave a reply to criticize TDs when they have not been<span style="color: #0000ff;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the shoes</span></span> of  the almost 48,000 drivers ( given that assumption that all taxi has 2 drivers on 2 shifts ).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Sandisct</span></span> - pls learn to ignore some replies of the thread (even some TDs reply may sound idiotic) which may be childish &amp; ridiculous.  ( if i am not mistaken, only above 30 of age can be a cab driver.. some of the forumers here are in their teens ).</p>
              <p>If you take it to heart ( then i advice you not to come in at all - do you no good )... Always take the good with the bad... Some pointers may be a good advices, some not(but if the negative remarks are proven and outstanding problems - then try to improve on it), but at the end of the day - the Forum may enlighten your views and possibly get to know some Forum-friends.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
              <p>Passenger of TD.</p>

              <p>Hi Mr TD La2534,</p>
              <p>Your comment on non - TD to make replies actually is actually an advantage to TDs.  From Pax on view, we love to share our opinions ( eg. your thread on Marina IR surcharges, I am the 1st to reply and give you my views ).  As Taxi is a mode of Public Transport, many readers (non-TDs) of the Forum are also interested the daily discussion that could understand the operations and potential difficulties the cabby may face.</p>
              <p>Of course not all replies to the TD thread are positive.  Some merely gave a reply to criticize TDs when they have not been <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the shoes</span></span> of  the almost 48,000 drivers ( given that assumption that all taxi has 2 drivers on 2 shifts ).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Sandisct</span></span> - pls learn to ignore some replies of the thread (even some TDs reply may sound idiotic) which may be childish &amp; ridiculous.  ( if i am not mistaken, only above 30 of age can be a cab driver.. some of the forumers here are in their teens ).</p>
              <p>If you take it to heart ( then i advice you not to come in at all - do you no good )... Always take the good with the bad... Some pointers may be a good advices, some not(but if the negative remarks are proven and outstanding problems - then try to improve on it), but at the end of the day - the Forum may enlighten your views and possibly get to know some Forum-friends.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
              <p>Passenger of TD.</p>

              <p>As long as we take it in a positive light, those negative comments can let us think how to improve our service.</p>
              <p>Of course I am not perfect. I tell off pax when I am fustrated. I get angry too. But all in all, I still think wadever being said here will help more.</p>
              <p>First it tell normal pax like u how unreasonable some pple are. 2nd these kind of pax gives us ammo in the forum to vent our fustration hahahahahah</p>
