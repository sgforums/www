              <p><br>Why, u so interested in cdg crown, I hear say first batch only reserve for those old crowners, you go borneo motor, it is parked inside their 2nd floor car park, but you need to have some business inorder to go in, what you can do is either wait for it to come out, or you act like buying car, go toilet then slip up 2nd floor to have a peep, you will be surprise to see toyota Axio on trial for silver too, then you can also see toyota camry on trail with red TC too. why?</p>
              <p>Last year, toyota make the biggest lost in their car sale history, one of the key point is the taxi market, the china is using VW, HK crown will soon be changing in VW as per their motherland china, malaysia is using their own product, the  proton saga or nicked png tan sa kua, Indonesia using all old vehicle, australis an NZ using holden, the horse. and recent 5 years period in singapore, almost all nearly all taxis had been using korea make cars, most popular sonata, magnetis, epica, i30 and also german make VW and merc.</p>
              <p>So, what is toyota going to do???? cut down the price lah, if you buying car, go toyota or peugot, $12,000 discount now, at least can offset your COE</p>

              <p>Waiting list now 3 to 4  months for new sonatas, there is still no news on new crown, only on trial, ON TRIAL&lt; do you understand what is ON TRIAL.??</p>
              <p>Previously, toyota was very proud of their product, they will the top car sales for decades, I once went to purchase Altis and you can see the sale guys dun even want to entertain you, just give u a pamphlet and said, all prices here, no discount, as for features, you can take the brochures and read it, once confirm, then come to me.</p>
              <p>Then I ask them, I want to trade in my old car, they tell you, they do not do trade in, so no choice, I go over to mazda at former Asia motor, got a nice sale guy who even order meepok for me when I told him I am hungry, so I bought the mazda 3.</p>
              <p>Due to their arrogancy, they might fail to see the on coming Korea car market, from Kia to chevrolet to hyundai, not only that, in my marine work, big marine engine are now a joint venture between koreas and europe, from B&amp;W Hyundai to caterpillar Kia and roll royce with samsung electronic control, now where are the Japonese??</p>
              <p>With a CEO on board in Japan, today, you see a different toyota, they will be out there to give a fight with the koreans, so, that is why they invited taxis companies to trial their vehicle, TRIAL ONLY ok.</p>
              <p>As for the camry hybrid, the former proud toyota told cdg, if you want trial, you buy 2 and trial it yourself, we can give you engineering and technical support, but you need to buy it, there is no such thing as trial and not happy, give back. So comfort are stuck with the 2 hybrids.</p>
              <p>Now, toyota is different, very friendly, test drive also got free ben and jerry ice cream <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It is not so easy to say, change or buy a new taxis, the technical and engineering support, the infrastructure is also a very important key to note, it is not as easy as buying a thousand hybrid and let get it started, what will happen to their diesel dept??</p>
              <p>Where are they going to charge those hybrid cabs that take longer than just plain putting diesel??? Q up from bradell to hougang??<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Are those Ah tiongs at the workshop know how to service hybrid, or they need more skilful technican and engineer, new service workshop....all these are cost.</p>
              <p>That's why I said, look at thing from many perspectives, until you are damn fcuking sure, then, put it into perspective.</p>

              <p>These 2 toyota camry hybrid is already an asset of cdg, they had already bought it, got hirer and relief driving it, see so many times at Jurong island parking there to change ICs, since cdg had bought it, it is right for them to put up the fare structure to the public at large. Why? u want to drive it, call cdg lah</p>
