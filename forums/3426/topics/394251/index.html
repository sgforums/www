              <p>Go there, the Staff face like not welcome, black black one, they see you roll in, they keep eyeballing you, see where you stop, either they ignore you at first or come over ask in a harsh unfriendly tone, what you want!?</p>
              <p>If you go to washroom for a while, they will go there hunt you down (if theres one cubicle) and knock on your door to hurry you, not just once, twice also have. or if you are washing or cleaning up, they will come over in to beo what you are doing with an irritated, impatient glaze like prompting you to hurry up</p>
              <p>If you go to the station mart, they will keep eyeballing you, see what you buy, whether you buy a lot or just some. and then eyeball you somemore all the way to your vehicle. some might even sneer or mumble unfriendly words as you pass by</p>
              <p>i found out from a staff that this GREEN Petrol Station Chain is the only one NOT participating in some discount voucher promo that every other petrol station chain out there is involved, and she herself noticed that resulted in lesser customers somehow (now that she mentioned it, i realise actually i already noticed that most of the time they seem less crowded than other petrol station chains before this)</p>
              <p>i then asked is that why the other staff are fidgeting this and that and carry that lousy attitude because business is slowing for them, so they pick on "non-premium", "non-exclusive" customers, like taxis, that the management is fk up..she just looked paiseh and smiled</p>
              <p>after that, i told myself i will NEVER visit this Petrol Station Chain again. even if they give the best discounts in the whole world starting from tomorrow til the day i stop driving</p>
