            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I was around 21 and fresh out from NS looking for a job in 1994. Realising that I am just armed with an ‘O’ level cert and job opportunities are limited I decided to go for an apprenticeship with an engineering company for an ITE cert in NTC 2.</p>
              <p>The apprenticeship runs for 3 years and I was supposed to serve another year bond. I was earning a base salary of $600.Better than nothing. I also concurrently underwent an electrical engineering diploma course at SP on my own time and expenses. After completing my apprenticeship I was promoted to technician. My last drawn pay in this company was $1200.</p>
              <p>Around 2000, I left for another company with a remuneration of $2500. My post then was a project supervisor. Life was looking good for me and I was looking forward to receiving my diploma and a possible promotion. Alas my diploma came but the promotion no, though in all fairness to the company I did receive a slight pay increment. In 2004 I left for another company and drawing a base salary of $4000 as a project engineer. I was on a two year contract with this company and my contract was extended for another two years. I was very happy there and getting along nicely with everyone. Unfortunately in 2008 my contract was not renewed as the company claim that it had lost out on a major tender, though some of my foreign colleagues are still there till now.</p>
              <p>I started looking for a job after a few months break as I thought I need a break after working nearly 13 to 14 years. Still had some savings left.I am also not unduly worried as I had received my taxi licence a few years back. Till now I always think that this is the best course I had ever went to.</p>
              <p>As my skill developed over the years was specific and specialised, and with more than 10 years in the industry, I was quite confident of landing a job.Meanwhile I drove cab. I started applying for jobs in 2009 and received numerous offers. Duly I went for interviews. Nearly very company offered me a position. But none of the them can match my previous pay or at least be close to it. This is the latest two offers that I got $1900 and $1700 for the same position as project engineer. That was about 1 year ago. The reason they told me is that it is the market rate. What market rate? This is worse than a fresh poly grad. Then it dawn on me is also the FT rate. I gave up competing with them.</p>
              <p>I’ve got a mortgage to settle and a family to feed. I had given up applying for a job now. I am still happily driving my cab. Who says that Singaporeans are afraid of hard work.  So I don’t really know what is the govt talking about upgrading. I believe I had done my fair share of upgrading and my pay seems to be downgrading. What is that upgrading for? As you can see I am no slouch at following the PAP command of upgrading. Look at these records, NTC 2, diploma, construction supervisor cert and numerous other certs all obtained while working and raising a family. Just felt that my life and time had been wasted on all this nonsense course except the taxi one. This is just nonsense from the better, cheaper, faster minister who had been spouting the upgrading mantra.</p>
              <p>As the GE is coming, I have been thinking that if the MP comes to my house for visits, I will paste all my certs on the front door and ask him what is the worth of all these certs that I have worked so hard for. If he replies salary is based on market rate, I will then give him all my certs to be used as toilet paper.</p>
              <p>By the way, my Kaki Bukit ward had been moved from Marine Parade to Aljunied. Gerrymandering or not, I definitely know where my vote is going to. And I will still rather drive my taxi.</p>

              <p>My life story is the same as him. Like the writer I came from the construction background with a diploma from SP. Nowadays the Phinoys, Indians, Bangla and China engineers are replacing the Singaporean. I quit the bz 10 years ago and I am happy driving my taxi.</p>

              <p>My ah lau also has the similar background.</p>
              <p>He was a technician who studied part-time to get his mechanical diploma in SP and many others related ones.</p>
              <p>Then, they find his pay was too high but not the garmen ministers.</p>
              <p>Now, they say "market pay" is even worst the the FT's.</p>
