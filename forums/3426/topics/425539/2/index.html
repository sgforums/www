              <p>too many FTs doing what a average singaporean should do.</p>
              <p>They taking over average singaporean rice blow by offer cheap and below market rate salary as they can have this type of salary as they do not live in singapore forever.</p>
              <p>our money is big for them at home.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh said singapore need FTs for surviving? He better think twice, reason for our populartion go down is most of our own talent go oversea and never come back. some back is because of parents. why do some singaporean girls willing to marry to rich ang mo ? I ferry most of them with husband ang mo living a very good live. Later the ladies will go to back to the husband mother land.  </p>

              <p>NONE of my friends and i mean NONE are happy driving a taxi with the exception of one fella who proclaims he is happy , i really have my doubts coz if he is happy , he will just pick about anyone and anybody. No need to plan strategy , no need to do this , no need to do that coz happy wad? right? why think so much? pick also got $ mah right?</p>

              <p>Vote? This year me turning 49. Only ever voted ONCE in my lifetime. Half a century bro. Haven't announced date already won 75 seats. What can you do? Vote? This time round I really hope to have a chance to exercise my right as a SG Citizen. The MIWs really have to wake up. The whole top echelon of the garment is so out of touch with the reality on the ground, just seeing and hearing what the "dai-pau-wors" want them to see and hear. really like "the emperor's new clothes". NO, they don't see, only look. Don't listen, only hear.</p>

              <p>(4) The biggest group of foreigners buying ECs are Ixxxxxs.</p>
              <p>(5) The group with the highest average household income is Ixxxxx. (I guess our own guys are being pulled up by their cousins, as in 80/20 rule. Top 20% earning 80% of the group's income)</p>
              <p>(6) DBS Asia Hub's facade is black. (this one added for fun, actually not related, just to emphasize the above only)</p>
              <p>I wonder how many Singaporeans are working in DBS Asia Hub. Based on pax I picked up at (2), more than 90% of those going to DBS Asia Hub are Ixxxxxs (not local). I guess the locals have to make do with company transport. Luckily they still have company bus for our locals.</p>
              <p>So who headhunted whom for you-know-what post? What is happening to Singapore's biggest local bank? I don't see the same thing happening at OCBC and UOB. SM asked if we can react in the same way as the Japanese did if a calamity were to befall us, knn, half of SG's population would have fled back to their own country at the first sign of trouble. Loyalty? What price?</p>
              <p>The best part is that I picked up an ex-Ixxxxx National who is now a SG Citizen. He expressed those very same thoughts!</p>
              <p>What is happening to my Singapore?</p>
