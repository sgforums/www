              <p>With reporting space being limited in one of Singapore's major Newspapers on Sunday, she certainly chose the wrong article to work on. Finding out whether a particular taxi driver is a liar, does not deserve front page news in any country.</p>
              <p>In this report, she focussed on two taxi drivers, but only the 7k one has spoken. No news about the 6k one.Is driving a Limo really that profittable?</p>
              <p>You ask me whether I know about the pitfalls of asking reporters to use common sense. I ask you whether you know about the pitfalls and dangers if they dont?</p>
              <p>Are readers of Sunday Times News Paper in Singapore, expected to analyse each article in the papers, with the knowledge that the reporter might in reality be exposing a liar! Front Page News! somemore and space is limited! I think more likely news is limited.</p>

              <p>LoL.. u guys still arguing about this..</p>
              <p>I newbie, but when people despo for money, especially when 2 months no income and got mouths to feed anything is possible.</p>
              <p>During my TDVL course even the instructor say, how much u earn depends on how much you want to earn.</p>
              <p>Even his close friend achieved $10k gross before rental and fuel, but 15-16hours on the road, eat sleep inside the cab, 7 days a week for full 1 month just to clear some debts.</p>
              <p>Rental and fuel he never say how much so gross profit i will never know. But i guess $5k-$6k.</p>
              <p>If u guys believe everything a news reporter say then got problem liao. Be it TV or Newspaper, nowsadays it not about just telling the facts. Story must sell, i think third time liao i said that it's about sales.</p>
              <p>Even those lucky draw local newspaper hold sometime, u all think 100% pure luck someone win prize? Got some stuff that goes behind the scene, that decides who win, what race, what age group, that i can't discuss here.</p>
              <p>Those old bird here some say impossible, some say maybe possible. Old birds know where to find pax liao, but sometimes i realise i sweep anyhow those places most old birds don't go still got pax, most time old birds rest actually also got many pax. Taxi driving most of the time is about luck mah.</p>
              <p>That guy already explain his side, still kena Fxxx, u guys all above 30+ most here above 40-50, must not stress yourself so much.. People say stupid things, just smile and let it go lah, u know wrong ok liao.</p>
              <p>I last time before drive taxi also New Paper and Berita Harian interview, both 2 page article about something. Nothing is exactly as i said it, when they interview they just take important notes, then put it all together from what they roughly remember, editor remove stuff that he thinks not important, but sometimes those few stuff he remove make a lot of difference in the story. Few months after that then publish and inform me.</p>
              <p>Most of the pax last few weeks also say the guy talk cock, i don't understand how wives of TD can believe it's true..</p>

              <p>From my POV, taxi drivers eaning above 4k or more a month does not deserve front page news in any major newspaper in Singapore, unless the reporters are so hard up for news. These topics are best discussed online. Looks like some reporters think they can be good taxi drivers by rushing for articles sourced online(Just like how some taxi drivers rush for pax on the road). In the end....</p>
              <p>Since this is an article for a major newspaper in Singapore, must spice it up bit by saying only younger drivers can achieve this. Like this, might as well reduce the age you can apply for a  taxi licence loh! We can have more young taxi drivers. </p>
              <p>Singapore Law allows only those above 18 to obtain a drivng license. But only those above 30 and who have been driving for more than 3 years, can apply for a Taxi licence.</p>
              <p>Reduce all these age limits and we might have million dollar taxi drivers in Singapore. Makes sense or not? I don't know. </p>
              <p>There are so many things to write about taxi drivers to boost money for the papers. But most articles are a conflict of interest. So cannot publish. Articles like rental cost, where the money is going to, why taxis catching fire, etc....</p>
              <p>So what to publish? Taxi driver from road sweeper to millionare. This is my next article.</p>
