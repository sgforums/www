              <p>Eh actually hor, during course Instructor also got say TD like to compare mileage instead of total taking per day. He say those old timer usually can judge how much a person make by how many kilo(km) they drive assuming normal road sweeper, never idle, etc..</p>
              <p>Until now i don't know how the calculation work.</p>
              <p>But for myself i notice every 50km i minus 15km, for example:</p>
              <p>Total mileage 300km</p>
              <p>300km / 50km = 6</p>
              <p>15km x 6 = 90km</p>
              <p>300km - 90km = 210</p>
              <p>Then my gross taking $210</p>
              <p>So easier way to calculate 70% of my total mileage equals to my gross taking.</p>
              <p>300km x 70% = $210</p>
              <p>For myself that formula pretty accurate for my style of driving on normal days on Huat or OBK days different formula, but others i don't know ah</p>

              Newspaper like that one, they exaggerate headlines. Sunday paper not many buy, u can see news stands normally got many left. Only way to sell, put catchy headline on front page lor
              
              If put taxi driver earn $3k on front page everyone also never look or buy. 
              
              Don't really care about the repercussion, that one later then talk.
              
              End up everyone now think TD loaded, LTA enforcement surely won'tgive chance now, bloody TD earn so much sure can pay many summon, TP and parking attendant also won't give chance to TD liao. Go coffee shop people see you drive taxi sure charge more. Pax sure ask for discount, pax might even ask for loan since cabby all earn $6k-$7k.
              
              Cabby complain to media, then another good story to sell on Sunday

              <p>All i can say ..... yellow top , SMRT , smart , silver , transcab and cdg , will have different mileage against different collection each .</p>

              <p>Until now i don't know how the calculation work.</p>
              <p>But for myself i notice every 50km i minus 15km, for
              example:</p>
              <p>Total mileage 300km</p>
              <p>300km / 50km = 6</p>
              <p>15km x 6 = 90km</p>
              <p>300km - 90km = 210</p>
              <p>Then my gross taking $210</p>
              <p>So easier way to calculate 70% of my total mileage equals to my
              gross taking.</p>
              <p>300km x 70% = $210</p>
              <p>For myself that formula pretty accurate for my style of driving
              on normal days on Huat or OBK days different formula, but others i
              don't know ah</p>
