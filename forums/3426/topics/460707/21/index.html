              <p><br> This Belmont Lay really spoke our thoughts thru n thru, is he a
              cabbie or have family who are cabbies? Anyway his blog should be
              made sticky n highlighted for those non cabbies to digest. Another
              interesting pt to stir is pt 2 &amp; 3, this is wat u get when u
              employ foreigners to do a local's job (reporter). Most foreigners
              are simply not deep rooted enough to understand our culture n do
              things their way. I buy ST for news worthy material to read not
              some juicy stories. If I'm interested in juicy news, I'll buy
              WanBao ;) Since the four cabbies are sacked, how abt the journalist
              n editor?? I feel they did ST a great disservice by not reporting
              factual and misleading headline. Heads gotta roll......</p>

              <p><br> Bankers are all ponzi trained, buy, sell, use other people money to

              educated in this areas, specialise in it, so they know the in and

              will master it, if not kick your own ass.</p>
              <p>Like taxi driver, after a while, you know the in and out of it.
              So do not take them highly, they are there to bank your ass only.
              You buy, they gain fees, you sell, they gain fees, then got good
              lobang, they use your money to buy themselves, if win, they put
              back your money with the usual interest, if lost, they go take
              other funds to cover up, cover here and cover there, flow here and
              there,  money become like liquid to them. Welcome to Ponzi

              <p>A clever financial guy or business person will never use his own money, he only manipulate other people's money, and there are 2 types of peoples who are very good in it, one is the Jews, the other, the Indians. Asia basically like to get indian bankers, and for the west, the Jews.</p>
              <p>There are 2 types of start up in any business, one is thru IPO, the other is loan from bank, IPO, initial public offering needs to have a basic business in place, like breadtalk goes into IPO only after that can acertain that their business can work, bankers agreed, do a under writting for them thru banks and issue IPO, with funds from external, you buy, i buy, they can expand further.</p>
              <p>If you do not have basic business in place and wish to start a business, then you hv to borrow from banks, banks get their money from the public like you and me and loan it to you at a much higher interest, as such, you need to talk to the banks about your business plan.</p>

              <p><br>The truth is if begining no luck, you will not be a taxi driver, so, do not call it as luck, but rather a suction into TD trade.</p>
              <p>Same goes to gambling, notice when you first gamble, there is some luck, and that pull you in, after that, lost all the way, and then start to think of the begining luck and try again n again n again, then one fine day, go Bedok R.....and the rest is history, the only thing i know is that when my contractor call me, Siao eh..Bedok R, one uncle</p>

              <p><br> Me banker??, knn, everyday I get bangs from hirers, casket
              contractors, shipyard contractors, pax, govt until blur blur
              liao..more like banger than banker.</p>
              <p>A clever financial guy or business person will never use
              his own money, he only manipulate other people's money, and there
              are 2 types of peoples who are very good in it, one is the Jews,
              the other, the Indians. Asia basically like to get indian bankers,
              and for the west, the Jews.</p>
              <p>There are 2 types of start up in any business, one is thru IPO,
              the other is loan from bank, IPO, initial public offering needs to
              have a basic business in place, like breadtalk goes into IPO only
              after that can acertain that their business can work, bankers
              agreed, do a under writting for them thru banks and issue IPO, with
              funds from external, you buy, i buy, they can expand further.</p>
              <p>If you do not have basic business in place and wish to start a
              business, then you hv to borrow from banks, banks get their money
              from the public like you and me and loan it to you at a much higher
              interest, as such, you need to talk to the banks about your
              business plan.</p>

              are simply not deep rooted enough to understand our culture n do
