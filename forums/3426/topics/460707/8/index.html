              <p><br>Taxi drivers boasting (how lian) among ourselves is ok, like when you boast, we also know, just give face and let you boast, because we know most mid age guys love to boast here and there about their earning, their experiences and encounter. It is ok, as long as you happy, we happy, laugh and life goes on.</p>
              <p>But to be boastful in the public like newspaper, nets and forum, is a total diseaster, hokkien said, ya lan kar tao, "take own cock and hit own head."</p>

              <p><br>But at least get the right news, did not you see so many sueing on other papers by our govt, singapore is still very much non liberal in telling the truth, in its early days, govt banned so many papers, from chinese to english to malays to indians, and its make news lack of total freedom which is the basis of its existence, without a freedom of news and expression, what is newspaper.</p>
              <p>So that is why you see many older folks still very much incline to our govt, cos brain washed, but the young ones, with internet access, it changing the landscape, and that is why govt official including our PM have to go into facebook, otherwise, no more face.</p>

              <p>ok fair enough an explanation but then again , not providing them with any news or even give them a chance to pry benefits us more.</p>
              <p>Btw am seriously concerned what this pc of news will do , i believe a lot of people are farking upside down becos its so impossible to make that kind of $ based on just 8 hrs or 10 hrs or even 12 hrs.</p>
              <p>In fact , the authorities should sit up and look hard again coz to clock that kind of $ , that farker behind the wheel muz be extremely  shagged! dangerous for pax!</p>
              <p>And the best line of the year goes to that maxi chap. Simi everywhere got hands waving , there is no downtime.</p>
              <p>Thats the biggest BS i have ever heard this year.</p>

              <p>Btw am seriously concerned what this pc of news will do , i
              believe a lot of people are farking upside down becos its so
              impossible to make that kind of $ based on just 8 hrs or 10 hrs or
              even 12 hrs.</p>
              <p>In fact , the authorities should sit up and look hard again coz
              to clock that kind of $ , that farker behind the wheel muz be
              extremely  shagged! dangerous for pax!</p>
              <p>And the best line of the year goes to that maxi chap. Simi

              $350 x 30 days = $10500 (gross taking for the mth)
                
              $10500 - $3000 (a mth rental) - $200 (4 sundays off so save on petrol) = $ 7300
                                      
              $7300 / 26 workings days = $280 nett per day

              poolman wrong liao... in the paper he mentioned minus rental minus petrol, his nett income daily is $200... so he is saying he earn 200 pur profit per day after minus operating cost
              
              
              he says, "working at least eight hours a say lets him take home about $200 after paying $100 to rent the cab and about $50 for fuel"
              
              so straits times never misunderstand the gross thingy...
