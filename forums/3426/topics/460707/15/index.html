              <p>You guys must understand, usually people tell the truth during interview with media. Reporter also not to blame, usually they give correct info, but sometimes they make it sound nicer so that "boss" see as good story to put on front page.</p>
              <p>After that editor look thru, put in more "flower".</p>
              <p>So guy say one month, just that one month, he earned $7000 but work very long hours to pay debt.</p>
              <p>Reporter ask his normal working hours, he say 530am-930am then 2pm-6pm.</p>
              <p>Editor put together the info, work 8hrs get $7000.</p>
              <p>Like TV news also, they edit all the other stuff, just what they want people see/hear.</p>
              <p>Like the Gold 90 FM TV ad:</p>

              <p>Actually weekdays ok, Saturday sales for them also ok cos people buy saturday paper to look at the recruit section to look for job. Saturday and weekdays wake up slightly late only sure all the Straits Time gone.</p>
              <p>Sunday even 11pm still can find Sunday Times at 7-11</p>
              <p>Sunday newspaper always hard to sell, so put a sensationalise front page headline to sell, especially when coming towards month end, so overall sales target is met.</p>
              <p>I don't think its a propaganda to recruit more TD or Premier TD, it's just about selling newspaper.</p>

              <p>Nope bro. <strong>theoretically and logically possible</strong> but <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">physically</span></strong> impossible.
