              <p>Data from the <a href="http://www.nta.org.sg/">National Taxi 
              Association</a> seems to also point to the possibility that Hasnor and Lewo may 
              be one-off success stories in the taxi industry here.<br><br>Advisor to the NTA 
              Ang Hin Kee told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> that in general, most taxi drivers 
              earn slightly more than $2,000 a month after offsetting rental, fuel and ERP 
              costs.<br><br>“Taxi drivers should not push their physical limit by spending 
              more hours on the road to earn more,” he said. “I spoke with some of the more 
              experienced taxi drivers and they have indicated that earning a net income of 
              $6,000 is almost what two drivers take in with extra hard work. It is hence 
              rather uncommon to achieve that kind of amount driving alone,” he added.      </p>

              <p><br>True and agreed, the horse is taking some true nowaday..</p>
              <p>..well, many of us here had passed by 32 years old period, it is time of garang and pride and showing off, full of ego and lost of moral routes, think of inner self more than the outer self. NTA spokeman, a MP, is not going to said all these, because it is not good for them to say it, but behind it, they will had said it in this way, just that, most MPs are trained to how to deal with media.</p>
              <p>But in saying one time off, give you a statement of truth, you can do it, so therefore, the advisor of NTA is still very poor in dealing with media, or that he is also in the cohort of wanting to get younger people into taxis driving, if not, he got no one to advise to..with no one there to take his advise, then he can only kumlan lor.</p>
