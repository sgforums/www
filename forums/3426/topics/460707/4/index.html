              <p>Why Malays drivers to drive back taxis ?</p>
              <p>Back in the late 90's ....</p>
              <p>At least 40% of taxi population driven by Malays .</p>
              <p>They need to bring up the quotas .</p>
              <p>Now i dun see much Malays driving a cab .</p>
              <p>Maybe less than 30% .</p>
              <p>Taxi driving are not meant for Chinese as a tradition .</p>
              <p>Malay drivers are regards as good reliable driver or chauffeur .</p>
              <p>They are usually called Ahmad , it became a common term when come to criticising people that tell us to drive them around .</p>
              <p>" U think i Ahmad for you ?"</p>

              Wow,  serious no joke.  Actually comfort recently called me up abt week ago saying straits times wanna interview young 30s taxi drivers with diploma / degree. I decline in fact. haha never expect e one that accept the interview so big cannon. 
              
              Lol if anyone readers belief taxi driver can earn so much, I strongly encourage all quit to join this trade...no need study so hard, no need to report to bosses, do work at own timing. Please all quit ur jobs now, jump e wagon quick if not queue too long liao

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is a propaganda by LTA and taxi companies with this SMLJ untrue news. This is to attract people to join taxi industry. With this new influx of newbies, all taxi co can then rightly increase taxi daily rental and at the same time clear e balance stock of unwanted cabs at their backyard.</div>

              <p>Actually possible, i got a fellow course mate drive same TC Wish as me, OMO like me also, split shift like me (but he more discipline), anyhow sweep like me.</p>
              <p>His shift:</p>
              <p>Morning 7am-11am, Evening 4pm-10pm (very seldom he finish 10pm)</p>
              <p>We call each other or meet at Toh Guan update on morning and end day taking, i can never beat him how hard i try..</p>
              <p>His gross daily consistent $300-$350,</p>
              <p>So if count on high side:</p>
              <p>$350(gross) - $72(rental after incentives) - $40 (Fuel) = $238 nett profit</p>
              <p>$238 x 30 = $7140</p>
              <p>Oh he Chinese fella, around same age as me mid 30s. Reason he morning start 7am because have to send kids to sch and stop at 11am send wife to work, but normally 10am go makan liao like me, then afternoon sleep like me.</p>
              <p>Morning taking normally both of us about same, but usually he slightly higher. Maybe cos i usually end up waiting for my regular morning pax, cos she always late, but when she late normally she give me extra.</p>
              <p>Evevning he always will beat me cos my start time not consistent</p>

              I agree with u that  it is possible  for a OMO to achieve $6k. But that is not possible to achieve 6k per mth by just driving 8hrs daily with sunday off
              
              To clock 6k per mth  u need to drive  at least 12 to 15 hrs daily. No rest day.  no time for other activities, no family life

Net $7k or $10k sure no problem. If intermediate got pax and no pax plus waste of fuel, Gross income per month including Rental, Fuel and Income everyone also can hit Gross $7k to $10k a month (30/31days without offdays).
