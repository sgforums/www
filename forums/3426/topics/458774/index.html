              Picked up an auntie ard 40s (looked threndy) @ paragon ard 515pm today. She grumbled saying she had waited for 2hrs
              
              Trying to be helpful. i replied it will be better to call a cab instead when she first started queuing 2hrs ago... Non peak cuurent booking only $2.30 nia... and dun need to wait for so long until need to pay the city surcharge after 5pm...
              
              Haha her face turned black. Not sure whether she got too sensitive. She quickly retorted saying booking need postal codes and how she dunno....
              
              I then said get thru the operator to book ma... She said operator dunwan to speak with her...
              
              For then on, i just kept my mouth shut..........My mind screamed what a stupid pax indeed.....

              <p>Sometimes , pax blame us ?</p>
              <p>I thought they no brain actually .</p>
              <p>Actually also cannot blame them , S'pore taxi fare structures damn complex one .</p>
              <p>Cabby themself also blur, dun say commuters .</p>
              <p>Most commuters meter show what , they pay what , they hardly know what's inside the fare .</p>
              <p>I am saying they no brain , cos when time like 3-5pm , changing shift time .... why insist in calling CDG , where most drivers also changing shift and most are like do not want to take with risk like hitting to the wrong side of S'pore?</p>
              <p>They rather interview .... safest .</p>
              <p>SO if need to call ? Callwhich hotline the best ?</p>
              <p>Call those taxi companies which their calls has got destinations given to taxi drivers !!!!!!</p>
              <p>Or Lake View .... our calls will have destinations for most calls given out from 3pm to 5pm , unless hotels which need 2 or more taxis .</p>
              <p>Comfort - Blocked destinations .</p>
              <p>TransCab - Blocked destinations .</p>
              <p>Premier - Reveal destinations .</p>
              <p>Smart - expensive booking fee .</p>
              <p>SMRT - some reveal most blocked destinations ...........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So logically who is the best chances u can get a cab home?</p>
              <p>Of course those with destinations ? </p>
              <p>Simply becos some drivers might just nice going back base .... take one and go back lor !!!!</p>
              <p>Price ? </p>
              <p>Same mah , it's between $2.30 and $2.50 .</p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Actually if i am to recommend one hotline ...... if commuters know how to make full use of them , it's TransCab !!!!</p>
              <p>Cos TransCab operators can assist caller to indicate destinations to drivers .</p>
              <p>It is unlike Comfort , for Comfort , the operators are instructed not to give out destinations , even some pax said a destination , their operator covered it all up , became AUTO CALL.</p>
              <p>Which do not benefit both drivers and commuters , at all,nobody wins !!!</p>
              <p>Comfort mentallity to their drivers , want take , don't want done .</p>
              <p>Strictly no pick n chose .</p>
              <p>So fine , some time slot like 3pm to 5.30pm , we cannot escape our sight that most drivers are taking advantage of it and start asking "Go where" to favour their trips , rather than getting hit one to Hollan .</p>

              <p>So, your wife manage to get a taxi with a call of no destination? Good.</p>
              <p>Now, if there is destination stated, do you think your wife is able to get a cdg cab so fast?</p>
              <p>The concept of cdg is simple, as a transport service provider, we transport peoples around singapore regardless of which destination, as a driver of cdg, not an employee, you can take the call or ignore it, but if u take it, you have to honor it. By giving destination can only diverts driver to their own preferrances, and that would sway more toward a few places only, it therefore defeated the purpose of what cdg wanted, servicing peoples all over Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>Whether it is a fail or successful attempt, it is not going to bother us, because that is CDG concept and base on it, that is why its current calls got not destination, but if you ask me, as I said earlier, I would prefer with destination.</p>
              <p>Those see collars at cdg is not going to do thing that divert from it objectives, otherwise top management would tell them to f off and see no collar liao.  I bet that every pax who called would had told operator about their destination, but the operator goes by the rules, and with that, it hold ground in any complain coming in from the public that the biggest cab company only take preferred road, because Cdg will said back that their calls had not destination.</p>

              <p><br>Agreed of cos, serve pocket and family first lah, but we need understand why cdg hasno destination on their current calls, it is not that they do not know the agony and dislike that their TDs is having and facing on their taiko calls, but they still stick on those rules.</p>
              <p>Every cdg drivers knew that cdg has their own KPI to meet, from calls to servicing time, complains and grievences handling case, every month, DROs will highlight to all their drivers on nos of call taken successfully, whether meeting target or did they meet the servicing of cab time on time...etc etc</p>
