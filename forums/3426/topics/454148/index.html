              Questions need answers on :
              Do they work alone or in pairs: 2 men or 2 ladies or as a couple?
              where do they normally board the taxi ?
              Day &amp; time of boarding.
              How far do they travel,I assunme is less than 10 km,the longer &amp; further  the more expensive the catch.
              They will definitely need a reciept &amp; choose to pay CASHLESS?
              DO THEY KEEP QUIET OR ENTER INTO A CONVERSATION with themselves or w the TD ?

              <p>Now you know why I avoid them like the plague.</p>
              <p>All these cheapos from India, that are being hired for their 'expertise' especially in IT. But their mentality is the same, everything they calculate in Indian rupees, so $7 Singapore dollars is like 100 - 200 rupees.</p>
              <p>They only want to have things cheap or free. Why this receipt? Because can claim. Why after 7 or 8pm maybe later especially in Alexandra area or town, you see a lot of calls from them, and not as many from locals?</p>
              <p>Because locals 5.30 - 6 pm will wanna ciao home. These clowns purposely will stay back claiming to do overtime or extra work to impress their bosses. Because of that they are allowed to take a cab back and claim. If leave at 5.30pm, must take own transport (public).</p>
              <p>Our Govt thinks it's smart to bring these monkeys in. Companies employ them because they are still cheaper than locals and usually won't leave for better prospects, since their knowledge of better paying jobs would be lesser than Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>So pay peanuts you get monkeys!</p>
              <p>1 thing that really surprises me (no I'm not envious, being xenophobic or racist):</p>
              <p>That stupid companies actually go rent good condos or aprtments for them. Or give them allowance to do so (in this case most will try for HDB and pocket the difference).</p>
              <p>Yes some India Indians are extremely able and good especially in IT and some of their better universities have high standards as well in certain fields. (India after all have developed their own nuclear missiles).</p>
              <p>But the top 10% of them are all swallowed up by the US especially Silicon Valley. The next 20 - 25% all head to Europe. The next 5-10% will go to the Middle East (better pay than rest of Asia). So what we are left with?</p>
              <p>Those well below 60%. These are the ones, our Govt has welcomed with open arms.</p>
              <p>Now this condo thing. If you have been to India, even the better parts in cities where the rich and more educated live, you'll unlikely to find a condo that matches the standard of something like Elias Green or the ones in you see in Yishun, Woodlands or CCK. Don't even talk of sart ones like Mandarin Gardens, 6th Avenue or The Sail.</p>
              <p>Their best usually is like Pacific Mansions or the HUDC types in Bedok or Tampines. Yet our dumb companies are housing them in places like Tg Rhu, Tiong Bahru, East Coast etc.</p>
              <p>Of course, they like and thus become more arrogant, because they feel important and big, back home they would never have enjoyed things like sauna, gym, swimming pool etc in such good condition.</p>

              <p>Ya man, I been to india as a sailor before, kerala, gujarat, mumbai, chennai, there is a very high disparity among the rich and poor, poor is real damn poor, see already also sad, rich are damn rich, agree that their houses are poor condition, but with so many servants and workers working for them, they are like kings in India.</p>
              <p>I alway see indian workers sleeping along the pavement in industrial area, once I told them this is not clean, they said, 100x better than our india home, singapore road, grass patch, bus stop is much much better than their town house</p>
