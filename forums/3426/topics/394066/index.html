              <p>Dear all brothers,</p>
              <p>I have officially return my transcab merc 368
               and tore up my
                                      taxi licence on the last day.</p>
              <p>This is my sentiments on driving a taxi for 
              half a year.</p>
              <p>When i first started , i was full of zest and
               enthusiam for my
                                      new found "career". However to be blunt , in my 
              38 years of life i
                                      have never found a job that i can meet so many 
              UGLY singaporeans
                                      and those foreign talent included. They order u 
              like DOGS , LEFT
                                      RIGHT . Come on passengers do i fxxx own u a 
              living ? In my life i
                                      have never been rude to even the aunties that 
              clear my plates at
                                      hawker centre , was asking myself what level of 
              hell am i in to
                                      meet all these idiots.</p>
              <p>There are rude taxi drivers but most of us 
              are just trying to
                                      make a living by giving you passengers a 
              convenient ride home ,
                                      when someone help you home with that peanuts 
              money dont you think
                                      you should be appreciative? In case those frog 
              in the well didnt
                                      know , taxi charges are the lowest amongst 
              developed country and be
                                      thankful for that. It was not in my character to
               be revengful but i
                                      did in last sunday the last day of my driving , i
               drive pass
                                      passenger and purposely when close by switch to 
              BUSY sign ; the
                                      notion never take things for granted. We are 
              provider of service
                                      and not server and lord relationship.</p>
              <p>Another issue , do you passengers think taxi 
              drivers are a bunch
                                      of uneducated fools. I have been insulted about 
              wearing a fake
                                      rolex that cost me 30K to put on my wrist. To 
              all those that have

              and transcab merc
                                      368 ; i have finally found a job as a NYMEX oil 
              trader and can well

              <p>The good thing that came out of me ; I have 
              learned to value
                                      money a lot more. I have learned to put aside my
               ego( leo fxxxer)
                                      for the sake of my family to make a living and

              <p>i think all taxi drivers will be facing the same kind of situations that you have.. it is unavoidable and i guess at the end of the day, you will just have to accept it as part and parcel of a taxi driver.. just like a office job, seldom you will find your bosses praising you for the good work that you have done cos they thot this is what you are being paid for.. instead they will often point out your minor mini faults that you have made.. people are people.. nice people around, bast**ds around also.. but lucky for you, you have found a good paying job from the looks of things and congrats on that...</p>
              <p>this world is round, what goes around will come back one day.. so those f**kers will get that just desserts one fine day.. cos these f**kers lack what i call "respect"..</p>

              <p>agree with FT.... employee always an employee meaning you dun control your own destiny.. ur destiny always lie with your employer.. so if you meet a good one, good, no worries.. but if meet a bad one, die liao.. pay peanuts expect work like superman..</p>
              <p>i have worked for so many years and u know when was my happiest [thou not necessarily means pay higher], is when i became my own boss running a food stall.. that was the time i am happiest working and working almost 18 hours a day, but at the end it did not work out as i lost money and financially drained, so no choice went back to working society till now.. finally cleared my debts etc and now i am prepared to take another shot at working for myself, starting off as taxi driver.. once i got my licence, it is time for me to say goodbye to the working class society.. dun mind earning lesser but at the end of the day, i can go home and tell my family, this is my hard earned money and feel happy..</p>

              <p>Bro ah phui, i saw you on thurs afternoon lighting up you cig while crossing the road.  I wave you and i think you saw me. Unfortunately i have pax and thinking of after that try to turn back and have coffee with you but don't know whether you will still be there.</p>
              <p>So i think on that day you look so relax and easy (happy). It must be your last day as Taxi driver.</p>
              <p>You are more slim and trim compared to 6 months ago.</p>
              <p>By the way - i wish you all the best.</p>
              <p>And now you can say phrases like :  "When i was a taxi driver...........", "Once upon a time, i was a taxi driver........".</p>

              <p>Dear all brothers,</p>
              <p>I have officially return my transcab merc 368 and tore up my

              <p>This is my sentiments on driving a taxi for half a year.</p>
              <p>When i first started , i was full of zest and enthusiam for my
              new found "career". However to be blunt , in my 38 years of life i
              have never found a job that i can meet so many UGLY singaporeans
              and those foreign talent included. They order u like DOGS , LEFT
              RIGHT . Come on passengers do i fxxx own u a living ? In my life i
              have never been rude to even the aunties that clear my plates at
              hawker centre , was asking myself what level of hell am i in to
              meet all these idiots.</p>
              <p>There are rude taxi drivers but most of us are just trying to
              make a living by giving you passengers a convenient ride home ,
              when someone help you home with that peanuts money dont you think
              you should be appreciative? In case those frog in the well didnt
              know , taxi charges are the lowest amongst developed country and be
              thankful for that. It was not in my character to be revengful but i
              did in last sunday the last day of my driving , i drive pass
              passenger and purposely when close by switch to BUSY sign ; the
              notion never take things for granted. We are provider of service
              and not server and lord relationship.</p>
              <p>Another issue , do you passengers think taxi drivers are a bunch
              of uneducated fools. I have been insulted about wearing a fake
              rolex that cost me 30K to put on my wrist. To all those that have
              sat in my taxi namely SMRT azera 4773, Kia 6928 and transcab merc
              368 ; i have finally found a job as a NYMEX oil trader and can well

              <p>Taxi in singapore context will always be a looked down upon profession. i never seen any other job category where the majority of the population  have so much hatred against. dont believe ? look everywhere in the papers , the forums esp those car ones . taxi drivers are labelled as scums , losers.</p>
              <p>every nite when i drive , its not a just a battle to get paxes , its a battle with those cars on the road , when they see a taxi , they beam us , refuse to give way , tailgate horn. this is how society  views us, do u all still wanna be a nice TD? no sorry , for me , i serve myself 1st , public later.</p>
              <p>like FT said , drive with pride.</p>

              <p>Let me say something to the guys here ....</p>
              <p>I have a good start to my taxi driving job ...... i lasted til now .</p>
              <p>Vincent was one of those who whack an Azera with his first day of work , and he lasted 6 months .</p>
              <p>He asked me whether Azera is good after he signed .</p>
              <p>Lam left Azera .</p>
              <p>Now 6 months later , Lam's buddy Vincent left too ....</p>
              <p>I believe ..... if Vincent has got a good start of driving a cab , with the right company , i think he would have enjoy more driving .</p>
              <p>Anyway , if he can get a job elsewhere , good for him .</p>

              <p>Vincent ah phui, don't forget u are ex-TD.  So next time when u are pax, please be magnanimous to all TD regardless of how blur king, newbie, oldie cockup type. Forgive them or us. We are just TD.  Guide the newbie if u sit in their car.</p>
              <p>Don't complained if you don't get a Cab just outside CBD.</p>
              <p>Call LV and offer to top up 8 + metre to anywhere.  Back to your home in CCK, offer more than 15+ and Pool and the gang will come and help you.  Then we have motivation to go to taiko places.  Kangchia back to town also never mind.  </p>
              <p>Hope you will take care of yourself in your new TRADE.  I have many friends in these oil trades and many have long left this industry.  NOT EASY!   You have to learn how to spend more time with your family especially in your new role.</p>
