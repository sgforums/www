              sorry i forgot say the big vehcile backside was facing my friend, what happen in the front of it cannot see at all. my friend thinks the girl is trying to board the passenger seat of that big vehicle thats why she come out to its left side. my friend thinks even those witnesses might not see the girl run out herself first, only saw she run into headlights or even later after my friend brake stop

              Not simple case ..... inform your friend to report to taxi company for them to take note of such event that had happened .
              
              If that girl's want to pursue , at least u have done your part in reporting .

              <p>As long we are driving,esp. a Taxi, always got to be alert. Acciedent will still occur, show care and concern the moment it happen, it will reduce testify against you.</p>
