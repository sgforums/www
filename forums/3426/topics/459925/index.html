              i don't have a better word to describe, maybe just share some of the experience i have
              
              1. Advance booking $8 
              unless you are driving omo, the chances you fight to get a advance booking is slim cost some of the driver will start pressing the PTT before the full details are out
              only sometime you will get lucky , but sometime you being the first bidder, it might just end up giving the booking to others instead.
              
              2. current booking $2.5/$3.5
              same , you must be the first bidder to get the job , not the nearest to the booking tha count,  being the nearest will only happen once in a long while
              
              for call center,
              i will share others matters later when i am free

              <p>as a new premier driver , only from 2012 .....</p>
              <p>I only can say their call volume ......  out of 10 points . They get a 3/10 , maybe better than Prime and Smart .</p>
              <p>Quality ...... 3/10 , only those cannot get taxis , then they call Premier . They do have stronghold like Sungei Gedong , but as a citycabby , Sungei Gedong's calls mean nothing to me .</p>
              <p>As for their city calls .... i would say 2/10 . Only actively on 5pm to 5.30pm , when cabbies still haven't hit town . After that ..... before 8pm , their call centre staffs can drink kopi at canteen .</p>
              <p>After 8pm ..... they sounds to me their Call Centre has closed down . All the way until midnight .</p>
              <p>Perhaps sometimes the talkie will just sounded somewhere from Vivo ... Mapletree Financial Centre at Pasir Panjang . This 2 .</p>
              <p>And the destinations their customers going , simply scary !!!!!!</p>

              <p>As for their drivers .....</p>
              <p>Cos they have got 3 groups .</p>
              <p>Group 1 , as in for those Mercedes and old birds .</p>
              <p>Group 4 , for "active" members .</p>
              <p>The other group strictly for talking like Limo , no calls . Never interested in calls .</p>
              <p>I used both Group 1 and 4 before , Group 1 on Benz , Group 4 on Kia and Skoda .</p>
              <p>Group 1 their drivers more standard . Calls volume i would say same leh , not say Group 1 less calls , but Group 1 has got more quality calls , like Tuas to Anson Road , Tuas to Centrepoint etc .... dunno why ????</p>
              <p>Group 4 their drivers , two words : Yao Gui </p>
              <p>Bo stanard . Destinations also very rotten one .</p>
              <p>Si mi lan chiao calls , sometimes without listening to the destinations just bid ! Woodlands also go maybe , want to have $3.50 nia , no scare tio tai ko . Bo standard , they should have join Comfort , sometimes i thinking .</p>
              <p>What is standard ? Finish listening all then bid .... if u got it , u are good !!!!</p>
              <p>I never kena their advance call before driving a Kia and Skoda .... maybe because i dun bid , not interested .</p>
              <p>But during the Benz's days , i kena one .</p>
              <p>Solid one Group 1 job .</p>
              <p>It was at Tuas ....advance booking for 30 minutes job to Orchard Hotel .</p>
              <p>I was at CCK , bidded and got it .</p>
              <p>That Hirer ( his customer ) actually told the pax it was a Merc .</p>
              <p>Pax paid me $45 for a $20+ job .</p>
              <p>But to me , their advance bookings , like what andrew had said , 100% taken away , surely got taker , good or lousy , whichever timings .</p>

              <p>But it's a matter of sooner or later Premier instal a MDT for every taxis .</p>
              <p>Now they had improved on cashless payment .</p>
              <p>Next step will be MDT .</p>
              <p>Got good got bad .</p>
              <p>Good .... MDT still is MDT , works to the max , esp in precisions of locations of drivers .</p>
              <p>Bad .... sooner or later , call levy to be charge accordingly .</p>
              <p>Once levy chargeable , 7% GST must add on .</p>
              <p>Then IRAS laughing all the way to the bank , cos got GST 7% to collect mah .</p>

              <p>I believe in near future ....</p>
              <p>Premier MDT system will be integrated and invested by LTA .</p>

              <p>Only Comfort and Citycab is a standalone call centre .</p>
              <p>The rest will be under one centralised LTA call centre .</p>

              <p>Good Premier calls all got destinations .</p>
              <p>Bad once integrated into a centralised electrnoic call centre , all Auto Booking type of calls .</p>
              <p>Like Singapore flyer .</p>
              <p>Pax call 6452-xxxx , press 1 and wait for taxi number and duration .</p>

              <p>In fact that should be the way of maximising booking service .</p>
              <p>Comfort deal with all their corp customers , cab charge customers , e-vouchers customers .</p>
              <p>The rest used LTA centralised hotline ...... LTA to maximise the usage of all taxis around the island .</p>

              <p>But it will be useless , if LTA place taxi company total taxi population's ranking as first priority for pax getting a cab , it's LPPL .</p>
              <p>Still will be chaos .</p>
              <p>Customer holding on for their phone for 10 minutes and turn out "no taxis around your area ."</p>
              <p>It's never a secret that CDG has a massive corporate customers base .Where got time for others ?</p>
              <p>This paxes already so busy liao , priorities mah .</p>
              <p>In the end , tourists also kena .</p>
              <p>Imagine a german tourist with a german auto roaming phone is Sgp ? No CDG takers cos handphone number +049-123456789 , no CDG drivers dare take , cos scared take liao call cost them a bomb .</p>
              <p>Cannot get a cab .... one call 10 minutes to hold , in the end no taxis ?</p>
              <p>His phone bills will be about $30 for not having a cab ! </p>

              <p>Simply put, CDG should stop their stupid policy of removing destinations from calls.</p>
              <p>Who wants to take thier calls? I know unfortunately a large number of drivers will be dying for their calls no matter where, whom or what, got call already steam, go woodlands, jur west ext from town also anyhow take.</p>
              <p>But a smaller percentage say 25% will not (like me), because we shudder at the end result. So we second guess, from the pax name, pick-up location, the time amongst others, whether to commit to the call or not.</p>
              <p>Even their corporate or VIP give me also I don't want, these people all yaya one, because CDG suck up to them and entertain all their stunts. Worse still drivers who take their calls also suck up further and end up spoiling market for others. Pax come late after 5-8 maybe more also can. Go here, go there, a few drops, also entertain. Everything also entertain. So normal drivers like myself who choose to take these calls will have to put up with these nonsense, because the previous drivers had done so and CDG no matter what will side with them.</p>
              <p>But imagine if CDG reverted to the old scheme where destination was put up for normal calls, will it be so bad, that only nearby destinations will be serviced?</p>
              <p>I don't think so, most CDG drivers are like PAP voters, anything you ask them, they will comply. Go N,E, or W, also will have drivers. In fact some actually like going these far far places, because to them - CBD $3, booking $3.30, starting $4 (incl 25%) - like that already $10, then the journey maybe $10-15 more - over $25 give or take - 1/2 shift rent already covered.</p>
              <p>So there 75% who now are taking calls without location, will continue doing so, but because of the location included, the 25% like myself who aren't taking their calls, will also start to take them because of the destination.</p>
              <p>It's a win-win for them, but they live in their own world it seems.</p>

              <p><br>What you said is true, but of course others also have the right to express themselves in their own opinon, so brother, there is no right or wrong, just like what you perfectly wrote it, everyone has own style.</p>
              <p>And with that, why get so heat up over it, relax, we love your post, just let the forum have it free flow, if you like give a thumb up, if not like, just ignore, no need to say goodbye or like chief like to say bye bye.

              <p>And also, I noticed that our chief alway give good commend on the taxis company he newly joined, from former cdg to TC, he will say very good this and that, but the end is after he left the company, he always fark them.. fark type company lah, CMI company lah...this is his usual style, if you know him well, he is like this one lah, but he do not mean it by the heart.</p>
              <p>However, for silver, it is quite unusual for him to give bad remark, because he is still driving it, so, to conclude, I believe their call is damn bad.</p>
              <p>I started from silver, I never take their calls</p>

              <p>Not so shack lah, still can survive, when I drove with them, I just Q, st pick, go airport, never take a single call, after I go into TC crown also seldom take call, still can earn a decent living, thereafter, I also drive for Cdg, then take more calls.</p>
              <p>So for people like me, I start from the basic street pick up..now can do both, where to pick, and where and when to take call also know liao.</p>
