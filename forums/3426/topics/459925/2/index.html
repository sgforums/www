              <p>Call booking is no big deal, not only the amount, it's the behavior</p>
              <p>People will do a call booking when there isn't sufficient supply of Taxi, out of common way, so taking up the job with that little extra, the time taken to travel there and risk of no shown, is who helping who?</p>
              <p>I take call booking as a bonus, my routine does not put call booking as a priority. I will not be lure into it for that little extra. i will take the call only</p>
              <p>1) Convenience, is along the way</p>
              <p>2) time taken is faster then my prediction of next pax</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At low demand of Taxi period, area..... don't be happy when their is a call booking...... very like you will get a NO SHOW, which is rather TuLan.</p>
              <p>Call booking from whichever Taxi Company is not under my consideration.</p>

              <p>And also, I noticed that our chief alway give good commend on
              the taxis company he newly joined, from former cdg to TC, he will
              say very good this and that, but the end is after he left the
              company, he always fark them.. fark type company lah, CMI
              company lah...this is his usual style, if you know him well, he is
              like this one lah, but he do not mean it by the heart.</p>
              <p>However, for silver, it is quite unusual for him to give bad
              remark, because he is still driving it, so, to conclude, I believe
              their call is damn bad.</p>
              <p>I started from silver, I never take their calls</p>

              <p>Actually i dun actually started a special thread to condemn their call system , someone did , i add what i know .</p>
              <p>Only if Premier has got a bigger pool of callers , they will be better .</p>
              <p>Anyway , they are currently more suitable for my driving style than others so far .</p>
              <p>Cos i can chose a job at Tuas to CBD during near off peak period .</p>
              <p>They are the only one currently only one who reveal destinations to drivers .</p>
              <p>Ruined by some drivers who bidded the jobs without even hearing the destinations .</p>
              <p>Very sadly so , once 6pm , Premier calls at Tuas can be all the way Zero .</p>
              <p>It shows that their customers are those who called CDG dun have then call Premier one .</p>

              <p>Well , it will take sometimes for customers to fully aware that Premier can pay by NETS afterall .</p>
              <p>It is NETS to why most are calling in for Comfort .</p>
              <p>If given a choice , most will not call a Comfort knowing the rest can be faster than Comfort to arrive .</p>
              <p>Only because those customers are not aware that Premier can use NETS .</p>
              <p>And the Premier also make no effort to publish in paper to inform commuters about their recent exercise in upgrading their cashless paying system .</p>

              <p>In fact , i think not many here know how CDG , TransCab and Premier call system works altogether .</p>

              ha ha, i only sharing my experience i have encounter ,
              why is it so, cos sometime they are comment on this forum read by taxi company which was being print out to show the management
              not everything happening is known by the top , sometime outsider words are bettr being believe by th top than  those who are working in the taxi  at the taxi companies
              .bad thingi say but good one i also will mention but only refer to premier
              Their dros, as compare with some other taxi company i know are a group of good staff that really will listen to their TDs and try to solve within their ability
              but for the call center
              
              really i only give 3/10 , cos they always make mistake
              1. call booking message send wrongly
              2. hourly booking rate and charges not clear
              3. different standard  of operator for matter like no show situation
              
              worst is that when you kindly tell them their mistake, they never admit, give reason
              like
              1. I work 7yrs here in the call center (call center supvr)  and claims cannot be wrong
              2. a senior operator mistak, when tell just push it say new staff mistake etc

              with the recently install nets of course i would say it is a good move 
              only that a small sticker given which i find help a little as still many pax does not know even board. may need to work on this matter a little
              
              every company has good and bad, like human being, we always say bad things more than good things, but as long what i say is not bull shit, i don't see anyone should get heat , it is just sharing , not kpkb.
              who knows like poolman and i say about the their KIA and crown offer, knowing their vehicle condition it better not recommed friends to take up. i rather they come in with good impesssion and not leave because of the vehicle condition which driver may encounter
              e.g a air con pipe leak for a KIA , do you know it may take around 2days to have  patch
              , i repeat, is to patch the leak not replace, some other parts  they will try to locate used part , if the part is not avalable then driver either give a replacement(if they is available) if not stay at home shake their legs
              i am sure some silver guy driving KIA will know about the kia headlight, some driver were force to drive with high beam cost waiting time could be more than 1 month to 2 month . why? 
              I am also say cos some of my premier kaki left because of those reason i have mentioned. some even lost their relief due to not many call booking
              I am only stating facts, things i have encounter with premier since 2010 when i drove for them nothing else

              <p>As for the KIA headlights issues .</p>
              <p>It's not Premier's fault , i'll blame it on the hirer ! </p>
              <p>Cos the hirer drive OMO day , does he care about what's happening at night ?</p>
              <p>No lah fuck , sunset he also set , set to go home .</p>
              <p>I told him when i first drove the vehicle , he said it's like that one , if cannot see , high beam .</p>
              <p>Ok , high beam (never in my life i drove with my high beam on , unless to poke people's eyes for the vehicle infront ) </p>
              <p>But when high beam , i inviting retailiations ! And i hated it .</p>
              <p>So i told him ..... he said again it's like that one .</p>
              <p>Until one fine day , i realized many vehicle overtook me without signalling ( at night ) .</p>
              <p>I cannot blame them ..... cos i never encounter so much ilke that before i drove KIA .</p>
              <p>It has to be due to the low lighting  of my head light .</p>
              <p>So i fine day , i buay tahan liao .</p>
              <p>I demand my hirer to change it or Premier has to give me a black and white to tell me "any accident claim , they have to bear ! Not me to bear "!</p>
              <p>He listen liao scared .</p>
              <p>Went to see the DRO ....</p>
              <p>U know what ?</p>
              <p>Premier got it done in 30 minutes ! </p>
              <p>What indent ?</p>
              <p>Rubbish ! </p>
              <p>It's the hirer who bo chap .</p>
              <p>They have ample replacements .</p>

              <p>I hated the KIA not because of the high light .</p>
              <p>It's the steering ! </p>
              <p>That is why i condemn KIA and switch to Skoda .</p>
              <p>If got chance .</p>
              <p>Once i found a Skoda , fuck off KIA .</p>
              <p>This one i also cannot blame Premier , cos it's Mega Auto who bo chap , i also think the hirer played a part , cos to repair steering take longer time !!! </p>
              <p>And no replacement if repair steering .</p>
              <p>I believe that hirer was thinking ; " Steering can move can liao , meter can press can liao , the rest not important ."</p>
              <p>Then u go and drive lor ... since drive with steering like that so shiok !!</p>

              well you have your encounter but i think i want to mention one thng, there is limitation when come to changing certain part for Mega, they will need aprroval from premier before they can do it, not change and repair as they want, these steps causes delay in gettng vehicle repair
              or course for my headlight , at that time it was a long waiting list, only when i bang table then i get to jump Q. only to pity the other kia driver both headlight need to replace but end getting the right one replaced cause i took the left one
