              <p>Well, every organisation has it own culture and believes, LV is not exceptional, it operate in a way of everyone can join, no need whatever lesson, just grab a walkie, register and off you go, and at time even the organsier also dunno who is who.</p>
              <p>Therefore in nutshell, it is like a hit and run culture, first in or first reach, first run. This result in a kind cannibalism culture within, for a layman like most, already on the road, there are cut lanes and jam Q, vultures and hawks eyeing potential preys on the road with danger of getting knocks here and there is already a stress which is inevitable because we are in this line.</p>
              <p>But for radio station like LV it is a choice, and also in a way, additional stress </p>

              </p><p>TD who had join and experience himself before, sure can provide some endorsements.........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>But 1 thing you all must visualize, taxi stand groups is just like CDG, TransCab or Prime or Premier, or SMRT or any other taxi company, smaller in size but don't operate taxi, like a call center but very outdated paging system..........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Members come from all walk of life, all kind of taxi company and all model of taxi.........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>So to manage this kind of "Rojak" organization, not easy.........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>The baid to recruit members of course must have jobs la, so LV customer base don't just build over night, some got to backdated to yellow top era.........</p><p>

              </p><p>For me, nothing to endorse, because I still that sentence, taxi stand groups sooner or later will be history, so as long is still alive and kicking, those feel that can dang jiak, make full use to it, those think cannot, better cut the line and spent the money elsewhere.........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Lastly, I'm the ex-member for 2 taxi stand groups last time, which 2? Don't tell you.........<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Hahaha, page 4 liao.........very sorry, bro BCL, bo eng come
              in..........</p>
              <p>TD who never join group before, definitely won't understand what
              is grouping.........</p>
              <p>TD who had join and experience himself before, sure can provide
              some endorsements.........</p>
              <p>But 1 thing you all must visualize, taxi stand groups is just
              like CDG, TransCab or Prime or Premier, or SMRT or any other taxi
              company, smaller in size but don't operate taxi, like a call center
              but very outdated paging system..........</p>
              <p>Members come from all walk of life, all kind of taxi company and
              all model of taxi.........</p>
              <p>So to manage this kind of "Rojak" organization, not
              easy.........</p>
              <p>The baid to recruit members of course must have jobs la, so LV
              customer base don't just build over night, some got to backdated to
              yellow top era.........</p>
              <p>As for ordinary members........if all can think alike, å¤©ä¸‹å¤ªå¹³
              loh..........</p>
              <p>For me, nothing to endorse, because I still that sentence, taxi
              stand groups sooner or later will be history, so as long is still
              alive and kicking, those feel that can dang jiak, make full use to
              it, those think cannot, better cut the line and spent the money
              elsewhere.........</p>
              <p>Lastly, I'm the ex-member for 2 taxi stand groups last time,
