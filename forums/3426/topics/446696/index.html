              Yo bros
              
              Need some advise.
              
              My relief going long holiday but he pay me 1/2 of his rental as compensation as usual.
              
              Since our partnership ard 4 mths plus, he has gone for holiday trip approx 28 days (excluding most recent).
              
              I have found a temp relief staying v near to my hse &amp; he is interested to partner me for perm. But however, i intend to trial out this new relief b4 making any decision.
              
              My current relief is sort like mentor to me (im only got 5 mths exp). But im quite piss off with his attitude. He alws late in handover time (10-15) 4 times in a week. Major lateness also 4 times.
              
              1st- 1 hr late
              2nd- 1 hr late
              3rd- 2 hrs late
              4th- 1.5 hrs late
              
              He use overslept as an excuse which i find it unacceptable. I did tell him to buy alarm clock or use his hp as an alarm. But he say it's useless!!
              
              And also he didnt wash the cab for 2 weeks. He did it only when i tell him to do so with grumbling like ' wash liao den rain, now dirty again blah blah'.
              
              Today, he give me 1/2 rental of his shift x per day in lieu of his holiday. Quite a lot cos he went for 14 days holiday trip.
              
              Need some advise. If trial period with temp relief is ok, i intend to refund all the $$ to this current relief &amp; end our partnership immediately.
              
              1. Do i need to give him 1 week notice (he requested it when we start our partnership)? 2. What if he say i can't terminate him since i have taken his $$ in the 1st place?
              
              Thks for advise.
              
              P.s: This really makes my blood boil--&gt; I ask him aft this long trip, will he go for holiday again for this yr. He reply yes, 1 week for once in 2 mths! Me like KNNBCCB u!@#$ in my mind.

              FYI, i did voice out out to him bout his lateness &amp; holiday trips. He got mentioned that if both party can't see eye to eye den no point to continue this partnership.

              <p>Well, if you kicked him out... does that means he won't come to your place and sabotage your cab at your carpark ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Talk with him nicely, if he is still not willing to compromise, then end the agreement promptly.  Try your best to see that there is no hard feeling towards each other (easy come, easy go).  Also, pls claim down before you meet up with him.... always take the good (<span style="color: #ff0000;">he is once your mentor</span>) with the bad.</p>

              <p>Yo bros</p>
              <p>Need some advise.</p>
              <p>My relief going long holiday but he pay me 1/2 of his rental as
              compensation as usual.</p>
              <p>Since our partnership ard 4 mths plus, he has gone for holiday
              trip approx 28 days (excluding most recent).</p>
              <p>I have found a temp relief staying v near to my hse &amp; he is
              interested to partner me for perm. But however, i intend to trial
              out this new relief b4 making any decision.</p>
              <p>My current relief is sort like mentor to me (im only got 5 mths
              exp). But im quite piss off with his attitude. He alws late in
              handover time (10-15) 4 times in a week. Major lateness also 4
              times.</p>
              <p>1st- 1 hr late<br> 2nd- 1 hr late<br> 3rd- 2 hrs late<br> 4th- 1.5 hrs late</p>
              <p>He use overslept as an excuse which i find it unacceptable. I
              did tell him to buy alarm clock or use his hp as an alarm. But he
              say it’s useless!!</p>
              <p>And also he didnt wash the cab for 2 weeks. He did it only when
              i tell him to do so with grumbling like ’ wash liao den rain, now
              dirty again blah blah’.</p>
              <p>Today, he give me 1/2 rental of his shift x per day in lieu of
              his holiday. Quite a lot cos he went for 14 days holiday trip.</p>
              <p>Need some advise. If trial period with temp relief is ok, i
              intend to refund all the $$ to this current relief &amp; end our
              partnership immediately.</p>
              <p>1. Do i need to give him 1 week notice (he requested it when we
              start our partnership)? 2. What if he say i can’t terminate him
              since i have taken his $$ in the 1st place?</p>
              <p>Thks for advise.</p>
              <p>P.s: This really makes my blood boil—&gt; I ask him aft this
              long trip, will he go for holiday again for this yr. He reply yes,
              1 week for once in 2 mths! Me like <span>KNNBCCB</span> u!@#$ in my mind.</p>
              </div>

              <p>To part on good terms , its best to give your relief some notice.</p>
              <p>When i was targetted to be kicked off by my last last hirer, he told me he will wait for me to find another cab .</p>
              <p>eh not that im problematic , he wants to take over my shift and let out the day slot :D</p>

              <p>Bro... what we can give you are just advices...</p>
              <p>The most important is what you intend to do.....</p>
              <p>Try to minimize any confrontation. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Explain to him your unhappiness</span> (<strong>nicely</strong>).  Raising voice don't help to settle the problem.  (Pls don't bring Poolman there.... later he chopped your relief into pieces... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> just kidding).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">(Like Bro BCL said)</span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> <strong>Try to part with good terms</strong></span>.... Singapore is a small island.... taxi industry also... <span style="color: #ff0000;">Easy cum... Easy go.</span>.. It will brings you more GOOD then BAD. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png">.  </p>
              <p>No more partnership, still can be friends..... rather than 1 enemy.... correct ?</p>

              <p>1. talk new terms with him - cannot change relief</p>
              <p>2. give him notice - no need special reason just say want to drive omo</p>
              <p>3. increase his rental by e.g $10 - let him terminate you</p>
              <p>   ( cos he always late and go holiday, as a form of compensation)</p>
              <p>as i have mentioned, change when things don't work out, no need to hold it in your heart, you bring unnecessary stress to yourself, bad for health lah</p>
              <p>new relief good or bad really hard to tell as you got to partner and see, change till you find a good one</p>

              I going to refund him the money. True he did fulfil his part according to industry practice. But even with the $$, i need to work 1 more hr per day and buy night coupons to cover his period of absence.
              
              If 1 yr he went for 2 times, it's acceptable to me but not every 2 mths..
