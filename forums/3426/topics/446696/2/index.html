              <p>Relationship between Hirer and Relief not so simple like Relationship between Taxi Co. and Hirer.</p>
              <p>Taxi Co. and Hirer got all the conditions laid down. You step out of line, they shoot you. They say "A", you "A"; they say "B", you "B". You want to Sia Lan with them, you have to think of your deposit.</p>
              <p>Hirer and Relief partnership, most of the time only a few conditions or conditions not clear. And when partner got problems, got to know how to do people (choa laang, close one eye and give way) Or when shit happens, have to deviate from conditions or prepare for end of partnership. If behave like Taxi Co and hirer, for sure the partnership will not last. </p>
              <p>Very difficult to find good partners. A good partner is one who do not think about you handover late, but thinking maybe you got problems. But the other party must prove himself to be good partner too.</p>

              <p>Many many years ago, I started a small machine shop with 2 friends. Very good friends. Six months down the road, always quarrel. Another 3 months split, No more good friends.</p>
              <p>Partnership and being friends not the same.</p>
              <p>Also around the same time, set up another Co.  Partnership lasted for some time until one of us got to tend to other plans. Why can last so long? Becasue we always thinking for the good of the other party.</p>
              <p>Everywhere same..</p>
              <p>1. Must trust each other. If no trust, wait for partnership end.</p>
              <p>2. Must think of the good of each other. If not, wait for partnership end.</p>
              <p>3. Must have good financial arrangements (Rental pricing). If not, wait for partnership end.</p>

              <p>getting a understanding partner is very important and very lucky</p>
              <p>Surely, one have to give more than the other.... If the other never gives, always take... then it is only one way traffic... no good for a working relationship.</p>
              <p>Both must be having the same frequency as you guys tend to see each other regularly (upon shift changing).  Communication comes in and solve the unhappiness.  </p>

              <p>However, communication can also end up more worst if bad communication is involved. To be frank, all of us are earning a living of more or less of the same trade,  relationship alway start with a good bang, then come the storm where differences become apparent, that is the time to determine if you want to carry on the relationship.</p>
              <p>Once you are able to overcome the storming period, the spring comes along, both would had a good understanding of each other habituals and style, learnt to live with it and move on happily. To break it into pts</p>
              <p>Relationship works in such a way</p>
              <p>1. Introduction (lots of smiling and good gesture, courtesy and polite)</p>
              <p>2. Storm brewing (found out each other faults and bad habits)</p>
              <p>3. Storming (engage in unpleasant words of exchange, shown of dislike thru words and action, showing true color of each other, ego and pride take stage, most dangerous stage in relationship)</p>
              <p>4. After the storm, clear weather, nice and cooling effect like spring with rainbow (this only happen if both are able to overcome the storm, if not, the relationship would had stopped at the storming period) </p>
              <p>5. Consolidating period, each do some soul searching themselves, change to suit each other in the best possible way</p>

              <p>It's very true what Bowah has said, but sometimes there must also be an ending.</p>
              <p>I drove for my hirer for 2 years, the last year hoping he will be less calculative, but it doesn't seem to change. Sure he got help me like yourself, but I also got help him.</p>
              <p>But when he finally 'put the straw that broke the camel's back'. I decided enough must be enough and quit. No use driving everyday thinking of how you wanna quit or how to fire the guy. Everyday your stress or frustration increase. Your conscience is clear, you never do anything wrong to him, why must you be the one with the pressure?</p>
              <p>He cannot turn around and say you fucked up, if he do you have all the evidence and right to f him back.</p>
              <p>As a relief it's easier, just return key and game is over, but maybe as hirer you must ask him to return key, and hope he don't do monkey tricks, but remember always that you are not the owner, the taxi company is, if he do something silly, he is the one they'll go after.</p>
              <p>My advice is:</p>
              <p>a) You just tell him to return key immediately.</p>
              <p>b) You give him 3-7 days notice, you can give some excuse, say your brother just got license and you'll be sharing with him instead, sorry but bo pian.</p>
              <p>c) You tell him you're returning the cab, you got other lobang and will quit in a few days. If later he find out you still drive and f you, then you f back and say why you stop him. Most will not bother, this is part and parcel of Tdriving as a relief, hirers come and go, so most probably he'll move on.</p>
              <p>d) Or tell the company that you want to stop him, they will contact him and ask him to return the key to them. If he doesn't. They will also tell him not to drive anymore because if he does, he will lose his license and be refered to the police.</p>

              <p>Some hirers who thrown me out, end up met them on the road,  wanted me back, saying that their other reliefs are all like seibei jialat, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>So as a new hirer, it is also good to learn to terminate some reliefs, learn how to terminate them and then, find others. From here, you can at least compare all the bad apples.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p> It part of a taxi trade if you as a hirer need a relief unless you  can OMO all the way.</p>

              <p>of course you can't spell out everything, during partnership process, notice something, highlight, not comment or complain. most people like to keep small matter and wait till cannot loon, then voice out, by time, the kind of voice out tone could be different and result unhappiness to surface.</p>
              <p>like i said before, if partnership with who ever person causes many problem, it is always good to break early and still maintain good friendship</p>

                              <p>Relationship between Hirer and Relief not so simple like
              Relationship between Taxi Co. and Hirer.</p>
              <p>Taxi Co. and Hirer got all the conditions laid down. You step
              out of line, they shoot you. They say "A", you "A"; they say "B",
              you "B". You want to Sia Lan with them, you have to think of your
              deposit.</p>
              <p>Hirer and Relief partnership, most of the time only a few
              conditions or conditions not clear. And when partner got problems,
              got to know how to do people (choa laang, close one eye and
              give way) Or when shit happens, have to deviate from
              conditions or prepare for end of partnership. If behave like Taxi
              Co and hirer, for sure the partnership will not last. </p>
              <p>Very difficult to find good partners. A good partner is one who
              do not think about you handover late, but thinking maybe you got
              problems. But the other party must prove himself to be good partner
              too.</p>

              IMO b4 starting partnership must set the rules. Give &amp; take can begin from there.

              <p>I drove for my hirer for 2 years, the last year hoping he will

              <p>But when he finally 'put the straw that broke the camel's back'.
              I decided enough must be enough and quit. No use driving everyday
              thinking of how you wanna quit or how to fire the guy. Everyday
              your stress or frustration increase. Your conscience is clear, you
              never do anything wrong to him, why must you be the one with the
              pressure?</p>
              <p>He cannot turn around and say you fucked up, if he do you have
              all the evidence and right to f him back.</p>
              <p>As a relief it's easier, just return key and game is over, but
              maybe as hirer you must ask him to return key, and hope he don't do
              monkey tricks, but remember always that you are not the owner, the
              taxi company is, if he do something silly, he is the one they'll go
              after.</p>
              <p>My advice is:</p>
              <p>a) You just tell him to return key immediately.</p>
              <p>b) You give him 3-7 days notice, you can give some excuse, say
              your brother just got license and you'll be sharing with him
              instead, sorry but bo pian.</p>
              <p>c) You tell him you're returning the cab, you got other lobang
              and will quit in a few days. If later he find out you still drive
              and f you, then you f back and say why you stop him. Most will not
              bother, this is part and parcel of Tdriving as a relief, hirers
              come and go, so most probably he'll move on.</p>
              <p>d) Or tell the company that you want to stop him, they will
              contact him and ask him to return the key to them. If he doesn't.
              They will also tell him not to drive anymore because if he does, he
              will lose his license and be refered to the police.</p>

              Bro, i think i'll tell him honestly if i decided to partner my new relief. No point bluffing, worse come to worse, i tell him my new relief do not wana wait for the 1 week notice. Anyway i will refund current relief all the $$ he give.
              
              I don't take advantage of him in this case lo.
