              <p>The dog owner whose pet chihuahua was run over by a taxi has refuted the
               cabby's claims that he was part of a trio who attacked him after the 
              incident on Feb 8.<br><br>Chef Toh Meng Teck, 40, told The Straits Times
               that he was heading home from a supermarket with his girlfriend and 
              Lucky, his pet chihuahua, and stopped to cross Ang Mo kio Street 12 when
               67-year-old cabby Mr Ling Ah Yen hit the dog.<br><br>Mr Toh then chased
               after the taxi and shouted to the driver to stop. When he got to the 
              cabby, he told him about the dog's death but flared up upon hearing the 
              driver's response. "He said: 'Don't be agitated; it's just a dog'", Mr 
              Toh recounted.<br><br>He went on to say that it was two passers-by who 
              appeared and attacked the cabby, and that he was restrained by two 
              acquaintances who ran over from a coffee shop. He said: "Even if I'd 
              wanted to beat him, I couldn't because I have a frozen shoulder".<br><br>The
               police were called down to the scene by the taxi's passengers but Mr 
              Toh said that after being asked by a police officer if he had attacked 
              Mr Ling, to which he said no, he has not been contacted by the 
              authorities since.</p>

              <p>wrong mean wrong, even the lady who lost two kids say she has forgiven the lorry driver. Sadly, many Singaporeans value the word "sorry" more than their life. To me peolpe who dare not say sorry are worst than cowards.</p>

              <p>Although I drive taxi, but i cant defend fellow drivers in this aspect, so many times, taxi refuse to give way when I'm a pedestrain walking across the zebra crossing.</p>
              <p>Did the taxi driver forget his highway code? slow down and prepare to stop on sight of a pedestrain, even if the pedestrain is jaywalking.</p>

              <p>As long as you are the first to lay you hand on someone, you are deem wrong.</p>
              <p>The dog issue is another issue, most properly, you can get a lawyer to sue the TD.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, some had correctly said, the dog was not leashed, therefore the dog can wander along the pedestrian crossing and being small, Taxi uncle may not be able to notice.</p>
              <p>The laws will then look into the intention, for Taxi Uncle, there is no intention to hit the dog, which is running in every direction given without leashing, there is no intention of the TD wanting to hit the dog, this is purely an Accident, ACCIDENT.</p>
              <p>Perhap the old man expression could had agitated the owner, and I respect the saddness of the owner having lost his lovely pet, but to beat up someone, that is confirm Wrong.</p>
