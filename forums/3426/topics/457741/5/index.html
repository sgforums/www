              <p>I feel you over rated yourself a wee too much abt yr background haha. Graduates these days are going for a dozen a dime. Jealous will be the least in those that responded to yr post but curiosity perhaps.  </p>
              <p>I dun disagree when you peg 6k as a reasonable standard of living but to achieve that as an avg cabbie sounds somewhat stretched. It's good to plan ahead but didn't you realize that being a cabbie is a deadend job? You mentioned that a number of yr peers are hitting no less than 10k, did they shared with you how they achieve those astronomical figures? Perhaps 10k seems little to you but to achieve that figure being a taxi driver? If I can really hit 10k consistently not to mention 15k, I'll keep my mouth real shut. Call me selfish or whatever but that's life. Since you cant afford to waste time during yr transition, with yr qualifications n experience why waste yr talent by driving a cab? Go for bigger things immediately, skies the limit :) </p>
              <p>Most of us drive taxis to put food on the table n pay bills, realistic n achievable. Tips n tricks to a simple life pls look ah koon's thread, what u're looking for requires more than starting a gullible thread. Perhaps asking the PM is a better option, if u're cute enough maybe he ask his sec to dish out all $xxx jobs to you. </p>

                  to us, from our past experience, 6k sounds reasonable and fits the

                  than that into the future of course and we need to plan ahead. a
                  number of our peers are already doing no less than 10k so we do not
                  think its unreasonable if we put in efforts. we have heard from
                  some associates who are high level management and secretaries,
                  sometimes they arrange jobs for $XXX so we feel its achievable, but

                  we would be moving on to bigger things soon, but we just need a

              <p>hello all i and my colleague plan to get our vl and become
              partners or separate drivers depending. we have this feeling our
              company may be adjusting hr costings soon, though both of us have
              advance qualifications we fear we might have some difficulty
              landing ideal jobs immediately, so we decided why not give TD a
              shot. hopefully it can tide us over in the short to medium term,
              but we are not expecting it to be a long term thing. becos we would
              not want too many of our peers to find out we have been involved in
              this, then there would be difficult questions later on.</p>
              <p>we did some planning, we both have families and housing, the
              cars our kins or relatives could take over for the meantime. we
              came across this here and did some reading up. we saw the recent
              discussions about 6k which we take as the minimum income, but with
              our respective expenses, we think we need at least 8 to 10k to be
              anyway helpful. anything above that would be nice, like 12 or 15k
              but we would be completely new and so not sure what could be the
              tricks of the trade so we hope some of the more experienced drivers
              here can help out a couple fellow Singaporeans on their way. any
              advice or tips will be sincerely appreciated and not be
              forgotten.</p>
