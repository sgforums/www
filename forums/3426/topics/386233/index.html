              <p class="hn-byline">(AFP) – <span class="hn-date">1 hour ago</span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE — The number of tourists visiting Singapore rose in November at its fastest rate this year, the government said Monday.</p>
              <p>The city-state welcomed 830,000 foreign visitors during the month, up 8.4 percent on the same period last year, the country's tourism board said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Tourist numbers slumped in the first eight months of 2009 as people cut back on business and leisure travel due to the worldwide economic downturn, but started growing again in September.</p>
              <p>Visitors from Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Australia and India accounted for over half of the arrivals in November, the board said.</p>
              <p>Singapore is aiming for up to 9.5 million visitors this year, generating an expected 12.0-12.5 billion Singapore dollars (8.6-9.0 billion US) in revenue.</p>
              <p>It received 10.1 million visitors last year, missing its target of 10.8 million as travel slowed in the second half due to the global slump.</p>

              <p>THE year started badly but a strong second half pushed Changi to end 2009 with a total passenger haul of 37.2 million.</p>
              <p>This was just 1.3 per cent less than a year earlier.</p>
              <p>At the height of the global economic crisis, there were fears that Changi's total traffic for 2009 could dip by more than 8 per cent.</p>
              <p>In December alone, 3.83 million passengers walked through Changi's gates - the highest ever for any single month.</p>
              <p>Despite the economic downturn, the airport also handled more flights last year; a total of 240,360 or 3.6 per cent higher than in 2008.</p>
              <p>Changi Airport's chief executive officer Lee Seow Hiang said: 'We are beginning 2010 on a strong footing, and expect the improving global economy and exiting tourism developments in Singapore this year to have a positive impact on Changi's performance.'</p>

              <p>this is how i judge , if its a pick and go situation , i think most wont complain. those who kpkb most likely waited for very long . when i was queuing regularly at the ap last time , i had so many AP- simei , tampines trips that i totally gave up going there , it came to a point where the moment i get into my cab to drive , i expect a simei , tampines , flora road , anything further is a bonus hahaha</p>
              <p>though i think its wrong for drivers to vent their frustration ( not your fault u stay simei right? tio bo? ) but maybe juz try to understand a bit. give N take la.afterall its a short journey :)</p>
              <p>frankly , not many are generous like you to give $15 if the driver gives good service.most will pay the exact fare ( 5 cts also take back ).</p>
              <p>ONLY once did i encounter one lady pax , she boarded my cab and immediately apologised , i was like huh? wtf? sorry 4 wad? she said ' uncle dont be angry , im going to bedok , u take this 15 dollars , confirm more than meter fare , sorry.</p>
              <p>u think this kinda pax a lot? bro maybe 1 in 5000 la.</p>
