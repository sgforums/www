With the revision, the CBD taxi rule that requires taxis to only pick-up and drop-off passengers at taxi stands and on the driveways of buildings along roads where public buses ply will be shortened by 2.5 hours to between 7.30am and 8pm (Monday to Saturday, except Public Holidays), from 7am to 10pm currently.</p>
              <p>2. The taxi Vocational License Points System (VLPS) for non-compliance with the CBD taxi rule will also be revised. From 1 March 2012, the existing 3 demerit point penalty for breach of the CBD taxi rule will be removed and the fine increased from $100 to $130, to also bring it in line with the full-day bus lane penalty.</p>
              <p>3. The shorter hours will allow taxi drivers to pick-up and drop-off passengers along roads where public buses ply, and for passengers to hail a taxi along these roads earlier.</p>
              <p>4. These adjustments were made in consultation with taxi companies and taxi driver associations, who expressed support for the changes and agreed that it strikes a balance between minimising safety risks and addressing the operational concerns of taxi drivers when driving in the CBD.</p>
              <p>5. Mr Colin Lim, LTA's Group Director of Vehicle and Transit Licensing said, "We have reviewed the operational hours and traffic situation following feedback from the National Taxi Association (NTA) and taxi companies. Our key consideration for the CBD rule is safety. As traffic in the CBD is lighter after 8pm, we have relaxed the CBD taxi rule to align with the full-day bus lane operational hours. This balances safety concerns while providing taxi drivers and passengers with more convenience."</p>
              <p>6. Said President, National Taxi Association (NTA) Mr Wee Boon Kim: "We are glad that LTA has listened and considered NTA's feedback carefully in their decision-making on the easing of CBD rules. This refinement and shortening of hours on the pick-up and drop-off of passengers inside the CBD area would benefit not just our drivers, but also the passengers. It would make it easier and more convenient for passengers to hail a cab and alight near their destination. At the same time, we are pleased that LTA has decided to withdraw the demerit points accorded to drivers who breach the rules."</p>
              <p>7. Since the implementation of the CBD taxi rule on 1 March 2008, the number of taxi stands in the CBD has increased to 121, up from 80 previously. Taxi stands are located within 250 metres or about a 5-minute walk from major buildings within the CBD to make it easier for taxi passengers to hail a taxi from a taxi stand, and for taxi drivers to pick-up or drop-off their passengers safely.</p>
              <p>8. In addition to taxi stands, taxi drivers can pick-up and drop-off passengers at the driveways of about 220 buildings in the CBD.</p>

              between 7.30am and 8pm (Monday to Saturday, except Public
              Holidays), from 7am to 10pm currently.</span></p>
              <p>2. The taxi Vocational License Points System (VLPS) for
              non-compliance with the CBD taxi rule will also be revised. From 1
              March 2012, the existing 3 demerit point penalty for breach of the
              CBD taxi rule will be removed and the fine increased from $100 to
              $130, to also bring it in line with the full-day bus lane

              <p>3. The shorter hours will allow taxi drivers to pick-up and

              safety risks and addressing the operational concerns of taxi
              drivers when driving in the CBD.</p>
              <p>5. Mr Colin Lim, LTA's Group Director of Vehicle and Transit
              Licensing said, "We have reviewed the operational hours and traffic

              2008, the number of taxi stands in the CBD has increased to 121, up
              from 80 previously. Taxi stands are located within 250 metres or

              <p>"Our key consideration for the CBD rule is safety. As traffic in
              the CBD is lighter after 8pm, we have relaxed the CBD taxi rule to
              align with the full-day bus lane operational hours. This balances
              safety concerns while providing taxi drivers and passengers with
              more convenience."</p>
              <p>only idiots can give this kind of excuse!</p>
              <p>is he implying that private car drivers are safer driver than
              taxi drivers?</p>
