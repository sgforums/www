              <p>Day or night shift depends on your registered hirer.  If he wants to drive day.. then you have to drive night...</p>
              <p>If you wants to drive day shift - then you have to state your shift specifying to the potential partner. You can do it Online (some TD's website) or thru taxi company.</p>
              <p>If you intend to drive OMO, then you can request for a cab from the company, after that, you can search for a night relief if you felt tired driving alone.</p>
              <p>Day shift has it advantages (got time for family in the evening). Few of the disadvantages is the HEAT from the Sun, Heavy traffic Jams during peak hour, also Many White Monkey hiding at Over-head bridge with a speed cam.</p>
              <p>Night shift needs alot of sacrifices (no social life). the advantages are the opposite of the disadvantage mentioned above... except for traffic jams.</p>
              <p>As TD income is not fixed = it depends on the trips/luck of that particular day..</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we encourage fellow TDs not to reveal their daily income online... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> the reason....? you guess...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> ( this is a national forum page - every one can access into this page - including the taxman ).  lol.</p>
              <p>If you have a Full-time Job at the moment... stay with it.... Unless you are unemployed and having a Driving Licence, then go for the Vocational Licence (that is TDVL).</p>
              <p>As long as you are honesty to yourself, don't  overcharge, always ask the pax for his/her preferred routes, then you should be fine...</p>

              <p>this...</p>
              <p>you should go for some TD's gathering ( spend some time to know more ), also mingles with fellow TDs are important ( sometimes, they will call you if there are no cabs at airport etc.  or some traffic information ).  as i did mentioned on the above few threads, we should'nt reveal the $$ you clocked.</p>
              <p>to maximize income, you should join a taxi-stand group (for normal), a Limo-Group if you are a limo driver.  with this walky grouping, you will probably get some trips rather than waiting for your MDT (Modile Data Terminal) to allocate jobs to you.  hence, your income will increase gradually.</p>
              <p>As long as you ON YOUR METER for every trip and NOT ADD ON SURCHARGES you are NOT ALLOWED to add... then it is legal... (except for limo drivers who occasionally have limo jobs from hotels or from Limo grouping - private arrangement).</p>
              <p>Nobody can be a millionaire by cheating a few dollars (by adding additional surcharges to the meter)... he will be caught (one day) if the pax is smart.  (and when he is caught, he will plead for leniency), why put yourself in this situation ?</p>

              <p>let get this straight (One more time).</p>
              <p>Hirer can be a sole driver (hence in taxi terms, we called him OMO)... he has 24hrs to himself (but normally working hours is ard 16-18hrs).  Driving cab need sufficient rest.</p>
              <p>Coy will hold taxi's driving conditions (exclude for wear and tear) solely to the Hirer of the cab.  Hence, company will deduct daily rental from the Hirer's bank's a/c.</p>
              <p>As driving OMO is uneconomical (cab likely to be parked at your CP for some hrs when you are resting), many hirers will search for a comparable partner to lessen their rental liabilities.</p>
              <p>Conclusion = Hirer can choose to be OMO or not... depends on himself. </p>
              <p>clear ?</p>
