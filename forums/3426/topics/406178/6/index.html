              <p>Wah, Xinyan... you're like popping up everywhere man...</p>
              <p>LOL...</p>
              <p>After excursion, wait at least 1 week for the actual test.  Then, after test, wait at least 3 weeks before collection of license.  That's my experience for Comfort.  Not too sure about SMRT but should be similar bah, since you taking the online course.</p>

              <p><br>I took the online course from SMRT as well sometime in May or June this year.  You already know the date for the test when you book your excursion right?  I think is the next thurs or friday.  Remember to take the tips from the excursion, take down everything he say, a lot of it come out in the papers.  Try not to fail, coz you have to wait for approximately 1 mth for the next retest, at least that's what happen to me, failing the landmarks paper by 1 point!!  And the next retest available date is sometimes 1 mth later. </p>
              <p>After you pass, the STA guys tell me to wait for SMRT to contact me, but I kan cheong and contact them first and was asked to go and take photo the next day, and license should be ready in a week time or so.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>After 5 years, sure got lots of problem, even private cars got problem, not only taxi, that is why private car after 5 years, value depreciate alots, usually people will trade in to get a new one before 5 years.</p>
              <p>Lucky you know when to stop and call for repair, repairer efficiency good is one thing, but effective is another, for 2 months u go in for major servicing, that is not very effective, and if brakes give way all together on the road, it can be very dangerous, so take care. Best is ask for a new car and register at the waiting list</p>
