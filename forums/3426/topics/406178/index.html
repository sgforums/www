              <p>Ok, let me start the topic about this taxi coy call SMRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know many bros out there may have some unpleasant experiences about this coy when they hand over the keys and Uncle Pool always bash about it. Haha!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is nothing personal &amp; I will not mind if bros here continue to bash SMRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since Uncle Pool says not many SMRT TDs here and I am 1 of the minority, I will share with bros here about my experience with SMRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many bros here says SMRT call booking system is no good. I agree as there are only about 1400+ call bookings per day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But whenever I am in the CDB area, there will be calls from the National Museum of SIngapore. 
                  
                  You know why?? Because there is a SMRT standee at the lobby &amp; pax only call SMRT. Haha!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have been lucky as every other day my MDT will have a CDB calls sometimes with destinations within the CBD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am also with their Central Limo group 6, and this 1 really benefits me. 
                  
                  SMRT have counters at T2 &amp; T3 for SQ cabin crews. So whenever I am near airport, I can try the arrival hall at T2 or T3 for PNG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fyi, the pick up fare is the same as the airport Q.
                  
                  Of course, there will be many short trips but on tues got 1 Jap SQ chio bu to Bukit Merah View &amp; thurs during peak hr, I got 1 fare from T3 to Queen St. This cabin crew reside in JB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course like what Teolk posted, the SMRT lounge for drivers is 1st class. They also have people who are visually handicap to provide shoulder or foot massage at $20 for 20 mins, i think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So much for now.</p>

              <p>Wah!! This looks like an interview leh!! You not from any newspaper hor??</p>
              <p>Anyway,</p>
              <p>I am only 18 months as a TD &amp; I drove a crown for my 1st 3 months.</p>
              <p><br>I don't know what's your definition of successful?? I cannot say I am 1.</p>
              <p>I believe many bros here are good in their trade, whether merc or normal cabs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Currently I drive night &amp; I believe nights TD can make more abeit in a shorter time.</p>
              <p>2. I join Lakeview &amp; SMRT Central Limo &amp; private jobs from airlines &amp; hotels.</p>
              <p>3. That's true. If you are 1st time TD, why do you want to have high overhead cost???</p>
              <p>4. Uncle Pool will say " Siao ah, new bird wanna drive merc ". haha!!</p>
              <p>5. SMRT have many corporate jobs &amp; Lakeview has many inter CBD jobs. But Lakeview has help me to secure many private jobs. So it is the best combination for me right now.</p>

              <p>Believe me.. at most times, you will earn more than CDG cabbies
              (becos they spend too much time waiting for a MDT call).</p>

              <p> I totally agree with you. Like I say in another thread, the taxi is just a tool for us to ply our trade, just drive with the right attitude &amp; I don't care about which coy I'm with.</p>

              <p>Today after dropping a pax at Downtown East I head straight to AP but
               all terminals have long Q of taxis &amp; no cabin crews to pick.</p>
              <p>As I have a job at 930pm in Orchard, I thought of driving empty to Havelock Rd where the LV members are gathered.</p>
              <p>Then, my MDT "ping" with a call booking from Changi Naval Base with no destination.</p>
              <p>I bo chap just press 5 mins. I just pray no Ah wood or Ah rong.</p>
              <p>Pax on board, Jalan Minyah at York Hill.</p>
              <p>I said "Thank you, Mr Wong". The pax look puzzle.</p>

              <p>That's what I thought.</p>
              <p>Whenever I am on the way to AP, I would press STC early. I have took few bookings from there. Surprising, those few bookings were not to the east side. Mostly nearer to town.</p>

              <p>Ok, let me start the topic about this taxi coy call SMRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know many bros out there may have some unpleasant experiences about this coy when they hand over the keys and Uncle Pool always bash about it. Haha!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is nothing personal &amp; I will not mind if bros here continue to bash SMRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since Uncle Pool says not many SMRT TDs here and I am 1 of the minority, I will share with bros here about my experience with SMRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many bros here says SMRT call booking system is no good. I agree as there are only about 1400+ call bookings per day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But whenever I am in the CDB area, there will be calls from the National Museum of SIngapore. You know why?? Because there is a SMRT standee at the lobby &amp; pax only call SMRT. Haha!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have been lucky as every other day my MDT will have a CDB calls sometimes with destinations within the CBD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am also with their Central Limo group 6, and this 1 really benefits me. SMRT have counters at T2 &amp; T3 for SQ cabin crews. So whenever I am near airport, I can try the arrival hall at T2 or T3 for PNG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fyi, the pick up fare is the same as the airport Q. Of course, there will be many short trips but on tues got 1 Jap SQ chio bu to Bukit Merah View &amp; thurs during peak hr, I got 1 fare from T3 to Queen St. This cabin crew reside in JB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course like what Teolk posted, the SMRT lounge for drivers is 1st class. They also have people who are visually handicap to provide shoulder or foot massage at $20 for 20 mins, i think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So much for now.</p>

              <p>either not happy with CDG becos their old mercedes are given them problems (CDG not willing to give them a upgraded cab - 50 new mercedes was released late last year).</p>
              <p>SMRT Premier Dep looking for experienced Mercedes Limo cabbies to upgrade to Chryslers.. most of these cross-over drivers are guaranteed a new cab.</p>
              <p>SMRT chrylsers cabbies was a hit at the Airport Limo Q (when operated by SMRT), this also attracted many cross-over, as it is a Meter + $20.  (but since TOA took over the Airport Limo counters, Chryslers are not in their list of Limo required.)</p>
