They obeyed. <br>To the Japanese he said,' It's the consensus.'

The DJ told them that they only have English songs and told them to re-select another song. The Ah Bengs were very angry and kicked up a bigfuss, claiming the DJ was insulting them. The manager had to intervene in order to calm them down. Finally, after long talk with Ah Bengs, the manager found out that Ah Bengs actually asking for the song 'Unchained Melody' by the Righteous Brothers.</p>

As they looked at the dial, they could see the number 20 down to number 2. It was then followed by a G. As they not English-educated, they were puzzled and had no idea what does the letter G mean. Suddenly one of them exclaimed excitedly and hit G. When they finally reached the ground floor, the other Ah Lian was so impressed and asked the first Ah Lian, 'Wah low!!!, how you know one?' The first Ah Lian reply smugly, 'Easy lah.. G for Gero mah...'</p>

Lee KY's wife said, 'C'mon, don't you know that we only hire lawyers with surnames beginning with 'Lee' only? Of course, we can't hire Santa Singh!' <br>So Lee KY told the bad news to Santa Singh about his rejection. <br>Few days later, Santa Singh came back to the same company and request for another interview and Lee KY said, 'Look Santa, I have already told you that we only hire.......' <br>when Santa Singh interrupted him and said, 'I know, I know.

              <p>Subject: Business Lesson <br>  <br>Kevin wanted to have sex with a girl in his office,<br>but she belonged to someone else...</p>
              <p>One day, Kevin got so frustrated that he went up to <br>her and said, "I'll give you a $100 if you let me <br>have sex with you. But the girl said NO.</p>
              <p>Kevin said, "I'll be fast. I'll throw the money on <br>the floor, you bend down, and I'll be finished by the <br>time you pick it up. "</p>
              <p>She thought for a moment and said that she would have <br>to consult her boyfriend... So she called her <br>boyfriend and told him the story.</p>
              <p>Her boyfriend says, "Ask him for $200, pick up the <br>money very fast, he won't even be able to get his<br>pants down."</p>
              <p>So she agrees and accepts the proposal. Half an hour <br>goes by, and the boyfriend is waiting for his <br>girlfriend to call.</p>
              <p>Finally, after 45 minutes, the boyfriend calls and <br>asks what happened.</p>
              <p>She responded, "The bastard used coins!"</p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>&gt; &gt; First time sex<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night to<br>&gt; &gt; meet, and have dinner<br>&gt; &gt; with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl<br>&gt; &gt; announces to her<br>&gt; &gt; boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and<br>&gt; &gt; make love for the<br>&gt; &gt; first time. The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex<br>&gt; &gt; before, so he<br>&gt; &gt; takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. He<br>&gt; &gt; tells the pharmacist<br>&gt; &gt; it's his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy<br>&gt; &gt; for about an hour. He<br>&gt; &gt; tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and<br>&gt; &gt; sex. At the<br>&gt; &gt; register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms<br>&gt; &gt; he'd like to buy, a<br>&gt; &gt; 3-pack, 10 -pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the<br>&gt; &gt; family pack because<br>&gt; &gt; he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time<br>&gt; &gt; and all.<br>&gt; &gt; That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents<br>&gt; &gt; house and meets his<br>&gt; &gt; girlfriend at the door. 'Oh, I'm so excited for you<br>&gt; &gt; to meet my parents,<br>&gt; &gt; come<br>&gt; &gt; on in!' The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner<br>&gt; &gt; table where the<br>&gt; &gt; girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to<br>&gt; &gt; say grace and bows his<br>&gt; &gt; head.<br>&gt; &gt; A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with<br>&gt; &gt; his head down.<br>&gt; &gt; 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.<br>&gt; &gt; Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the<br>&gt; &gt; girlfriend leans over and<br>&gt; &gt; whispers to the boyfriend,<br>&gt; &gt; 'I had no idea you were this religious.'<br>&gt; &gt; The boy turns, and whispers back, 'I had no idea your<br>&gt; &gt; father was a<br>&gt; &gt; pharmacist.'</p></div>

              <p> 57 CENT CHURCH <br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; A little girl stood near a small church from which she had been turned<br>&gt; &gt; away because it was 'too crowded.'<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 'I can't go to Sunday School,' she sobbed to the pastor as he walked by.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Seeing her shabby, unkempt appearance, the pastor guessed the reason<br>&gt; &gt; and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her<br>&gt; &gt; in the Sunday school class. The child was so happy that they found<br>&gt; &gt; room for her, and she went to bed that night thinking of the children<br>&gt; &gt; who have no place to worship Jesus.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Some two years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor<br>&gt; &gt; tenement buildings. Her parents called for the kindhearted pastor who<br>&gt; &gt; had befriended their daughter to handle the final arrangements.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; As her poor little body was being moved, a worn and crumpled red purse<br>&gt; &gt; was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some trash dump.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Inside was found 57 cents and a note, scribbled in childish<br>&gt; &gt; handwriting, which read: 'This is to help build the little church<br>&gt; &gt; bigger so more children can go to Sunday School.'<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; For two years she had saved for this offering of love.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he<br>&gt; &gt; would do. Carrying this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the<br>&gt; &gt; pulpit, he told the story of her unselfish love and devotion.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; He challenged his deacons to get busy and raise enough money for the<br>&gt; &gt; larger building.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; But the story does not end there...<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; A newspaper learned of the story and published It. It was read by a<br>&gt; &gt; wealthy realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many<br>&gt; &gt; thousands.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered to sell it<br>&gt; &gt; to the little church for 57 cents.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Church members made large donations. Checks came from far and wide.<br>&gt; &gt; Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,<br>&gt; &gt; 000.00--a huge sum for that time (near the turn of the century). Her<br>&gt; &gt; unselfish love had paid large dividends.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; When you are in the city of Philadelphia , look up Temple Baptist<br>&gt; &gt; Church , with a seating capacity of 3,300. And be sure to visit Temple<br>&gt; &gt; University , where thousands of students are educated.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday<br>&gt; &gt; School building which houses hundreds of beautiful children, built so<br>&gt; &gt; that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside during<br>&gt; &gt; Sunday school time.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; In one of the rooms of this building may be seen the picture of the<br>&gt; &gt; sweet face of the little girl whose 57 cents, so sacrificially saved,<br>&gt; &gt; made such remarkable history. Alongside of it is a portrait of her<br>&gt; &gt; kind pastor, Dr. Russell H. Conwell, author of the book, 'Acres of<br>&gt; &gt; Diamonds'.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; This is a true story, which goes to show WHAT GOD CAN DO WITH 57 CENTS.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Please send this back. (You'll see why.)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; St. Theresa Prayer (cannot be deleted)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; REMEMBER to make a wish before you read the prayer. That's all you<br>&gt; &gt; have to do. There is nothing attached. This is a powerful novena.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Just send this to four people and let me know what happens on the fourth day....<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Do not break this, please. Prayer is one of the best free gifts we<br>&gt; &gt; receive. There is no cost but a lot of reward.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; (This is true)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; (Did you make a wish?)<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; If you don't make a wish, it won't come true. Last Chance to Make a Wish.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; May today there be peace within.<br>&gt; &gt; May you trust your highest power that you are exactly where you are meant to be.<br>&gt; &gt; May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass on the love<br>&gt; &gt; that has been given to you.<br>&gt; &gt; May you be content knowing you are a child of God.<br>&gt; &gt; Let this presence settle into our bones, and allow your soul the<br>&gt; &gt; freedom to sing and dance. It is there for each and every one of you.</p>

              <p> A woman  arrived at the Gates of Heaven. While she was waiting  <br>for Saint Peter to  greet her, she peeked through the gates.</p>
              <p>She saw a  beautiful banquet table. Sitting all around were her parents and all the  other people she had loved and who had died before her. They saw her and  began calling greetings to her "Hello - How are you! We've been waiting  for you! Good to see you." <br>When Saint  Peter came by, the woman said to him, "This is such a wonderful place! How  do I get in?" "You have to spell a word," Saint Peter told her.</p>
              <p>"Which  word?" the woman asked. <br>"Love."</p>
              <p>The woman  correctly spelled "Love" and Saint Peter welcomed her into Heaven. <br>About a year  later, Saint Peter came to the woman and asked her  to watch the Gates of  Heaven for him that day.</p>
              <p><br>While the  woman was guarding the Gates of Heaven, her husband arrived. "I'm  surprised to see you," the woman said. "How have you been?" <br>"Oh, I've  been doing pretty well since you died," her husband told her. "I married  the beautiful young nurse who took care of you while you were ill. And  then I won the multi-state lottery. I sold the little house you and I  lived in and bought a huge mansion. And my wife and I travelled all around  the world. We were on vacation in Cancunand I went water skiing today. I fell and hit  my head, and here I am. What a bummer! How do I get in?" <br>"You have to  spell a word," the woman told him.<br>"Which  word?" her husband asked.</p>
              <p>"Czechoslovakia."</p>
              <p>Moral of the  story:  Never make a woman angry... There will be Hell to pay  later!</p>

              <p>A first-grade teacher was having trouble with one of her students.</p>
              <p>Teacher: What is your problem?</p>
              <p>Boy: I'm too smart for the first-grade. My sister is in the third-grade and<br>I'm smarter than she is. I think I should be in the third-grade too.</p>
              <p>The teacher took the boy to the principal's office. While the Boy waited in<br>the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation<br>was.</p>
              <p>The principal told her that he would give the boy a test and if he failed<br>to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first-grade and<br>behave. She agreed.</p>
              <p>The boy was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he<br>agreed to take the test.</p>
              <p>Principal: What is 3 x 3?<br>Boy: 9</p>
              <p>Principal: What is 6 x 6?<br>Boy: 36</p>
              <p>And so it went with every question the principal thought a third-grade<br>should know. "I think the boy can go to the third-grade", said the<br>principal. The teacher said she had some of her own questions to ask. The<br>principal and the boy agreed.</p>
              <p>Teacher: What is it that a cow has four and I have only two?<br>Boy: (after a moment) Legs.</p>
              <p>Teacher: What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?<br>Boy: Pockets.</p>
              <p>Teacher: What starts with a C and ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious<br>and contains thin whitish liquid?<br>Boy: Coconut.</p>
              <p>Teacher : What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?<br>The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the<br>answer, the boy was already answering.<br>Boy: Bubblegum</p>
              <p>Teacher: What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a<br>dog does on three legs?<br>The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the<br>answer...Boy: Shake hands.</p>
              <p>Teacher: Now I will ask some "Who am I" sort of questions, okay?<br>Boy: Yep.</p>
              <p>Teacher: You stick your poles inside me. You tie me down to get me up. I<br>get wet before you do.<br>Boy: Tent</p>
              <p>Teacher: A finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you're bored. The<br>best man always has me first.<br>The Principal was looking restless, a bit tense and took one large vodka<br>peg.....<br>Boy: Wedding Ring.</p>
              <p>Teacher: I come in many sizes. When I'm not well, I drip. When you blow me,<br>you feel good.<br>Boy: Nose</p>
              <p>Teacher: I am a stiff shaft. My tip penetrates. I come with a quiver.<br>Boy: Arrow</p>
              <p>Teacher: What word starts with a 'F' and ends in 'K' that means lot of heat<br>and excitement?<br>Boy: Firetruck.</p>
              <p>Teacher: What word starts with a 'F' and ends in 'K' and if u dont get it u<br>have to use your hand?<br>Boy: Fork.</p>
              <p>Teacher : What is it that all men have one. It is longer for some men than<br>for others. The pope doesn't use his. Normally a man gives it to his wife<br>after they're married?<br>Boy: SURNAME.</p>
              <p>The principal breathed a sigh of relief and said to the teacher, "Send this<br>Boy to the University. I got the last ten questions wrong myself!</p>

              <p> Lesson 1:</p>
              <p>A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower, when the doorbell rings.</p>
              <p>The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs.</p>
              <p>When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbour.</p>
              <p>Before she says a word, Bob says, 'I'll give you $800 to drop that towel.'</p>
              <p><br>After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob, after a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 and leaves.</p>
              <p><br>The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs.</p>
              <p>When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, 'Who was that?'</p>
              <p>'It was Bob the next door neighbour,' she replies.</p>
              <p>'Great,' the husband says, 'did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?'</p>
              <p>Moral of the story:</p>
              <p>If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.</p>
              <p>Lesson 2:</p>
              <p><br>A priest offered a Nun a lift.</p>
              <p>She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident.</p>
              <p>After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg.</p>
              <p>The nun said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?'</p>
              <p>The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. <br>The nun once again said, 'Father, remember Psalm 129?'</p>
              <p>The priest apologized 'Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.'</p>
              <p>Arriving at the convent, the nun sighed heavily and went on her way.</p>
              <p>On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, 'Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.'</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: <br>If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity.</p>
              <p>Lesson 3:</p>
              <p>A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp.</p>
              <p>They rub it and a Genie comes out. <br>The Genie says, 'I'll give each of you just one wish.' <br>'Me first! Me first!' says the admin clerk. 'I want to be in the Bahamas , driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.' <br>Puff! She's gone.</p>
              <p>'Me next! Me next!' says the sales rep. 'I want to be in Hawaii , relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.'</p>
              <p>Puff! He's gone.</p>
              <p>'OK, you're up,' the Genie says to the manager. <br>The manager says, 'I want those two back in the office after lunch.'</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: <br>Always let your boss have the first say.</p>
              <p>Lesson 4</p>
              <p>An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing.</p>
              <p>A small rabbit saw the eagle and asked him, 'Can I also sit like you and do nothing?' <br>The eagle answered: 'Sure, why not.'</p>
              <p>So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the eagle and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: <br>To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.</p>
              <p><br>Lesson 5</p>
              <p>A turkey was chatting with a bull.</p>
              <p>'I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree' sighed the turkey, 'but I haven't got the energy.' <br>'Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?' replied the bull. They're packed with nutrients.'</p>
              <p>The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him enough str ength to reach the lowest branch of the tree.</p>
              <p>The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.</p>
              <p>Finally after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the top of the tree.</p>
              <p>He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the tree.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story: <br>Bull Shit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there..</p>
              <p>Lesson 6</p>
              <p>A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field.</p>
              <p>While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him.</p>
              <p>As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was.</p>
              <p>The dung was actually thawing him out!</p>
              <p>He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. <br>A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.</p>
              <p>Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.</p>
              <p>Morals of the story: <br>(1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.</p>
              <p>(2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your <br>friend.</p>
              <p>(3) And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep <br>your mouth shut!</p>
              <p><br>THUS ENDS THE FIVE MINUTE MANAGEMENT COURSE <br>And send this to five bright people who have enough sense of humor to take it!</p>

              <p>4 PROFOUND THOUGHTS BY MEN</p>
              <p><br>Thought 1</p>
              <p><br>When we are born, our mothers get the compliments and the flowers.</p>
              <p>When we are married, our brides get the presents and the publicity.</p>
              <p>When we die, our widows get the life insurance.</p>
              <p>What do women want to be liberated from?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thought 2</p>
              <p>The average man's life consists of:</p>
              <p>Twenty years of having his mother ask him where he is going, Forty years<br>of having his wife ask the same question; and at the end, the mourners<br>wondering too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thought 3</p>
              <p>A Man was walking down a street when he heard a voice from behind, "If you<br>take one more step, a brick will fall down on your head and kill you." The<br>man stopped and a big brick fell right in front of him.. The man was<br>astonished.</p>
              <p>He went on, and after a while he was going to cross the road. Once again<br>the voice shouted, "Stop! Stand still! If you take one more step a car<br>will run over you, and you will die." The man did as he was instructed,<br>just as a car came careening around the corner, barely missing him.</p>
              <p>The man asked. "Who are you?" "I am your guardian angel," the voice<br>answered. "Oh, yeah?" the man asked "And where the hell were you when I<br>got married?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the Best !!!</p>
              <p>Thought 4</p>
              <p>Everyone in the wedding ceremony was watching the radiant bride as her<br>father escorted her down the aisle to give away to the groom. They reached<br>the altar and the waiting groom; the bride kissed her father and placed<br>some thing in his hand. Everyone in the room was wondering what was given<br>to the father by the bride.</p>
              <p>The father could feel the suspense in the air and all eyes were on him to<br>divulge the secret and say something. So he announced "Ladies and<br>Gentlemen today is the luckiest day of my life." Then he raised his hands<br>with what his daughter gave him and continued, "My daughter finally,<br>finally returned my credit card to me."</p>
              <p>The whole audience including the priest erupted in laughter .......... all<br>except the poor Groom  !</p>

              <p>A chicken farmer went to a local bar, sat next to a woman and ordered a glass of champagne. <br> </p>
              <p>The woman perks up and says, 'How about that? <br> <br>I just ordered a glass of champagne, too!' <br> <br>'What a coincidence' the farmer says. <br> <br>'This is a special day for me, so I'm celebrating.' <br> <br>'This is a special day for me too, so I'm also celebrating!' says the woman. <br> <br>'What a coincidence!' says the farmer! <br> <br>As they clinked glasses the man asked, 'What are you celebrating?' <br> <br>'My husband and I have been trying for years to have a child and today my gynaecologist told me that I am pregnant!' <br> <br>'What a coincidence,' says the man. <br> <br>'I'm a chicken farmer and for years all of my hens were infertile, but today they are all laying fertilized eggs.' <br> <br>'That's great!' says the woman. <br> <br>'How did your chickens become fertile?' <br> <br>'I used a different cock,' he replied. <br> <br>The woman smiled and said, 'What a coincidence.'</p>

              <p>Pain of a married man!!!!!</p>
              <p>A woman awakes during the night to find that her husband was not in bed.</p>
              <p>She goes downstairs to look for him. She finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee in front of him.</p>
              <p>He appears to be in deep thought, just staring at the wall. She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of his coffee.</p>
              <p>"What's the matter, dear?" she whispers as she steps into the room. "Why are you down here at this time of night?"</p>
              <p>The husband looks up from his coffee, "Do you remember 20 years ago when we were dating, and you were only 18?" he asks solemnly. "Yes I do" she replies.</p>
              <p>The husband pauses; the words were not coming easily. "Do you remember when your father caught us in the garden?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, I remember" said the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.</p>
              <p>The husband continued.. "Do you remember when he showed the shotgun in my face and said, 'Either you marry my daughter, or I'll send you to jail for 20 years?"</p>
              <p>"I remember that too" she replied softly.</p>
              <p>He wiped another tear from his cheek and said, "I would have been released today!"</p>
