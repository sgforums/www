              <p>Never challenge, reason out, explain....etc  with ugly pax, they will never let you win. They know they are nasty, unreasonable...etc, but just don't give a damn on Taxi Driver. (Will you let a waiter win in a dispute in a restuarant?)</p>
              <p>Just "walk away", be firm and ask them to leave your car. Don't worries about LTA, cos worst thing can happen if the abusive continue.</p>

              <p>Depends where. If ulu ulu place I ask him fark off. But I dun collect fare. He complain also no use. Because as long as the journey is not complete I dun collect fare I am not wrong. I kanna once pax complain to CDG when I am driving relief last time. I drop him off at SLS taxi stand after picking the pax from queen street. He keep kpkb says I put 5min but arrive in 7min. Then he says can dun pay booking fee. I tulanzzz ask him to fark off. Reason....he is of a certain race....and he going to woodlands....</p>
              <p>Then CDG next day call me I go tell them off. I says pax dun want pay booking fee and according to MDT data I am only a min late. So no point carry on since there is a dispute. Then the CSO says very difficult to get cab there I tell her MY PROBLEM? If reach destination he dun want pay me booking fee how? $3.50 - levy $0.50 I go police station? I din earn booking fee still must give company $0.50? They also din do anything to me. LOL</p>

              <p>when the pax insults my intelligence or start to shout at me, tat's the time i ask them to get off. of course cannot collect fare.</p>
              <p>satisfaction is that he has to LL get off n start looking for another cab n hopefully learn tat it is in his interest to co-operate with the cabbies n not quarrel with them. i've kena complained several times by pax but when u say u were verbally abused, always no case for them.</p>
              <p>but if pax refuses to get off..tat's another story!</p>

              <p>There are alway bad days for everybody, I think people of a right mind will not go into unneccessary arguement just for the sake of a minutes or 2 lates or a dollar or 2 more.

              <p>On the other hand, some paxs I took also ask me on how to handle abusive TD, the one who will argue with them on the first sign of trouble, like wrong road taken or extra charges, once pax open the mouth only, the whole journey the TD can start to curse and swear, so, give and take, it is an equal sum. Depending on the situation and handling skills, many a times, thing can change amicably.</p>
              <p>Public relation is the most difficult job of all jobs, and unfortunately, TD is in public relation kind of job, unlike a staff who work with the software or non living object, TD deal with human, the one that can think and change as they like, from front line customer relationship job to waiter to TD to air stewardess and so on, job that deal with humans is consider stressful, you need a very discipline, mature and consultation approach inorder to make the best out of it. To make a nice guy to become you fren is nothing, but to make your enemy into your best fren or best pax is consider a Guru in Taxis driving.</p>
