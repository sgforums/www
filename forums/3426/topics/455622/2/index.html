              <p>My 2 kids (20+ years old) still staying in the HDB, so cannot rent out.</p>
              <p>5 Foreign students, earn enough to have meals and occasionally go out for good food. Want to huat, not possible.</p>
              <p>Calculations very simple.</p>
              <p>Collection from 5 students, minus Rental, Utilities, Maid, Groceries, Miscellaneous. Only left the bones.</p>
              <p>Want to huat, must have 3 to 5 Homestay, each at least 6 students.</p>
              <p>And then drive Taxi to earn extra pocket money for that special holiday or save for rainy days.</p>
              <p>Now you know why I can OMO    :)   </p>
              <p>No stress, but no good, because end up very idle. I always admire some of our hardworking brudders in this forum. How nice if I am like them.</p>

              <p> Agree .... cannot trust agencies .</p>
              <p>My case was quite frustrating .</p>
              <p>Maid ran away .... made police report ..... </p>
              <p>Engaged new maid to come 1 month , that month busy doing housework .</p>
              <p>Say it's like up front pay $XXX amount for replacement .</p>
              <p>Collection of maid has to comply with payment of total $3XXX to the agency .</p>
              <p>Hidden cost .... knnbccb .</p>
              <p>I bashed my wife infront of the Agency .</p>
              <p>"See u and your fucking big mouth , this will be the first time and last time i'll have a maid from this agency ."</p>
              <p>I dun care who is infront of her , just bashed . </p>
              <p>She and her big mouth ..... deserved to be bashed . Fucking tell her never listen .</p>
              <p>Everytime she miscue , became Dog Mother Snake , i have to clear her shit and in the end , i pay for all expenses , knnbccb . Woman damn nusiance one .</p>
              <p>Yup at home i am a bit of those type like chauvinist . </p>
              <p>I rule .</p>
              <p>With a iron hand at home . </p>
              <p>Also good , i shown to the new maid first day , who is Boss at home and his temparament .</p>
              <p> </p>
