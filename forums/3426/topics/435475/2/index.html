                                                <p>I noticed recently that more and more taxi drivers are rejecting passengers in a taxi queue and not moving off. (Clarke quay and lucky plaza especially)
              
              What should i do against these drivers? If i were to complain to LTA, Would I stand a chance?
              
              Maybe the best way to deal with it is to buy a car recorder and send the details to LTA....

              actually  i was hoping someone itchy backside, go the full length, spend own money buy recorder, spend more time install it up, then spend even more time out to stake out, if miss the chance or the shot then stake out again and again until capture the perfect scene, draft letter send, wait for reply, then take own time out go down interview, thumbprint and swear on statement..then many weeks later, received follow up letter. that everything is actually a misunderstanding. driver was reminded and then let off to continue earning a living.
              
              but this is just my theory

              i have a theory that everything is not a easy as we think it is, catching and sentencing a perpetrator, completely trusting the whistleblower who can just be a frustrated sabo king, and because there are so many ways to explain, which i wouldnt mention here. but test my theory, i hope someone would actually do through all of the above without miss. i always like to see an idea succeed, or fail, thoroughly.

              <p>Actually, i have another theory.</p>
              <p>If all taxis/cars are equipped with car recorder and everyone sends the clips of errand drivers(both normal cars and taxis) who infringe any rules regulations, we would not have many cars on the roads after 1 year.</p>
              <p>If that happens, the government will lose out on all the taxes it stands to gain. The traffic division will need to cut down on tons of jobs as well.</p>
              <p>Thus, the authorities will probably not do much against smaller issues even though they know about them.</p>
              <p>The primary concern of LTA would be safety and accident prevention rather than breaking of rules.</p>
              <p>However, i think we should still get car recorders just to protect our own interests.</p>

              <p>Locals staying in HDB usually do not take a black car. But there are a significant number of HDB dwellers staying in certain HDB estates who frequently take the black car. As a black car driver, you must know which HDB estates these are and what is the best time slot to sweep these areas.</p>
              <p>Many locals staying in condo and landed homes also like to take black car. Many foreign talents also like to take black car. These are the kind of pax you want as a TD isnt it? They already know it is $5 flag down and $0.30 jump. They got cash to pay and tips to spare sometimes.</p>
              <p>Frequently I see a sampan stopping behind me thinking the road side pax will avoid my black car and go behind for the cheaper taxi. But no, the road side pax rather take my black car than the sampan. And this happens much more frequently than u would like to believe.</p>
              <p>We as TD do not need pax with no money. Pax with no money can always take the bus or train. So the black car acts as a filter. No money types, taxi-cheater types hardly ever prey on a black cab. We get to fetch all the good pax most of the time, and frequently do not even need to interview the pax.</p>

              <p>Got several types of people working in CBD. First kind is those who can claim taxi fare, so very high chance they will take black car over anything else. Another type who earn pretty good income or family well off, so black car is no big deal. The third type is so rich that they can afford driving and paying for CBD parking. So taking the black car when their car got problem or they want to go drinking is a cheap option.</p>
              <p>What are the balance types? 5.30pm Hitachi tower to Sengkang HDB? This kind wont take black car. The pax automatically go to the sampan behind - HAHAHA. No need interview somemore. So evening peak just wait at Hitachi tower or Singapore Land Tower. Switch off engine and wait for your evening peak hr CBD to Tanjong Rhu, or CBD to airline house, or CBD to nearby areas. Queue moving slow? Never mind. 1 pax per hour can liao. But if pax want to do a 5.30pm CBD to Sengkang, never mind, the pax 'Or Bar Kak', and you are richer for it. Come back CBD rinse and repeat.</p>
