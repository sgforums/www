              <p>Last night must be some kind of record for me, I actually picked up 2 sets of Indian FT pax.</p>
              <p>I was along River Valley heading for CQ when saw 2 Indian Ft women flagging frantically at leonie. I act blur. Just ahead looked like Ang Mo also flagging. Stop, knn, Indian FT but fair looking. Interview ask where? CQ.</p>
              <p>Ok la why not, I actually going there what. Suddenly he come in, the 2 women also joined, all same Adams family haha. But short distance, I had to put with only 3-4 minutes of their Hindi non stop bullshit.</p>
              <p>All my interviews today going fine, stayed in the zone or nearby all the while, but I knew I would get 1 wrong. Along Cecil spotted 1 AngMo @2330hrs, never interview, he come in, location? KNN Bayshore. Town got many pax. Lan lan la. Go bayshore, come out see 3 Indian FT flagging, time 2350hrs.</p>
              <p>Ok la bo pian, just take screwed up location what. Only 2 got in, as usual going north (Tampines Ave 2). Knn cheapos, leave friends house at 2350hrs to avoid paying midnight. But I told them, no nets only cash. They agreed.</p>
              <p>Tampines Ave 2 in the end I think not so bad what, can go to one Chinese Muslim stall and eat either laksa or wantan mee. Ok la. Not upset. Drop the donkeys, go makan, finish, 1 Mat approached, Abang you free? Haha. In the end go Sengkang, there also got pax waiting, still managed to head back to town with paying fare.</p>
              <p>So last night Ah nehs, got approval from me. But confirm today, back to normal - no chance.</p>

              <p>Lucky for you managed to get back the fare and you did the right thing by refusing to back down.</p>
              <p>Now let's see my Malay can cari makan:</p>
              <p>Tetapi tuan, ada ambil risiko sedikit kerana hendak membawa mereka dalam teksi tuan ke balai polis. Orang macam ini, kalau betul tidak ada duit, boleh merompak atau memukul tuan apabila di dalam teksi pada kali kedua. Saya rasa lebih baik jika tuan terus memanggil polis datang kepada tempat yang tuan berada. Biarkan polis yang memberi dia amaran untuk membayar wang kepadamu, atau ikut tuan ke-pusat kewangan.</p>
              <p>Of course this also depends on the person you ferry, if you confident you can handle him, no matter what then sending back to station is not an issue.</p>
              <p>I think people who cheat on cab fares are desperate and may resort to violence if cornered.</p>
