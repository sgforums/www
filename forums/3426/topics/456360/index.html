              <p>After driving for 10+ yrs with CDG, I still find those no-show pax cases hard to stomach.</p>
              <p>In all my years of driving, I hv always honor my side of the business contract when I accepted calls, i.e hv always showed up 95% on-time. I had never no-showed before!</p>
              <p>Just like this afternoon, got a call at NUS PGP residences. Pressed 3 mins and arrived in 2 mins. As usual pressed "arrived" and "call"</p>
              <p>What did I see...a young couple loading their luggage onto a blue sonata. The girl turned and looked at me then spoke to the guy.</p>
              <p>From their expression and body langguage, can tell that:</p>
              <p>girl: see the cab is here</p>
              <p>guy: aiya, luggage already up liao what to do. I'll cancel. (he then looked at his phone apparently receiving CDG system call but not answering)</p>
              <p>They left and another guy came up but I gestured to him that I was on-call.</p>
              <p>He booked another cab and his cab came when my MDT reflected 4 mins after arrival.</p>
              <p>No show appeared liao still no cancellation!</p>
              <p>They are undergrads, you know...well educated and future leaders!</p>

              <p>That's why I feel these ppl must be penalized.</p>
              <p>Once call confirmed, telco deduct cab-booking charges (incl admin) and pay Cab Co. later.</p>
              <p>Pax board cab but do not hv to pay booking charges. Cab Co. credit booking fee to TD.</p>
              <p>Once no show, pax cab-booking charges forfeited. Cab Co. and TD still receives the booking fee.</p>
              <p>It's all in CDG system, whether they wanna implement or not. To effect "no show" in MDT, we must be in the correct location, pressed "arrived", call pax by pressing "call", then wait 2 to 5 mins as applicable before we can pressed "no show".</p>
              <p>Thus, the call success rate for pax will surely rise and TDs will not be sent on wild goose chase with nil compensation.</p>

              Totally agree, last time before i drive cab and often take cab, I also wondered why they don't charge no show to pax.
              
              I always see people in taxi stand, call for cab and end up take other cab leaving the on call cab waiting like dunno what. Those in queue also can't take cos cab on call, and sometimes 2-3 on call cabs stuck there..

              <p>Sadly, ppl can never be educated to be socially responsible and will always try to beat the system!</p>
              <p>Why divert a cab to you if you have no intention either to honour the contract or wait out for the cab arrival?</p>
              <p>Imagine, these 2 sold their dignity for a mere $2.30. Imagine they were to become leaders with say $300 billion in reserves!</p>
              <p>Luckily, from their appearances and amount of luggage, I guess they are either from a neighbouring country or ah Ts.</p>

              <p>In the business arena, as long as there are no transaction taken place, no one owes anyone anything, so there is no way that cab companies or cabby can do to no show pax.</p>
              <p>What companies can do is to harder the rule of calls, but certainly, unable to penalise the pax, for eg, those on advance call hv to pay 8 dollars in advance thru credits or debit cards. But then which companies want to do it, it will be very customer unfriendly and end up losing customers. On the other hand, if $8 was paid in advance, transaction happened, and if the cabby who took the job did not show up, it can be very serious.</p>

              <p>These are call abuser, in all systems created, there tend to have abusers, from drug abusing to racial abuses and so on.</p>
              <p>Sad to say that there are no perfect system, near perfect maybe, but never perfect as nobody is perfect. Not only cabby are being abuse by pax, we are also constantly being abuse by taxi companies and govt with higher and higher rental and fuel prices without any justification other than COE and oil prices which is not in our control.</p>
              <p>Some abuse their maid, some abuse the power and authority given to them with free sex and money. When are able to comprehend on matter we are in, perhap than, we might not end up so fed up, because, as a TD, like it or not, we are part of the system , and being part of it, we do get abused.

              <p>Think open brother, do not alway dwell within the cocoon of TD, LTA and PAX, or LV, there are many other thing you can do, think and see in this world beside it.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving is our core, however, for some issue, it is the external factor that influence our core, we also need to have some social and public awareness in us in order to comprehend the issue at hand. As the core of it, we are alway at the liabilities as our job is a exposed one, like if pax no show, nothing can be done, you just knncccb and phui 10000x, feel pity for your other brothers, but if you take a call and no show yourself, you could be in big trouble.</p>
              <p>For all you know, that pax might had experienced many time of Cabby no show, or came late, so she end up, abusing the call system, call here and there.</p>
