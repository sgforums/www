              <p>ok this is gonna benefit some if they are not aware what their hospitalization scheme is.</p>
              <p>Being a bo chup fella for most of my life , i didnt care what plan i was on until just recently i signed up. Better late than never.</p>
              <p>I was on some stupid basic income plan A which pays like 12400 for a surgery, i think thats hardly enough and sway sway touch wood kena cancer , ho seh liao .</p>
              <p>I took on a plan for $446 per year , as charged .  Private hospital and all bills paid for in the event  i kena 'toto'</p>
              <p>Take some time off pressing your meter , walkies and mdt and go check your plan. For this cb trade , its best to go as charged.</p>
              <p>To me its farking costly paying $446 but i think this $ cannot save.</p>

Why I said using medisave is because CPF medisave gives 2.5% interest rate, which can offset abit of your $446 and at the same time, a contribution to medisave as required</p></div>

              <p>One more story .</p>
              <p>Before my father dignosed with Cancer , Government got him to sign up Medishield .</p>
              <p>Since Medisave so many money not utilised , just sign .</p>
              <p>After a few months down the road , he was diagnosed with Intestine cancers .</p>
              <p>Can imagine those cost of surgery to cut off some cancerous portion in the liver ( a bit affected ) .</p>
              <p>We were worried .</p>
              <p>If i can remember ...... the whole thing was amounted to somewhere $30 grand .</p>
              <p>His Medishield and Medisave save our ass !!!!</p>
              <p>I dun remember if i come out any money , not even any amount was deducted from my medisave at all .</p>
              <p>About $700+ was deducted from my brother's medisave .</p>
              <p>$0 cash involve .</p>
              <p>A simple Medishield can actually save everyone's ass .</p>
              <p>Imagine if he do not sign up Medishield , Medisave will be swept clean and we still need to pay up front cash involve .</p>

              <p>Folks, besides hospitalization plan, you might want to get a critical illness one to complement also.

              <div>Eg. Diagnose with cancer warded, hospital plan will take care of hospital bills. Lump sum/instalment payments will be made by critical illness plan. This money can be used to jia por or for family during the period cause there's no income coming in.</div>

              <p><br>Medishield is our national healthcare plan for all singaporeans up to age 82. the one that you are talking abt age 40 and above is eldershield.</p>
              <p>i know, i have been in and out and hospital for my parents for the last ten years. what can be claim wat cannot. wat is the claims limit for medishield and medisave for certain illnesses all i know inside out.</p>

              <p>One more issue dont ever ever stick to our basic CPF medishield. Upgrade your medishield to a private insurer of your choice(aia,ge or prudential) and yes medishield has already been outsource to private insurer. And why upgrade to private insurer if u ask me. Cos most private insurer now provides a lifetime coverage of up to 500k and more and i heard some got no limits also. Just ask and enquire with your insurance frens</p>
              <p>Dont just look at how much you are being covered in event that you are ill. MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION&gt; Ask your insurer about your LIFETIME COVERAGE.</p>
              <p>Basic Medishield only have a lifetime coverage of 200k used to be only 100k years back.( Just an example of my mum: diagnosed with cancer,stroke and kidney failure, 3rd year of treatment 200k all paid up and insurer wash hand and leave it to you, my mum live til the 8th year after diagnosed before she passed away, so just make a guess the amount that i have spend after the insurer stops paying.)</p>

              <p>If u have not sign up any , pls proceed to nearest CPF to sign up , no cash involve if u have sufficient funds in Medisave to sign up .</p>
              <p>Very easy one , sign on the dotted line only .</p>

              <p><br>I have never ever look into insurance as a form of saving or retirement&gt; i think the word of the company says it all "INSURANCE".</p>
              <p>Insurance to me is a form of protection and that alls no more no less. And if im well insured its on a no returns and max coverage basis.</p>
