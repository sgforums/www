              <p><br>." Can airbags injure people? Yes. Occasionally, the energy required to inflate frontal airbags quickly can cause injury. Fortunately, most of these injuries are minor scrapes and abrasions. Serious injuries and deaths are relatively rare. Since 1990, deaths attributable to airbag inflation in low-speed crashes numbered more than 260 according to NHTSA. Approximately 65 percent of motorists killed by airbags have been passengers, and more than 90 percent of the passenger airbag fatalities have been children and infants, most of whom were unbelted or in rear-facing restraints that placed their heads close to the deploying airbag. Among the adult driver and passenger deaths, about three-quarters were women. More than 80 percent of those killed were improperly restrained, and more than 90 percent of deaths " US Bloomberg business times.</p>
              <p>HiÂ bro, I am not saying airbag is not good, but we need look thing at a different level, everything we created is good, no matter what tools, is to help and safeguard peoples, when I go onboard vessel, the safety officer said, wear yr safety belts, if not you will get fine $50 and subsequently banned from entering, but please becareful, the belt can hook on anything on the ship engine parts, keep it tight and tap it up if possible, so bro, what I am saying is that something good can also be an hazard if not well taken care off. You can surf the net for more pleasure reading when you are free, dun read while driving.</p>
              <p>If you at zebra crossing, a safety pedesdrian crossing, and yet when hit, people died on the spot, firstly, because zebra crossing, especially those junction filtering left or right road, are taken for granted by some pedestrians and cyclists, given a lousy day, or a chiong day, the driver can just go thru it, and pedestrians, who had taken it for granted that vehicle must stop for them, they are on the right, so no need to look left or right, and that is when BANG!! happened, of course the driver is wrong when hit, but the pain or lost of life is the crosser, Safety is good, but dun rely on it too much.</p>

              <p>Since 1990 Over 150 People Have Been Killed By Airbags </p>
              <p><br>Many of these deaths occurred when an airbag deployed in a speed crash striking an occupant who was sitting very close to the airbag - less than 10 inches. Most airbags deploy with a tremendous amount of force (an explosion of gas 200 mph), thus posing a serious threat to small children and those who sit too closely to the airbag can cause heart stopping reaction with such sudden impact.<br><br>However, airbags Have Saved More Lives<br><br>Since their introduction, airbags have deployed in automobile crashes well over 3 million times and according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) it is estimated almost 5,000 deaths have been prevented by the use of airbags.<br><br>Airbags are a controversial topic. It is true that some people - especially children - have sustained serious injury from airbag deployment. However - the fact is - airbags combined with seat belts (lap and shoulder belt) do save lives and help prevent more serious injury in most cases. <br><br>The airbag danger problem is serious enough that some retrofit on-off switches can be found and used if federal requirements are met -- switches must be operated by a key and equipped with warning lights to indicate whether the bags are turned off or on. <br><br>Big Lawsuits Settlements, Quickly With Expert Witness Testimonials <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sal Fariello author has been helping people get quick settlements in airbag injury cases in the $320,000 to $1,500,000 range, and usually have been settling out-of-court.<br><br></span><br><br>Read more: <a style="color: #003399;" href="http://www.articlesbase.com/non-fiction-articles/airbag-injuries-and-wrongful-deaths-118649.html#ixzz1Y5djrNtL"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.articlesbase.com/non-fiction-articles/airbag-injuries-and-wrongful-deaths-118649.html#ixzz1Y5djrNtL</span></a> <br>Under Creative Commons License: <a style="color: #003399;" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attribution No Derivatives</span></a></p>

              I just find that this para "but if you suddenly do an emergency brake, airbag ballooned infront of you," may be over erroneous. Its true that it saved more lives than other wise. 
                          
                          You know how the Americans drive right? all sorts of patterns! 
              no wonder some got killed by airbag. Best way to claim insurance ma...
