              <p>Khoon say correct, 1st trip dun take coins never mind.</p>
              <p>Anyway give discount to pax who deserve it, you can tell sometimes what pax you ferry and that they take a cab because really bo pian, they could have taken something cheaper if they had a choice.</p>
              <p>NS boys, students and some old people (not all some very calculative) are the usual ones. Like the cleaner i took she worked late frogot the time no choice had to take a cab, these kind of people all can one.</p>
              <p>Pax give you tips, you also can give tips. But when I take cab I alway pay towards the dollar never in coins, if 6.20 becomes 7, if over 8 must be 10. But if driver damn kwai lan, then exact fare, but out of 100, only 1-2  or never sometimes.</p>

A convinient thing for you but for some drivers who need cash daily to roll, it becomes a problem, because on certain days after certain hours it can take 3-4 days before they see the cash. If 1 pax or 2 does that it's ok, but if you get a sizable number then the driver could very well end up with little or no cash to show home for that day's effort.</p>
              <p>So be understanding a bit, if got ATM nearby where you intend to hail a cab, go and withdraw la, if out of the way then bo pian. </p>
              <p>Give and take a bit, that's all what most drivers will ask. We also did NS or served in uniform and we know how tough it can be for an NSF to juggle the small allowance he gets.</p>

              <p>But I was a regular in the Police from the late 80s to mid 90s, salaries weren't high in my time not like now, everyone getting promoted, those days to get an 'ikan bilis' had to wait long long one.</p>

              <p>Ah hammer, you come from a reasonably well to do family, not
              making any assumptions here, you could have very well not received
              any financial help from your family and managed entirely on your
              own.</p>
              <p>But I was a regular in the Police from the late 80s to mid 90s,
              salaries weren't high in my time not like now, everyone getting
              promoted, those days to get an 'ikan bilis' had to wait long long
              one.</p>
              <p>So it was quite tough for me, not terribly tough, but still had
              to struggle from pay day to pay day.</p>

              <p>Khoon say correct, 1st trip dun take coins never mind.</p>
              <p>Anyway give discount to pax who deserve it, you can tell
              sometimes what pax you ferry and that they take a cab because
              really bo pian, they could have taken something cheaper if they had
              a choice.</p>
              <p>NS boys, students and some old people (not all some very
              calculative) are the usual ones. Like the cleaner i took she worked
              late frogot the time no choice had to take a cab, these kind of
              people all can one.</p>
              <p>Pax give you tips, you also can give tips. But when I take cab I
              alway pay towards the dollar never in coins, if 6.20 becomes 7, if
              over 8 must be 10. But if driver damn kwai lan, then exact fare,
              but out of 100, only 1-2  or never sometimes.</p>

              <p>Must support our fellow drivers.  Even a small tip can sometimes brighten them (ourselves) up a bit.</p>
              <p>If your mood not good that day, but a pax gives you a tip, how to be angry about this? Definitely it'll make you feel appreciated and change your mood at that particular time.</p>
