              <p>Hi Bros!</p>
              <p>I'm a relief driver under CDG driving Mercs. Last week on 16th Oct, I picked up an Indian pax but forgotten to press the meter. After about 10mins I realised and told pax that I forgot to press so she needs to top up the fare later on and pax agreed.</p>
              <p>After reaching destination and stopping meter, the fare was $20+ so I asked her to top up $5 since it's also including midnight charges. She kicked up a fuss saying that usually her fare was $24. I explained that mine is Mercs. She not happy and threatened to complain.</p>
              <p><br>Next day I received call from office asking me to relate what happened. The guy, Jeffrey said he will present my explanation to his supervisor. The following day he called up to ask me come down and meet his supervisor.</p>
              <p>I went down this afternoon and spoke to this fellow, Joshua and was given notice till 30 Oct! This is my 1st offence, no warning given whatsoever and CDG just terminated me. I feel that they should at least give me a warning first before terminating right away.</p>
              <p>So now, should I appeal or LL go other company? Pls advise bros. Thank you!</p>

              <p>Hi Bros!</p>
              <p>I'm a relief driver under CDG driving Mercs. Last week on 16th
              Oct, I picked up an Indian pax but forgotten to press the meter.
              After about 10mins I realised and told pax that I forgot to press
              so she needs to top up the fare later on and pax agreed.</p>
              <p>After reaching destination and stopping meter, the fare was $20+
              so I asked her to top up $5 since it's also including midnight
              charges. She kicked up a fuss saying that usually her fare was $24.
              I explained that mine is Mercs. She not happy and threatened to
              complain.</p>
              <p><br> Next day I received call from office asking me to relate what
              happened. The guy, Jeffrey said he will present my explanation to
              his supervisor. The following day he called up to ask me come down
              and meet his supervisor.</p>
              <p>I went down this afternoon and spoke to this fellow, Joshua and
              was given notice till 30 Oct! This is my 1st offence, no warning
              given whatsoever and CDG just terminated me. I feel that they
              should at least give me a warning first before terminating right
              away.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>So now, should I appeal or LL go other company? Pls advise bros.

              <p>You should go other company.</p>
              <p>You forget to press meter. It is your fault. Go to other taxi company and see how they can help you.</p>
              <p>You driving CDG mercs. Give me your details and I will complain for you. First complain is why CDG allow you to drive their Mercs?</p>

              <p>Let me tell you, I Indian and I always reject Indian, mainly because all FT and damn lan lan one. Local Indians I may give face sometimes, if elderly, but let tell you, what's worse than Indian FT is local Indian gal with education one (also FT Indian female, educated or the rich type).</p>
              <p>This educated Indian gals, think very superior, I dunno why. I never kena, because I seldom or never will take, but they are the most likely ones to complain. A few of my friends have kena, and of course I have also known some of them through functions where we exchange stories.</p>
              <p>Let me give you 1 example told to me by an Indian gal at a function, she's a lawyer btw. She took a cab with her from Keong Saik Rd Temple go some place (I forget). Anyway the TD, maybe blur or maybe as she claim tried to makan a little and go longer route. You know what she did, she told him, half way on the expressway, now you turn back and send me back to the original place, I will take another cab and I wont pay you, or I will complain and not pay you. The stupid driver actually go and send her back for free.</p>
              <p>Of course I can differentiate between local and FT, so when I see these educated locals, I won't even bother to interview. Follow procedure, put on busy and drive past them, if I drop off at taxi stand and they are first in queue. After drive by, a few hundred yards can put for hre again. This is LTA rule - as long you put busy, they won't do anything. Of course you can't interview then put busy, or wait and see then put busy. Dont want to take, put busy, Mustafa this is standard policy one.</p>
              <p>On the street, you don't want to stop, your pasal, they cant do anything because it could be for many reasons. My excuse is that I blur sotong, drive like straight horse, concentrate on the road, never see, or behind got car follow very close cannot stop wait langgar, near bus stop, traffic light, etc etc.</p>
              <p>As for your case, no need for me to rub salt into your wounds and ask why you did what you did. Done is done, we all learn better from mistakes.</p>
              <p>But this case can definitely appeal, you can do what has been suggested or go and see which PAP MP is also NTUC related one, best still which one incharge of taxis and busses.</p>
              <p>Go explain your story, say you relief, not very experienced, dunno how to handle this kind of issue - failing to on meter. You did in good faith, not to overcharge. Prepared to give back money etc, tell your family problem. Blah blah. This one sure got chance one.</p>
