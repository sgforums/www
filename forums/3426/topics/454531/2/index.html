              <p>Wont revoke la, maximum is 2 week suspension for major offense plus $300 fine I think.</p>
              <p>Btw kissing men and men is no offense. Nowadays so common.</p>
              <p>Performing a sexual act is, if in a public place, doesn't matter if men and men or men and women.</p>
              <p>Strictly speaking blow job or fellatio is an offence of gross indecency between man and man. But they dont prosecute if between consenting adults. Likewise the law here is an offence between man and woman if it doesn't lead to normal sex, blowjob alone is an offense, but again no prosecution between consenting adults.</p>
              <p>But if you paid for it, then you are on sticky ground...</p>
              <p>As for LTA, this is a grey area, can you ask them to leave your cab? If against your religious beliefs, yes, but you must warn them to stop, if persist then only you can order them to leave, giving your reasons and informing your respective cab company of the incident. I doubt you can charge the fare as you did not send them to their desired location.</p>

              <p>I think it is more of a moral issue, not laws, we as Asian tends to embrace conservativeness more than the west, LIke i say, while waiting at LTA office for processing ID or renew of license, you and a guy start kissing and hugging each other, what will be the reaction from the LTA officers and others?</p>
              <p>There are good in the west which we can embrace, I am not against gay in anyway, but the west also got many bad that had eroded our society,  it is not a matter of laws or rules or cannot do it, but a matter of moral ethics, public behavorial and civilisation.</p>

              a few time, send from 1 end of singapore to the other. Eg from

              <p>These butch very scared their gf turn striaght and have
              boyfriend, so will mati mati try to control all their movement. 1
              time I pick up, the butch can't understand why the gf wants to go
              back to having a boyfriend again.</p>

              don't care meter, running after midnight, talk lah how you want to

              <p>Ya me too. These fall under the Chee Hong Pax catogary. But even better. You don't have the male trying to show off to the female. I kenna one time a female want go liao, male insist on paying for cab fare but got no cash. Realise I got no nets, drag the gf down and slam my door. GF keep saying nevermind liao she got cash. Then end up no taxi for them. I make one u-turn at st james liao with new pax they still waiting down there with many others..... tok kong.</p>

              <p>I kena propositioned a few times over the years, but last year I had 1 that gave me a fright.</p>
              <p>I picked up 1 Ang Mo at Mohd Sultan on a Sunday, he named the condo in Tg Rhu. I forget which one now.</p>
              <p>Along the way, I interview him, he's from Ireland. Quite fat and hairy type. That time was the Rugby World Cup, so I talked about it, I like to discuss sports with my pax.</p>
              <p>Talk talk along ECP, I forgot to exit at Fort Rd, instead relaise I overshot, so exited at Tg Katong. I pologised, said I will adjust the fare accordingly.</p>
              <p>He said never mind, maybe you want some fun? I said huh? He said, how about giving me a blowjob!</p>
              <p>I thought he joking, but he became quite serious keep repeating. Said only 10 minutes enough, can come to his place, told him I'm straight, maybe he can go Tg Pagar got a few gay pubs there, or find his own, I said Singapore now quite open, shouldn't be a problem.</p>
              <p>The bugger still refused to back down, kept on repeating. I quickly send him to Tg Rhu, faster faster collect fare and ciao. No discount also!</p>
