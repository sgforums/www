              <p>Incident 1 : Tiong Kok Chye</p>
              <p>3 weeks ago, I was driving night shift from 6pm to next day 6am. Feel a tired and looking for a place to take a short nap and I drive to West Coast Park. Reach there, saw a cab(better dun name the company) parking there, closer look at the number plate and its belong to one of my TVL classmate. I drove passed and noticed the driver seat was empty. I suspect something may happen to my classmate so I parked my cab 50 meter away and slowly walk toward my classmate cab. I take a look inside and saw a tiongkok chye half naked and was sitting on the lap of my classmate at the back seat of the cab. My classmate was hugging her tightly. No wonder I cannot find my classmate at driver seat. My classmate saw me, wind down the window and introduce the Tiongkok chye to me. He told me he is teaching the tiong kok chye how to read road directory, you believe what he say? The tiong kok chye quite pretty but the neh neh like char siew pau.</p>
              <p>This classmate of mine, look very soo boon type, ex-army officer, I think hold rank of LTC. He has a wife and 3 children. I told him, his licence will gan tong if he continue to teach passenger to read road directory at ulu place.</p>

              <p>Incident 2: Thai kok Chye (TKC)</p>
              <p>Last week, I was plying around Havelock. One TKC waved for my cab. She was at the roadside near to Mirarmar Hotel. I stop my cab and she hop inside. Age around 40, wear mini skirt and low cut. Every man see her, I bet they will like to makan her. These are our conversation.</p>
              <p>Me : Good evening, Welcome onboard, where you wish to go.</p>
              <p><em><strong>This Thai kok Chye stare at me and clap her palm.</strong></em></p>
              <p>TKC :Sawatikar, Can you fetch me to Geylang?</p>
              <p>Me : No problem Mdm, please fasten your seat belt.</p>
              <p> <em><strong>I look at the rear mirror and saw her slowly fasten the seat belt and can see the belt press against her chest and the two sport light protrude out. On the way to Geylang she asked me.</strong></em></p>
              <p>TKC : Sir, how is your business today.</p>
              <p>Me : Very bad, nobody take cab, dun know why? BTW are you tourist?</p>
              <p>TKC : No, I am not tourist, I am on social pass and working in tourism industry.</p>
              <p><em><strong>KNN, cho kuey say cho kuey, nothing to be shame about, what working in tourism industry. Think I dun know.<br></strong></em></p>
              <p>Me ; I also working in tourism industry, I fetch tourist around.</p>
              <p>TKC : I am in tourism industry, my job is to make the tourist and/or local happy,</p>
              <p><em><strong>KNN, she no different from taxi driver, we ply all over singapore, she ply along Geylang, the only differences is she sleep on bed and do not need a street directory or GPS and we sit on chair and require a street directory or GPS to help us to reach our destination. <br></strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Me : How you make our tourist and/or local happy? How much you charge to make them happy?</p>
              <p>TKC : My charges varies, Package A is $100, Package B is $80, Package C is $60 and Package D is $40. The cheapest package is $20.</p>
              <p>Me : My taxi charges also varies, airport $3, CBD 35%, mid night charge 50% ... Can you tell me what are the services in your $100 package?</p>
              <p>TKC : Oh the $100 packages include removing clothing for the tourist, bath together with the tourist, body massage, BJ and piaking.</p>
              <p>Me : How about the $20 package?</p>
              <p>TKC : $20 package is a simple job, it is specially customised for taxi driver like you.</p>
              <p>Me : What do you mean?</p>
              <p>TKC : Please take me to the near multi-storey carpark, I will make you happy happy with my hand.</p>
              <p> Me : OMG, no thank.</p>
              <p><strong>By then we reach Geylang, some of my taxi driver quite stress out and I think they need the budget $20 service. I asked for her number and she give it to me, 62353535.</strong></p>
              <p>Next day, before I pass the number to my stress out buddies, I make a call to 62353535 and a gal with a very sweet voice answer " Good morning sir, do you want to order PIZZA, we are having a promotion" I quickly switch off my HP. KNN the TKC make fun of me, darn sway that day.</p>

              <p>Incident 2: Thai kok Chye (TKC)</p>
              <p>Last week, I was plying around Havelock. One TKC waved for my
              cab. She was at the roadside near to Mirarmar Hotel. I stop my cab
              and she hop inside. Age around 40, wear mini skirt and low cut.
              Every man see her, I bet they will like to makan her. These are our
              conversation.</p>
              <p>Me : Good evening, Welcome onboard, where you wish to go.</p>
              <p><em><strong>This Thai kok Chye stare at me and clap her
              palm.</strong></em></p>
              <p>TKC :Sawatikar, Can you fetch me to Geylang?</p>
              <p>Me : No problem Mdm, please fasten your seat belt.</p>
              <p> <em><strong>I look at the rear mirror and saw her slowly
              fasten the seat belt and can see the belt press against her chest
              and the two sport light protrude out. On the way to Geylang she
              asked me.</strong></em></p>
              <p>TKC : Sir, how is your business today.</p>
              <p>Me : Very bad, nobody take cab, dun know why? BTW are you
              tourist?</p>
              <p>TKC : No, I am not tourist, I am on social pass and working in
              tourism industry.</p>
              <p><em><strong>KNN, cho kuey say cho kuey, nothing to be shame
              about, what working in tourism industry. Think I dun
              know.<br></strong></em></p>
              <p>Me ; I also working in tourism industry, I fetch tourist
              around.</p>
              <p>TKC : I am in tourism industry, my job is to make the tourist
              and/or local happy,</p>
              <p><em><strong>KNN, she no different from taxi driver, we ply all
              over singapore, she ply along Geylang, the only differences is she
              sleep on bed and do not need a street directory or GPS and we sit
              on chair and require a street directory or GPS to help us to reach
              our destination.<br></strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Me : How you make our tourist and/or local happy? How much
              you charge to make them happy?</p>
              <p>TKC : My charges varies, Package A is $100, Package B is $80,
              Package C is $60 and Package D is $40. The cheapest package is
              $20.</p>
              <p>Me : My taxi charges also varies, airport $3, CBD 35%, mid night
              charge 50% ... Can you tell me what are the services in your $100
              package?</p>
              <p>TKC : Oh the $100 packages include removing clothing for the
              tourist, bath together with the tourist, body massage, BJ and
              piaking.</p>
              <p>Me : How about the $20 package?</p>
              <p>TKC : $20 package is a simple job, it is specially customised
              for taxi driver like you.</p>
              <p>Me : What do you mean?</p>
              <p>TKC : Please take me to the near multi-storey carpark, I will
              make you happy happy with my hand.</p>
              <p> Me : OMG, no thank.</p>
              <p><strong>By then we reach Geylang, some of my taxi driver quite
              stress out and I think they need the budget $20 service. I asked
              for her number and she give it to me, 62353535.</strong></p>
              <p>Next day, before I pass the number to my stress out buddies, I
              make a call to 62353535 and a gal with a very sweet voice answer "
              Good morning sir, do you want to order PIZZA, we are having a
              promotion" I quickly switch off my HP. KNN the TKC make fun of me,
              darn sway that day.</p>

              <p>Bro, for that free ride, she wrote a commendation letter for me to my cab company about my service. I think she is not a maid, I suspect she is a nurse working in one of our hospital looking for some fun.</p>
