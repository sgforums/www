              <div class="content">WHILE my wife, two-year-old child and my sister-in-law and I were on an outing last Friday in Orchard Road, my sister-in-law sprained her ankle.<br><br>We decided to catch a taxi home and joined the queue at the taxi stand at Liat Towers. But as the queue was long, I decided to call for a cab. In the meantime I could not help noticing the large number of taxis with their green indicator lights on, showing that they were not carrying passengers.<br><br>The drivers were cruising along Orchard Road. Not a single cab turned into the Liat Tower stand. The second mystery was that no cabby responded to my call for a booking although there were many passing by. Twice, a voice mail reply informed me that there were no taxis in the area even as I observed otherwise. We tried for a better spot and crossed over, heading towards Orchard Towers.<br><br>At the Thai embassy, we tried to flag a taxi but again the slew of empty cabs cruised by. Finally, we managed to flag down a cab after half an hour of trying. I asked the driver why none of the cabs stopped when there were so many cruising by without passengers.<br><br>His reply: Cabbies would pick up fares only after crossing the Scotts Road-Patterson Road junction because that is when the $3 surcharge kicks in.<br><br>Is the Land Transport Authority (LTA) enforcing rules for picking up fares frequently and effectively?<br><br>My family and I tried in vain to flag a cab for half an hour while tens of cabbies drove by with their vehicles empty and did not stop.<br><br>This is a bad habit that should not continue.<br><br>Can the authorities consider other ways to help passengers get a cab ride, rather than through surcharges?<br><br>If surcharges are the preferred option, the LTA should do a more thorough and effective job in checking and catching these drivers.<br><br>Daniel Tan</div>

              <p>those who never drive a cab before can never understand lah.. i last time also dun understand why.. whats big deal abt 3 bucks?.. now i driving cab, then i can understand why.. cos money very hard to earn.. u think 3 bucks easy to earn? then go try driving a cab..</p>
              <p>it is just like selling a product.. if u can sell at a higher price, will u be so stupid as to sell to another party for a lower price?.. if your employer wants to give u a pay rise, will u say "no thank you"?</p>
              <p>also there are 6 taxi companies.. i believe if a pax is really in need of a cab, they will try calling all 6 taxi companies and not only rely on 1 or 2..i dun believe if they do that, not a single response? which means not really in need lor.. cos when a person is in need of something, he will find ways and means to get it..</p>

              <p>Just like employer, let their employees fight against one another (disagreement), employer just sit and see the show and wait for chances to be a good heart pple. (show only).</p>

              <p>It's only in Singapore tat's so hor mia market is monopolised by cabby, you go Taipei or Hong Kong there's no such thing of midnight surcharge all e nonsense, yet there's steady flow of cabs everywhere.</p>
              <p>Think we should follow Taipei, remove all e surcharges.</p>
              <p>why should ppl be at e mercy of cabbies opportunnity to collect more fares. When tax is alrdy considered private transport (personal tpt vs MRT or buses).</p>
              <p>I guess that's how come there's touting at 1 moment at these places. chicken n egg problem.</p>

              <p>Agreed.</p>
              <p>Let TD have a slice of a pie.</p>
              <p>And let commuters flock in to take the cab again.</p>
              <p>Dont worry, still got many pple will take your public transport.</p>
              <p>Yes, you (LTA) collect less tax / money, but do something good for the TD. Rich bowl is impt for them. Dont keep on breaking the rich bowl.</p>

              <p>no doubt la, because Singapore not as lively w/ night life as like HK or Taipei, a certain formulation could still be used for after hours travelling.</p>
              <p>to think of it, HK no midnight surcharges cos their MTR and public buses run till 1am from city area to residential areas</p>
