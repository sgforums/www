              <p>Your own-created dialogue is not realistic, at least the LTA's officer part.</p>
              <p>LTA will definitely act to catch these errant taxi drivers when they receive sufficient numbers of complaints from the passengers.</p>
              <p>LTA can impose heavy fines and deduct points and if these errant taxis drivers refuse to change, then LTA can revoke their licences.</p>
              <p>In the past, some SBS drivers used to cruise pass bus stops without stopping when passengers waved their hands. But, with the change in management, the new management has come down hard on these drivers and there are rarely a case now that SBS drivers cruise pass a bus stop without stopping when the passengers wave their hands.</p>
              <p>So, if SBS can do it, the taxis companies and LTA can do it too.</p>
              <p>LTA might not have stationed officers to catch these errant taxis drivers in the past BUT this does not mean that LTA will not do it any moment from now especially when there are sufficient number of complaints from the passengers.</p>

You can jolly well open your eyes big big &amp; look at it. Don't just play your Iphone when u taking cab. Or maybe you take too much bus liao never taking a cab before, come taxi forum cry father, cry mother.</p>

              Hi all, just my view. Why do u think CBD charge came into effect? Because no cabs in cbd lah at that time.  So well take away cbd surcharge means td will not go cbd unless no pax outside. So well choose lor no cab in cbd or no cab outside cbd. 
              
              As for those pax that wants a cab and I dare say for all td out there. Get a cab between 5 to 7.30pm definately have lah. Don't be cheapo and wait until no surcharge. 
              
              Ok maybe some argue take away peak hours surcharge. That means we td will take regular breakfast and dinner lor. Why go thr all the jams and crab cbd rules during peak hours? Better go eat with family or meet girlfriends etc during peak hours. 
              
              Ok now those that really say they won't mind the price for a cab outside cbd. Can I ask the laochiao here to set up a special hotline for those willing to call a cab $ 20 plus meter. I am sure we will take u. That is if u will pay. 
              
              Thx ok now to go back sleep wait peak hour Liao

              <p>tttan - very well said and well summarize for all.  The surcharge of 35% and CBD surcharge, and midnight 50% surcharge has the right proposal from it.</p>
              <p>Do you think i will drive on morning or evening peak hour to pick up pax without incentives?  Better eat normally and enjoy TV time with kids and hug my wife.</p>
              <p>Do you think i will drive and make a living in Mid Night Shift (graveyard shift) ?  I better make love in bed and drive 8 am to 5 pm.</p>
              <p>Every where people make a living. Even construction or road paving at midnight is very costly.  That's why you seldom see this happen unless very urgent and willing to pay for the highest bid.</p>
              <p>The "complaint starter" better wake up.  Try making a living in a "graveyard shift" factory work and tell your boss you will waive the "double pay" for weekend double pay.</p>

              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p>inside every taxi (whether be it Comfort, CityCab, Prime, Premier, Silver, Transcab or Yellow Top), you will find a fare structure sticker with all the applicable fares and surcharges.</p>
              <p>Even if you have never taken a taxi in your life before (unlikely but give you the benefit of doubt), you cal go to the respective company's website and they will have a page showing the same information as well. </p>
              <p>It can't be more transparent than this, right??</p>
              <p>Most of the time (or feedback that I get from customers) is they never bother to check and straightaway complain that the fares and surcharges is very confusing to them while not knowing that the very information is available just next to them.</p>
              <p>** Facepalm **</p>

              <p>Hi all, just my view. Why do u think <span>CBD</span> charge came into effect? Because no cabs in cbd lah at that time.
              So well take away cbd surcharge means td will not go cbd unless no
              pax outside. So well choose lor no cab in cbd or no cab outside
              cbd.</p>
              <p>As for those pax that wants a cab and I dare say for all td out
              there. Get a cab between 5 to 7.30pm definately have lah. Don’t be
              cheapo and wait until no surcharge.</p>
              <p>Ok maybe some argue take away peak hours surcharge. That means
              we td will take regular breakfast and dinner lor. Why go thr all
              the jams and crab cbd rules during peak hours? Better go eat with
              family or meet girlfriends etc during peak hours.</p>
              <p>Ok now those that really say they won’t mind the price for a cab
              outside cbd. Can I ask the laochiao here to set up a special
              hotline for those willing to call a cab $ 20 plus meter. I am sure
              we will take u. That is if u will pay.</p>
              <p>Thx ok now to go back sleep wait peak hour Liao</p>

              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p>Are you a TD?  if you are not, then I'm very impressed with what you have posted.  Totally explain the entire situation in a few very short paragraphs.</p>
              <p>Let's don't forget why the various surcharges come into place.  It's due to this very $$$-efficient government that tries to solve any problem with money.  Traffic jam? ERP ($$). No taxi? Surcharges ($$).</p>
              <p>Those who argue for no surcharges, try getting a taxi on Sunday.  Even myself (a TD) tried once and have to spend at least 20 mins (and that is outside CBD) to get 1 near my house in Bedok.  And also, on Sundays, my maximum driving time is only 3-4 hours.  Why so short? Because, like many TDs, Sunday is a day for me to relax and chill out with my mates.  A very big reason why this day is OFF is due to no surcharges. </p>
              <p>Meter = $5 = you only pay $5.</p>
              <p>Meter = $7.20 = you only pay $7.20.</p>
              <p>See already also sian. LOL... So just drive to cover rental + diesel and take the rest of the day off.</p>
              <p>On Sundays, in CDB, everywhere you go, taxi stand long queue.  I even get people walking out to main road at the taxi stand at Killiney Road (don't know for 313 or what building) trying to stop me at around 7:30pm.  That's peak hour and traffic is not light.  So, you want this???  Everywhere in CBD on Sundays, you go and you see long queues at taxi stand.  Pick &amp; Go. No joke.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes, totally support this man... Would solve the taxi supply problem at this area.</p>
              <p>LOL... I even got paxes trying to pay me the $3 surcharge when they are about to alight, until I tell them CBD surcharge not applicable at their boarding location.  Yes, I'm one of those who don't really choose places to pick up pax.  Got, just take... That's probably why some days, I take longer to hit my daily target whereas some days by 12-1 am can keep car already.</p>
