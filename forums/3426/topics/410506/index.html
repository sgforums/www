              <p>THE Government is investigating the provision of free bus rides in Singapore to the two integrated resorts by their operators.</p>
              <p>The probe, announced on Wednesday by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), is to establish that Singaporeans are not targetted and encouraged to go to the casinos at the integrated resorts (IRs).</p>
              <p>It comes amid protests from MPs like Mr Liang Eng Hwa who, in an interview with The Straits Times, said the free rides encouraged Singaporeans in the heartland to gamble at the casinos.</p>
              <p>Following queries from The Straits Times, the ministry said in an email reply: 'We are investigating the provision of free transport by the IR operators. The IR operators will not be allowed to target the local market or provide incentives in any form for Singaporeans to patronise the casinos.'</p>
              <p>Both IRs provide free bus services. Marina Bay Sands free shuttle is between the resort and Changi Airport and hotels in the Marina Bay area. The free shuttle of RWS are available at two spots in the Central Business District as well as 12 HDB town centres, including Ang Mo Kio, Jurong East, Tampines and Bedok.</p>
              <p>When contact, RWS said 'we do not provide special casino incentives to Singaporeans'. It also released its own survey of 2,500 users of the free shuttle and it shows 'more than 60 per cent' do not go to the casino.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-size: x-small;">SINGAPORE - This weekend will see the last of the popular Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) free shuttle buses plying through the housing estates. <br><br>In a statement released late last night, RWS said it was "voluntarily withdrawing its shuttle services in the spirit of collaboration with the Singapore Government". <br><br>A total of eight services running through Bukit Merah, Queensway, Bedok, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang, Tampines, Jurong East, Ang Mo Kio and Bishan, as well as Tiong Bahru will be stopped with effect from 11pm on Sunday, RWS spokesman Robin Goh said. <br><br>Mr Goh told MediaCorp that the remaining shuttles running through the Central Business District, Orchard and Marina areas will continue. <br><br>The other IR, Marina Bay Sands, also offers shuttle services between the resort and Changi Airport, as well as hotels in the Marina Bay Area.<br><br>RWS' announcement yesterday comes one day after the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) announced it was investigating the shuttle services. <br><br>MCYS had said that the integrated resorts operators "will not be allowed to target the local market or provide incentives in any form for Singaporeans to patronise the casinos". <br><br>Hours before RWS' announcement, MediaCorp visited the pick-up points in Bishan and Bedok and observed that demand for RWS' shuttle services - which had operated as scheduled - remained strong, in spite of the authorities' investigation. Passengers interviewed had hoped the shuttle services would stay. <br><br>"It's convenient for people to visit not just the IR but also Sentosa," said Mr Shahary Mohd Yunus, 22. <br><br>He was accompanying his girlfriend, who works at an RWS eatery and takes the shuttle daily.<br><br>"Without the bus, business there won't be as good," said a 53-year-old who wanted to be known only as Mrs Lee. <br><br>Her group of four hopped onto the bus at Bedok at about 10am, went to the beach and had lunch at Underwater World before catching a ride back at about 5pm.<br><br>The strong demand for the free shuttles saw passengers at the Bishan pick-up point like development manager Alan Tan, having to wait for the next bus when the 3.10pm bus was full.<br><br>"I didn't expect it to be so full at this time," said Mr Tan, who was with his wife and son.<br><br>The next bus - 30 minutes later - was also packed, having arrived from the Ang Mo Kio pick-up point. The Tans almost did not make it onto the bus, but the driver found seats for them. About seven people had to wait for the next bus.<br><br>Of the 10 people approached by MediaCorp, two were heading to the casino. </span></p></div>

              <p>ya lorh. I can understand the Ministry's concern but isnt the casino already charging Singaporean 100 bucks levy entry fee?</p>
              <p>Both IR's dun mainly focus on Casino and pple take shuttle bus = more incentive go casino?</p>
              <p>Might as well keep Sentosa off to Singaporean so they dont have to worry Singaporean going to Casino?</p>

              <p>They need money from the gambling taxes, but then hope most Singaporeans do not gamble inside.

              <p>When they approved the IR, they emphasized that the casino component is a very very very small portion only, about 2% IIRC. Now they say taking <strong>FREE</strong> bus service to the IR means they must be going to gamble. How f**king lame is it.</p>

              <p>All these are politics.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why PAP is doing this before the election. In fact, if they want to they should do it after the election.</p>
              <p>Now PAP is in damage control mode, but they are doing more damages to Singaporeans and coming out with bullshits and lame excuses with their millions dollar salary.</p>
              <p>Do we want this type of political party to govern Singapore for another 50 years? First thing we can do is to vote alternate parties into parliament to deny PAP the two-third majorty at this coming election.</p>
