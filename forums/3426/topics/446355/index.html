              <p>Bro Joe Raj,</p>
              <p>Hammer's proposal is very good. I hope you two can work together.</p>
              <p>Please remember Limo TAXI driving is different from Pte limo driving bro. (If i don't remember wrongly you used to drive pte limo earning $ paid per trip, right?) You are on your own plying your own strategy now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to first question (if you not driving for Hammer), maybe you should ask yourself from the other angle. You should think what income opportunity do you miss from 6pm to11pm,  by not paying $30 more rental.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck bro!</p>

              <p>You'll be surprised or may be not, that even we locals can't stand them. Just the other day I picked some Dutch guys, and they were amazed I could guess their nationality.</p>
              <p>I said your language sounds like German but from a few words you speak, I know for sure you can't be German, leaving you likely to be Dutch or Swedish.</p>
              <p>Then our topic focussed on who or which race I didn't like as a TD. Your answer, my answer the same. They asked why, I said many things, but most of all I dislike their caste system. You can have that back home, but not here.</p>
              <p>On CNY Eve I was doing feeder service from Thomson Plaza, all going smoothly until 1 of them boarded. Queue what, bo pian. Come in, I never talk much, he want to go Tagore. Then he ask whether I local or what. I already fed up and I hate this question, so I just abruptly answer local. Knn he said I very rude!!</p>
              <p>I really wanted to F him up and down, but I just U turn and tell him to get out! He said he know what to do, i said do whatever you want, just F off from my cab!</p>
              <p>Then guess what, the next pax also from there! But this time a lady and she was quite polite, going to tekka and surprise surprise, pay cash!</p>
              <p>Saturday after midnight outside town, I got 3 call. I look at the names, say never mind, midnight or no midnight, no thank you.</p>

              <p>Thanks, very informative and gives me some food for thought, likewise WizQ answer.</p>
              <p>I might give it a try, but will sleep on it first before deciding.</p>
              <p>Truth be told, I'm also looking to cut down on my hours or days of driving this year. As Poolman suggested, a break from TD is also not a bad thing, he took a year off once.</p>
              <p>Also my cousin is thinking of opening a Prata shop and wants me to manage it. I've worked in the food industry (hawker, coffee-shop) before, so I know a thing or 2 about it, so I will almost likely give it a try, if things go as planned.</p>
              <p>If really got stall, I'll let you guys know, all TDs I sure give discount especially those from here!</p>
              <p>From cop to limo driver to TD and now maybe prataman, if that isn't progress in life, I don't know what is! Hahahaha.</p>

              <p>If you are those that require to hit a certain amt of fare , 11 pm to 7 am is not for u. When u come out at that time , a lot depends on luck and how alert and fast are u. Earnings fluctuate wildly , one day can huat another day can OBK.</p>
              <p>Like WizQ says , your opportunity cost would be the hours from 6 pm to 11 pm.</p>
              <p>For more details u can pm me Joeraj , coz i wanna get discount la if u decide to be a prata man.</p>

              <p>you are better off renting just from 3am - 7am. This is the piang hours. Very easy to huat if rental comes down to say $15 haha.....</p>

              <p>Yeah thanks I read that. Very useful.</p>
              <p>I also agree with komade, 11-7 isn't really a problem, especially those with some experience.</p>
              <p>Anyway the hirer has asked for $20 and I figure with diesel it can come up to 35-40.</p>
              <p>But $20 for 11-7pm and only from Mon to Thurs, after careful consideration, I've decided to forgo this offer.</p>
              <p>My reasons:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Why this hour? From the thread Quickpick showed, it's clear the hirer is trying to save on season parking of $90 a month.</p>
              <p>2) Why only Mon to Thurs and not offer Friday? If Friday was included, I would probably take it up. Yeah sure, he has rental to pay and maybe needs to earn a bit more for himself and family etc etc, but he's carefully chosen timings that in any case, he can't or won't be driving as an OMO. And he wants to maximise this to the fullest, and where possible offer only crumbs.</p>
              <p>3) As a night driver, in any case I almost never ever drive until the wee hours on weekdays. Usually close shop around 1-2 am, even earlier if my first few midnight end up near my home. (Once you come within a whiff of home, become lembik already and will find all sorts of excuse to go home, watch TV, drink coffee or surf the net) But with this scenario, it means that goes out of the window and I must drive until at least 3am and then if I want to rest, stay awake until 5am for any advance job (5-6am) and die die must find 1 between 6-7am.</p>
              <p>4) In other words, I will still be working 7-8 hours like I do on weekday nights now, but will surely earn less or be pressured to hunt for pax. Is that worth it, compared to working from say 6-7pm to 1 or 2 am and pay $30-40 more in rent and diesel?</p>
              <p>For these reasons, I think I must reject the offer, unless the timing comes down to 10pm. In any case the hirer by offering this clearly shows he's very calculative and I don't like people who calculate every damn thing.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the answers, it has really assisted me in my decision.</p>
