              <p>Got my TDVL last week.  Have checked out &amp; registered with CDG. </p>
              <p>With my family commitments, I am looking at day relief on weekdays.  However, to cover the cost, I would need to do at least 12hrs. </p>
              <p>There is a high chance that I might have to do night driving as in between I would need to fetch my ger back from school and prepare dinner.  The staff remarked that their pool of female drivers so far have no issues where personal safety is concerned for night driving.  But, given their "customer-oriented policy", I might encounter problems loading luggages as I am short and do have some back issue.</p>
              <p>Besides, getting advice on whether it is safe for female driver to do night?  I would like to find out whether worse case, OMO, drive 6hrs in the day and resume again at night is feasible or not.  And which are the recommended coy for female driver.</p>
              <p>P/s: I have tried to find out as much as possible b4 starting this topic.  Seek understanding from all the seniors here if my qtns are too typical for a newbie.</p>

              <p>To be honest , i will talk to you frankly ....</p>
              <p>It is very tough for a lady to drive at night .</p>
              <p>Cos most ladies are not fast drivers .</p>
              <p>And i can tell u , night drivers are very fast drivers .</p>
              <p>If u are driving a CDG , u will see other drivers from other taxi company will try to bully u .</p>
              <p>Stick to day lah , honestly .</p>
              <p>And u can find Khoon for more driving tips .</p>
              <p>Khoon can also organise some lunch break for u to learn something with other day drivers .</p>

              <p>Hi Sis CookiesM,</p>
              <p>As Chief pool said, OMO, not the way....I OMO 1 month already cannot tahan.... Night driving, really must be fast, even I got a fast machine also can kenna makan by blue and yellow..... sometimes dangerous too, meaning dangerous driving by some night drivers on the road.......</p>
              <p>As for relief or OMO, you dun need 12 hours to cover costs lah, if really need 12 hours, then better not come in this trade, cos 12 hours straight driving is very tiring and end of the day, you don't make money at all......</p>

              <p>Now i share my story ...again , many stories to tell .</p>
              <p>Personal experiences .</p>
              <p>2005 ...... my son 5 years old ... Maid went home Indonesia , my wife gambled and lost a big chunk of mine fortune , gotta OMO to recover those expenses i need ..... (quite stupid , cos thinking OMO can earn more) . </p>
              <p>No maid , but need to fetch him from child care .</p>
              <p>Morning my wife sent him to child care , i work from 7am .</p>
              <p>evening by 6pm , need to pick him up and sent him home , thank god that time my father still alive , after sent him home , i can continue to work , my father looked after him before my wife reached home .</p>
              <p>easy for me ? Fucking tough ..... at Simei need to rush back to CCK to pick him up knn ..... anywhere from Sgp also must pick him up , whatever distance also need . Got people cannot take . </p>
              <p>My wife can only be back at CCK at 7pm , but child care close at 6pm , die die by 6.30pm must pick my son from there .</p>
              <p>All in all , averagely need 1 hour of the time .</p>
              <p>Worst it's CCK very hard to get pax between 6pm to 8pm .</p>
              <p>Need to waste another 30-40 minutes to get another pax .</p>
              <p>I wasted almost every evening 2 hours for that sort of craps .</p>
              <p>Think here think there ...... not the long term solution .</p>
              <p>Work fucking hard ... to earn that money in order to get a new maid .</p>
              <p>I did ..... a good maid solve all my problems .</p>
              <p>Once i solve the child care problems ...... i am back driving night shift .</p>
              <p>Found a day relief .... and back to business .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I earned more cos i can utilise more on the road , less tiring cos less charging here and there , more life ...... not just driving a cab .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fuck OMO ... OMO really cannot make it one . Earn so much lesser than just night shift , more tiring and more fuel consuming for the taxi .</p>

              <p>One thing affected me .....</p>
              <p>I cannot focus my driving when my mind were congested with problems ...everyday need trouble shooting .</p>
              <p>But that made me a better trouble shooter .</p>
              <p>Seriously when one has got many problems , i cannot believe they can work better than those without problems in their head .</p>
              <p>Now i do not have problems in my head ..... funny and realistic enough , i earned more .</p>

              <p>I also learnt that if u relax driving , u can earn more , drive more happy .</p>
              <p>Rushing here and there doing personal stuffs , can really dampen your mood to drive .</p>

              <p>I hv seen and taken cabs with women Tds at night, but most only do night after doing day  for sometime and then confident about the switch.</p>
              <p>But I think your case as a mother, it's better for you to be home when your daughter finishes school, not just fetching and cooking which will make you very tired.</p>
              <p>Drive morning, come 4 or 5pm and then prepare dinner, check on your kid etc and then go to bed is best for family persons, not just female, most TDs will tell you that.</p>
              <p>As for fetching, honestly it doesn't work well for TDs to be doing this unless the first job is to send your spouse or kid to school,work, or the last job is fetching for home and then close shop.</p>
              <p>Let your kid take a school bus if very young or public if older. As a TD, you wanna be free to take any jobs at any time, if that timing your momentum is good why break it, in order to fetch? You can carry on, earn a bit more then next day, you can relax a bit.</p>
              <p>But as Poolman said ask around, but I think morning is safer because at night you might have to face drunkards - sooner or later you gonna have to face them, and as a woman, it's usually more stressful to deal with such pax.</p>

              <p>also in order to find a day relief , she cannot insist on just CDG .</p>
              <p>She must be ready to open up to SMRT , Wish or even Silver Kia .</p>
