              the day, she said you are going through the long way!  Once I
              picked up an indian woman from hillview to somewhere near yew tee
              mrt.  Ok, i admit don't know the way, so I asked if she know,
              and she said, "I know the way when you get to near CCK", which is =
              don't know the way!  So I follow GPS, which tells me to go
              Upper Bukit Timah, Woodlands then CCK.  Then reaching
              destination the fare goes to $10.xx and she said I am going through
              the long way and said normaly cab fare only between $6 to 8. 
              There is some jam at hillview roundabout, so I said probably due to
              the jam and she argued that she has been to worst jam than that and
              also not reach $10!  I saw not quite willing to give discount
              and said since you don't know the way, I am going through the GPS
              way.  Then she said if I don't know the way, ask other drivers
              next time!  How to ask when I am driving on the road? 
              End of the day, I accepted $8, but the last sentence that she said
              before leaving the cab really piss me off!  She said something
              that nowadays Singapore are like any other countries, people are
              all trying to cheat!</p>
