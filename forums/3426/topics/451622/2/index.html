              <p>Yesterday after alight Pax at AP Departure, Terminal 3, I turn around to Arrival to pick up Pax because when I was approaching, there were no Taxis in the queue.</p>
              <p>When it was my turn, the warden instead of telling me which yellow box to go to, beckon me forward.</p>
              <p>Then she ask me to wind down my window. Jialat. What did I do wrong? Shit.</p>
              <p>Then she look at me with a stern face and says, "You go forward, to Crown Plaza."</p>
              <p>Wheez, I thought what happen. She want me to pick up passenger at the Airport Hotel.</p>

              <p>Bro foolsh, being able to access to information about landing is not much use. Because you must interpret the information.</p>
              <p>Which flight, from where, time of day, how close each flight, etc., etc.</p>
              <p>Only when you know how to use these information, then you can PnG at AP.</p>
              <p>I know got some Brudders here already cracked the code.</p>
              <p>I want to master Sweep, Sweep, Sweep before look at AP Schedule.</p>

              <p>If i were StriveOn , being a CNG cab , i will not go to Q at

              is one taxi stand , 70% of chances , u will get one to West side

              <p>I think differently. TD is in the service industry. If your customer like your services and ask for a name card, you should give it to him/her. You might not know who he/she is. What he/she is working as, but that one card (worth less than $0.10) could possibly influence your future.</p>
