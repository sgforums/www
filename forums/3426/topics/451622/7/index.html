              <p>You are right. Like yesterday while on my way back to return to night shift was trying my luck for nearby pax at a Marsiling MRT taxi stand. But see long taxi queue and thus move on to the next taxi stand. Just when I passed by the taxi stand (probably less than 10 meter), someone flag for me cos the taxi at the queue is a Wish. I point to him to go to the taxi stand and take that Wish and the pax look stunt. Ha Ha.</p>
              <p>Is not that we need the pax but sometime we just have to respect the Taxi stand Queue esp is so near. (Imaging just probably 10 steps more to the Taxi stand). Thus, this is just a way that we hope that the next time we also get the respect back from other cabby...</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p>Don't worry, u can't prevent other from not doing it but u tell yourself that you follow what u think is right. Maybe, while your next pax will send u to town. Ha Ha.</p>
              <p>That night (Monday) after I proceed to the next taxi stand, guess what I rejected 2 pax due to they not going nearby, they go to Clementi and Punggol. After that, I tell myself it must be I rejected the previous customer(@ Marsiling side) that I was given a choice for a further distance.</p>
              <p>Since I kanna 2 paxs with no nearby and left with 25mins, I left the taxi stand and passdown to my 2nd part night shift.</p>
              <p>So just treat that the next pax or a few more other pax will give you good trips too.</p>

              <p>So I was thinking maybe "On Call" or "Busy"</p>
              <p>Further down the road, a lady flag my cab. And another man flag for the Red Crown.</p>
              <p>And the Red Crown stop to pick him.</p>

              <p>Yep, its an old auntie.</p>
              <p>But I find the super old ones (above 80) are more generous.</p>
              <p>Whereas the old ones (up to 60) are cheapo.</p>
              <p>Maybe they see broken already.</p>
