              <p>Since I took the wheels of a 2.0L Wish in mid-March 2012, there are things happening which I want to share.</p>
              <p>But because in the begining, I am so blur (on the road) and evrything so stressed, didn't really want to start another thread.</p>
              <p>Now that things are more or less settled down, decided to start this thread.</p>
              <p>No promise, but I try to keep posting every now and then.</p>

              <p>At first, when I came to this forum, I thought it is just another forum.</p>
              <p>But soon I realised that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> just another forum.</p>
              <p>It is a place where you can get a lot of info, .. if you are considering joining the TD trade.</p>
              <p>It is more like a club. Unlike other forums, some of the people here do get in touch with each other.</p>
              <p>Some of the postings here are strongly worded, but actually the forumers know each other and are good friends.</p>
              <p>But like in other forums, there are also heated arguments that are real.</p>

              <p>Got something worrying me currently.</p>
              <p>On the 8 April, my picture was taken by LTA Officers in front of Clifford pier, because I was inside a full day bus lane.</p>
              <p>Pax wanted to go Marina Bay Financial Center. Somewhere near Clifford Pier, she says turn left, so I turn la.</p>
              <p>Then she says "no, no, no", further up.</p>
              <p>I already in Bus Lane, then I saw this guy taking my picture.</p>
              <p>I was in the dotted line Full Day Bus Lane. The slot where I left the main flow of vehicles has already closed up.</p>
              <p>I make a sharp right turn and wait for a slot so that I can join the main flow of traffic.</p>
              <p>If I move forward 2 meters, I will enter the unbroken line full day bus lane.</p>
              <p>So I die, die dont move forward. Until a slot appears in the main flow of traffic, and I move in.</p>
              <p>Until today, 1st May, I have not received any letter from LTA.</p>
              <p>Praying and hoping that I WILL NOT receive the letter.</p>

              <p>There is life is Taxi driver, the way TD work on the road is already their life, except for the same vehicle and wheels, the scene and the people you met keep changing, that is life, life is a constant change, if you look at security guard, that is no life, I am also do relief for condo guard, seibei boring, yet low pay.</p>
              <p>TD in a closer look, got a colorful life. You can take or reject a call, you can press no show if pax do not turn up on time, like me casket driver, there is no such thing as no show, the dead will die die wait for you, if you are late, get fark until siao</p>

              <p>Suddenly you put new meaning in an old lifestyle.</p>
              <p>In a way its true. When I was working in the factory, employment contract says 8 hrs. But just to make sure everything OK so that Boss will not screw me, can easily spend 12 to 14 hours in the factory.</p>
              <p>Used to joke, never see the sun. Morning go to work at 6.30am. Factory and canteen inside the building. Leave workplace between 7.30pm to 9pm. How to see the Sun?</p>
              <p>But then we can snake here and there.</p>
              <p>Taxi Driving cannot snake.</p>
              <p>If Got passenger, brain have to think what route to use and how to get there safe and fast. Fast so that can do next job.</p>
              <p>If No passenger, got to scan the road side for pax, very tiring to the eyes. And also must keep an eye on the vehicles in front.</p>

              <p>TIPS</p>
              <p>Yesterday, I ferried a couple and a kid from Ikea to Henderson.</p>
              <p>He have some stuff plus a long thingy that strectches all the way to the headrest of the front seat.</p>
              <p>He said"sorry,sorry". I said no problem, as long as it does not affect my driving.</p>
              <p>Fare was $5. Passed me $10 and gave him back $5.</p>
              <p>Then I got down to help him unload. Everything cleared, Wished him a good day, and got back into my Driver seat.</p>
              <p>Before I moved off, he opened the rear passenger door to check the seats. I turned around and says, "nothing there".</p>
              <p>Then he look at me and pass me the $5 that I gave him earlier.</p>
              <p>Shiok !!</p>

              <p>Ikea's pax at Alexandra is an ideal place if u dun intend to go long .</p>
              <p>This is one location where it is nearly impossible to find one to go East side , cos logically Ikea has got one at Tampines !</p>
              <p>If i were StriveOn , being a CNG cab , i will not go to Q at Ikea Alexandra , instead i will Q at Queensway SC taxi stand . This is one taxi stand , 70% of chances , u will get one to West side .</p>
