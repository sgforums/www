              <p>I think differently. TD is in the service industry. If your customer like your services and ask for a name card, you should give it to him/her. You might not know who he/she is.

              <p>Then driver usually far away , cannot make it , tell pax give you 30 minutes , they fly there .</p>
              <p>Service very good . Pax impressed , but . . . then drivers will come to think of it , knn got pax dun take , spent 30 minutes come down from Tampines to Shelford Road , and for that $10 ?</p>
              <p>Worth it ?</p>
              <p>Then slowly . . . when pax call next day , not free , quite far away .</p>
              <p>NExt day , still far away .</p>

              <p>Out of those 100% of normal taxi drivers i know , not one succeeded in holding on their so called regulars .</p>
              <p>Their regulars eventually will go back to conventional ways of getting a cab , 6552-1111 , maybe now they can call 6555-3333 . Maybe some extra got Premier .</p>
              <p>Unless one give out name cards when driving normal taxis , then when their customers base solid liao , hop to Premium level , then giving out name cards come handy .</p>
              <p>Premium level as in min 25points per trip for short trip , as much as $50points for different type of service .</p>
              <p>And maybe per hour bookings .</p>
              <p>Yes , then giving out name cards works .</p>
              <p>Normal taxis can only get normal prices .</p>

              <p>No lah,. no bang wall.</p>
              <p>Got no intention of getting regular customers at this point of time, but building up the base is good for my next phase in the tranporter business.</p>
              <p>But the problem is if I give name cards now, they will expect limo service but taxi price.</p>
              <p>The only regular service that I dont mind doing is the 6am or 7am one.</p>
              <p>Wake up, go straight to pick up, then start the day.</p>
              <p>I did this for one week, for a Secondary School boy going to school, but the cheapo (but very rich) Indonesian family stop after one week. (No offense. I have some Indonesian Friends who are very ethical)</p>
              <p>That's not all. Pay by week, so when I ask for money at the end of week, the boy says mother never give him the money.</p>
              <p>Had to make a few phone calls, and make an extra trip across the island (I did not want to delay if he is ready to pay me) just to collect the miserable 4 days fare. I believe the boy has the money to pay me on that Friday, but because of his selfishness, I had to spend extra time, fuel and phone calls just to collect what is due to me.</p>

              <p>In Taxi Driving, giving extra service has no benefit. Bec ause probably you wont see this pax again.</p>
              <p>But the argument is, if All TU give extra service, then the Professionalism in Taxi Industry will go up.</p>
              <p>But look around you, even you as a TU also cannot tahan the other TU, who got no ethics or considerations. So your extra service will be wasted.</p>
              <p>I choose to think of it the other way.</p>
              <p>I will give extra service, because I feel good inside, and I like to look at Pax surprise that still got TU like me. (ha ha, self-praise)</p>
              <p>eg. Auntie got many NTUC bags to carry. I will get down and close the Rear Passenger door for her, because her hands are full.</p>
              <p>eg. at AP, I will take over trolley and tell Pax to go sit in the Taxi while I load up.</p>
              <p>eg. Unsteady Old man getting down from Taxi, same, I will get down and close rear Passenger door for him. I tell Uncle dont worry about the door, just keep walking.</p>
              <p>The satisfaction, I cannot describe. You do it and you will know. But remember, dont expect anything in return.</p>
