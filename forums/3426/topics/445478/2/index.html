              <p>My friend, those spirits are better than human, unlike human, they never sabotage you, want your money or your trick you into anything bad or like our govt, suck your blood and money.</p>
              <p>Most of these spirits are the rich and younger ones, when you drop them off at the crematorium or the burying ground, you need to open the pax door for them to get down, if not they will follow you back.</p>
              <p>These spirits do not believe that they are dead, especially the younger ones and still think that they are alive, more so are the rich one, because they still got lot of money yet to spent, that is why people say, come with nothing, go with nothing. It is true.</p>
              <p>For us in these line, we know the trick like your MDT trick, you need to open the pax door, respect and tell it that it has reached your destination, your family had already paid the fares, please alight and follow your family, give three bow and then after a few minutes, close the door, then close everything once the box is taken out. I guess your buddy forget to invite those spirit down, that is why, they followed him home and make a mess out of his life. Because the spirit get fedup with him of bringing them home.</p>
              <p>Even if I said it you will not believe, when you open the pax door for it to alight, you can feel a wind blow by as tho someone walk by you, and that is the time you close the door slowly. If you close in a panic way, it will scare and go back. Stay cool and calm.</p>

              <p>Decent02, dun be prejudiced against black car drivers. You see them maciam car weird dress weird, and snicker at them.</p>
              <p>But I bet its them who laughing at you. They already know what people will be thinking of them kenna rejected at airport.</p>
              <p>Its no big deal one. People reject them just means the pax bo lui one. Dun even need to interview. They got time to wait. 5 rejections so what. Just need a wealthy pax.</p>
              <p>Perhaps your blue sonata is relatively new or well taken care of. But you need to go airport twice to equal their single trip.</p>
              <p>You think black car driver pok kai, but when you try to get one, then you wonder how come blue yellow so high turn over, but black car waiting list for new drivers can be years.</p>

              <p>Its true lah. Airport is important for many people, but especially black and maxi.</p>
              <p>Talking about cabbing trying to 'sum' pax, I observed that not just at tourist attractions, but also combi drivers doing fake arrivals.....</p>
              <p>As for the Alphards, it does not make sense unless they got CDG's call volume. Without calls, the drivers might as well take a bank loan and buy their own. I have no clue how these Prime Alphards are supposed to survive. If they got kang tao, no need Alphard already. If they no have kang tao, might as well drive for C&amp;P or other limo coys.</p>

              <p>Perhaps your blue sonata is relatively new or well taken care of. But you need to go airport twice to equal their single trip.</p>

              <p>i am not prejudiced ....just stating feedback from a tourist</p>
              <p>in fact I am more prejudiced against those red crowns who sped in RWS tunnel going into the casino taxi queue trying to overtake you so they can be in front of the taxi queue.... brainless and so dangerous.... really makes no diff if you are just slightly ahead.</p>
