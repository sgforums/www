              <p>I read so many of TD's encounters with bad passengers who accuse TD 
                  for driving longer routes. But personally, I met a TD who really go the 
                  longer route even after I told him I'll guide him to take my route.</p>
              <p>I've
                   been going from my home in Hougang to my company in Tampines central 
                  for years via Old Tampines rd (bus 72's route) and it's faster than 
                  whatever expressway route (I forgot the name of the expressway, think 
                  it's CTE. This expressway route also taken before with a few TD, but 
                  always got traffic jam so I prefer Old Tampines rd).</p>
              <p>So whenever I take cab (due to me waking up late sometimes) to company, I'll always ask the TD to go by old tampines rd.</p>
              <p>But
                   once, there's this tmd TD uncle who asked me what route to take, I 
                  asked him to go by Old Tampines Rd, he said that road &amp; expressway 
                  always jam. I replied I always take bus 72 which also go via Old 
                  Tampines Rd but I've never experienced jam. Then he insisted on going by
                   Jalan Kayu Rd then to some expressway. I quickly pointed out that would
                   be a longer route, he said no choice because of jam and just started 
                  driving.</p>
              <p>I was shocked but too late to get off already. Never 
                  mind, so I let him drive. Even for those TD who took some expressway 
                  route, they never have to drive via Jalan Kayu road. This is clearly a 
                  rip off! Thoughout the journey, he keep on saying Old Tampines Rd jam.</p>
              <p>Personally,
                   during those times when I woke up on time, and take bus 72 which go to 
                  Tampines Central via Old Tampines Rd, the traffic is always normal one. 
                  Then I SMSed a colleague who took bus 72 to office, she also said that 
                  morning Old Tampines Rd no jam, normal road conditions.</p>
              <p>When 
                  nearing Tampines Central (near the temple &amp; dormitory area), that 
                  tmd TD went to the HDB flats area in the national library side to took 
                  another longer route. I pointed to him again, that he can take the route next to Tampines dormitory (after the temples) to access central (bus 72's route), he said that road cannot take. I was like "What?!"</p>
              <p>Then he go all the way to the road beside Courts/GIANT to the HDB flats near the national library area.</p>
              <p>When
                   reached Tampines Central finally, I paid $27 (my usual is $10.** 
                  only!) and I'm still late despite taking a cab. Normally, when I woke up
                   late, I take cab which go by Old Tampines Road, I'll still be on time 
                  and paying only $10.**.</p>
              <p>This is clearly a rip off! So, don't blame us pax for being suspicious or agitated when asking about route!</p>

              <p>Jalan Kayu road you also don't know? Along that road got lots of roti prata shops one loh, then at end of Jalan Kayu road is the dunno what expressway (but is not the expressway TD usually take when they go from my place and they never take Bartley rd flyover).</p>
              <p>The part of Hougang I'm staying is near Yio Chu Kang road.</p>
              <p>TD also can take bus routes one what, as long as not in bus lanes.</p>
              <p>That unlucky time I took with that jerk TD is without call surcharge, I didn't call him as it's easy to get cab in my area along Yio Chu Kang road.</p>
              <p>With peak hour surcharge, usually only $10.XX only. Never hit $11 one. But that unlucky time with that jerk TD, it hit $27!!! Want to earn more money from me, can, but next life must pay back multiple times!!!</p>

              <p>So whenever I take cab (due to me waking up late sometimes) to company, I'll always ask the TD to go by old tampines rd.</p>
              <p>But once, there's this tmd TD uncle who asked me what route to take, I asked him to go by Old Tampines Rd, he said that road &amp; expressway always jam. I replied I always take bus 72 which also go via Old Tampines Rd but I've never experienced jam. Then he insisted on going by Jalan Kayu Rd then to some expressway. I quickly pointed out that would be a longer route, he said no choice because of jam and just started driving.</p>
              <p>I was shocked but too late to get off already. Never mind, so I let him drive. Even for those TD who took some expressway route, they never have to drive via Jalan Kayu road. This is clearly a rip off! Thoughout the journey, he keep on saying Old Tampines Rd jam.</p>
              <p>Personally, during those times when I woke up on time, and take bus 72 which go to Tampines Central via Old Tampines Rd, the traffic is always normal one. Then I SMSed a colleague who took bus 72 to office, she also said that morning Old Tampines Rd no jam, normal road conditions.</p>
              <p>When nearing Tampines Central (near the temple &amp; dormitory area), that tmd TD went to the HDB flats area in the national library side to took another longer route. I pointed to him again, that he can take the route next to Tampines dormitory (after the temples) to access central (bus 72's route), he said that road cannot take. I was like "What?!"</p>
              <p>Then he go all the way to the road beside Courts/GIANT to the HDB flats near the national library area.</p>
              <p>When reached Tampines Central finally, I paid $27 (my usual is $10.** only!) and I'm still late despite taking a cab. Normally, when I woke up late, I take cab which go by Old Tampines Road, I'll still be on time and paying only $10.**.</p>
              <p>This is clearly a rip off! So, don't blame us pax for being suspicious or agitated when asking about route!</p>

              <p>Jalan Kayu road you also don't know? Along that road got lots of roti prata shops one loh, then at end of Jalan Kayu road is the dunno what expressway (but is not the expressway TD usually take when they go from my place and they never take Bartley rd flyover).</p>
              <p>The part of Hougang I'm staying is near Yio Chu Kang road.</p>
              <p>TD also can take bus routes one what, as long as not in bus lanes.</p>
              <p>That unlucky time I took with that jerk TD is without call surcharge, I didn't call him as it's easy to get cab in my area along Yio Chu Kang road.</p>
              <p>With peak hour surcharge, usually only $10.XX only. Never hit $11 one. But that unlucky time with that jerk TD, it hit $27!!! Want to earn more money from me, can, but next life must pay back multiple times!!!</p>

              <p><br>I of course know Jalan Kayu , but u said u stay at Hougang &gt; Then go by Kayu ?</p>
              <p>I never visualised which part actually .</p>
              <p>If near Fernvale , or Buangkok side , or Hougang St 91 , or Ave 4 side .</p>
              <p>Pls tell the drivers that took you to take this route .</p>
              <p>Don't take any Old Tampines Road .</p>
              <p>This one faster .</p>
              <p>Yio Chu Kang Road &gt; Hougang Ave 2 &gt; Eunos Link &gt; Airport Road &gt; Bartley Road East &gt; Down &gt; Tampines Ave 5 .</p>
              <p>Try this route , now many people use this route , save alot of time .</p>
              <p>I would say , nothing more than $11 .</p>

              <p>I suppose you stay near Regentville at Hougang Ave 9</p>
              <p>I tried both routes (the one you suggested and the Jalan Kayu-&gt;TPE route)</p>
              <p>The Jalan Kayu one is definitely more expensive as you enter TPE much earlier than at Hougang Ave 3 where you can choose to enter Old Tampines road too.</p>
              <p>Its rare for Old Tampines road to have jams (personally I have never encounter any before). But one point to note is the Kovan area always jam in the morning so maybe the TD was imply that area.</p>
              <p>Another route you can consider is Hougang Ave 9-&gt;Sengkang New Town-&gt;TPE. Smooth traffic flow and cost about the same as the Old Tampines Road</p>
