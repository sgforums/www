So you mean old are no use.</p>
              <p> ha. come on...lah, you never old...ha.. So you mean old peoples are useless and you hate them all those bus, truck, taxi, as long as they are above 50 years, what about your parents are they fall into this catagory. assumption could be lower that 30 years. so children...let it be, you happy or not happy they are still there, nothing much we could help. try take away the 85 year old....can you.</p>
              <p>we are talking  about the fines or violation, not the old, where taxi drivers need to know. yo.</p>
