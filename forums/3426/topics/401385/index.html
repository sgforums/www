              <p>Benitez, who took over from Gerard Houllier in 2004, found his position untenable after a disappointing season which saw Liverpool finish seventh in the Premier League, just 12 months after being runners-up to Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Rafael Benitez told the club's official website: "It is very sad for me to announce that I will no longer be manager of Liverpool FC. I would like to thank all of the staff and players for their efforts.</p>
              <p>"I'll always keep in my heart the good times I've had here, the strong and loyal support of the fans in the tough times and the love from Liverpool. I have no words to thank you enough for all these years and I am very proud to say that I was your manager.</p>
              <p>"Thank you so much once more and always remember: You'll never walk alone."</p>

              <p>He have left a lot of Liverpool fan alone in misery when he insists on playing his pet Lucas.</p>
              <p>Liverpool will struggle with or without him next season without the funds.</p>
              <p>But, without him around, the youth players will come up the rank and crap players like Lucas will be banished to the reserves.</p>
              <p>It is a re-building process that Liverpool need to undergo to be a true champion.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have carried too many baggage and too egoistic to improve the present squad given his approach for the past few seasons.</p>
              <p>The new guy, whoever he is, will build a true Liverpool squad and bring the spirit back.</p>
              <p>Defeat or draw will be part and parcel for the next season.</p>
              <p>But, if we can build a strong and passionate squad, why no ?</p>
              <p>It will never happen under Ah Ben.</p>
