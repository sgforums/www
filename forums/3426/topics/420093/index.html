              Hi all, can u guys share how do u deal with passengers that eat in the taxi. 
              
              Can we enforce the law when the pax refuse to corporate.
              
              I had this Indonesian ladies inside my cab eating biscuits. Well most of the time if it's just one or two pieces they take I turn a blond eye. I really don't like confrontation, as it spoilts the day after that. But this time all four of them was munching and the thong that cheese me off was that one of them even go to the extend of brushing off the crumps not once but twice. I then turn around and told them sorry u r not allowed to eat in the taxi. The one sitting in front beside me apologise and stop. But just within another few mins one of them munch again and brush the crumps off again. I though maybe she just finishing the leftover so ignored and let it be. Drove on and WTF she started eating again, I turn around and said to her excuse me I told u not to eat in the cab. And she just shove another piece of biscuit into her mouth right in front of me and with a don't f attitude brush the crumps off her hand and her pants. I was really piss and I stop the taxi and told them I could report u and get out of the cab. Her friend apologise again and well I did not want to waste time and that lady did not argue. I drop them off their intended destination.
              
              This isn't the first time pax eating inside my cab. I use to just let it be, but then a while back some spilled sunflower shells in my cab. It was dark I did not see until the next pax came in and told me. Then some leave sticky tissues by the hand rail. Even had this ang mo guy ate burger and left lettuce inside the back seat. So really now I will tell pax not to eat. As other pax wanna use a clean cab later. But really I find it hard to confront and also really want to know our rights on this. If any of u know, pls enlighten. Thx u in advance.

              <p>If you are driving cdg, just eat the humble pie, if pax counter complain about your attitude, you will get demerit points.</p>
              <p>If other taxi coy, just do what you think its right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best to wear a pie-kia mask and pax would sit quietly throughout the journey....even if they dirtied your taxi, they would pay you extra $30 cleaning fee without being asked.</p>
              <p>To become pie-kia, u must first become ho-kia and go through all kinds of shit.....it is not easy to master the art of pie-kia.....so just endure till u finally leveled up to pie-kia.....</p>
              <p>Cdg too many ho-kia....pax no money, didnt accept money, u get star award, pax wanna borrow $100 coz he forgot wallet, also kenna star award lmfao....</p>
              <p>You better pray you dont meet a pro pax complain until you will be out of cdg, but its a good thing, u can become pie-kia and suffer less shit.....</p>

              <p>Well ..... if u see people carry a Mcdonald before boarding , before u press the meter , tell them first : " Pls do not eat inside the cab , this is a public transport , do you eat inside a MRT or buses ?"</p>
              <p>No , we don't do that .</p>

              <p><br>I just did that, i went hard on a PRC couple whom I picked up at waterloo street, eating Pao and drinking bubble tea in my taxi, then when they eat, they eat like animals, bits drop here and there on my taxi, then i told them not to eat or at least eat without dropping, they scolded me, I stopped the taxi and told them to pick up the rubbish and drop, they throw the pao and tissues on my rear mats, then walk off, I go after them, told them I report police, they shouted very loud at me, my taxi was in the middle of the jammed middle road, already a big jam there, lots of honking at my taxi, so no choice, I went back and drove off.
