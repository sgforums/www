              <p><br>Of course for talk only, cos you drive until tao hong liao, but for empty talk, it is ok, alway remember this is a public forum, there can be 10 posts but 1000++ viewing it, the govt is very sensitive on association and society creation in singapore, from union association to secret society are top priorty of their security and more so, their position as govt, they will by all measn try to stop it in the mask of peace and harmony as their way of brain washing the people.</p>
              <p>And when your house door get knocked at morning 3am (hopefully you are not at all but driving), in you go, all they can said, this is to protect singaporean for peace and harmony.</p>
              <p>NTUC is the brainchild of LKY, initially led by Devan Nair, who was once our president. Today, it is one of the richest union in the world, perhap behind Ringo , japan union. And today, NTUC is the perhap the only union in the world that have increasing members.  NTUC protray 3 objectives,</p>
              <p>1. Members being the blood of the union, now standing at 600,000, I believe their vision will be 1 million soon.</p>
              <p>2. To work with govt and companies in a consultation approach rather than force approach, and thereby promote Tripartism, meaning harmony, peace and corporation by all 3 parties, Union, govt and management. Singapore tripartism is the awe of the world.</p>
              <p>3. To protect workers from exploitation and care for their welfare.</p>
              <p>There 2 laws that govern singapore union, the trade union ACT and the industrial relation ACT. Employment Laws is a public laws, and if you look closely, it serve the employer (Boss) better than the workers or drivers.</p>
              <p>The Union also hv it own court know as the Arbitration Court, which is the highest decision maker in industrial issues.</p>

              <p>As Taxi drivers, you are the boss, so what is there to protect you from exploitation by taxi companies, if you fight for rental issue, you go court, the court will throw the issue out of the court base on that you are the boss,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You rent the cab with eyes open, if dun like, throw key, same as the taxi companies, if they dun like you, they can sack you.</p>
              <p>From the perspectives of laws, it take on the equilibrium of the issue, not your emotion or whatever personnal issues.</p>
              <p>You agree to the terms, you rent = taxi companies provide taxi for you</p>
              <p>You throw key = taxi companies take back the key and may ask you to compensate as per the terms agreed</p>
              <p>Fair?</p>
              <p>On the other hand</p>
              <p>You did not follow the term agreed = Taxi companies remove you</p>
              <p>You do not agree to something new on the term or so forth = you remove the company by throw key</p>
              <p>Fair? democratic enough??</p>
              <p>This is how laws take on you as a taxi drivers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TD joining companies is unlike normal workers, workers are contracted for service under the employment act, and when they join union, they are covered by Trade union act and IR Act, in one united force, they get a union rep, chairman, to negiotiate with company for wages increase, bonuses, and so on.</p>
              <p>For workers, they can, collectively, have an agreement on the terms and conditions with the company boss, and this agreement is called Collective Agreement, in it, it spell out all the regulation, retrenchment benefits, leaves, hospital, medical insurance and so forth, and this is the most important paper the workers hold, it is certified by the IAC.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers got what??? nothing, you go in, you agree with the term, you drive on, not agree, can fark off. We are therefore, on our own.</p>

              <p>The way I saw it, the taxi meter is a political liability. Fares going up or down will never please everyone. Up also got complain, down also lost votes. The best is to remove it altogether and charge flat fares like public bus, tour coaches, trains, ship, boat n aeroplanes.</p>
              <p>This taxi meter does not provide any value to them. It was never upgraded all these years. COE also no taxi category. Maybe the government is hinting at a different direction, one where they can wash their hands and let market forces dictate the fares. What is market force?

              <p>Bros pool, you seem like to use the word "if", this is a dream "conjunction".</p>
              <p>To have a revolution, it takes a very strong united feeling among the people against the those holding power. Most of the time, these are poor and suffering peoples, and you need to have a strong cause to do it, in singapore, what is your cause to start a revolution, and will people listen to you when you talk? Most will think, you kong jiao way, siao liao. Why? because nearly all singaporean got a home, a job, a family and a peaceful environment.</p>
              <p>Unless you are saying that we are now like former soviet poland, need to Q for a piece of bread, need to Q for water, wood for fire, need to Q for days to get a job, street full of robber and thieves, prositutes, country in a state of corruption and the soviet govt exploiting the polish people to the extreme. But are we?? Mao took over china because he had a strong cause, Hilter rule over german because the people of german had a strong cause for change. And LKY come to power because he had strong cause to remove the British and want a independent singapore, people take it.</p>
              <p>Social politics is about you, follow by your family, your town and then, your country. Once you are not taken care of, yr family suffer, your town get bulldoze over, and your country in a state of downturn. LKY understood all these, so he know that "YOU" is very important, by giving you a job, you can earn, by giving your a peaceful environment, you can build a family, by giving you a sense of belong, you can support your town, and then with all these, you can then truly protect your country with your heart and soul. Without a job, nothing work, and revolution can then take place.</p>

              <p>Psychological speaking, when you wake up, what do you think, for those limo will be thinking of booking, for those normal cabbies, will be thinking of breaking even the rental first, for worker like me, better reach company on time to punch in, if not kenna go office for being late again, then maybe cut bonuses. That is what our govt want us to think??? and when you think of that, you got no way to think of rebel and revolution.</p>
              <p>This is further reinforced by govt in providing lower wages jobs to mid wages jobs for most of us, if not, like the arabs, all lazy and sleep at home, money also can fly in, so in a sense, the govt do not wish to make you full, they wanted you to be hungry, hungry for materialism, hungery for foods, hungery for business, hungery for fares, hungery for durian to drop.</p>

              <p>It was never a political liability, it is more of a political profiteering at the expense of both the TD and Pax. In taxis driving, 4 parties are involve in the daily merry go round state, the TD, the Pax, the Companies and the Govt (LTA).</p>
              <p>If analyse on it, COs is there to make profit behind a curtain</p>
              <p>LTA is also to make profit and at the same time, instill rules and disciplines also behind a curtain.</p>
              <p>Pax, as the frontline end user, pay and demand good services with as lowest fare as possible. And yet they earn money in their business, work or client meeting because of the fast and efficient transport the TD provide</p>
              <p>TD, the frontline service men, just like the front line infantry men, have to face paxs in a daily basis, sweat and sweep the road all day long in return to pay taxi cos and sometime LTA and yet, at the same time, have to lookout for traffic, LTA officers, Jams, calls, time, fuel meter, weather, car condition, and so on. Then end up with a pathetic return, 50% less is OBK&lt; 10% more consider as Huat kind of life.</p>
              <p>So, if you look at it, One Man work, many take profit and the one who work most, took the least.</p>
              <p>The govt had alway want the market force to do the work, because singapore, in a capitalist country of being the top 10 most expensive country in the world, market forces will alway set a uptrend pace, if govt did not intervene the housing, what do you think a house cost today??? If the market forces is to decide taxi fare, what will be the logic fare...for this, I let bro Pool to present to you. Bro pool please.</p>

              <p>I admire your notion Poolman, that's why I signed your petition. Something has to start from somewhere. To be frank. You all know Singaporeans got cut throat culture. Many still have the "fuck each other up" attitude to get a bigger pie. Never before has a real union sufficed. Never before many Singaporeans felt the greatness of cohesiveness.</p>
              <p>See how all the French people violantly object to retirement age increase and are denied of rightful pension? And see how so many Singaporeans fuck each other up when government raised our retirement age. Small percentage of vocal Singaporeans will raise their displeasure, the majority will tag these people as whinners and claim government doing it for our good.... if not can get dementia. Sometimes I find it quite funny.  The mentality of a big group of us are hindering the pace of advancement in standard of living. Like I said, I signed your petition even when I'm no longer with transcab. But that doesn't mean I think only for myself.</p>
