              <p>I think the strategy of what the former LTA minister did to implement peak hour surcharge is not getting well with both TDs and commuters, every now and then you can hear complaints and negative remarks from both the service provider and the end user.</p>
              <p> The authority can alway discuss with relevant taxi companies, NTA or even a normal TD like us for feedback, propose a few options and let discuss it over, simply by putting surcharge here and there is not going to solve problem, it could end up island wide pax get fed up and boycott this period altogether, which for night drivers, other than those clubs, it is a battle out there to get pax in other part of this island.</p>
              <p>We should not take for granted and solve issue by increasing this and that, which is what the govt is doing and the peoples are not happy, just like bus services, why do they need to increase 1% of the fare when the two operators are making millions of dollars in net profits? It is not a matter of 1%, which can be harmful for me, the poorer people but still affordable, but it is the principle of it. You privatise the bus companies which is mend to serve the lower class peoples and all others by the govt, so that you can run like any business entities that need to increase profit to satisfy yr shareholders, we are all taken for a ride.</p>

              <p>There is old hirer who I used to be his super relief, he got this so call daily confirmed regular night trips in several clubs, be it those nightclub girls or nightclub clients, mostly around selegie, jalan besar and some part of geyland. When I am his night relief, he will tell me where and what time to pick, not bad. Paxs that board alway ask about him, i told them he went holidays. I did ask him how he gets all these lobangs, he told me, most of the clubs bosses are his old buddies, these bosses formerly also no education, got nothing to lose but anyhow venture here and there, failed many times in business, learnt and then finally able to get on going, they dare to take risk better than him. So now his buddies are bosses, he still a taxi driver, but not bad, they still take care of him. He told me in older times, good friends are even better than brother, they care for you even if you are poor or down. Today, you can hardly find such bonding, maybe the society had changed to be more individualistic.</p>
              <p>As for angmo cau, he said that sending ang mo cau to clubs is the best, but sending them back that time is the worst. He said most Angmo are good and polite in nature, but once they get a few bottles/glasses, they can be the worst passengers. If you want to pick up paxs at CQ or OT, SJames etc, be prepare, if you are going to change shift or buzz off, avoid such places, Since you have no intention to take paxs, why be there and end up having to argue with some paxs, and thing can turn sour, cos most are no more using their normal brain to think, even the most elegant and professional banker can turn ugly.</p>

              around selegie, jalan besar and some part of geyland. When I
              am his night relief, he will tell me where and what time to pick,
              not bad. Paxs that board alway ask about him, i told them he went
              holidays. I did ask him how he gets all these lobangs, he told me,
              most of the clubs bosses are his old buddies, these bosses formerly
              also no education, got nothing to lose but anyhow venture here and
              there, failed many times in business, learnt and then finally able
              to get on going, they dare to take risk better than him. So
              now his buddies are bosses, he still a taxi driver, but not bad,
              they still take care of him. He told me in older times, good
              friends are even better than brother, they care for you even
              if you are poor or down. Today, you can hardly find such bonding,
              maybe the society had changed to be more individualistic.</p>
              <p>As for angmo cau, he said that sending ang mo cau to clubs is
              the best, but sending them back that time is the worst. He said
              most Angmo are good and polite in nature, but once they get a few
              bottles/glasses, they can be the worst passengers. If you want to
              pick up paxs at CQ or OT, SJames etc, be prepare, if you are going
              to change shift or buzz off, avoid such places, Since you have no
              intention to take paxs, why be there and end up having to argue
              with some paxs, and thing can turn sour, cos most are no more using
              their normal brain to think, even the most elegant and professional
              banker can turn ugly.</p>
