              <p>congrats for starters.</p>
              <p>but perhaps dont be tooo over the clouds first. lets see how long your this new relief lasts. I know some that skip hirers like every other week one..becos they keep arguing about something, maybe poor vehicle upkeep, disgrunted timing and/or owe rent or fuel <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p>I dun wan to elaborate cause I dun wan to get sued for defaming.</p>
              <p>In short, after 8 months of driving, I can only conclude that I should have listen to other experienced cab driver and my uncle advice. Really regret. Instead of earning more money, I find myself throwing back to SMRT. And that is not largey due to the way I drive but on the services I get.</p>
              <p>As a brand new driver, I find myself very helpless. SMRT mentioned we are partners, but I think in the end the partnership may be, to me, lopsided.</p>
              <p>When I reach one year contract and collected my last incentive, I going to drive Transcab. Will be looking for a day relieve driver after Aug 2010. Anyone staying in Woodlands interested? Tell u first, I dun wan lao jiao join me then argue abt dmgs, fuel usage etc etc. I see so many quarrels between relieve and hirer that I am really worried.</p>

              <p>Hi Poolman &amp; all, stumpled into this thread and glad to find that there's a cabby community here...</p>
              <p>Just passed my TVL and will be getting my vehicle next week...</p>
              <p>Was wondering how's DC doing? Would really like to get in touch with him as I'm getting the SsanYong Space MPV Limo like him too... actually couldn't sleep very well last night after back reading this thread earlier last night...</p>
              <p>As I understand Limo services relay a long on corporate bookings, airport tranfers, hourly/ per trip bookings. So will try very hard to find/ dig lobangs.</p>
              <p>Any bros currently in any walkie talkie or booking grp, and care to let me know how the structure is like? eg. charges and system?</p>
              <p>Hopefully the community here can help out a newbie in this trade.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Wish can afford to learn .</p>
              <p>Ssangyong cannot afford , no financial backup while learning .</p>
              <p>Wish mthly benefit $716 , u work or no work , still get $716 by end month , condition is rental must be punctual la .</p>

              <p>I have never driven a space before, so i can't comment on it. But trust micasa pool lah, he cannot be so wrong one. One thing about driving space is finding lobang, if you are not the type that's good at it, no point lah. One thing for sure you are facing strong competitions from all lao gui space, even if you manage to find lobang, you are always behind them. I believe life is going to be tough.</p>
              <p>One thing I am sure about is SMRT....phui.... damn cock up company. Most award them " Most Cock-up Company Of the Year 2010".</p>
              <p>How I hope more people will come read this forum before they ever join SMRT...sigh..</p>
