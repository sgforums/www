              .... stress..... Anyway run around to buy HDB car park , than
              realise that the nearest public car park at town council was a
              multi story type, hight limit 1.8m. Being warn by ppl no 1.9m don
              go it ... Dam. Drive back to check on my own multi story to see
              high limit, lucky 2.15m so go back to HDB town council . Reach home
              near 5pm already , tired , try to sleep but can not. Decide go rd
              to face the heat, knn , stuck with my MDT as can not log in..
              Stress... wonder if MDT can not work , can credit card marchine
              work or not. 1930 hrs , still can not get MDT to work , don care
              already just go and pray all pax will go around east and pay by
              cash.</p>

              ask me keep $20. Blur, tell pax why $20 , insist they tell me how
              much they normally pay and from there i discount. Pax told me your
              meter not $18.60 , you have not press total fare. Heehee , k total
              $26.80. But pax say they normally pay less than $20. Keep saying
