              <p>Thanks to all the feedback and really appreciate them. Already collecting my vehicle next week so not backing out for now... I told myself to "dong" 6 month if not at least 3 month if really really can't work out on the Limo. Will need to payback course fees and $300 penalty with 21 days notice if to break less than six month of contract... Bo Bian...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I know once collected vehicle will be spenting most time on road so may not be so "eng" to pop in here, but i will still try to take a peep now and then cos this thread  and the http://cabby.sgforums.com is really useful.</p>

              <p>To the MVP guy,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Putting about my own judgement about SMRT aside. Since you have already collected SSangYeong, it is as you said too late to blakang puseng.</p>
              <p>Rest assure that MPV is not as bad as some has described. It is heavy and bulky and fuel consuming. MPV nonetheless is a good vehicle to earn good money. Just that as a new driver, you will be struggling (a lot!!!) for the first 3-6months or so. Largely due to the fact that you may not be experience enough to find location to pick up pax and not familiar with routes.</p>
              <p>The only advice I can give you now is drive it like a normal cab but having a mentality of a Limousine driver. Be prepared to have pple getting up ur cab and only to get down again when they see a normal cab coming up behind. (be prepared to bang balls all the time)</p>
              <p>MPV driver must target specific kind of passenger. Eg, Pax that does air travelling a lot, big family etc. Be bold to charge booking fee of $16 or flat fee $45/$50 (+$12 midnight) to pple who called you personally in private to ask for your service.</p>
              <p>Do not waste time on pple who cry expensive. Concentrate to serve pple who willing to pay for YOUR service. One week 2-3 airport transfer will make your life very easy. Got hourly booking even better.</p>
              <p>So go study about the geographical information and tourist information on Singapore. Go print yourself a copy of all the airline in which terminal info from the Changi Airport website. know all tourist attractions. All these will be your "tanjia" ammo.</p>
              <p>Dress well cause pple will pay for your looks. Learn to sell yourself and your taxi. There is this young taxi driver 531 who looks like those F4 or Jay Chou singer. Bugger, at Vivo City ($40 per trip $7 levy) got even rich auntie want to take photograph with him.</p>
              <p>And O, dun waste time on SMRT limo counter. Most of the time, it is a waste of your precious time. If u wan to go Limo, go it when you are more experience or only during June/Dec holiday to be safe.</p>
              <p>Below are the pricing for my service :</p>
              <p>Hourly Booking $40-45<br>Airport Transfer $45 (departure) $50 (arrival)<br>Sentosa/Vivo/Habourfront $40 or $16 plus metered fare</p>
              <p>You are your own boss. So set what you think is best for you. I know some driver charge $50 for hourly booking. All the best</p>

              <p>I just hope they bother to see lor. Yesterday go down tender, interview me why i left, i list out the point lor till the lady so paiseh. If it's the truth, let it be reported. I am not making up stories.There should be freedom for people to choose their choice of taxi company, and also for people to voice out problem faced in each company. Where got everyday we pay them stupid high rental they gave such fark up service one. I dare to say from day one till last day in my driving, i did not owe them a single cent in rental, so why am i still treated like a shit.</p>
              <p>Don't want people comment about their services and policy, do something lah, The new SMRT ceo, tia tio boh!!!</p>

              <p>Seriously no need to join any group. Just subscribe to the normal MPV channel will do. All the calls there are MPV only booking ie the $8 and Airport transfer one (but SMRT pple like to play pasar malam, sometimes A/P transfer they page out $8 plus metered. Dun compromise we r in the process of negotiating with SMRT).</p>
              <p>If Central Limo ask u join, dun bother urself with them. Dun think Airport job or their so call coporate job very "tua gi". Nothing great. I dun kao tao to them and can still earn good money. I drive about 12-14hrs only.</p>
