              <p>Someone wrote to Sunday Times that cabby must not be choosy even if customer demand to go to the most ulu place , it is the repsonsibility of driver to drive him there.</p>

              <p>KNNCB to those who never tried driving a cab for a living and think cabby must do to their liking.</p>
              <p>Cabby is also trying to make a decent living.  Imagine you are sent to Ah Shun or Ah Wood and empty cab rushing back to town to pick another pax. Just for $ and ONE hour wasted plus you have to speed like hell ( risking your probability in accident) in CTE. If you are lucky there is no Jam and you can have a smooth crusing.</p>
              <p>Even with the current carrot of $3 CBD surcharge wouldn't help us earn more. In fact most time it can be worst than without CBD surcharge.</p>
              <p>If you make all your way back to town, hopefully you are still lucky to get your next pax immediately.  Sometime - TD laments that the Taxi queue is already in all sorts of Formation already when they returned back to town.  Quite true especially when during low period.  In a month there are many days of low period compared to high demand time.  NOT EVERY DAY IS A SUNDAY TO CABBY.</p>
              <p>To be frank - Taxi fare is too low. Ridiculously low.  And Please don't compare to ringgit or rupiah, baht, yuan, rupee, peso.</p>
              <p>Does cabby has the right to reject?  Yes, if i don't feel good and my body is weak after a tiring day.  I need to go pee, to shit , to eat, go home to fxxk.  OKAY ! Idiot customer is always king.</p>
              <p>King Customer - LET ME ASK YOU. You don't want to sit inside a cab when the cabby is having a stomach upset.</p>
              <p>Gahmen always say that cabby is self employed. In fact YES.  We pay rental, We don't owe anyone, We take care of our own Medical and our own CPF or whatever fxxk annuities in the future. We don't write report to Grease anyone AssHole. </p>
              <p>Cabby also have to make a decent living.  So as the same in any business. Squeeze here and Squeeze there.  Supply and Demand.</p>
              <p>If trying to Cap here and Plug there.  Then there is no ending. Go back and recap how the CBD $ is impose.</p>
              <p>How the midnight surcharge is impose.  How the Airport Surcharge is impose. </p>
              <p>Any Medicine prescribe will have a side effect. </p>
              <p>Live with it.</p>
              <p>OH...oh....i forgot.....too longwinded.   Better keep it short. KNNCB and kudos to those Complaint King.</p>

              <p>But then to be fair...pple need taxi to go home................someone got to fetch them back. In my opinion, we who provide transport service sometimes cannot choose. If not they walk home liao.</p>
              <p>Sometimes we have good trip, sometime bad. It is just part of our job as a service provider to see them get back home safely and promptly.</p>

              <p>Thats where u need to be aware of what other countries taxi driver is offering.</p>
              <p>This I am 100% confirm. Singapore taxi is one of the MOST cheapest taxi in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">developed countries</span> even with all the surcharges.</p>
              <p>Seriously no need to argue with Ang Mo or wadever dude that claim otherwise. Remember, if we are expensive, pple wun come here. The closest taxi fare that is near or maybe cheaper is places like Hong Kong. Even Hong kong taxi fare before midnight we are still more economical.</p>
              <p>Some of our things are more expensive as our government policy is different. No need to boil blood over them nor envy them. We only have things like Cars, cigerettes, bear etc more expensive. Other thing wise, we r economic.</p>
              <p>Seriously I am not worried about what other pple said about us. We have our fair share of bad things like certain government policy etc etc. But we have one of the best system in the world that pple envy us.</p>
              <p>Always be polite and mature to know that no matter what, everything has it's good and bad. We are used to our system here and it work for us. However, it is the same for foreigners. So no need to compare no need to fret.</p>
              <p>In the end, the best place is home. and here it is.</p>

              <p>But there are taxi drivers who are choosy and try all tricks to make more money.</p>
              <p>Just the other day, I was inside the CBD area and it was only 4.45 pm and I flagged an empty incoming taxi and it refused to stop for me and later the driver just stopped at a small lane and waited for the time to be 5 pm before it would fetch passenegers so that he can earn the 35% peak hour charge.</p>
              <p>On another occasion, my mother had a fall and we needed a taxi badly, I tried calling the taxi companies desparately for a taxi but no taxi driver was wiling to take up the call just because it was a short distance to the clinic.</p>
              <p>Next, I managed to spot a taxi-driver just after the lunch at the carpark and he walked back to his taxis. So, I rushed to ask him to fetch my mother but when I told the taxi driver that the clinic was a short distance away, he said that he did not want to start driving yet and he stayed in the taxi.</p>
              <p>The most angry part was that the taxi driver started driving after 5 minutes and drove past us while we were still waiting for a taxi desparately. If I had noticed the taxi number, I would have lodged the complaint to the taxi company, ROV and LTA and made sure he got sacked. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>There are many times, taxi drivers tried to trick you by going the longer way, drive behind lorries, buses and many other ways.</p>

              <p>1st of all...</p>
              <p>lets us sit down and highlight the surcharges,</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Peak Hours</span></span></em></p>
              <p>initial of $1 extra to meter, revised to $2 extra to meter.</p>
              <p>Then came in the 35% on the meter... ( a $20 meter journey had became $27, excluding ERPs )....</p>
              <p>It has been revised to the advantages of the Buses &amp; MRTs during peak hours. (ie 7am to 9.30am &amp; 5pm to 8pm.   Buses and MRT ridership has jumped almost 20% since the introduction.</p>
              <p>Hence who benefited from the above changes ? The Temasek Linked companies.</p>
              <p>TDs drivers have difficulties getting pax during this peak hours... (unless raining).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>MDS surcharges</em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">With the CBDs less than 100m away from the Casinos' taxi stand, CBD's carrot of $3 to meter definitely makes the different... ( you know how long a distance a taxi has to travel to make $3 ?? ).</span></p>
              <p>With the long taxi-Qs, Operator of IR (LV sands) proposed to LTA to have a surcharge of $3 to be imposed as well - then came in the taxis..... </p>
              <p>As mentioned by TD RotaryEngine - TDs are self-employed.... they have rental to pay too.. hence, their interest is to recover rental+diesel at the shortest possible time.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Starting flag down fare</span></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The taxi flag down fare having been revised SLOWLY thru the years and accordingly to the public acceptability... many years ago... the taxi fare was $2.20.. a jump of $0.40 to $2.60 almost made the country erupted like Volcano in Iceland...</span></p>
              <p>Within a few weeks (later), the flag down of $2.60 was revised back to $2.40.</p>
              <p>At Current, only the black taxis <strong>CHYSLERs</strong> charges a flag down of $5.00 [ with also a higher rate of $0.30 for every 385m (less than 10km) &amp; 330m(more than 10km) travelled ].  The rest of the taxis start from $2.80 (Toyota Crowns), $3.00 (Sonata, Toyota Wish&lt; Kia Magentis), $3.20 (Mercedes Cab, Skoda, MPVs), with a $0.20 jump on meter for every 385m (less than 10km) &amp; 330m (more than 10km).</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">MRTs &amp; Buses</span></span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">With more NEW MRTs stations (Circle Lines) &amp; up and coming (North-West Lines) on the way...</span></p>
              <p>The taxis fares must be kept at an affordable rate...  Lots of riderships had already jump boats... hence... the livinghoods of TDs will get harder in the near future.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the populations of Taxis have been gradually increasing.... at current of 25,000 TDs on the road.... there are a high chance that the Taxis could hit 30,000 in the years to come. ( every taxis companies have to have X amt of the taxis on the road - as a requirement by LTA )...</p>
