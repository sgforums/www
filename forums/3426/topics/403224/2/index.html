              <p>Hi fellow motorists,<br> <br> We all know stopping along a road with dbl zigzag lines carries a
              fine of 140 (?) and demerit pts of 4. And thats what i kena.<br> <br> Long ago, i was along shenton way. Lost my way, and didnt want to
              kena ERP coz of entering wrong road, then back and kena another
              ERP, i had to stop to check the street directory. I stopped behind
              a taxi stand taht is good for 2 taxis. I remembered that day, the
              taxi stand was full with a few taxi (more than 2 for sure). I am
              effectively a taxi in a queue if my car is painted with COmfort
              logo, and im on the dbl zigzag line. I was happily reading the map,
              and when i looked up, a scooter carrying the traffic marshal rode
              away after writing something on his notepad. I know im dead. bEing
              a good citizen, i paid the fine, took the points, and moved
              on.<br> <br> Recently, when i was back in the area again, i saw that the taxi
              queue along either Shenton way or Robinson road are always very
              long. Far more taxis are waiting in the 'just for 2 taxis' stand,
              and encroaching into the roads where the double zigzag lines are
              painted. And when a traffic marshall road past, nothing was
              done.<br> <br> In case like this, doesnt it carry double standard? How come a
              taxi, being on the ZZ line, is able to escape the penalty just
              because it is queuing? Then what is the 'For 2 Taxis only' sign
              for?<br> <br> If i was in line with the last waiting taxi, doesnt that render me
              immunity as well? Or does TAxi is a special group that is free from
              the ZZ lines rule?<br> <br> <br> Puzzled, i wrote to LTA.<br> <br> to be continued.</p>
              <p>TAXI STOPPING ON DOUBLE ZIGZAG LINES<br> FEEDBACK NUMBER: 20100615-0230<br> <br> We refer to your email of 15 June 2010.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Following your email, we

              Patrol Unit.<br> <br> Our officers from Patrol Unit will take your feedback into
              consideration when planning our operations.<br> <br> Thank you for bringing the matter to our attention.<br> <br> cc LTA - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kindly address
              to this issue seriously too as over-queueing of taxis at taxi
              stands come under your purview.</span><br> <br> So here is the ping pong again: the taxi is actually wrong queing
              on the zz line, so now TP will highlight to their patrol unit to
              enforce. But since the enforcement unit is traffic marshall (from
              TP or LTA?), they did not take action because they actually closed
              their eyes to both zz line rule and the taxi stand overcrowding
              rule. So now TP telling LTA that they should look into the taxi
              stand problem, that spilled over to the zz line prob, which is
              actually TP's problem. <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.mycarforum.com/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.gif" alt="biggrin.gif"></p>
