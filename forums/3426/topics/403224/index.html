              <p>Hi fellow motorists,<br><br>We all know stopping along a road with dbl 
              zigzag lines carries a fine of 140 (?) and demerit pts of 4. And thats 
              what i kena.<br><br>Long ago, i was along shenton way. Lost my way, and 
              didnt want to kena ERP coz of entering wrong road, then back and kena 
              another ERP, i had to stop to check the street directory. I stopped 
              behind a taxi stand taht is good for 2 taxis. I remembered that day, the
               taxi stand was full with a few taxi (more than 2 for sure). I am 
              effectively a taxi in a queue if my car is painted with COmfort logo, 
              and im on the dbl zigzag line. I was happily reading the map, and when i
               looked up,  a scooter carrying the traffic marshal rode away after 
              writing something on his notepad. I know im dead. bEing a good citizen, i
               paid the fine, took the points, and moved on.<br><br>Recently, when i 
              was back in the area again, i saw that the taxi queue along either 
              Shenton way or Robinson road are always very long. Far more taxis are 
              waiting in the 'just for 2 taxis' stand, and encroaching into the roads 
              where the double zigzag lines are painted. And when a traffic marshall 
              road past, nothing was done.<br><br>In case like this, doesnt it carry 
              double standard? How come a taxi, being on the ZZ line, is able to 
              escape the penalty just because it is queuing? Then what is the 'For 2 
              Taxis only' sign for?<br><br>If i was in line with the last waiting 
              taxi, doesnt that render me immunity as well? Or does TAxi is a special 
              group that is free from the ZZ lines rule?<br><br><br>Puzzled, i wrote 
              to LTA.<br><br>to be continued.</p>

              be informed that your email is receiving attention from our Patrol Unit.<br><br>Our
               officers from Patrol Unit will take your feedback into consideration 
              when planning our operations.<br><br>Thank you for bringing the matter 
              to our attention.<br><br>cc LTA - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kindly address to this issue 
              seriously too as over-queueing of taxis at taxi stands come under your 
              purview.</span><br><br>So here is the ping pong again: the taxi is actually
               wrong queing on the zz line, so now TP will highlight to their patrol 
              unit to enforce. But since the enforcement unit is traffic marshall 
              (from TP or LTA?), they did not take action because they actually closed
               their eyes to both zz line rule and the taxi stand overcrowding rule. 
              So now TP telling LTA that they should look into the taxi stand problem,
               that spilled over to the zz line prob, which is actually TP's problem. <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.mycarforum.com/style_emoticons/default/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>So in any case u get booked , its thanks to this bastard. i sincerely curse him with all the bad luck that i can emit out and all TD bros curse this fucker to hell too. may he and his family become taxi drivers for 10 generations</p>

              Good morning TCL
                               well said its truth you are very mad on this issue now the issue is you have paid the fine and u have 4 points and did u made and appeal before you paid the fine? i have and friend who is also a cabby but not like your case its happen in a bus lane along upper serangoon road towards  city in the early morning and he use the bus land during the operation time bingo he was caught by t/p and he knows well he had it, but what he did was took down the front and behind veh plate number who also happen to use the buslane at that time, and the rest was he wait for the letter from lta and summon was issue and then what he did was appeal and its was rejected and what he did next was he reappeal again and this time mention the both veh front and back veh  number plates and asking  if he is the only want who was caught, i was puzzle but i ask him, why he said that he say when he was caught the TP was just sitting on the bike looking front and back with his note book on hand , and he find its not easy to book and write down all at one go the veh number with this reason and for that he got and reply saying we consider your value points and been a good driver and been a long years in driving and also been a taxi driver we consider to waive this summon and its was  waived , hahaha so you see who is really right and wrong sometime, i feel such case we appeal and wait and not happy reappeal cause in your case its a valid reason which they shoulkd consider the point but at the end of the day all they care is $$$ law is made like this and they cant even be fair even they know its a merit of dispute any way TCL looking forward to see you out there to learn more from you and the other brothers with all your experince so that the rest will be better prepared 
              
              you have a good day

              <p>We alll know that it is illegal to over queue but we did it anyway because we need to earn a living. Otherwise go round and round empty car is bad for business.</p>
