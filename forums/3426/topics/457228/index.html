              <p>Kong tio drive casket van, story very long.</p>
              <p>After I came out as seaman, I worked in shipyard for a while, then in the early 90s, shipyard employed lots of cheap labour, so I left and become contractors, in the mid 90s, shipyards was consider a sunset industrial, so I can hardly get much contract, so I paid some money and went into downloading of cars at West coast pier and PSA gates.</p>
              <p>But you know those trade, without some comission, they will not call you, so one of my friend recommeded me casket driving, I went for the course, passed, then start driving casket without even letting my family know, sometime on the road see relative also siam, cos if they humilate me, then I may end up at the lowest point of my life.</p>
              <p>After driving for sometime, pick here and there, I find myself like a zombies, take break alone, go where also alone, of cos you cannot ask the dead to go with you for coffee break right, sometime i buy coffee back for them, just hang it there.</p>
              <p>Got once I went redhill to collect a old man body, he was a TD, his son told me, sent him correctly with the correct road, if not, as a TD,  he might scold you. Then as we talk, he taught me how to go get TD licence.</p>
              <p>From there on, I drove taxis and casket like super relief, but now, getting old, scare that one day, I might hv to drive my own casket, and also due to fark up casket boss, I throw keys back to him, recently he just call me to take up a job, even increased the points to 60s, knn, all the while cheated me.</p>
              <p>Presently, I drive taxis as relief and also work as contractors as and when needed. </p>
