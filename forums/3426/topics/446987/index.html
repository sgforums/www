We TD where got so much time to do forums, once a while post nonsense than disappear....... is the overall public eyes on it, bear in mind on that...... You don't want this forums to become STB(Singapore Tourist Board) links for all taxi query, or somebody spouse or family members to know other hidden activities by TD...... Forum in short, simple topic, simply reply, and full stop, where most forumers in taxi driver been doing fine, except some, maybe you are newbie to taxi industries, you won't know the social impact to other people life....... Why I bring up LV, cause most of you guys know each other in real life, so when posting, you guys forgot that you are not in coffee shop talk.... you guys did meet up and sound interesting....... stay positive and for the rest keep posting on relevant topics and debate accordingly and sensitively.....</p></div>

              <p>Posting that touches your nerve are also touches others too, the only difference is what nerve it touches.</p>
              <p>Your dislike might be someone liking. Of course it will be best if we can share the same liking (not girl hor), but how many time can all the best happen.</p>
              <p>You can come in to share your point of view, why took up task to stir and fried? You are still far from using such method to change, or are you position yourself higher and smarter cos you belong to old limo driver?</p>
              <p>Whatever those kopi kakis unhappy about this forum, invite them to come in and share their view. Why do we need to care for those who doesn't exist here?</p>
              <p>Over here, the mod got the final say, you just need to convince him and we will follow, that simple lor.</p>

              <p>Posting that touches your nerve are also touches others too, the
              only difference is what nerve it touches.</p>
              <p>Your dislike might be someone liking. Of course it will be best
              if we can share the same liking (not girl hor), but how many time
              can all the best happen.</p>
              <p>You can come in to share your point of view, why took up task to
              stir and fried? You are still far from using such method to change,
              or are you position yourself higher and smarter cos you belong to
              old limo driver?</p>
              <p>Whatever those kopi kakis unhappy about this forum, invite them
              to come in and share their view. Why do we need to care for those
              who doesn't exist here?</p>
              <p>Over here, the mod got the final say, you just need to convince
              him and we will follow, that simple lor.</p>

              <p> </p>Since when I unhappy with you guys? One year of reading, than decided to get myself register and talk nonsense to you guys?????? Do not underestimate anyone in life. In forum, anythings is target board, I never quote you guys I'm the old limo driver, I present myself with 6 years of driving a MERC cab....through cyberspace, one can tell a person is smarter????? Whether the kopi kakis decided to post here or other wise is 2 different things, I just do somethings which you guys been doing as far as I had read the thread before for the past year, the reaction is strong cause from nowhere POB appear, you guys been confine to your own world for so long and forgot about the fundamental of forums posting....Anyway, easily I can change POB to other user name...but lazy la, my wife been pestering me, why spent so much time on posting, why can't just read like before, itchy hand is the cause.....
