              <p>And some from City Group ? I think City group ?</p>
              <p>I am not so sure here about Limousine Groups .</p>
              <p>They earn more than us ?</p>
              <p>I also dun think so .</p>
              <p>Per trip basis , yes .</p>
              <p>Overall ? I dun think so .</p>
              <p>Maybe i dun know .</p>
              <p>If u just wanted $3000 per month , no need those headaches of joining what Limo groupings .</p>

              <p>Sometime there'll be customer requesting Mercedes Only !!! Prices can be like $35 , $45 , $8 plus the meter , all LTA approved prices , safe !</p>
              <p>Lake View is LTA approved call centre !</p>
              <p>So u stands a chance higher .</p>
              <p>Merc can also take normal booking , unlike us .</p>

              <p>I won't q at airport during peak hours unless I got info for png. Not sure about Limo counter. But like what Poolman said,</p>
              <p>Per trip basis - Yes, but have to wait (In the end, maybe square one)</p>
              <p>But earn more - I don't think so too.</p>
              <p>My opinion. Don't think too much about Limo counter. It's more important to be consistent &amp; drive your style.</p>
              <p>For me, I've been invited to join Island Link, Central Limo &amp; Royal group.</p>
              <p>In the end, I read about this forum &amp; join Poolman with LV without 2nd thought &amp; even pull in 1 from Island Link. Haha!</p>

              Prices can be like $35 , $45 , $8 plus the meter , all LTA approved
              prices , safe !</p>

              <p>LV also got Limo jobs &amp; I believe more will come but by consistently taking the calls, I don't see I can earn less than Limo jobs.</p>

              <p>Funny thing is after I join LV, I started getting many enquiries about hourly rate &amp; airport transfer.</p>
              <p>For me, I am a proactive person. I like to talk to the ang mos, especially those biz type &amp; goes back to hotels. Many times, I can get limo job to airport. Many times they will take cos can claim &amp; most times charge to their Amex corporate card.</p>
              <p>Btw, our airport transfer is 1 of the cheapest as compare to many European cities.</p>
              <p>There's 1 instant at a hotel in Stamford road on a Mon peak hr. 2 Russian ladies with fur coat going to airport. I was 4 in line, 3 Sonata in front &amp; they pointed to take my cab. Ask me how much to airport. Quoted airport transfer rate, they ok. Reach airport pay me in US$.</p>

              <p>Hi All Bros,</p>
              <p>I want to thank you all for your valuable advice.</p>
              <p>First of all, I am joining LV only. No other group in my my thought now. Hope all Lao Jiao can å¤šå¤šæŒ‡æ•™ã€‚</p>
              <p>When i get my merc, will go to transcab to book new wish too on the first day. Since COE too high now, might need to wait a while i believe. So drive merc for the time being.</p>
              <p>So join SMRT first since they have ready cab for me to collect on Wednesday. I can only get my licence on tues and if go other company, need to sit around for few more days to a week.Will not depend on their assistance to tan jia , so don't bother about their service.Sweep floor is a must since i need to cover high rental.haha.</p>
              <p>After reading, seems like LV is the best choice to join as friendly environment is a very important point to me. I don't like politics.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking,I analyse that people who communicate in forum are a group of better people. Because if they play punk, whole singapore will know thru forum and it will tarnish their name. So i believe no one in the right mind is going to risk that.haha.</p>
              <p>Once again, I will like to expess my greatest appreciation to all bros here who so willing to waste time on new bird like me.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
