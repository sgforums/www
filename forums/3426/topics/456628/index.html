              first news, behind the scene unknown to many of us, i also just found out, there are many who are actually appealing to the authorities to open up the taxi industry to FTs, to increase competition. of these, a number of them are foreigners who are, lets shall say, not that satisfied about service and are becoming more and more vocal about the authorities taking drastic action to revamp the industry. what i heard is the authorities under pressure, so what they might do is up to anyone..
              
              second, this one i also just hear from a few corners, there are more and more people, some is locals some foreigners, dont know is pretend or real, they will take rides and sort of hint or leak they are from various authorities or working in taxi companies. then they will make noise about the ride, and then demand the driver explain why do this or do that, then threaten the driver to do something or they will ask for receipt and report with witness back to company. so some cases, the driver worry will more problem, so will heavy discount or even not collect. even when the passenger get off, they will still look angrily and warn the driver to open eyes and drive carefully in future before closing the door hard. heard a few cases now recently, or is it coincidence? but they are from separate. and according the drivers, they really check and ask back certain questions to these passengers who can seems to answer quite a bit as if like they really know..anyone experience?

              @bing, share your experience since you say you encounter, dont just keep mum
              
              @red, obviously everyone will think they are main culprits, but these kind things can happen to another other co also right
              
              @worries, the driver say the other party did not say exactly what company or position, just hint very heavily up to the driver to think. but when ask question back, the party can answer almost all the things only experience drivers will know. when driver mention about id info, the party will dare the driver, do whatever you want to do, just pretend i not here, see what happens lo. since it was peak timing and there are other passengers, the driver just send back quickly no point arguing, maybe the passenger begin feel drunk then more trouble what for. thats why i asking here anyone else or anyone hear anyone else encounter something like this? this the second case i heard now in these few months. again i say i am not really interested in these 'threats' and how to handle them, that one can talk until cows come or dont come home. i am interested if this been happening around

              if anyone from related authority will not say such things. these ppl just trying their luck taking chance hoping to get  cheap ride. if you drive what a td should drive nothing to worry about,
              if they try me, they very fast up the lorry.

              competition. of these, a number of them are foreigners who are,
              lets shall say, not that satisfied about service and are becoming
              more and more vocal about the authorities taking drastic action to
              revamp the industry. what i heard is the authorities under
              pressure, so what they might do is up to anyone..</p>
              <p>second, this one i also just hear from a few corners, there are
              more and more people, some is locals some foreigners, dont know is
              pretend or real, they will take rides and sort of hint or leak they
              are from various authorities or working in taxi companies. then
              they will make noise about the ride, and then demand the driver
              explain why do this or do that, then threaten the driver to do
              something or they will ask for receipt and report with witness back
              to company. so some cases, the driver worry will more problem, so
              will heavy discount or even not collect. even when the passenger
              get off, they will still look angrily and warn the driver to open
              eyes and drive carefully in future before closing the door hard.
              heard a few cases now recently, or is it coincidence? but they are
              from separate. and according the drivers, they really check and ask
              back certain questions to these passengers who can seems to answer
              quite a bit as if like they really know..anyone experience?</p>

              <p>for FT driving Taxi it wont happen just to do that Goverment has to change the employment rules as FT need to be PAID SALARY in order to quilify for working visa where as taxi is a daily wage job you drive you earn pay compnay first after which pay for diesel then can see got something to eat or not FT may be desprate but not stupid . if you change rule for one industry you need to change for all and that will create a riot trust me</p>
              <p>any body pretending to be from the Taxi company better have some ID with them and you have a right to ask for ID and letter of authroity by the company stating that they are send out to do competency test or whatever else drive stright to nearest police station file report try to blackmail for money and pretending to be from company</p>

              <p><br>Ask yourself what is the definition of FT, Foreign Talents, then ask yurself again, Is Driving Taxi consider a talented or highly talented job/business? The rest, I do not need to elaborate.</p>
              <p>On the 2nd issue, all authorised peoples come with pass/identification tag, not only in taxi driving that you need to authentical his identity, even in homes, public, or industrial working, any person wanted to come into your house, check you IC in the public, or ask you about your work in a work site, they need to clearly identify themselves, and also must allow check back to confirm.</p>
              <p>Bet you alway tell your family, do not open door or allow a person in without any proper identification</p>
