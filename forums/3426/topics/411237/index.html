              <p>Hi Uncle Poolman and all Lau Jiaos...</p>
              <p>1 week plus on the road with Comfort and last night was involved in a minor accident. :(</p>
              <p>Was cruising along Geylang at 40+ km/h and there is this car that turned out from a parallel parking position.  Think he never check his blind spot and in the end, scratched my left passenger seat door. My car only suffer cosmetic damage while his is more jia lat than mine.</p>
              <p>Since nobody was injured, we just exchanged particulars. He did sign a note that he will be responsible for the damages.  On my side, I called up Comfort and was told to go down Loyang on Monday to report and to service the damage.  However, the young chap called me and mentioned that he is willing to pay for the damages + rental but would have to go his workshop.</p>
              <p>Can anyone advise me what to do? Never had a car before so don't have any reliable mechanic's contact.  I'm also worried that if leave the car at his workshop, end up there might have swapping of parts behind my back.  Also, on Comfort side, still must make report on Monday even if I "settle privately", right?</p>
              <p>Thanks,</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi TaxiNoob,</p>
              <p>From insurance point of view, you still have to make a report at your workshop.</p>
              <p>If the guy agrees to pay for the damages, then you can show him the bill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I were you, I would feel safer to have the repair at my workshop too.</p>

              <p><br>This young fellow is clever , cos if u claimed against him , he will lose all his Non Claim Bonuses , and after this claim , his insurance price will rocket up .</p>
              <p>Forget about going Loyang .</p>
              <p>Just sms him , to pay you $500 .</p>
              <p>For workmanship , a new door , and spray of paint .</p>
              <p>Or go any workshop , get him to accompany you .</p>
              <p>Check the price , he pay .</p>
              <p>And he need to pay for your Monday's rental and salary .</p>
              <p>Just a $500 i think reasonable .</p>
