              <p>A burly African slumped into the back seat with a thump. He gave me a much welcomed smile that eased the intimidation of this TD somewhat. "Hello, where to sir?", I inquired. "Yim Kah Hotel, please." He grunted with a baritone that match his size. I paused as the taxi cruised out of the airport T2 to join the ECP. "Err..... what hotel, sir?", I sought confirmation as mispronunciation is common with foreigners. "Yim Kah Hotel" came the swift reply. The words were as clear as the first time. I don't know this hotel. All my 12 years of taxi driving provided no clues. I thought hard. It must be a budget hotel. "Mmm.... have you been there before, sir?". I asked. "No, this is my first visit. My boss booked it and he said its a good place", he replied as he devoured his first glimpses  of the city. "Do you have the address?", I probed sheepishly. "Orchard Road." We passed the budget terminal and instinctly, I swerved to PIE exit. Now, I could swear I know every hotel in Orchard Rd, big or small. I'd roamed there since boyhood and could rattle off names of defunct places like Ban Chuan coffee house, Tivoli, Fitzpatrick supermart, Glutton's square etc. But Yim Kah Hotel?!?!?  I thought of calling Francis ( my TD buddy) for help though deep inside, I knew it'll be futile. "Errr.......do you have its phone no. coz I.....am.. not quite sure... of this...place." He shot a puzzled look and reached for his brown carrier that had seen better days. After rummaging through, he produced a piece of paper, glanced it through, and offered it to me. " Will this help?" It was a fax copy of the hotel reservation. I took a look and this panic stricken face was immediately pacified. The bold letterhead was all it took for the heaven sent relief. There glancing back cheekily were the words: YMCA SINGAPORE.</p>

              This happened about 3 years ago. I guess history repeats itself and will continue to do so. I've got PRC Chinese asking for æ‰“ç‹—é“ƒ. KNN. Gotta go ä¸�å¸®(beggar sect) in Chinese sword fighting novels? After heart wrenching blood and tears later did it make some sense. It was Tagore Lane he wanted. Phew! No need for å†°å±±é›ªèŽ².

              Thanks Poolman. Never really been active in forums. Was surfing and somehow got linked to here. Good site( the only one I know) for fellow TD to share experiences. What took me so long to discover this. Spent the last few days going through the archives and enjoyed it. Keep up the good work.
