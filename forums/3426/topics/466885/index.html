              Yes, I agree with you too. 2 dollar is a good enough as a good will 
              
              But for those ft,  police station is a better choice if they cannot agree to the  2 dollar discount
              
              But again, for anyone to become td, homework is also important about driving a taxi
              
              Being away for long time is never a excuse, or maybe should not even choose to be 
              
              Taxi  driver in the first place.
              
              If being new driver, remember, always let pax know and ask for refer route. Then this
              
              Kind of situation  can be avoid.

              <p>Another route take note. Evening peak hours if take PIE from AP direction want to go CTE(SLE) please dun gong gong queue. Take TPY exit then turn right Lorong 6 then turn into Bradell then CTE. Longer but faster. Save at least 20 mins...</p>

              <p>If you are the TD who are starting work for the 2nd day. How
              would you react? After reaching the destination, the FT told you
              she only have $4 to pay you since you gone the wrong way. </p>
