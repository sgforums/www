              <p>I drove for many hirers, some crown, some epica, some sonata, last time also include silver magnetis and i30.

              <p>And then I also drive sonata, epica and sometime mercs, sonata and epica with no doubt, earn more because of it swift, speed and good pick up, you get tire lesser, and as you know in TD, tireness is a major key to our earning, once you are tired, you want to go home, or you tends to make mistakes here and there, which can be costly if you get banged. So between a $50 and $35, the diff is only $15, you go figure it out, with auto cab, from my experiences as relief for both, they can pick up a few more pax, and as for crown, before you reach AP with pax, those auto one would had took a pax out liao</p>
