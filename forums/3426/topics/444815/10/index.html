              <p>however... would not be fair to ck if we part ways... especially as ck is the one to mentor khoon from day one... with sacrifices and selfless sharing of experience...</p>
              <p>so now juz maintain driving day and working out some alternate solutions...</p>
              <p>tis forum has far greater reach then wat we know of... many TDs lurk and read without posting... khoon has met a few of them... so it would be a consolation to those driving day to know tat we are in the same boat...</p>
              <p>even some pax - especially those regular take taxi type read tis forum... at least the awareness is created...</p>

              I never believe in hearsay. 
              
              I would always give a discount on that. 
              
              The worst part is hearsay from a TD to another TD. 
              
              Almost 3 years in the trade &amp; got to know many interesting bros in the trade. 
              
              Some really talk big but there are few who are really true to heart. 
              
              As a mod in the forum &amp; many years experience in the trade, to post what he hearsay here really doesn't help his cause.

              <p><br> I don't think BCL is taunting. I am very surprise that the so
              called 2nd biggest fleet would follow CDG's fare structure of not
              imposing $3 MBS surcharge on sun. That really say about the
              direction they are going. They think they are getting bigger &amp;
              it gets into their head. Poolman wanted to be different from us. So
              instead of çº¸ä¸Šè°ˆå…µ why not take action instead ? BCL just need someone
              to lead &amp; the best person is Poolman. Why so ? He's the mod

              <p>Maybe just maybe hor. Perhaps transcab is doing this in the hopes of selling their taxi fleet to CDGE? Got blue, got yellow. Having red makes it complete.</p>

              <p>To help fellow td, i suggest u discuss with lakeview's bosses to set up 'LTA' (lakeview taxi association). i strongly believed it will benefit LV and td. As united,we will have better bargain power.</p>
              <p>writing a petition with limited drivers support will not help. it will only be useful during bad economic times when they have alot of unhired taxis.</p>

              Really don't understand why TC forfeited the MBS surcharge while SMRT can still enjoy this surcharge after their fare hike? Hear from Jasmine to other TDs in office, she said MBS boss Mai Hor. Real reason??? MBS Or TC??? Blar Blar Blar...???

              <p>To correct, it is a fare adjustment. If TD is going to keep saying fare increase, I believe the public will take it as fare increased, even LTA, gove and taxi companies's boss are trying to protray it as a fare adjustment to better align the higher cost of operating and living for TDs and also for LTA, to adjust the timming for the benefit of cabby and pax.</p>
