              who say this fare huat ? 
              
              It's big time fare reduction! 
              
              Don,t come in here say this fucking fare huat fucking big time . all load of rubbish! 
              
              If commuters come in here and complaint about how expensive singapore taxis is , in my point or view . it's a good move to chase all real time cheapos out . 
              
              This fare not really huat big time type of fare . 
              
              It's just slightly on par with calling for a cab. 
              
              Huat ? Fuck lar .

              <p>Agree with Poolman. Who is the one that comes out with this fare structure better come out and explain WHY!!!!!</p>
              <p>This change in fares is to make tds drive longer hours....as if we tds do not need a life. Imagine those Cedrics and Crowns will be upgraded to CheeBoLet with extra $1000 rental pm. How much longer hours do they have to put in to cover this.</p>
              <p>When you were working, you kowtow to boss to ask for a measely $50 pay increase, now the taxi companies just humtum a $1K increase to your operating cost....just like that.</p>
              <p>Really, I wonder wtf are our unions for. No wonder that 'somebody' got set fire upon. There's no one to 'hue' our concerns.</p>

              <p>And the price we are getting , i am sticking with my Wish as long as i can ..... stick with my low rental .</p>
              <p>With the pace we are moving , day shift will be hit with working longer hours , higher fuel cost and lower wages overall .</p>
              <p>What huat according from some cabbies here ? Say the truth .....</p>
              <p>How often u get a Pasir Ris to Jurong ? Ap to Jurong ? Taman Jurong to Sengkang ?</p>
              <p>Every trip that way ?</p>
              <p>Mine trip 75% $10 and below .</p>

              <p>And now current fare ..... in between u got a cab on street , is cheaper than what they previously did ( on call ) , saved by at least $1</p>

              <p>My freind just came back from NY, where she had to take taxi twice - bo pian. 1st fare - S$145 for a Lavender to Hougang type journey. 2nd - Lavender to Suntec $85.</p>
              <p>And both drivers were immigrants. NYorkers dont want todrive cabs despite the high fares.  Ya la Press here say very true taxi fare in Singapore super expensive.</p>

              <p>We are only getting back something in between to what we had when diesel was lower. Diesel super expensive. Taxi companies all change new vehicles and increase rent, maybe to please evryone, I propose taxi fares come down to $1.20 and increase ten cents.</p>
              <p>Taxi driving very easy what, taxi drivers all rich what. Today 1st day back after new year, drive 5 hours already cannot tahan. Not many pax, body still not in full shape. 1 day drive body can tahan long hours, 2nd day body performance drop to 75%, 3rd day around 50% performance. We drive like this on a 3 day cycle, can earn super a lot what.now with fare increase, come on ppl take up taxi driving and be super rich and stronglike us.</p>

              <p>Our beloved Comfort used to change evehicles every 5 years, but with their smart ideas on buying new vehicles and driving up COE prices, they are now not going to change Sonatas until year 7, the maximum available.</p>
              <p>2 year Sonata already like an 8 year Datsun, frequent breakdowns. 3-4 year like a 10 year old Ford, noisy and unrealible. 5 year and more - unsafe, unrealiable, poor handling, plus Korea technology not like Japanese. And plus Comfort increase fares and renta, passengers and drivers are shafted. December alone my cab breakdown twice, this weekend almost likely again, the vehicle shakes like Lady Gaga with 3 or more passengers on board.</p>
              <p>Who cares? Not Comfort. Money ringing in all the way. Huat ah.</p>

              <p>Talking about day shifts, sorry slightly off topic here. I full time relief for a Comfort hirer. Most of time i drive 6 days so does he, but let him Sunday off, which is a dying day for full day (maybe now fare hike and cbd, a little better). Whole year 1 drive, he never share the measly 3 rent free day that Comfort throws.</p>
              <p>Never mind, i cincai, each 3 month, will give him earn my share but I will take 3-4 day off, as payback. He go holiday or malaysia I also cover full day, which is so hard becos I so used to night. Christmas i agree share rent half-half, but this year Xmas eve the stupid taxi broke down at the start of shift, so cannot earn, but I still swee cover the rent for xmas/boxing day holiday.</p>
              <p>Naturally Dec 31st, New years day 1 and 2 will be likewise, we both celebrate. Knn, this New Year Eve - rent free, he act blur, give taxi no mention of free rent. Somemore eve i drive only a bit not full blast. Knn drive 2.5 hour out of 5 to cover rent/diesel, very swee. So I declare off NY day 1 and day 2, let him go earn. He pengsan, Day 1 never drivem,day 2 drive 14 hour, no pax what, next day working day, who go out?</p>
              <p>Day shift hirer sometimes kpkb, think night so shiok. Night our hours are limited. Let them try, see whether body can tahan and the stress involved.</p>
              <p>Anyway I already decided need to find another hirer or switch company (definitely will change co, when finances are ok). Day shift isnt so bad but you must never start taking your night shift for granted or start comparing. I got drive day sometimes after a full rest. Not so bad, still can tan chia. Cannot compare with max takings for night shift Fri/sat, but on average around the weekdays, should be able to earn more than the night, a question of win some, lose some. This stupid fare structure deprives them a bit, but not by very much, if they can adopt and maintain a proper routine. True must be more road sweeper, but day road sweeping if done right is workable. Eg; if you know where are the best places/times to station yourself in certain estates, you get quite a few short trips, back to back.</p>
              <p>It's just that the sun has been my enemy for so many years, but I think eventually must revert to day. Body can only take night for so many years.</p>

              <p>Agree with Poolman. Who is the one that comes out with this fare
              structure better come out and explain WHY!!!!!</p>
              <p>This change in fares is to make tds drive longer hours....as if
              we tds do not need a life. Imagine those Cedrics and Crowns will be
              upgraded to CheeBoLet with extra $1000 rental pm. How much longer
              hours do they have to put in to cover this.</p>
              <p>When you were working, you kowtow to boss to ask for a
              measely $50 pay increase, now the taxi companies just humtum a $1K
              increase to your operating cost....just like that.</p>
              <p>Really, I wonder wtf are our unions for. No wonder that
              'somebody' got set fire upon. There's no one to 'hue' our
              concerns.</p>
              <p>Quit? It's about the only rice bowl left for older
