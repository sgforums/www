              <p><br>Bayfront Central line just had their opening ceremony last weekend, we are seeing more transport into MBS, with completion of Marina offices and many more to come, MBS bosses know that their location is no more a unique one to command a surcharge, more so for some special cab companies like transcab.</p>
              <p>Unlike when it newly open, when there is no MRT, walking bridge, ample carpark(now there is a new open car park beside the convention side with normal hour rates), and also a contraint for cabby to move in, as the system begins to get together with more modes of transportation, MBS will be seen as a any normal CBD location.</p>
              <p>Again, this could be another sabotage from CDG that add more salt into the decision than helping it, whatever taxis companies want to do within the perimeter of the company control is all up to them, be it rebates, dirty toilet, lower cost of rental or some other perks, but surcharge is a public perimeter, not that much within company control who need to serve the public at large, and MBS is in the public.</p>
              <p>It is not that by removing the surcharge, MBS would earn something, no, it is the public in concern that may want a more standardise fares within a more accessible location. MBS is no more a unique location like AP or RWS. More over as said, why CDG can do it, other cannot?? afterall most followed their fare adjustment recently, so kenna sabotage by big brother lor.</p>
              <p>In managment, a command of  fire means fire, there is seldom a hold fire, unless something big happen, of course for brothers, i understand that this changes might in a way lower your income, but afterall, MBS had provided another huat platform for most brothers in our day to day driving, so are RWS and many other new location, life is about changes and adaptation.</p>

              <p>For petition, there must be a ground. what is our ground?</p>
              <p>A little perk for Taxi Driver? This is not a valid ground. If MBS is lack of Taxi to meet their demand, it is a strong ground. When your request benefit yourself at the expenses of commuter and nothing gain or loss on the company, it is unreasonable request.</p>
              <p>Be patient, without the location surcharge, MBS will enjoy the peacefulness like those Hotel outside CBD during evening peak. Price will determine TD behavior, our behavior is........ let them ROT.</p>
