              <p><br>hahaha, not at all,</p>
              <p>Cos now very free mah, so just hantam only, fast reader only look for the main point, they do not need to understand the post, for a boss see tons of report per day, from financial to marketing and so on, he point to the fact and figure, then later go play golf and slowly think it over.</p>
              <p>Like for my post is easy, with the figures shown, you can just glance over it, then read the conclusion to tell you, we taxi driver are still very much shortchanged, be it snail or rabbit meter.</p>
              <p>On the fun side, it is also good for nite driver like me who can sleep to read my post. hehe</p>

              <p>Bowah, your analysis is good and thorough but also rounding down the cents makes the fare percentage even lower.</p>

              <p>Why can't they keep the fare adjustment simple, must kay kiang with the 2 cents and extra metres thingy. In the end LPPL and cause more unhappiness.</p>
              <p>Some one posted that 6 to 7 hours of driving is needed to cover costs and overheads and after that then it is our income. I too agree. But after 7 hours the body lembeh liao, how many more hours can it endure for our daily bread.</p>
              <p>Slave to the taxi. I pay $150 overheads to the company a day but cannot cannot even make that amount without putting in 14 hours.</p>

              <p>There is always a hit on Taxi Driver after every adjustment.</p>
              <p>Our leader are very experience to deal with it. Just cross our finger to hope it still works this time.</p>
              <p>But for sure, commuter behavior will change. More will be taking a train then Taxi as feeder service from 6pm. Singaporean aren't rich enough to enjoy a $10 above fare ride. And if going to do more feeder service, ones will going to throw key faster. It is not a formula to earn as a taxi driver.</p>
              <p>Our fares structure had been punishing for long distance traveller, i don't know the reason why. Short distance enjoy "free" first km, then longer distance tariff with that little flag down.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Taxi driving is never a choice in my life, it is because there isn't any better choice left and that why i am a Cabby. So it the the best i can get now. </p>

              <p>Like for my post is easy, with the figures shown, you can just
              glance over it, then read the conclusion to tell you, we taxi
              driver are still very much shortchanged, be it snail or rabbit
              meter.</p>

              <p>ya lor, when cdg change the meter fare structure, i have done the calculation,  and mentioned that day shift will suffer.</p>
              <p>6-7am,  changing to peak hour result more commuter switching to other mode of transportation, 7-9.30am you end up collection 3-5 dollars less because of the 10% reduction in the the peak hour,</p>
              <p>if most of the day shift would have realise, now you get lots of short trip and less long trip because commuter mind has been brain wash that fare are more expensive</p>
              <p>with the 2cents,  you are getting all the e.g 0.56 to 0.58 cents which has to be round now as require by LTA, so we end up collecting 0.50 and loss 0.06 to 0.08 cents. imagine if you are doing 20plus trip per day with all this stupid cents to down if you find giving the 5cents change troublesome, loss of this and less trip and pax, huat or not huat???????????</p>
              <p>i test out with returning 5cents,  so scary, what 1 normally clear the 5cents before that can actually end up using it so fast that no more 5cents left, in the end round down to the nearest 0.</p>
              <p>with commuter turning away in the days, call are reduce due to the fact more vacant taxis plying  on the road, so to summarise,no huat for the poor TDs, TDs will have to be force to work longer and pay more medical fee</p>

              <p>Since CDG adjusted the fares, many paxs have disappeared. But, i do not agree that day shift had many short trips. Just do your normal routine driving. Just pick n go, dun need to do magic like changing shift or interview.</p>
              <p>"<strong>HUAT</strong>" can only apply to good limo drivers or good stamina night shift drivers. I being seeing my hirer(night shift) earnings for the past five yrs. it is impossible to surpass his takings. I had tried very hard but still failed.</p>
              <p>It is very fair for night shift drivers to earn more as they faced more dangers than day shift drivers.</p>
