              <p>Bro, this is in theory.</p>
              <p>Like I said I have proof that for a 12.8km trip from ORQ to AMK Ave 3 for CDG SONATA &amp; TRANSCAB WISH, just the meter trip alone there's an increase, not much, even after I discounted the 20c increment in starting fare. </p>

              <p>Day shift dun really deserved to be tag Fare Hike on their taxis . Really misleading .</p>
              <p>2007 , I said 35% too much , u said huat at 2007 , i said sooner or later they will go down . 4 years , they goes down .</p>
              <p>If 35% huat , they will not go down .</p>
              <p>I like 20% increase , now 25% i just gotta accept it , but never 350-400m ..... should be 330m nett , long or short .</p>
              <p>i really dislike those 350m and 400m rulings .</p>

              peak hour , got think for our day shift counterparts ?</p>

              <p>I do day from 6am-930am. Takings is really 10% less. Why? Because between 6-7am cannot get pax. Knn those cheapo know got 25% all ä¹–ä¹– take MRT/BUS. Then peak drop to 25%. If heng heng got good connection then can match pre fare hike level. Last time close 1 eye can cover rental sometimes CNG. Now cannot even cover rental.                      HUAT KI LAN LAH!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif" width="38" height="38"></p>

              <p>when business slow down, can feel the pressure by the number of empty taxi on the road, on the queue.</p>
              <p>yesterday, sat morning 0430, the whole rivervalley road are full of Taxi, i mean full is all the lane are taken up by Taxi. No chance to pick and choose, kenna TPY also must take, then LL from TPY travel empty to Toh Tuck pump CNG then go back woodlands.</p>
              <p>Taxi population are over saturated, maybe i should throw key to leave an additional space for others.</p>

              <p>I am not sure if ah pool meter is seriously a snail meter and
              how Red5xx bro said that it's only 60c more for a 20km distance for
              this new fare !</p>
              <p>But I have proof that for a 12.8km trip from ORQ to AMK Ave 3
              cost more now just on the meter trip without the extras on a
              weekday night after 8pm.</p>
              <p>I have also discounted the add 20c for both CDG and Transcab
              starting fare which is $3.20 against $3.</p>
              <p>So how much more ?</p>
              <p>It's not a lot for a 12.8km trip.</p>
