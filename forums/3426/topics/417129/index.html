              Pick up an ang mo at Centerpoint, I think he jump q. Tell me go tanjong pagar and say he will pay me double. Then he call his friend one ah ne come in together, then say go spottisswood park. It was 945pm. Ang mo dig inside his wallet wanna give ah ne more money and say he promise to pay me double. Ah ne say don't worry about it, he will settle. Then after spotisswood say go yck. Actually for me a bit too LAN and was quite sure he won't pay me the double fare. But ok no need to argue anyway I also wanna to go back Yishun Liao. Inside the cab, ah ne tell me they drink la, park 3 good cars there. Nevermind tomorro fine la etc etc. After reach meter 21.50 give me 52 say don't worry about the cents just give me 30 back. I give him and print out reciepts to him although he never ask and told him, tomorro u can cliam double fr yr friend la. He slam the door and go. 
              
              This is the second time Kenna something like this. Another time pick up guest fr ap to ritz carton. I talk cock and sing song with the ang mo. Laughing etc. After reach ritz, there was an ang Mo manager outside waiting for my guest. I think maybe he VIP. Anyway I unload his bags he asked me how much I say 19.40 he pass me 50 and say just give me 20, the assho ang mo manager say u don't have to tip him so much. But the my pax say it's ok just give me 20. After he walk away I went up to the manager and tell him next time u want tip tell me la I give u, I took out 5 dollars na take la. He say f off, I told him u f off lar, u get tip i never say anything. U wanna suck up to them that's yr f biz. He likes my service my customer pay me. Don't get jealous.
              
              It's not all about the tip but WTF this people take our backside as their face to look good, but actually f cheapos. No class at all. We earn our keep, we don't go telling the customer that hotel or person is f etc. Really no f class.

Then he call his friend one ah ne come in together, then say go spottisswood park. It was 945pm. Ang mo dig inside his wallet wanna give ah ne more money and say he promise to pay me double. Ah ne say don’t worry about it, he will settle. Then after spotisswood say go yck. Actually for me a bit too <span>LAN</span> and was quite sure he won’t pay me the double fare. But ok no need to argue anyway I also wanna to go back Yishun Liao. Inside the cab, ah ne tell me they drink la, park 3 good cars there. Nevermind tomorro fine la etc etc. After reach meter 21.50 give me 52 say don’t worry about the cents just give me 30 back. I give him and print out reciepts to him although he never ask and told him, tomorro u can cliam double fr yr friend la. He slam the door and go.</p>
              <p>This is the second time Kenna something like this. Another time pick up guest fr ap to ritz carton. I talk cock and sing song with the ang mo. Laughing etc. After reach ritz, there was an ang Mo manager outside waiting for my guest. I think maybe he <span>VIP</span>. Anyway I unload his bags he asked me how much I say 19.40 he pass me 50 and say just give me 20, the assho ang mo manager say u don’t have to tip him so much. But the my pax say it’s ok just give me 20. After he walk away I went up to the manager and tell him next time u want tip tell me la I give u, I took out 5 dollars na take la. He say f off, I told him u f off lar, u get tip i never say anything. U wanna suck up to them that’s yr f biz. He likes my service my customer pay me. Don’t get jealous.</p>
              <p>It’s not all about the tip but <span>WTF</span> this people take our backside as their face to look good, but actually f cheapos. No class at all. We earn our keep, we don’t go telling the customer that hotel or person is f etc. Really no f class.</p>

              To mutiple views, either u really need to view more the text or get back study more English to understand. I don't need yr tips. It's others that want to tip me, but u as the outsider say no. It's like the boss want to reward u yr colleage say no need. That is what I am writing about. I seriously won't need yr tip and ask all tds out there will never expect a tip fr people like u. In actual I think u remind me of another using our tds backside as their face. Guys that act rich and then offer to sent the girls back, then realise so expensive, call every friend near their home if got extra cash or not. Friends tell him no money or some kindda crab. At the end of the journey ask mr to wait for his friend with a worried look. In end I let him pay lesser and told him no money it's ok to asked the girls to chip a little and not use our ass as their face.
              
              So get it. The India told the friend don't worry I will settle it for u when the friend said he promise to pay me the tip. His Ang mo friend keeps his words. The India led his ang mo friend to believe that he is going to keep his promise. Thinks he is a great chap pay for me first, but in actual just say to make him happy, suck up to him and take credit for it. Same goes for that ang mo manager but his sucking up back fired. 
              
              That is call use our ass as their face. 
              
              And gee to parn that keeps saying give me yr taxi number to wrote a report, could u give me yr company's name and yr actual name as ur posting during yr working hours. 
              
              Yes it is true that at times u need to have a bowl of yr own pee to reflect at yrself
