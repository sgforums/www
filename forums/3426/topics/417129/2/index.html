              <p>You think it's easy to write a good complaint letter? Why don't you go write one for yourself lor...</p>
              <p>I don't think your company will even take your complaint letter seriously. Maybe they will use their company funds to organise english course for you.</p>

              <p>I dun really understand the need to post such thread... It's very simple. If you get your tips, good for you. Dun whine if you didn't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Simple as that, if you were in the other party shoe, you'd do the same. Would you stop your friend from paying more than what he owes? Would you advise your guest that tipping is not really necessary or practised in our country?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would say yes, I would do that as well. This is not called using td's asses as their face but doing their part of responsibilities in terms of work or relationship.</p>
