I am currently developing an app which will make booking/sharing of cabs easier. Since hotlines are constantly jammed, SMS booking needs postal code.

              In my opinion , the system is alright .
              
              Only the pricing need some fine tune .
              
              No point creating applications with little man power to enhance the efficiencies

              so what u have an app to call for a cab , when u dun have taxis around ?
              
              so what u have so many apps for commuters , when taxi drivers dun even bother to take such jobs ?
              
              When taxi booking fee is $2.50 , most cabbies would rather : " Tampines ! Tampines ! "
              
              And shoot to Airport for that $5 carrot , like Sunday night .
              
              When taxi booking is $2.50 , most cabbies like me would go for MBS $3 carrot , and RWS $3 carrot . Booking fee $2.50 , and taxi companies levy $0.40 , nett profit $2.10 , nay , it's MBS and RWS or AP for me on Sunday .

              The best is for taxi companies to stop collecting any levy ..... let drivers collect full booking fee .
              
              And booking fee standard 24/7 all round $3.50 .

              <p>Really there is nothing wrong with the current booking infrastructure. Its the booking fees and booking levies which are still stuck in the stone ages. Secondly, all calls must come with a destination. Even a crappy iphone or android app with this feature will be golden to cabbies. Yes there will be calls which cabbies will not take. We are trying to earn a living, so why must comfort make things difficult for us? Such a feature is free, but they also wont relent.</p>
              <p>Lastly, Comfort was really silly to invest millions into a contactless payment system. It makes no difference to the cabby's bottom line. They could have given the booking levy back to the cabby but they refused. There are many things they could have done to ease cabbies life, but right now they really do not care.</p>

              <p>To clear things up I'm developing for this upcoming code xTreme apps. A competition mainly focused on transportation by LTA. So i'm hoping to change things a little if possible. If comfort were to take this app it might just change the experience allowing personalized booking at no additional cost.</p>
              <p>Since i'm not so sure how you all earn or what, i'm not gonna comment much on that. Main focus is to help both the cab and the passengers achieve win win situation. People can get cab, Cab can get passsengers faster, probably able to cover rental cost and stuff but not everything is perfect and ideal always so ya......If the idea can't take off then i won't really be focusing much on it already.</p>

              <p>Royal, some serious suggestions here.</p>
              <p>can you develop an app that iphone or andriod users can use this app to 'directly' call for cab and not going thru taxi company. Those TDs with iphone or andriod phones downloaded with such apps can 'receive' this calls. This 'link' between both parties has got nothing to taxi company. They can shut down their call centers and save millions... and of cse, stop earning our 40 cents &amp; 50 cents!</p>
              <p>Let LTA decide the levy charges. eg: $3.00 flat 24/7.</p>
              <p>just my 2 cents contribution.</p>

              <p>If my iphone have an app that can see the surrounding pax calling for cabs (like we see those ERP logo on our MDT, or bus-stops on map), and pax can 'see' us in their google map too, that will be great. so that we can link and get the best outcome by fetching them at the shortest poss time.</p>

              <p>lets fully utilise the iphone apps technology and help commuters to get taxis asap at peak hours. Most executives have iphone.</p>
              <p>now, TD have 2 choices, take calls from MDT + iphone.</p>
              <p>Pax also have more choices to get a cab fast.</p>

              <p>Well yep didn't really intend to leak out what exactly i'm doing but ya. What i'm trying to implement right now is somewhat you said. Directly contact the driver instead thru the company. This would meet the requirement of personalized transportation. Save the booking fees, benefit the driver too since most of the fee goes to company might as well get contact with customers directly. Since i have limited information, I'm implementing a prototype, which will show nearby cabs around so users can directly 'flag' them up. Well as for the sharing of cab, currently it is only implemented for friends around. Would be made open once i can get that up smoothly. Sadly i'm not that familiar with the iPhone XCode yet. Would be touching on it soon. Currently only can develop for windows phone cause the programming language is what i'm proficient at right now. ps i'm still a student =/</p>

              <p>Really there is nothing wrong with the current booking infrastructure. Its the booking fees and booking levies which are still stuck in the stone ages. Secondly, all calls must come with a destination. Even a crappy iphone or android app with this feature will be golden to cabbies. Yes there will be calls which cabbies will not take. We are trying to earn a living, so why must comfort make things difficult for us? Such a feature is free, but they also wont relent.</p>
              <p>Lastly, Comfort was really silly to invest millions into a contactless payment system. It makes no difference to the cabby's bottom line. They could have given the booking levy back to the cabby but they refused. There are many things they could have done to ease cabbies life, but right now they really do not care.</p>

              <p>Well, gentlemen,</p>
              <p>First and foremost, please remember that we do not own the taxi companies, we only hired the taxis from them, the whole business and the way to run it, still belong to to management of these taxis companies, we can only make some comments or feedbacks, whether they digest or make decision out of our feedbacks, to them, is none of our business.</p>
              <p>If you think you want to potong jalan and run a taxis call system or whatever non legal business with the cab you hired without the knowledge and the gain of the companies you hired, we are asking for troubles. Even those legal entity call system like lakeview or beach road are licensed and pay taxation to run a business.</p>
              <p>No doubt Smart phones can or may provide an app for calling taxis, taxi company can alway tell those telco providers to fliter all these and under legal rights, whoever process a business transaction without registration n licensee, it an infringment to the copuright and  IP of Singapore.</p>
