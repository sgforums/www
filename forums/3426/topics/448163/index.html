              <p>STOMPer Chelsie encountered a stubborn taxi driver who 
              refused to take her preferred route to her destination but chose to go 
              via his own way, causing a 40 minute journey to stretch to an hour.<br><br>The STOMPer wrote:<br><br>"I
               boarded a cab with the license plate SHA7991T at Tanjong Katong on 28 
              February 2012 at around 2am with two colleagues going to 3 locations, 
              first to Toa Payoh, then to Yishun and lastly to Woodlands. <br><br>"So 
              the driver started the journey and I told him our preferred route, but 
              to my surprise he did not follow my instructions and decided to go by 
              his own way. <br><br>"Upon realising that he took his OWN preferred 
              route, I questioned him why. His reply to me was very rude as he raised 
              his voice and told me that he was a new driver. <br><br>"I was very unhappy with his reply, but what happened next was really terrible.<br><br>"After
               dropping my colleague off at Toa Payoh and a slight argument with the 
              cab driver over the fact that he took a longer route, we proceeded to 
              the next destination, Yishun.<br><br>"AGAIN, I told him my preferred route, which was to go by CTE than SLE. <br><br>"But
               once again, he acknowledged what I said but went by his own preferred 
              route, as if he was the passenger and I was the cab driver. <br><br>"He went by PIE Tuas, then BKE. <br><br>"On the way, I saw places like Bukit Timah and so on, places I would rarely pass on normal days. <br><br>"I
               got very upset as I was returning home from work and it was already 
              very late. The cab driver obviously wasted my time, causing me to have 
              lesser time to rest. <br><br>"I started to question the driver about whether he knew where he was going and why he went by his preferred route. <br><br>"And AGAIN, his answer was that he was a new driver. <br><br>"I
               did not accept that reason and decided to call the Comfort Hotline to 
              give my feedback. As I was feeling very frustrated, I was raising my 
              voice while speaking to the person on the other line. <br><br>"Then the cab driver asked me to mind my tone in a very rude way.<br><br>"I
               was the one being driven around the whole of Singapore at around 2am, 
              not knowing where this cab driver would drive me to and unaware of what 
              his motive was.<br><br>"After that, I told him to go to Woodlands first 
              instead of Yishun as BKE was closer to Woodlands. Only then did he 
              decide to follow the preferred route and drive properly. There was no 
              more driving around all the nonsense places.<br><br>"I was afraid and worried as it was nearing 3am and I really did not know what this driver was up to. <br><br>"Thus I decided to call my friend to pick me up under the HDB block. <br><br>"Upon
               reaching, the cab driver asked me to pay him the full amount, which was
               $52.30 for the 'tour' that he took me on around Singapore. I was 
              reluctant to pay the full amount as it was just not fair. <br><br>"Therefore,
               my friend boarded the taxi and headed to the nearest police station to 
              lodge a police report. Details were taken down for reference.<br><br>"After we reached at the station, the cab driver suddenly decided to reduce the fare to $37.00. <br><br>"When
               I reached home, I checked the website for the estimated distance and 
              time needed to travel from Tanjong Katong to my 3 destinations.<br><br>"The website reflected:<br><br>"<strong>Tanjong Katong Road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Lorong 5 Toa Payoh: 6.9 km, 10 minutes.</strong><br><br>"<strong>Lorong 5 Toa Payoh to Yishun Street 22: 17.7 km,  22 minutes.</strong><br><br>"<strong>Yishun to Woodlands Drive: 4.9 km, 10 minutes.</strong><br><br>"<strong>Total: 29.5km, 42 minutes.</strong><br><br>"However,
               the receipt shows that the total distance covered for my journey was 
              44.4 km, and the time taken to travel was 1 hour and 2 minutes. <br><br>"Look
               at how much time I wasted on this joker, and adding the fact that I did
               not feel safe throughout the whole ride not knowing where he was 
              bringing me to. <br><br>"I am pursuing this incident at all costs as the reasons and excuses that the driver gave were ridiculous. <br><br>"Don't taxi drivers have GPS installed in the taxis? How could he have 'lost his way' and gone by his own preferred route?"</p>

              <p>Your this example cannot be applied to this case.</p>
              <p>While the LTK-LSL's case that that of "too many cooks, spoil the broth", the same cannot be said about TD-Pax relation.</p>
              <p>Being a new driver, one of the answers I dread getting from pax when I ask them "do you have a prefer route" is "whichever is fastest"</p>
              <p>For a newbie, reason why I ask that is hoping that they will show me the way cos "i dunno"</p>
              <p>I think in this case, being new is just an excuse. I would followed exactly the route that the pax wants me to take simply because the pax "should" know best right? If wrong, that's his problem. But if needed, I always reaffirm with them before taking action to double confirm and "save my ass" first.</p>
              <p>If  wanna claim as new then take PIE-BKE route, I think it's just a case of "acting as a pig to eat the tiger"</p>

              <p><br>The rights here works both way.</p>
              <p>So, if you dissatisfy with the driver, be it new or old driver, you can</p>
              <p>1. Ask to stop and walk away, under the laws of consumer, you do not hv to pay anything as the service is not rendered</p>
              <p>2. You can tell the driver off, if he apologise or if he got a good reason behind why he is not following yr instruction, you may choose to pardon him or complain about him throught many channel, from LTA to CASE to taxis companies.</p>
              <p>3. You can also ask for discount due to longer route taken even with instruction given</p>
