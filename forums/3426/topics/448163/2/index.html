              <p>Your this example cannot be applied to this case.</p>
              <p>While the LTK-LSL's case that that of "too many cooks, spoil the broth", the same cannot be said about TD-Pax relation.</p>
              <p>Being a new driver, one of the answers I dread getting from pax when I ask them "do you have a prefer route" is "whichever is fastest"</p>
              <p>For a newbie, reason why I ask that is hoping that they will show me the way cos "i dunno"</p>
              <p>I think in this case, being new is just an excuse. I would followed exactly the route that the pax wants me to take simply because the pax "should" know best right? If wrong, that's his problem. But if needed, I always reaffirm with them before taking action to double confirm and "save my ass" first.</p>
              <p>If  wanna claim as new then take PIE-BKE route, I think it's just a case of "acting as a pig to eat the tiger"</p>

              attitude must be really F-ed up. Most taxi drivers are nice. In so many years,
              I only had one bad experience with a cab driver who insisted that he drive for
              many years and that I’m wrong and I don’t know the way and he went the wrong
              way instead! And he was also very rude and nasty but that is like 1 out of so

              <h1 class="headline">Briton charged $150 for 10km trip, sparking furore over cheating cabbies</h1>
              <div id="yui_3_3_0_1_1330593795245242" class="bd">
              <p class="first">Petaling Jaya (The Star/ANN) - An English tourist was charged 450 ringgit (about US$150) for a taxi ride from KL Sentral to the Suria KLCC shopping centre, a distance of less than 10km.</p>
              <p>The <span id="lw_1330481616_4" class="yshortcuts">Land Public Transport Commission</span> (<span id="lw_1330481616_0" class="yshortcuts">SPAD</span>) said the tourist paid the fare before lodging a report against the driver.</p>
              <p>SPAD chairman <span id="lw_1330481616_1" class="yshortcuts">Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar</span> said they were investigating and would take action against <span id="lw_1330481616_3" class="yshortcuts">the taxi driver</span> and the operator.</p>
              <p>He said the taxi driver was believed to have threatened the tourist into paying the fee.</p>
              <p>"<span id="lw_1330481616_5" class="yshortcuts">Taxi drivers</span> are our frontliners and ambassadors of the country as they interact with tourists daily.</p>
              <p>"We are taking this seriously as it affects the country's image," he said after opening SPAD's new enforcement centre at the Persada Plus here yesterday.</p>
              <p>He said SPAD was conducting a study to regulate the pricing mechanism for the taxi coupon system.</p>
              <p>"We want feedback from <span id="lw_1330481616_2" class="yshortcuts">taxi drivers</span> and passengers before proceeding with the study," he said, adding that there were mixed views about the coupon system.</p>
              <p>While some supported it, he said, others saw it as restrictive.</p>
              <p>"Some drivers said they would be unable to take passengers if they were not part of the taxi coupon system, while others felt it restrict-ed their movement," he said, adding that the system was implemented privately by mall and airport operators.</p>
              <p>SPAD also announced the purchase of 17 new vehicles, which will be used by its enforcement officers nationwide.</p>
              <p>Syed Hamid said the highest number of reports SPAD received were against illegal taxi touts, followed by complaints about overloaded lorries on the road.</p>
              <p>In the 3,845 operations conducted since Jan 2010, 74 individuals and operators have been taken to court.</p>
