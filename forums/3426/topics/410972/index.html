              <p>Though I just started driving for less than a month... (Wait!! Tomorrow marks the 1 month anniversary of my TVL collection...), I already forgot my first pax liao. LOL...</p>
              <p>However, until today, I still kenna destination that I only know the general direction to the area but not the specific place that pax wanna go to.  Hence, most importantly is to be frank to them and explain that you are new lah, still trying to familiarize with routes lah... Most paxes are understanding and some will even encourage you verbally.  The most important thing to avoid is not to tell pax that you don't know the way and then in the end bing them on a merry-go-round.  If pax can't give direction, then probably it's best to tell them to get another taxi. (Though I have never had to resort to that since I had a GPS and on the rare occassions that pax don't know the way, they are ok with me referring to the GPS.)</p>
              <p>Hope this helps...</p>

              Thanks for all the advice and encouragement. I shall drop him a message and leave it on his screen and see how. I wonder if he would just let me drive on Saturday nite only. Cos I now have a full time job, but I am thinking of retiring then be a TD to earn some pocket money, I just want to have more time with my family. I more family man lah, like to see my daughter growing up, donâ€™t want to miss her growing years. That one not like a movie, if you miss still can rent dvd and watch again. Once I miss her growing up, thatâ€™s it.
              
              But anyway, I digress. So, I wan to try once a week first and then if okay, then ask my boss for part time and drive part time, then 55, drive full time. What do you bros think ha? Can work or not?
              
              Bro poolman will say aiyo, its inevitable leh.
              
              Thanks again, you are a nice bunch!
              
              Btw, I was in a taxi last night and I met this TD. He driving since 1979, he say that time starting fare only lak kak. I say wah, you veteran lah, some more tell me how much he earn, he said, I start 5pm until now 10pm I already got $130, all long distance one today. Some more tell me go get license lah standby. I smiled inside.

              <p>This is very true. I got a friend who regretted not spending time with his daughters during their early days. His job required him to travel often. And 1 of them got into bad company and almost ended up in girl's home. He felt bad about that.</p>

              thanks for all the helpful suggestions.
              
              well, i did it and left a message on a comfort hyundai asking the fella to contact me if he needs a relief driver. i tot of leaving the message with the toyota wish, but then i tot maybe hyundai cheaper to rent. anyway, i see how and let you guys know. interesting to find out that there were 3 taxis parked in the red lots at 7.30pm on a sunday evening. and thats only on the first 2 levels of the carpark. 
              
              thanks again,.

              Well, I have just being offered a fire engine. he said me being a newbie, he proposed that better not do nights but try Saturdays, Sunday and public holidays, which actually made sense to me. Sounds like heâ€™s quite easy,  and I can give him advance notice should I want to call it quits, and if I go on leave, I can just compensate him him part of the rental.
              
              i have been reading around and it sounds like the advice is to take a fire engine to start with, did I get that right?
