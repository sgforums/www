              <p>You see, the rental should be base on the OMV of the taxis, not
              the COE nor the this tax and that CEVs. Then we can said that
              rental prices is more base on OPEN MARKET VALUE.</p>
              <p>The open value (real car value + importing and exporting
              expenses) of a diesel driven epica is only 28k to
              30k at most, and if spread over a 7 years lifespan, per
              year is only 3 to 4k depreciation, and they are charging more than
              3k of rental per month.</p>
              <p>COE had fallen, from 90k to 60k, still high, but it had fallen
              by 30k, if taxis companies said because we bought that time COE was
              high, that is not our problem, so if COE GOES DOWN&lt; are you
              going to lower your rental??? And for once in your taxi driving
              life, have you see any Taxis companies lowered their rental??</p>

              <p>Do not underestimate your fellow countrymen, 50% upfront in buying car is no problem for many, if not why COE still so high, remember that COE was reduced so as to curb inflation, not reduced because people cannot buy, even at $90,000 for a piece of paper, still fully taken up.</p>
              <p>Yes, laymen like you and me may not be able to afford that luxury of putting 50%, even can, also heart Pain, unless it is was gain thru 4D, toto or other lucky means or Ah Kong's left over money slowly spent away by lousy decendants.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, COE control car population, it control also the able and the unable, but the nos of car one got to have is limitless, you as TD goes by so many private houses to sent of pick up paxs, you see the how many cars does each have?? 3? 4? or some even have a garage with 10 luxury to sporty cars to play around.</p>
              <p>Therefore, as a basic family man who really need a car in a social sense will find it very difficult to own one, but on the other hand, those eat full buy pao type of people, who have more cars than needed are buying cars like eating fish soup at cambridge road, so you see that inequlibrium here.</p>
              <p>And when our govt attracted more and more richs, you will see higher and higher cost of living, because to the rich, what is high cost? as long as there is peace, a haven and place to put and wash my money in a safe place, who cares?</p>
              <p>But it is the laymen like us that cares, laymen like us that cannot afford that 50% will turn to drive taxis, be it fulltime or partime just to live on,</p>
              <p>You cannot blame them, the society acted upon them to go into this line, same like your and me, why driving taxis??.. not that they or we wanted, but if a hotel/hospital  driver paid is $4,000  with bonuses, OT, increment and all others benefits and looking for a driver who can drive it home after work, you think you still driving Taxis?</p>

In return, the govt use Gst, ERP, property, stamp duties, rental, business, fuel and all other kind of taxes to get their money, dun tell me you pay your power supply bills and taxis rental with no GST??</p>
              <p>You are taxed, this is call silence taxation, a taxation that goes on without even you knowing, let say for example $7 Gst for a cab per day, 360days x$7=??, so dun tell me taxi driver dun pay tax hor</p>
