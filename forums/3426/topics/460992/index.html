              <p>No, you can hardly do it within a few hours, at least take 1 ot 2 working days, and today is not a working day, so how are you going to register your super relief, and also, there is no cases that you can take a relief on the spot, some hirers take weeks to find a super relief.</p>
              <p>And FYI, super relief will alway ask for a lower rental, because you need them and when the demand over subscribe supply, sure there will be a lowering down on rental, if not super relief can find others.</p>
              <p>There are some post and even in this forum registered themselves as super relief, you can check it out, but for today or tomorrow, it is definitely a no no way.</p>
              <p>Learn to accept the underline of being a TD, something you hv to throw rental or take those free rental days if you got benefit, for TD&lt; sick is your problem</p>

              <p>Sorry to be harsh, bros, but we got to live it up to reality as a TD.</p>
              <p>Comfort do not care if u r super relief or relief, every cab is hired out by hirer, each hirer can get up to 12 reliefs in his card, and each relief can also relieves up to 12 hirers if he wants to,</p>
              <p> there are many cdg kiosks island wide, you do not neccessary need to go to Sin Ming to register, as along as your relief hold a valid taxi licence, registered under cdg, you can register him.</p>

              <p><br>Si meh, I got 8 hirers on my list, last time got 10, then 1 retired, the other passed away.</p>
              <p>Cdg makes it more flexible for reliefs and hirers,</p>
              <p>For those on the spot, the hirer must do it, not the relief, the responsible it still the hirer, most of those taxi stand can do it on the spot, because the Taxi stand boss is the hirer.</p>
              <p>As for hotlines, even you manage to get thru, for individual hirer and relief matters, they prefer both to go offices around singapore to register, this is the ensure signature are signed and both agreed, the lau aunties at kiosk need to see relief licence, this is LTA rules, it is impossible to do it on the spot unless both are willing to go down on a working days within the working hours.</p>
              <p>If by hotline can, lau aunties and cdg kiosks can close shop liao.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, hirer never meet relief before, it is thru recommendation or advert that they contacted each other, so, if you are a hirer, are you willing to let go of yr hired cab under your responsible to a person you never see before?</p>
              <p>As far as it is concern, TS is sick and just want to get a replacement to cover the rental for the day, we should tell TS to forgo rental and rest for a day, some other day he will be able to make it back when he is ok, driving TD as hirer is like this one, sick, who cares?</p>
              <p>I got hirer whom i relieved for a week, and the day to return, he said, you drive another day free, cos, I am sick, so if gum,  just whack lor, if not park there for what, but at least give hirer some rental fees, already sick, somemore ask him to lose money, really no heart, remember I am the best relief around, full tank until diesel flow out, wash at kiosks, interior personally clean one, even booth also clean and wipe, but some taxis I see, knn, never keep clean one, wa lan, dunno how they can tarhan all day inside, not only dirty, damn messy, got this wire, that charges, open the hand glove only, whole compartment can drop off.</p>
              <p>Although cab is a money making machines for both you and cab companies, but at least for yourself sake, make it clean and nice, drive also song song from ap go jurong, pax happy, you happy, taxi company also happy </p>
