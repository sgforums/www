              <p>Fuck Dairy Farm is very close to the place where a taxi driver was stabbed and killed some years back, also SMRT driver.</p>

              <p>Malay pax are 90% or more very okay pax, only like to pay Nets, but that never mind. It's only the 10% or lesser who are drug addicts who are a threat. Of course the same goes for Chinese or Indian drug addicts who also rob and steal for their fix, but generally they tend to rob other places where got more but a bit harder to rob, whereas the Malay addicts tend to prefer taxi drivers, as an easier target but with lesser cash.</p>
              <p>Nothing sinister here, or bias against Malays, it's just a trend I observed from my time as a cop and through taxi driving. It's an assumption on my part and I may well be wrong in this assumption.</p>

              <p>Defensively, if people want to rob you, let them have it, not worth losing a life, money can earn, life only one, but these bastard can also kill to silent everything. Touch wood, if they get me, I idle one, earn very less, about only a hundred plus, all can give them, but some robbers taking less get fedup can also stab you.</p>

              <p>Defensively, if people want to rob you, let them have it, not
              worth losing a life, money can earn, life only one, but these
              bastard can also kill to silent everything. Touch wood, if they get
              me, I idle one, earn very less, about only a hundred plus, all can
              give them, but some robbers taking less get fedup can also stab
              you.</p>

              <p>No lah, this taxi driver was totally innocent and offerred them the cab even, he even cried 'tolong tolong'. I went for the trial.</p>
              <p>These guys wanted to rob the taxi driver to get his vehicle because they had a gun and wanted to rob a goldsmith shop. They killed him because they didnt want him to be a witness. There was nothing the poor driver could do to escape his fate.</p>
