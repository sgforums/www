              </p><p>If had to add on to other factors, OMO definitely benefit individual more, but I do agree with you, if fall sick or got other urgent matter to handle, throwing rental can be hard pain, but as an OMO, recover loses is anytime..........</p><p>
              
              </p><p>As a relief, mai di di use $20 to whack hirer, I know a lot of hirers because of this, give their relief the marching order, $20 should be very genuine cases, in a good working partnership, both TD should have equal responsibility towards the taxi, than relationship can prolong...............</p><p></p>

              <p>If you are doing an office job, you cannot said that TD is a never relax job, there are many jobs out there that is also not relaxing, we as ship engine servicemen can tell you that TD is much better than those 24 hrs non stop jobs like jobs in PSA, on board servicing jobs like my partime, good money but can go mad anytime, and many others, it all depend on your exposure.</p>
              <p>To me TD is a physical drain job, but not a mentally stress job. So all you can do is rest more often and do some exercise to built up that physical fittness in it.</p>
              <p>From a perspectives of a TD, as I drive, I take it as a relaxing job, pick and go, call and take, sweep and stop, 10 hrs max, go for a short run and exercise, go home, think of good food, can buy while driving, open one stout or cheap wine, enjoy while watching TV or surfing porn...hehehe, relax mah?</p>
              <p>The problem with TD not able to relax and use to say TD is tough is because the heart is not with TD, and that instead of behaving as a simple TD, they complicated their life for nothing? Remember, most of our problem are self created, the motive of becoming a TD is to be simple, so be simple and enjoy lah.</p>

              <p>For this, let me teach you a the true meaning of <span>çœŸå®ž or <span>çœŸ, the Jap call it Zen.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Ask yourself</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Are you a TD?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Are you a father?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Are you a LV member?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Is EPica at $123 rental?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Are you in your forties?</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>and so on</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>All these is self questioning, and the answer is alway yes, yes and yes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>The reality to understand Zen is to understand the truth.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>So you may said oh..last time cedric only $70, now epica $123, but is it true?? Yes, it is true, and case close. </span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Oh, that guy he become so rich, last time, we together go play play, now he so rich, but I still a TD, is it true, Yes, in reality, he become rich, and you are still what you are? So be it, case close.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>Oh, he wears an expensive rolex watch, I only casio, it is true, Zen zen he wears a rolex and I wear a casio, so how??? so be it, life goes on, you loose nothing physically, case close.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>The problem with people failing to understand Zen is that mentally, they gets agitated when they start to compare and like to live in a realm of illusion. </span></span></p>
