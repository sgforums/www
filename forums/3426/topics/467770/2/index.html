              <p>The most important thing is to be able to 2nd guess your pax - know beforehand what type of pax he's gonna be before picking him.</p>
              <p>But that's not possible always, the next thing is figure out where the nearest police stn/post enroute should something go wrong along the way. The moment a pax abuses you, you're justified in terminating the trip for your own saftey, worry abt complaint later. Of course this easy to say, sometimes after some abuse pax will cool down, but not in this case.</p>
              <p>If that also not possible, find the nearest crowded place with cameras.</p>
              <p>Also activate distress alarm constantly, if cannot pick up phone that is, to call for police. If BJ did this earlier maybe the police might hv arrived faster at Normanton and the assailant detained.</p>
              <p>Alert your call centre early, all this will help in your court case. The assailant might deny but this calls all are circumstantial evidence which might be useful for a judge in determining who's telling the truth.</p>
              <p>Never, I repeat never carry a weapon and use it to fight back. The most it can be used to threatened a person to stop attacking you, but that's still dangerous, what if the weapon is gained by him and used on you?</p>
              <p>Finally also accept sometimes life is unfair, the law cannot help every single case, sometimes you must find your own justice. if I was the victim, I will pity the farker if I ever lay eyes on him again, because my backing very strong one. I can call many people one. Of course I will do it smartly and not show my face for the revenge. Then it will be up to him to prove I was behind it. But kena hit, that I hv to bear, bo pian, but so far so good.</p>
