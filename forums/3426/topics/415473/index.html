              <p>Dear all seniors,</p>
              <p>Hi, Im new in this forum and need not to say im new soon to be a TD once the LTA ask me to collect my TDVL. I have a problem here, and  would like to seek advise and guidance from you the most experienced TDs. :)</p>
              <p>I'm residing at Jalan Batu soon. I did browse through the cabby.com.sg to look for hirer who is looking for relief over at jalan Batu there and i cannot find someone staying near my area. The only nearest is Geylang area but he is looking for Merc relief. Another Hirer is driving Transcab wish red which i very padang on the color i dont prefer to drive a red color car or cab.</p>
              <p>I did browse through this forum and many advise not to drive as hirer if really need of money or want to fetch wife mistres..blah blah blah..:) But if i cannot get any hirer near my place would you guys suggest especially im new to hirer a cab myself first then drive for a few month then look for relief driver? But i also know that looking for relief also sometime will get pain in the As* ya.</p>
              <p>Can any of you seniors advise me or do you think got any other forum can get hirer who stay near Jalan Batu area which is near Tanjong Rhu.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>hi bro morning, as an advise , now we hv two big taxis coy , the blue n the red(comfort n transcabs) n other coy, well, maybe u 2day drive a blue taxi now, but got terminate for no and unjustified reason, join all other coy, but also cannot, in the end LL hv to drive red colour taxi, and need to drive to support family, will u say u pantang cannot drive? family or pantang importan? u can say u pantang taking the first pax to woodland or pantang to fetch first pax angmo but never say u pantang in any colour of taxis here, cause the colours of taxi we can choose is limited. like wat we chinese hv a said( å‡¡äº‹ç•™ä¸ªå�Žè·¯ç»™è‡ªå·±ï¼‰ï¼Œif u really no choice nd to drive a red cab, friend saw u and say"i thought u pantang red colour leh", then u will be very malu, right? my own opinion is, driving a taxi to support a family is no problem, if u r well discipline .save some money and want to bring family out for holiday(short one, europe must strike 4d then can) no problem, only bad thing is no cpf, aws, leaves , mc ,etc but freedom u can off anytime u like just pay half rental to the hirer, no nd to apply leave c boss face.</p>
              <p>secondly, u can try to look for hirer within 5km around yr house, talk to him how u n him want to hand over the vehicle, u sent him back and he sent u back, for me i find this is a waste of time, as for me , i park the taxi at my relief house at teck whye every morning, and walk back to my house at bukit batok which is around 3.5km or 45min walk, is a good exercise , and evening she park at my house and go back herself, good about this is no need to wait here and there. or u can take a bus or taxi back, gv some business to our fellow brother also.</p>
              <p>Dun be omo when u r new in this line, u will be very stress.  ppl said drive taxi, drive only ma!!!easy lah, whose ever got license can drive also, i know. knn, sorry when ever i heard ppl say this, my ball boil, ask them come and drive for 1wk and try then said. Driving a taxi u must look for cars infront  and behind u( cause bang , $2000 gone) if we are at fault , look for pax, traffic light, lta, tp, buslane, cbd can stop cannot stop etc.the stress we hv driving a taxi. I dun know u are in this industry be4 or not( cause taxi is also a service line, like retail, hotel , travel), we need to meet different ppl everyday, is different from office work and othe trade. We meet different ppl and different character everyday.For me be4 i drive taxi, i am in the travel industry, i use to drive coach and bring those aunty and uncle( pay little but want alot and complain alot) go malaysia and thailand, so i will train and bulletproof now. i alway tell myself this, the most F***pax i take, the most take me only 30mins then u go, why must let a only 30min stupid pax and make my the next 12hrs driving unhappy and anger, most important is affect my income also( no mood to drive) and not fair for the next pax onboard yr taxi cause he pay the fare also.Go and try yrself, dun only listen to ppl said this can blar blar blar, that cannot blar blar blar, different ppl got different character, whose know maybe he not suit this line but u can, only u yrself know yrself better. Gv a try, three month cannot. then change other line, atleastå¯¹å¾—èµ·è‡ªå·±.got try be4, right bro? if u worry other taxi coy no call, join LV, we have plenty of call, tiobo CSM (poolman)?My uncle , drive taxi also bring up three children, 1phd , 1 honour and 1 stiil is nus, so dun think bad of driving taxi.u will heard ppl said last time taxi easy, now different, Ya, why last time ppl eat rice, we eat gold now, i agree now got more driver and more cab now, but if u willing to work hard, still can support a family( mark my word) not drive 2 hrs and sit 10hrs then tell me "paidan"(éš¾èµš)</p>

              <p>Jalan Batu is a place u can find not much cabbies , or try your luck at Kampong Arang ?</p>
              <p>Very logic ...u expect Tanjong Rhu residence to drive a cab ?</p>
              <p>Or Mountbatten people driving a cab ?</p>
              <p>If u stay around K Arang , the best place u can find a cab is surrounding North bridge Road area , Beach road area .....</p>
              <p>Or even Upper Boon Keng area .</p>
              <p>Then take a bus or cab home .</p>

              <p>Hi Bros here,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you for all your advise on location for hirer</p>
              <p>Poolman: Hahaha True , Tanjong Rhu area quite hard to find TD, Yes im just staying at the blk along Kg Arang. I just got my TDVL still waiting for my new house to complete before i start driving as Relief which ever company.</p>
              <p>Kallang Airport area will be good also. As one of the bro here Mr Goh Li getting his TDVL soon also maybe will join him or else let see how first.. Now ba long long for 2 months liao really how my new house to be ready by mid dec so that i can really setle down to concentrqte to work as TD.</p>
              <p>If i still stay at sengkang area im sure i have no worry for the hirer, coz theres alot of hirer at Sengkang Rivervale Crescent lookinf for relief. Hahaha.</p>
              <p>Would like to comment more in this forum but i still havent drive yet so i have nothing to comment and advise yet. Stay tune!</p>
              <p>Thank you</p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
