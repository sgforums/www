That time I also kanna double white line from Suntec to Marina Mandrain. KNN the TP just under the bridge outside Pan Pac. Saw him writing something on his note pad. I thought die liao. That was in July till now no news should be ok liao. I think he also give chance lah bcos that time no cars around and I am the only car on the road so not endanger anyone. So he give chance good for me and good for him also....haha</p>

              <p>bro... the yellow box is suppose to be clear of vehicles...  the bus might start moving from the bus stop and then saw the taxi stationary and want to move into the 2nd lane, but this TD suddenly move his taxi forward, resulting in the collision.... do you think the BC will expect the taxi to suddenly  move off into the yellow box? think this TD is purposely want to block the bus from turning in.</p>

              <p>The yellow box is there obviously for the bus to move out.</p>
              <p>You are in the yellow box when the light is red and all vehicles are not moving as I can see on the video.</p>
              <p>The bus is trying to move into the yellow box and it has the right of way as the vehicles in front of you is still stationary.</p>
              <p>As we can see clearly on the video, your vehicle bang onto the right side of the bus in the yellow box.</p>
              <p>With so many cameras on the bus, it would have shown that while the bus is trying to get into the yellow box, your taxi is moving in at the same time, thus resulting in the collision.</p>
              <p>It would consistent with your video if you are to show to SBS or Transcab.</p>
              <p>Bro hammer, sad to say you might be on the losing end. Not even 50/50.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Yeah man , red light , yellow box , i do not see why u need to accelerate ?</p>
              <p>I thought lights in your favour as per our conversation .</p>
              <p>If lights is green , u move , bus chucked in , then he could be at fault .</p>
              <p>U better not bring up this video , not in your favour .</p>
              <p>From that view , clearly , i don't know , the bus has intention to filter in before the red lights goes green , and i was shocked to see you accelerated and banged him .</p>

              <p>BOLA applies even if there is dispute over right of way at traffic lights, or yellow boxes etc.</p>
              <p>Applying scenario No.14 or No.31</p>
              <p>The onus is on the bus driver to be extra careful.</p>
              <p>However I also feel that  the video may be used against the TS as he is seen moving into the yellow box while the other vehicles are not moving.</p>

              <p>If you are not in the yellow box to begin with, this accident would not have happen.</p>
              <p>As we can see from your video.</p>
              <p>All the stationary vehicles did not move and we can see the bus turning right at the traffic light junction ahead while the collision occured.</p>
              <p>To be brunt, you have no wish to give way to the bus who has the right of way into the yellow box.</p>
              <p>This is why LTA has to introduce Mandatory Give-Way to Buses Scheme so that buses can exit from the bus bay.</p>
              <p>So many bros have commented on your video, so let's take it as a lesson learnt instead.</p>
