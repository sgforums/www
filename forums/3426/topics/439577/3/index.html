              <p>I hate drivers who stop inside the yellow boxes.</p>
              <p>I myself always stay clear of the yellow boxes so that other motorists could turn out from the side road.</p>
              <p>Like I mentioned before, practise defensive driving and give way to other motorists even if you have right of ways. It would not save you much time anyway if you don't give way.</p>

              <p>A truck driver died when a heavy load of steel rods from the back of his long trailer surged forward, piercing through his seat and flattening the driver's cabin.</p>
              <p>The freak accident happened at about 2.20 pm outside a warehouse on Lokyang Way, near the junction of Pioneer North Road in Tuas.</p>
              <p>The driver is identified as Mohd Ghazali Masoothu, aged 38.</p>
              <p>Rescuers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force's elite Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team took about 40 minutes to remove the rods, pile by pile, with a crane.</p>
              <p>They also had to use a spreading and cutting tool to open up the mangled wreckage to extricate the driver?s body.</p>
              <p>Delivery driver Mr Yeo Yeow, 43, who was coming out of the warehouse to go for tea, said the truck driver?s cabin was reduced to a flattened heap.</p>
              <p>"I have never seen anything like it," said a stunned Mr Yeo, who sent pictures of the accident scene to Stomp, The Straits Times interactive portal.</p>
              <p>"The incident reminds me that I must be careful when I drive my cargo."</p>
              <p>In another accident shortly after at 3pm, one container truck trailer, and two double-decker buses collided with each other along the Pan Island Expressway towards Jurong, near the Lornie Road exit.</p>
              <p>One bus driver was injured and rushed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. He had abrasions on his forehead and body.</p>
              <p>The public buses were not carrying passengers as it was off-service time.</p>
              <p>Police are investigating both accidents and appeal to anyone with information to call the Traffic Police hotline at 1800-547-1818</p>

              <p>RIP.</p>
              <p>So it pays not to cause people to brake for no good reason, because its not just our lives, but everyone's at stake here.</p>

              <p>Please leh bro. What you meant by this? What give others a chance who needed it? So you mean I am holding on to my taxi and that will deprive others from becoming a TD? Do you know how many Wishes Jasmine are stuck with? You says until my Wish is the last Wish available and I dun return keys others got no taxi to drive like that<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Wow this topic... i wan comment too.</p>
              <p>My personal conclusion is TS is in the wrong.</p>
              <p>My reason is simple:</p>
              <p>- Before the contact, bus was the first to be stationary, taxi still moving leading to the impact.</p>
              <p>- Yellow box, TS fails to stay outside but instead inch inside and fail to give way to bus from the left</p>
              <p>The yellow box as i see in the video is specially drawn to let buses move out with ease becos if no yellow box, u can forget about smaller cars giving way to buses.</p>
              <p> Advice for TS, be man enough to admit wrong, who wont mak mistakes in their life?</p>
