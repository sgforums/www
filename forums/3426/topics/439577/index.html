              <p>Because another vehicle is trying to switch lane behind so I let him have some space. But before the accident occurs I already moving off because the light is changing to green.</p>

              <p><br>Just dun bother.</p>
              <p>Many of these yellow box is practically just now for a 12m bus to move.</p>
              <p>Always check the yellow box, sometimes the bus just cannot brake esp if the bus is fillled w/ standee.. We cars can brake, but bus brake ppl fall down.</p>

              <p>Because another vehicle is trying to switch lane behind so I let

              <p>when the accident happen, the light is STILL RED and you can see clearly that there are still traffic turning at the junction.... i think you purposely drove forward and dun want to let the bus turn out.... look how far you have gone inside the yellow box? at least 5m... and still moving..(just look at position of the comfort taxi on the right) show the video to the TP lah.. see who will win the case? still  dare to say that can claim 100%? no other cars are moving at all. only you special move inside yellow box...</p>
              <p>think u better dun go down to the depot.. you sure lose one, cos even if you delete away your video, there are so many CAMERAs on the bus....that was a Wright and you can see the camera near the BC window as well. Cant hide the facts that you have move into the yellow box...</p>

              <p>wrong....dun show movie also will lose.  the BC/SBST can also show movie even if this TD does not show any movie... the movie show by the BC/SBST will clearly show that the traffic light is still red and all other vehicles are not moving and will show that this RED cab move inside the yellow box while the rest of the vehicles did not move at all. SBST will claim the insurance on this TD, plus any additional cost, eg if that bus went for repair for one week, SBST can claim the opportunity cost of not running the bus on the road for one week.... that will be big sum...</p>

              <p>i think that is the Sv174 bus... 7591? now SBST smart, put up cameras all over the bus... think last time they kenna claim too much by those unreasonable ppl and a lot of BCs suffer and lose their jobs....... still remember a case recently that a old man complain that he fall down from the bus when he is alighting as the bus move.... still dare to complain to newspaper and want to claim SBST... the video taken by the bus cameras clearly show that the man have already alighted and he was on the bus stop when he fall down.</p>
