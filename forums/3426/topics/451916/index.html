              I am a 35 years old citycab night shift relief. I recently turn full time after driving part time for 4 years.
              
              Instead of telling the normal pick up here and there, I'm going to blog about the dark side of a night shift cab driver. I should have been complained by paxs, but I'm still in the trade. Yet like most cab drivers, I have no place to go to if I can't drive a cab anymore. So please pan chance.
              
              Let intro a bit why I become a taxi driver. I'm a 'O' level with a official tested IQ of 158. OK, first part reality - 'O' level + 35 years old = max. 2K salary(- cpf = 1.6K cash) which is not enough for my family of 3 living in a 3 room flat. Second part, I'm a natural facial, body language reader. It is so good that I can know 95% if you are lying over the phone detecting from the frequency of your tone (unless you are trained to cover your tone). In other words, I am a code reader. It also becomes a curse when put me in an office politic environment. Night shift is GOOD for me, because it is dark and I don't need to see the pax faces. They're picked, alighted, finish. Simple business that I don't need to think so much. I only need to think about how to maximize the profit using the shortest hours.
              
              Lucky for me, my math is also good. Whereas experienced drivers based on their experience, time and location to pick up the paxs, I incuded number of 'green' cabs, estimated market on the road, and probability in my calculation as well. Example, Labour day night, Tue, 1st of May - no one working, no one clubbing, no one go shopping (because of the long weekends.) Everywhere, super long 'green' cab queue. Probability + some luck, I managed to hit $205 for a 6 hours work. Ability to read the situation and adjust is the key.
              
              Whereas normal nights when most drivers know where to go, I become a â€œnormalâ€� driver again.
              
              I am a rogue driver because I donâ€™t share. Other drivers are my competitors. Of course, respect and manner is another thing, which I still got.

              Monday. A school holiday in lieu of Vesak Day.
                      
              Today I worked from 6pm to 9pm. Not that I earned enough, but I got hit by the flu. Focus was at ~65%, a level which could suddenly drop lower if drive longer. If I insist on driving, I could not be here typing. Initially not so bad, but it went worse once I started the air-con. Should be the midnight rain I caught few nights ago when Iâ€™m running home.
                      
              Today break even after rent, diesel and wash car. No, not break even because I wasted a 3 hours effort without getting anything.
                      
              So how tomorrow? What if flu cannot get away 3-4 days? How should I face my hirer? Iâ€™m need to pay the hirer $20-$30 each day Iâ€™m not driving? Sick, no pay, no medical allowance, no medical leave, no income and need to pay up $60-$90. Fair? If not, how? Company can help? Insurance? Create some system?
                      
              You people really can talk. Give you a problem, can you solve?
                      
              End of the day, it's us the human who cannot be trusted and start abuse the system that provided help.
                  
              I am a rogue driver because i cannot be bothered about the chance of infecting others as long as I'm in condition to drive. At the end of the day, I only need to answer to myself and my family. Ya, the chance of me infecting my own family at home is so much so much higher than the paxs goes one round to infect them. Of course, unless there is a code red like sars, I will take extra cautions.
