              <p>Anyone regular at the CDG kiosk Jalan Bukit Merah? After pumping do you walk to the counter and pay or drive your vehicle to the counter make payment? By right should walk there pay then come back collect vehicle and drive off right? But I see alot of buay automatic driver after pumping drive up to the counter and pay thus cause a jam for those who want to move out.</p>
              <p>Have encounter alot of times and complain to CDG alot of times. Today also same thing. Wait until tulan liao honk at the Sonata in front. Then after coming out main road give the driver a finger. Wah that CB kia buay song come and give chase. He initially want to U-turn to Hoy Fatt direction and I going straight. So we come down KPKB each other at the Queensway Shopping center junction. KNN that CB kia then buay song jio me 1 on 1 ask me follow him to the car park in front. Lai loh...I scare meh. So follow him to a quiet place. Before he can land any blow on me I already floored him with just 1 blow. Ya just ONE BLOW on the FARKING face and that CB kia cannot even stand up. Then treat him a few more kicks until he call tolong....</p>
              <p>KNN old man still so guai lan. Got some faded tattoo so what. Want to play gangster with me. Think white Limo hor jiak issit? I tell him next time see me better siam far far if not see one time whack one time. Really spoil me day......</p>

              <p>Bro hammer, cannot strike one, you end up at losing at end. Kena kick from CDG no problem but if LTA involve, both kena suspended.</p>
              <p>Just hope matter ends there. I know very difficult to let go the fucker, but this is a very serious matter if become police report, it is considered 323 (VCH) but because it started from a traffic matter, is considered road rage and this if goes to court will attract a jail term.</p>

              <p>I used to pump there during my omo days. For me, it's quite straightforward. Leave the pump to pay so others can use the pump.</p>
              <p>However, if there is a long queue of cabs at the cashier and I may block others, I'll pay first before leaving the pump.</p>
              <p>Yes, those that double park deserve to be shacked!</p>

              <p>Ya busy period I understand. But that time non busy period. 10plus morning. No need to shift out because there is no other vehicles behind waiting to pump. Half the kiosk is empty. Only place jam up is the counter area cos of those selfish bastard whom dun want to walk to and fro to make payments.</p>

If summon to police or LTA or CDG then I will says he whack me first I self defence loh. See the authority believe who? An uneducated lao ah beng TD with criminal record (Claim by the beng himself, got cannon or not I dun know) or an educated innocent cute looking limo driver like myself? I already got medical report stated that I am badly injured just in case.</p>

              <p>We are going through what other's industries been going through also...3rd Generation of Taxi Uncles.</p>
              <p>1st Generation of TU already long forgotten, current situation is the transistion period between 2nd &amp; 3rd generation of TU.</p>
              <p>What I wanted to stress is that, TU in 3rd generation including me won't be able to understand what 2nd generation TU had gone through before.</p>
              <p>They are force by circumstances and make changes, ie behavious, customer srevices, cashless mode, rules &amp; regulations and many many more.</p>
              <p>Try to be more tolerant between TU....at the end of the day, it make no different to the amount of income you have bring home to feed your family.</p>
