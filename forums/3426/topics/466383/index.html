              <p>KNN last nite picked up an drunk Irish farker from Orchard Tower wants to go Tanjong Pagar accused me of taking longer route when I turned to North Bridge rd after Kim Seng rd and says I should keep going straight by Outram then Cantoment...   When I tried to explain myself, he starts to ask me to shut up and threatens to lodge a complain.</p>
              <p>So I stopped my taxi and asked him wat he wants from me now! He replied to bring him to the nearest police station, so ho say liao, I drove him to to the Cantoment Police HQ.</p>
              <p>Told the guards on duty briefly the story and was told I cannot park my taxi there. So I parked my taxi at the bus stop further up. He suddenly became timid and he paid me the fare pretending nothing has happened.</p>
              <p>This type of ppl really ought to be slapped in the face, haha!</p>
              <p>But I won't be surprise if he complain to my co. anyway already feedback the incident to the control center...</p>

              <p>those that tell you where and how to go usually wont complain or make a fuss.</p>
              <p>its those who dun reply, say go your own way or any way that complain when you reach destination or when you take a route that they dun like.</p>
              <p>even when you tell them how you intend to go, they usually say aiyah just go lar, go your own way or just keep quiet.</p>
              <p>my theory is that they are just spoiling for a fight, after all they complain, customer always wins mah if blue or yellow got voucher to take summore. just pick up a very quarrelsome passenger yesterday, pay by voucher, was boasting in the taxi that she is a VIP comfort always give her voucher and she always FEEDBACK to comfort taxi driver tricks. bo pian just have to smile and pretend she is correct....</p>
