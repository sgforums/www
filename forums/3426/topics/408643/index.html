              wednessday  morning along AYE near portsdown exit on d 1st lane, abt 6 car pack together. 1st &amp; last was blue sonata and in middle was also a blue sonata. Really pathetic.
              Then last night on Lakeview talkie, ECP avoid, very jam, FOUR taxi accident.   I wonder HOW many of them is a part-time TD holding a full time day job.
              From wednessday papers, TD arrested for failing to stop on ZEBRA crossing resulting in the death of a 41yo woman.
              Maybe bro Poolman should start a thread in this aspect so that we all could learn fr others mistakes.
              It would also shed some lights to TD wanabies who is misleaded into thinking that TD job is easy money. 
              It would also warned those weekend high flyer TD who do 19hrs,23hrs type  "hey , not only ur love ones is waiting 4 u at home BUT your passenger's family is also waiting for them to reached home safely."
              take care, drive safe guys.

              once , all the cars in front of me and mine slow down almost coming to a stop @ the traffic junction, i saw one blue manual TD fr rear view mirror that his speed was too fast towards my ass. Seconds later, he was panicking n braking hard .  As the front car still move forward b4 coming complete stop, i try to help that driver by going closer to d car in front, thus giving that litte bit more of space.
              In the end he manage to avoid collision but veered slightly off.
              
              I re-think d whole situation, i think wat i did was totally wrong. WHAT IF that idiot still slam me, d impact would hv cause my car to hit d one infront. AND thru' no faults of mine, i'm liable to pay for d damaged to d front car. It's hard earned money. 
              
              Maybe next time don't b so kay-kiang. Just pull handbrake as hard as possible and BRACE for an impact. KNN
