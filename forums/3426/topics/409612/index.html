              <p>tats why CDG is not suitable for drivers who are rude to pax, likelihood to incur complains and have a habit of owing rental. kena 3 pax complains and u get shown the red card.</p>
              <p>so far , from the time rejoined CDG, 3 of my friends tio kick liao</p>
              <p>(1) Refusal to accept Nets , E-voucher , Cab Charge ( This pax complained that he scolded her , he also threw the card back at her &amp; that was the last straw ) RED CARD</p>
              <p>(2) Excessive speeding &amp; take long route  X 3 complains</p>
              <p>(3) Owe rental 10 days nia.</p>
              <p>For (1) , i really got no sympathy for him . If he dont accept cashless, why the fuck he drive CDG taxi for???? CDG even hand delivered the termination letter to his house personally haha</p>
              <p>(2) &amp; (3) damn tulan with CDG now. one is now a red gangster chief haha</p>
              <p>simply said la , CDG very xia lan now. those who need their calls better not try to play punk.</p>
              <p>those who are sweepers honestly shouldnt drive for them and subject themselves to their bastard attitude. i see so so many CDG taxis queueing at jurong bird park or jurong point when Benoi road , Tuas , Gul is on fire. why ah? Q taxi stand no need to drive CDG mah.</p>
              <p>For me , no call i dont know how to ply my trade, so guai guai lo. until the day they kick me out then i will think of alternatives haha</p>

              <p>ermm now???? under who i also dunno. obviously u can see the difference.</p>
              <p>anyway , since cant drive for them can consider others mah. like poolman now doing very well with Transcab.</p>
              <p>Today he came out one hour earlier than me , 4 pm . 12 midnight he sms me he hit $XXX . it took me 4 am to hit his amount short of $20.</p>
              <p>so for every 1 hr that he got advantage over me , i have to slog another 4 more hrs just to match him. so CDG very good meh?</p>

              <p><br>Hi,</p>
              <p>Comfort joined hand with delgro to go global, that is partnership, with Delgro, which is a private enterprise/entitiy, they can venture into any part of the world to do business.</p>
              <p>Your 540millions per year is a gross profit, you must take into the account of cost of operation and taxation. The cost of buying new taxis, workshops, staffs and workers paid, office rentals etc etc.</p>
              <p>However, you are right that even at net, which minus off the gross profit, they still earn alots, if not long close shop liao, my suggestion is buy their share, it on the open market, they paid good dividends, and if you see CDG expansion, most likely their share will go further up.</p>
              <p>If I am the CEO, I will offer driver share options to attract them, being a drivers for comfort delgro, you are also a minority shareholder, you will work with more pride, more income and certainly, more returns if the company grow.</p>

              <p>CDG has about 30,000 registered active taxi drivers.Each paid $1000 as deposit even before they start to drive their taxis. $30,000,000 of deposit money. If put in some bonds or banks fixed deposit, interest may be 4% p.a. during good times. $1.2 million of interest profit in a year.</p>
              <p>Many have parked their $1000 there for more than a decade. Yes, good to buy their shares and work or drive on the road with more pride............ but are they proud of us ?? We are driving their taxis to make a meagre living, while they are using us to make even more money.....No love for each other !     </p>
