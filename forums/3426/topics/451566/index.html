              <p>Got this habit from my former relief, I want to have my cab "spit" and span each time I start work. I always do departure, so chances of people touching my booth is very high.</p>
              <p>From my limited experience, the booth area seems to get dirty the fastest. There was once I abit lazy that night so never wash, next day do departure and the pax went to open the booth, gosh, so embarassing for me, the back was so dirty. And I wash every alternate days too. Know a fellow CDG omo who claim that he was once every two weeks? Cannot imagine if ppl still dare to take if it's mine.</p>

              <p>Talking about these water source, Each time I walk my dog, I would see this guy in my neighbourhood who go around in his bicycle and big plastic container going to our Bt Panjang spring to collect water.</p>
              <p>Out of curiosity, I finally ask him if he rear fishes and using this water for changing his tank. To me, this water is most idea for fish and watering plants.</p>
              <p>To my surprised, he said he using them for drinking.- own consumption. FREE some more. Gosh, this people really bother. Reminds me of my Teochew opera, where the wicked sister in law would force the female lead to go to well far off from her place to collect bucket and bucket of water. In real live, such practice still exist.</p>

              <p>Talking about these water source, Each time I walk my dog, I
              would see this guy in my neighbourhood who go around in his bicycle
              and big plastic container going to our Bt Panjang spring to collect
              water.</p>
              <p>Out of curiosity, I finally ask him if he rear fishes and using
              this water for changing his tank. To me, this water is most idea
              for fish and watering plants.</p>
              <p>To my surprised, he said he using them for drinking.- own
              consumption. FREE some more. Gosh, this people really bother.
              Reminds me of my Teochew opera, where the wicked sister in law
              would force the female lead to go to well far off from her place to
              collect bucket and bucket of water. In real live, such practice
              still exist.</p>

              <p>Just my suggestion, hopefully you guys can stop addressing each others in LV code, this place is not as enclosed as what you guys think.</p>
              <p>It might ended up backfire, individual background still need some minimum of privacy.</p>
