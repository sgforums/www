              this guy like dye hair and wear polotshirt and bermudas look something like ah beng waving his arm big big at roadside. when i stop he very fast jump in and speak like malaysian chinese: "quick go to vivo that james power something..from woodland to there its not very far right" 
              
              at first i thought hes asking me but when i see his face in the back mirror its like not asking, its more like telling me then he lean and sit back liao. then i started driving not long just a few traffic lights he started asking (or saying?)

              but after that he very fast make those tsk tsk upset sounds and keep shifting in his seat like impatient, then keep saying you say not far, very fast, but why so long are we there already or not!? all the way until we see the james power building then he more quiet.
              
              but when we reach near the carpark, he say he no enough money and then say need to call his friend come over pay, then he talk very fast and angrily into his handphone in something funny dialect. he then open the door half leg on the roadside outside half body inside, like want to get out but not get out, looking everywhere like for his friend but the place where we stop theres no one near at all. sometime i thought hes going to get out becos he put his 2 legs outside. but his actions look very gan chiong and frustrated like that, holding handphone to his ear and talk very loud, something like rushing to hospital emergency like that
              
              but cars behind us start to more and more some horn already maybe becos at the side doing road work so smaller lane, then i finally say or nevermind how much you have there you can pay first? he say he only got $10!..

              <p>Bro NewDriver</p>
              <p>When I saw this thread (<a href="/forums/3426/topics/427650">encounter a slight drunk local man who thought i am PRC</a>), I thought is the drunk man problematic.  But, when I saw that you did not say anything when this guy say "from Woodlands to there not very far right", I have to really wonder whether you are "born-in-Singapore" Singaporean.  (Ok, I know that only pink IC holder can drive taxi in Sg).</p>
              <p>From Woodlands to St. James is not only very far, it's gan si lan far.  You're talking from very north to very south of Singapore leh.  How can you not know that??  Maybe he pulled the trick before. But, as you mentioned he spoke in M'sia Chinese, I give him the benefit of doubt lor.</p>
              <p>Think you really need to shred that "good guy" or "decent guy" look of you.  I can recommend you a very good tattoo shop in Geylang, if required.  Best in Singapore and JB. Some say Batam also. (Ok, just joking about the tattoo...)  From Woodlands to St. James for only $10, tooooo cheap. I only give if it's a very chio girl, give 3/4 balls and wearying super super short mini skirt.  And, it must be midnight somemore.  Else, tell him to wait for a good (read =&gt; charitable) TD to arrive.</p>

              <p>No offense meant, but it's exactly this type of reasoning that these a**hole preyed on that made them try this sort of trick.  Maybe they got away each and every time hence no harm trying lor.</p>
              <p>Anyway, not really must bring these a**hole to police station one.  Just dial 999 and most of the time, police will appear within 10 - 15 minutes.  I did that twice but once is because I refuse to carry on the trip due to "degrading remarks" by the pax and he refuse to alight.  The second time is the pax refuse to pay compensation for his friend vomiting in my car.  These a**holes huh... They just want to try their luck one.  Once they heard police WILL be involved, most of the time money will appear miraculously.</p>
