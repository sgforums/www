              <p><strong>Thomson Line to open from 2019 with 22 stations</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: 
              Singapore's sixth rail network -- the Thomson Line (TSL) -- will open 
              from 2019, instead of the indicative timeline of 2018 announced in the 
              Land Transport Master Plan.<br><br>Minister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew, 
              who gave an update on the Thomson Line on Wednesday, said the change in 
              timeline is to accommodate some adjustments made to the original plan.<br><br>Under the final rail alignment plan of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the TSL will be longer and have more stations.<br><br>It will be 30 kilometres long -- 3 kilometres longer than envisaged -- and have 22 stations, four more than originally planned.<br><br>One of them is Springleaf station, sited in Nee Soon Group Representation Constituency (GRC).<br><br>Ms
               Lee Bee Wah, an MP for the area, said: "Springleaf, most of the 
              residents there, they are living in the private estate, landed 
              properties, as well as some condominiums. So this station will be able 
              to serve all these residents."<br><br>Another two stations are Woodlands North and Woodlands South in Sembawang GRC.<br><br>Ms
               Ellen Lee, an MP for the area, said: "It (TSL) will facilitate 
              transfer, especially within the estate itself and it will solve the 
              crunch that my residents feel whenever they take the MRT and when they 
              take the buses."<br><br>TSL will run from Woodlands in the north to 
              Marina Bay in the south and is expected to be built at an estimated cost
               of around S$18 billion.<br><br>It is expected to have a daily ridership of 400,000 commuters.<br><br>Six of the 22 stations will be interchanges, enabling commuters to reach their destinations in the shortest possible time.<br><br>For
               example, a resident of Sin Ming travelling to Republic Polytechnic in 
              Woodlands will halve his or her commute time from 50 minutes to 25 
              minutes.<br><br>Another at Woodlands Regional Centre heading to Marina Barrage will take 55 minutes instead of 70.<br><br>With six interchange stations, the TSL will connect to all existing lines and the future Downtown Line (DTL).<br><br>"All
               in, about 160,000 households will be within 10- to 12-minute walk from 
              one of these stations. So you will have an additional option. Instead of
               having to take a feeder bus or find a way to get to one of the stations
               on the North-South Line, these 160,000 households can choose to walk to
               one of the Thomson Line's stations as an alternative," said Mr Lui.<br><br>TSL will connect to the North-South Line at Woodlands and Orchard stations.<br><br>Caldecott Station will connect to the Circle Line.<br><br>Residents of the Bukit Timah stretch can change trains at the future DTL Stevens Station to connect to the TSL.<br><br>The
               Outram Park Station will connect the TSL to the East-West Line and 
              North-East Line, while the Marina Bay Station will connect the TSL to 
              the North-South Line and Circle Line.<br><br>TSL will open in three stages from the north to the south.<br><br>Phase One, which will have three stations from Woodlands North to Woodlands South, will open in 2019.<br><br>Phase Two will be ready in 2020, with stations from Springleaf to Caldecott.<br><br>The final stretch of 13 stations from Mount Pleasant to Gardens by the Bay will open in 2021. <br><br>When fully operational, an estimated 60,000 households will be within 400 metres of one of the TSL stations.<br><br>The line, which will be fully underground, will run on a four-car instead of a three-car system.<br><br>Mr Lui said this will give it additional capacity to cope with any increase in long-term demand.<br><br>He was speaking during a visit to Telok Ayer Station of Downtown Line One, which will open by the end of next year.<br><br>Mr
               Lui also said: "During the construction phase (of the TSL), there will 
              inevitably be a certain amount of inconvenience, noise pollution. We 
              will try our best to minimise this as much as possible. We will of 
              course want to engage the residents, dialogue with them, find ways to 
              meet as much as possible some of the points that they raise."<br><br>LTA,
               Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority 
              (URA) said in a joint statement that while all efforts have been made to
               minimise land acquisition, the government will acquire four full lots.<br><br>They
               include Pearl's Centre in Eu Tong Sen Street, a post office along Upper
               Thomson Road and two landed properties along Stevens Road and Robin 
              Close.<br><br>Pearl's Centre will be affected by the construction of the TSL as a tunnel will run under part of the building. <br><br>To
               optimise land use around the future TSL station at Outram Park, Pearl's
               Centre will be acquired and integrated with the adjoining state land 
              for a high-density mixed-use development.<br><br>Five other part lots will also be acquired but will not affect the main building structure.<br><br>The SLA gazetted the land affected by acquisition on Wednesday.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>No, alot of people still prefer privacy, woodland to many taxi driver is a pain in the ass if you are doing nite and hv to go there, there in providing MRT can be a blessing for TD in a way that they got more time to ply other better income places.</p>
              <p>The opening of centre line, or earllier mrt to expo and airport may had add a little less income for TD as thought, but as times goes by, still many are taking taxis, not much an issue.</p>
              <p>Singapore is feeling the heat of it infrastructure failure if it do not extend it MRT lines, and that can shame singapore who had alway been seen as the best infrastructure in Asia if not the world. The mass immigration had led to transportation problem, hospital bed problem, and many other problem that our govt scholars had failed to see, is like inviting many guests but never think about the drinks and foods.</p>
              <p>Govt is now trying to recuperate this shortfall, which had angered locals in a way of being second class instead of true blue singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The next point is the reduction of cars population adversely would result in  adding more peoples taking public transportation, and that opportunity cost of a person taking a taxis or MRT is up to individual to decide.</p>
              <p>Let us take an example of 4 persons going from woodland to orchard road, feeder bus services + Mrt would take each about $2.50, you add it up you get $10, a cab down to orchard under non peak can be around $16 to $18, each just come out a dollar more and you get privacy without the need to crowd around with others, walks, or maybe have to  stand for the whole journey and yet have to walk again or change MRT or buses to their desired destination.</p>
