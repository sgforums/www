              <p>Oh yah forgot to add, the G-sensor can set low, normal, high sensitivity or off. Normally i see people recommend low. So when got impact (accident) or hard breaking it will lock the file during the event, so camera will not overwrite that file when card is full.</p>
              <p>Also has an SOS button, so can manually press the button to lock the file.</p>
              <p>Similar high end models with same specs and functions cost about $600+, this one i bought plus shipping only around $130-$140</p>

              <p>Not from ebay from Hong Kong with one year warranty, i'm one of their registered reseller but purchased this for myself and also to test. If can gather enough interested parties i can do a mass order. Won't take profit from forum members.</p>

              <p>Just uploaded, night clip after wshing windscreen. If u notice my left shoulder got white color light it's actually coming from the Infra Red LEDs, invisible to human eye, but use handphone camera can see the LED are on. Good thing about the IR LEDs, it has a light sensor, only on when light level is low.</p>

              <p>There are many other dual lens DVR on ebay and such, but reading all the specs and video reviews i find this to be the best for a budget.</p>
              <p>I was actually very interested in this one:</p>

              <p>Think according to LTA cannot, filming rear of car (ie following vehicles) also cannot, not only cab but all vehicles.</p>
              <p>But then i've seen so many cars mounting rear DVR, some even have four, 2 front 2 rear.</p>
              <p>But if pax run fare or rob, LTA got help you for the lost  or help find the culprit?</p>
              <p>The DVR i use got LCD screen, PAX can see that i'm recording them as well. Even if no memory card, still will show on screen, at least a better deterent.</p>
              <p>Also good lah they don't allow film pax, cos some TD will abuse if they allow. Like last time in the 80s or 90s, TDs put small mirror to see upskirts of female pax, like that also shiok?</p>
              <p>Singapore a bit slow when it comes to technology and taxi driver welfare. A lot of other countries in the world has CCTV on their taxi filming pax. The front facing camera was also not allowed in cabs, only until the Rochor Road accident that they realise having front camera makes it easier to settle investigation and insurance... Taxi companies and LTA don't really suffer much when taxi driver get rob, pax run fare or driver get kill, so to them they don't actually benefit having to implement internal camera.</p>
              <p> Last time can lah, pax that run fare usually young kids. Now with all the "foreign talent" taking advantage of the fact that most TDs are old and can't do anything if they run, beat or verbally abuse, etc</p>
              <p>Read this, see how many other countries have cam on their taxi:</p>

The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) introduced its original safety camera specification in 2000 and cameras quickly became the preferred item of safety equipment for the FHVs. In 2007, the TLC updated their camera specifications to take advantage of the latest advances in camera technology, increasing the number of images by a factor of 10, and greatly increasing the resolution and the image quality of the night images. In 2008, with approximately 20,000 cameras installed, New York has more cameras than any other city. The number of incidents of taxi crime is also one of the lowest in the world."</span></p>

Like many such towns, it has seen an increase in the number of fare bilking incidents, and assaults against taxi drivers, principally by drunk young men. The licensing authority was anxious to promote the safety of their taxis, particularly as a holiday season was approaching. In 2008, the town proposed to part-fund a pilot scheme of 10 cameras. By early 2009, there had been a spectacular decrease in the numbers of incidents and the police had used the images obtained from the cameras to gain speedy convictions against the perpetrators of two robbery attempts. In March 2009, the town purchased a further 20 cameras and is hoping to have all taxis and private hire vehicles equipped with cameras by 2010."</span></p>

              <p>Definitely not allowed to film passengers!!! In event of an incident or accident, if u submit your video clip as evidence you may also be fined for filming passengers. I was looking at the X3000 and X8 which were dual camera. Some even has GPS and shock sensors which shows where u are when reviewing in computer. But the images are only 720 resolution. </p>
              <p>Some facts about LEDs, the LEDs used for CCTV work in the invisible range of infrared. LED only helps illuminate videos or pictures taken in black and white. It does not help when color cameras are used. U can try covering the LEDs and see the results in ur video. There should be no difference except damage to ur eyes. The Really Really bad thing about IR LEDs is ur eyes cannot see it so ur pupils do not adjust to it. So ur pupils are wide open at night which is like staring into the sun wt eyes wide open. It will ruin ur eyesight in a short time. Eyes are essential for a taxi driver, especially if u intend to drive for years. So take care.</p>

                  <p>Definitely not allowed to film passengers!!! In event of an
                  incident or accident, if u submit your video clip as evidence you
                  may also be fined for filming passengers. I was looking at the
                  X3000 and X8 which were dual camera. Some even has GPS and shock
                  sensors which shows where u are when reviewing in computer. But the
                  images are only 720 resolution. </p>
                  <p>Some facts about LEDs, the LEDs used for CCTV work in the
                  invisible range of infrared. LED only helps illuminate videos or
                  pictures taken in black and white. It does not help when color
                  cameras are used. U can try covering the LEDs and see the results
                  in ur video. There should be no difference except damage to ur
                  eyes. The Really Really bad thing about IR LEDs is ur eyes cannot
                  see it so ur pupils do not adjust to it. So ur pupils are wide open
                  at night which is like staring into the sun wt eyes wide open. It
                  will ruin ur eyesight in a short time. Eyes are essential for a
                  taxi driver, especially if u intend to drive for years. So take
                  care.</p>

                  X3000 similar spec, but saw clips of night shots of rear, totally black. Daytime clip of rear has purple tint, due to ir filter in lens but no ir light. Common misconception about ir, it will only adversely affect your eye if you stare at it directly for long periods of time

              Yes, same as pic but if purchase your own, make sure get same specs as above that particular pic has 4 different spec, see lens field of view.

              <p><br> You know that the MDT records, location, when u start stop vehicle, how many trips how much u make, etc.. But not many know that even audio is recorded, there are several triggers for the audio recording. LTA don't use that audio as evidence, but sometimes they review it to resolve driver/passenger conflict to see which party lying. But even then they won't say they have audio as evidence hence why they call down for "interview"</p>
              <p>MDT running on WinCE, they can even view MDT live remotely if they want, but last i check no remote software installed. :)</p>
              <p>Digital media (photo/video/audio), previously was not allowed as an evidence in Singapore. Only recently they allow since most CCTV now use digitally recorded media. I know last time photos only from film allowed, audio and video from tape are allowed, since digital media is easily edited and very diffcult to tell edited and orginal versions apart.</p>

              <p>Actually in total darkness with front and rear passenger it actually works. </p>
              <p>X3000 at night rear cam won't see there are passenger behind.</p>
              <p>Bro, IR LED are actually safe. IR laser that one different story ah. </p>
              <p>Anyways the rear camera LED is offset to my left, staring directly implies shining it directly to your eye like put torch light right in front of eye.</p>
              <p>Yup if can order locally just buy locally, for me diff , order on 30th 6am item at my door on 31st noon.</p>
