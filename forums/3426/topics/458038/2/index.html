            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually, I went to GMarket website to look at the car cameras then I noticed that some of the sellers have contact numbers and address. So when I ordered the camera, I ordered directly and collected personally, cause the seller was staying only 2 bus stop away from me in Jurong West. So I have his phone number and address if the camera was not working. I think there is another seller in Klang Lane which is near Race Course road. There is another one in Woodsland too. So these sellers are in Singapore. I am only talking abt car cam, maybe other stuff in GMarket take long time.</p></div>

              <p>I never order from Gmarket before. Ebay yes, been selling and buying on ebay and forums for 10yrs now. From what i see GMARKET is like the old Yahoo Auctions, no buyer or seller protection like ebay. Hated the old yahoo auctions style, eventhough local buyer/seller got phone numbers yet so many con.</p>
              <p>But this cam i order direct from HK, for one piece cam cost me about US$80. Plus shipping i think US$90+</p>
              <p>I calculate if can order 10pcs, price would be about US$75 including FEDEX shipping. That's about SG$95+/- depending on exchange rates at point of order. Since 10pcs is well over SG$400, most likely have to pay GST 7%. But knowing FEDEX the GST bill normally comes few days after shipment received, but that all depends.</p>
              <p>They provide one year warranty, but must go thru me to ship back for RMAs.</p>
              <p>Those concern about the legality of filming pax, can always switch the rear cam off. Can record either front only or rear only or front and rear.</p>
              <p>Although there are many DVR out there capable of 1080P, the night shots quality most of the time not so good. At 720P this cam front camera nightshot are pretty good. Only on the built in 2.7inch screen the shots look grainy, viewing on the software or convert i realise that the night shots quite good.</p>
              <p>The only other cam i would buy that is comparable to this one in terms of specs is VisionDrive 8000 HDS, but it cost SG$600+</p>

Too bad I won't be able to buy one cause I just went to sign my SMRT contract for the new Epica and they told me our batch of new Epica comes wt car camera installed. I will use the one I have to take video of traffic in the rear to film tailgaters and hazardous speeding drivers. Will be collecting the taxi on 14th September. Just missed 1st prize 4D on Sunday cause I did not roll number. Only bought 4 combinations, but total needs 12 combinations cause have repeat digit. Sigh....Â </p></div>

              I was doing sales before my ns days, after ns all the way technical line, telecommunication, electronics, IT but did online sales on the side.
              But past few years didn't do much selling, been concentrating on mobile application development and my web hosting business.

              <p>Rear cam not that sharp but note that 2 of the IR LED partially block by rear view mirror. I'm waiting for my RAM mount from US. Should get by 10th of this month, so maybe can adjust the position of camera away from the rear view mirror</p>

              <p>Up to you guys if 2 buyers still around the SG$120 range depending on exchange rates. If 10 around SG$95 to SG$105, depending on exchange rate and GST 7%</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>For me i bought at $120 i find worth it, but you guys need to remember it doesn't come with micro SD card, they recommend above class 4 micro SD, i bought SanDisk 32GB class 10 at $35 i think from Sim Lim.</p>
              <p>And also since it's a china product, i advise not to leave it in the after you shift end, unless u day shift then leave it at night ok lah. My NETS machine leave in glove compartment in hot sun feel so warm when i start shift again at night.</p>

              <p>Yes, can. The screen can either switch off, show front recording only, show rear recording only or show both side by side when recording 2 channel.Â </p>
              <p>That clip rear camera bit blur, i realise that everytime i mount the cam, i sometimes smudge both lens with my finger. I remove the cam everytime i finish one shift, i don't dare leave it baking under hot sun. Camera might be able to take it, but i doubt the SD card can take the heat. So now after i mounted, i wipe both front and rear lens with microfiber cloth.</p>
              <p>and also.. since the camera uses same screw thread as a normal camera. I'm using RAM Mount system to mount the lens, more stable and more adjustability.</p>

              <p>If decent02 and you don;t mind paying same price as i paid then, i'll help order. But if u guys want cheaper price like i stated then must find more people interested.</p>
              <p>But here are some problems i encountered with the cam using for past 3 weeks.</p>
              <p>Problem 01:</p>
              <p>After one week, the plastic piece that is in front of the LCD dropped off. the glue they use never set properly</p>
              <p>Solution 01:</p>
              <p>I placed the plastic back, use a plastic clamp, those hobby ones look like clothes hanger clip, left it overnight now ok liao.</p>
              <p>Problem 02:</p>
              <p>The player program sometimes slow and never show which clip is locked.</p>
              <p>Solution 02:</p>
              <p>I format the SD card again using PC. Remove the "Volume Label" name, default is DR_Disk when u use cam to format, "File System" FAT32, and most important "Allocation Unit Size" must set to "Default allocation size"</p>
              <p>Problem03:</p>
              <p>Sometimes, when u on the camera and GPS connected. The date will change to one day before. ie today 25/9/2012 u on the camera, GPS sync it set to 24/9/2012. Yes u can manually change to the correct date, but everytime it's on will revert to previous day date.</p>
              <p>This could be a problem if let's say u forget to set correct date, for instance morning u record with wrong date, then at night u set to correct date. Then all the morning recording with wrong date will be overwritten as it detects as older file.</p>
              <p>Solution03:</p>
              <p>Simple, Format the card, if let's say u outside can format with the camera. But if there are clips inside u need to save to PC just let the wrong date be. Downside if do like that the time stamp wrong date lah.</p>
              <p>But if want to order, i can provide some tech support for those not so tech savvy.</p>
