              <p>
              </p><p>Wasted 1hr for a $20+ fare:</p>
              <p>    Last night around 730pm picked up 2 female pax from Science park. 2 destination, Moulmein then Orchard.</p>
              <p>    They board as normal, after dropping one pax at Moulmein head to Orchard, first pax said ION, then later change to 313, happy cos still within CBD.</p>
              <p>    Along Orchard, pax decided want to drop in front of 313 just at the crossing, since lights were red. Pax give me Amex Corporate card, but TC cashless terminal don't accept Amex. So asked if cash got cash/Nets/other Credit Card.</p>
              <p>    Pax gave me Visa card, tried but connection failed. So i reboot the terminal and try again, still cannot. So i thought maybe signal no good, told pax i got to back (taxi stand), then try again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Entered the Drop Off point, try again, come out error. So Pax give me another Chase VISA debit card. Tried but failed cos insufficient fund. I was at the drop off for nearly 10min see behind got one CDG behind me, i give hand signal say wait awhile. He waited. Then after few mins saw he roof top change to "On Call" and behind him got one private car entering the drop off, so decided to move out and stop just outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Asked pax if she got ATM card, so can bring her draw cash. She say have but inside not enough money. She just only start work in Singapore, she sounded like a PRC, so i understand that just start work here sure not enough cash first few months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    She said if can transfer the money to me, i said ok but must transfer by tonight. She said cannot and also she need receipt. I said i can't give receipt for fare you have not paid. If she transfer also how am i going to pass her original receipt for her to claim. She was on official company business and need to claim, the Amex card is company card.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Told her nicely she should have asked before boarding if i accepted card or Amex. Told her not all cabs have cashless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    She said she didn't know, from the conversation between her colleague and her earlier can understand that she just started work here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    I told her one way is we go Police station ad least make a report, at least got black and white she will pay me later. Anyways Orchard NPC nearby only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    She scared to go police station, i calm her down said just to get black and white.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    So turn back to Killiney, at traffic light i saw my petrol gauge was below quater tank, told myself must pump petrol a bit after CNG later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Then idea came to mind, SPC Devonshire nearby, ask her pay for my petrol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Then told pax u pay for my petrol use company card, then i give u receipt you claim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Then think, eh how to pump if pump same as fare then end up she get discount, i dont know how much SPC discount, so dont know how much to pump.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Told pax i pump $25, if after discount it's more i give u change and if less take it as i give u discount.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Then go pump, i go pee she go pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    She told showed me receipt total after discount $23.75, she said nevermind just write the receipt as $23.75, since she will be claiming $23.75 anyways and she already wasted a lot of my time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    I said ok lor, at SPC also got one Wish behind me, while i writing receipt he horn horn at me. KNN, i just finish pump petrol u horn for F!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Drop pax at 313, she asked me for my phone number. I gave her my card. I think she scared later her company ask why claim petrol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>    Is what i do ok in such situation? Although wasted 1hr, if thought of she pay for petrol earlier, wouldn't have wasted that much time.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br> She totally no cash, thats the thing... All card.. And also she needs receipt cos she die die want to claim..</p>
              <p>Cos that trip was work related, go buy something for today company event, using company card.</p>
              <p>Would have ask her transfer money to me, but her bank also not enough money.. Can only transfer when get pay, but she need original receipt first..</p>
              <p>Best thing she stay near Somerset area, so not HDB rental flat..

              <p>cyben i understand ur fustrations</p>
              <p>but hor cant really blame the pax leh….never accept amex, but
              pax also gives u credit card leh right.. just that bo signal
              ma…</p>
              <p>so all you can blame is TC, the lousy cashless terminal signal
              connections..</p>
              <p>imagines now the role changes, u the pax, i am the cab driver…
              reach destination but my cashless terminal failed… u angry
              anot????</p>
              <p>lucky the pax is a lady n is new to singapore…. give her few
              more mths… she will behave like any singaporean.. complain here n
              there liao…</p>
              <p>she can simply walk away as it is that she wants to pay but u
              cant accept, plua you are wasting her time instead not the other
              way round…</p>
              <p>or she k simply trf the money to ur bank acct when she feels is
              convinenced</p>

              <p>Let me share a few stories .</p>
              <p>Last year .... a few months after Khoon joined Lake View .</p>
              <p>He kena an accident at Portsdown road ..... junction of Queensway .</p>
              <p>His handphone besides low batt .... camera also not working .</p>
              <p>In any accident case , taking pictures is a must .</p>
              <p>He immediately SOS from talkie ..... </p>
              <p>I was at Benoi Road when he SOS .</p>
              <p>His mentor flew in from Toa Payoh .</p>
              <p>LV126 went over to help .</p>
              <p>I rush from Benoi Road in 10 minutes .</p>
              <p>Using my Galaxy tab to photo those damages , photo that China driver driving license and Work Permit .... on the spot , i email those photos into Khoon's gmail account .</p>
              <p>Imagine what if Khoon never joined Lake View and no walkie talkie to SOS ?</p>
              <p>No doubt taxi companies will give support , but how far taxi companies can do ?</p>
              <p>Better than what we can help Khoon ?</p>
              <p>Did Khoon pay a Premium for this type of SOS ?</p>
              <p>No lah , just $3 a day .</p>
              <p>One call finished the story .</p>

              <p>Safely .</p>
              <p>Did the pax paid me ? Yes of course , and paid me more than the amount . Does he paid for my friend ? Yes he did , more than the amount again before he left for my cab .</p>
              <p>He cannot believe how fast we reacted to such SOS , and he was impressed ! </p>
              <p>He cannot imagine SOS came so rapidly .</p>
              <p>He mentioned it was a facinating experience , despite the accident .</p>
