              <p>
              </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>Confession pages on facebook are now the rage. Here's STOMP's choice of the confession of the day.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In today's featured confession, an NUS law student speaks up about the injustices her father has to face for taking up a job as a taxi driver to support the family -- a job deemed less respectable in society.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"When I was younger, my dad had a good career that paid him well (a job that pays you more than 10k a month now), until an economic turmoil many years back.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Now he works around the same position, many would say "wow" to, but not many actually know he's underpaid. Most of the jobs are taken by expats. He earns 4k a month adnw works thrice a week.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Therefore, besides his current job, he also works as a taxi driver.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"This is because all his four children are pursuing bachelor degrees and master degrees. His children do work part time but he always wants the best for the family.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Last night, my sister and I needed his help in delivering a big heavy parcel to a friend's place. After delivering the parcel, I told my dad that he can drop us there and continue fetching other passengers since there were a number of people flagging for taxis at the roadside.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"He however, insisted on taking us home. We then saw two men flagging for a cab and I told my father to drop us there and take them instead.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"My dad didn't want to let us travel home on our own so he asked the men if they were okay with paying for the fare still. They agreed and boarded his cab.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"On the way back, the man kept asking my dad about my sister and I even after my dad answered that we are his daughters.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"The man then made remarks and asked questions like "your daughters from which kind?", "from where, China or Vietnam?" and "how much?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"I don't know how many people can understand how disrespectful he was to my father. It made my dad annoyed but he tried not fuel the tension so he kept quiet.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"The man kept on pushing things further and said my dad was rude as he did not answer his questions. My dad said he was being disrespectful and the man got angry and said he will lodge a complaint.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"He then made my dad drive to insignificant places like Sungei Kadut and wasted time waiting. We were not even sure why he stopped to wait, he just made us stop and swayed his head like a drunken man. It was scary.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"When we arrived at his place he gave $10 out of the $25 fare and walked away, and said my dad should feel lucky that he even received his money&gt; He went on to say that he will also lodge a complaint.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"My dad tried to compromise regarding the fare but he was hot headed and therefore my dad had to call the police. </strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"The man asked the police to arrest my dad for causing embarrassment for fear that he might be seen by his neighbours and also for wasting his time (wasting his time? He would probably have wasted more time trying to find a cab earlier). </strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"The policemen obviously didn't arrest my dad and after he left, the policemen told my dad that he didn't have to worry as he's not in the wrong.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"But how could he do this when before boarding his cab he had agreed to pay the fare?</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Amidst all of that, my biggest regret is how I read law in school, and am trained in NUS to speak up, and argue your way through many things, but yet I did not defend my dad.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"I did not utter a word to the guy, to tell him that his words didn't just strike anger but hurt that can never be healed and it can only be placed behind us as we move on in life.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"I'm sorry that I had troubled my dad, but I was even more sorry that my dad had to experience such awful things in life.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"I'm well respected for being in a local university, with a bright future and all sorts. But how can I ever more justify that my dad deserves more respect for nurturing me, for bringing me up, that he's the hero? It is of my sad realization that there seems to be no longer hope for a moral change in Singaporeans.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"It will only get worse from here and though initially, I thought of staying and fighting for the welfare of Singaporeans, the impending social turmoil already exists amongst Singaporeans and perhaps the only way to reverse everything is the presence of world war 3 to teach everyone to be more grateful for everything in Singapore.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Gratitude, is it so hard to give? Schoolmates, leaders of tomorrow:</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"1) While you are customers, bear in mind how we should still treat others the way we'd like to be treated. Please give taxi drivers what they earn. You can complain about how taxi fares are so expensive and such. But you have a choice not to take them. And you should know that taxi drivers do not absorb that extra fare raise. Our government takes them.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"2) Men, please watch your words and stop objectifying women. You wouldn't like other men objectifying or label your sisters, daughters or wives as sluts.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"3) Stop treating people based on the stigma the society place on some jobs. Being a taxi driver (or a plumber etc) is an honourable and well respected job in the western countries. My dad is a graduate, things didn't turn out well for him so he had to juggle 2 jobs to "live comfortably". He's not begging for money, he's trying to earn money in exchange for his service. Driving long hours IS tiring.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"4) Even bankers have a lot of things they have yet to learn, just because someone is a taxi driver that doesn't mean he knows every road in Singapore. If he does, you should be ashamed cause it only shows how much smarter he is to remember all the roads than you can. If you complain about how taxi drivers "take the long way", please let them know your preferred way early. While you think being a taxi driver is so "low class", think about how many different kind of people they experience every day in their lives. It's a take away that many people will not experience in their lifetime. All your drunkenness, conversations and actions have all been witnessed by many taxi drivers.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"My dad is an honourable man who lives by the virtue "live with what you earn and not by what you can get". Thus he works hard.</strong></p>
              <p><strong style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Help your fellow Singaporeans by being nice. I don't have a fantastic GPA. But this is the experience that has made me a thousand times more resilient, and it will be something I'll treasure for the rest of my life."</strong></p>

              it is no wonder that man has ask such a question while on board
              
              coming into a industries or trade must have knowledge about it and many unnecessary
              
              can be avoided.
              
              maybe it is better not to defend and stay quite, maybe the boy should defend his father
              
              but do we know what will happen?
              
              if the td is driving a cdg vehicle, than wost thing may happen, i.e ternination

              <p>What is warming is that his daughter did put it in a way of asking peoples to respect TDs, it is thru this experiences that she saw her own father get insulted and still have to beg for a fare which is actually not necessary.</p>

              <p>What is warming is that his daughter did put it in a way of

              <p>On the other hand, my lor sor instinct tell me, that you never truly understand what is rules, basically speaking, who created the rules? Human right? secondly, let me just ask you one more question, if every cars including TD, lorry, bus and so on. on the road followed rules strictly, do you think the traffic will be smooth, and thirdly, since you are a NSmen and served the SAF before, you know the COC 7th rule of do anything you like, just dun get caught. This apply to our daily life. Or dun tell me you are like me, just Serve And Forget?</p>
