              <p>My location only got taiko hirers, or those with ECA, ie take black car for personal business errands only. Good sampan hirers yes, but very few to zero mercedes or chrysler or maxi hirers. I was forced to OMO, turned out to be the best decision. No more relief driving for me. OMO works best for me.</p>

              <p>Unless you are a full time relief with your hirer, he being day shift and you being night and all of the sudden during NY or christmas Eve he asked you to take a rest, then that is very uncall for, but if you are a partimer or super relief driver like me who even drive casket van at time and got a job with bonus, CPF and other allowances, you should balance the opportunity profit and understand TD livinghood, those huat days dun make a TD a rich man, but at least help them to tight thru and enjoy some fruit with their family.</p>
              <p>As for news of govt helping, the latest is those who are 40s and above, you can get an application form from CC to fill up, any singaporeans above 40s with a per capital of $1500 and below, can now get a big discount at most clinic in singapore.</p>
              <p>Per capital meaning if your household income is $5000 per mth, but you got a wife and 2 kids, so per person is $1250, then you and your wife qualify to a lower medical cost if both are 40s and above.</p>

              <p>Frankly, not being racist or making remark on any race, I find Malay hirer very easy going, as a super relief, I see most, but not all, are good hirer, they take care of their relief and never make a issue out of small problem like a few mintues lates, or fuel meter goes down faster than normal, or mats not clean..so on. And when you discuss with them on timing,or that you are unable to drive or you want to drive at this period, that time, they are open to listen and understanding.</p>
              <p>I got this malay hirer who use to call me for hari raya, haji or when he goes on holidays and so on, our understanding and friendship had come to an extend of visiting each other family, hari raya, I will bring my family to visit his home and CNY, he will visit me, each with gift and ang bao,  our wifes also know each other very well, my son once even give math tuition to his kids, and when come to driving, we do our part and alway have a good chat before driving off before changing shift or taking over. And because of good networking, if his friends who are also cabby need relief, he will call me. The only thing they do not allow in the cab, is dog, which is actually not allowed by the rule</p>
              <p>I believe that hirer and relief relationship need to be build, nurture and bring the best out of it, but somehow, many start good and end negatively. For that, I leave the last quote that this malay buddy of my left behind "There are tons of money in Singapore, as a TD,  how much can you scope?"</p>

This ang mo pax from ardmore residence, had a big dog who wants to take my maxi for airport departure, but owner not bringing him along. So dog jump inside rear compartment together with the luggage n refused to get out. By the time the family dragged out the white dog, it had shedded much white hair. Very hard to remove white dog hair from the carpet n fabric seats. So from now on, I also dun allow dogs. After one month, i can still find white dog hair in my cab.</p></div>
