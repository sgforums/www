              <div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is an integrated resort (IR) with a
                  hotel, casino, retail mall, convention facilities and entertainment
                  venues including theatres, a museum and nightclubs. Sitting on a
                  570,000m<sup>2</sup> waterfront site at Marina Bay, MBS is operated
                  by Las Vegas Sands (LVS) Corp. and has been one of the company’s
                  most profitable properties since its opening in April 2010. MBS’s
                  distinctive architecture includes three 55-storey hotel towers
                  topped by a 12,400m<sup>2</sup> SkyPark and the lotus flower-shaped
                  ArtScience Museum.<br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br> Background</span></strong><br> In March 2004, the government raised the prospect of the
                  longstanding ban on casinos being lifted as part of a resort
                  development plan for <a rel="nofollow" href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_247_2005-01-20.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Sentosa</span></span></a> and the Southern
                  Islands. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) then carried out
                  a study on the economic, tourism and social aspects of having a
                  casino within an IR, while the Feedback Unit (now REACH) held
                  dialogue sessions with public groups including those from the
                  religious, grassroots and business communities.<br> <br> Amid much public debate, the government through the Singapore
                  Tourism Board invited concept proposals for IRs at Marina Bay and
                  Sentosa in December 2004. These IRs would include casinos, with
                  restrictions including entry fees for Singaporeans (S$100 per visit
                  or S$2,000 per annum), curbs on advertising and regulations on
                  credit extended by the casinos.<br> <br> The casino component of the IRs was debated in parliament in
                  January 2005 and by March, consortiums from the United States,
                  South Africa, Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong had submitted
                  concept proposals for the Marina Bay IR, with the highest bid
                  coming in at S$5.8 billion. The following month, the government
                  confirmed in parliament that two IRs with casinos would be
                  built.<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shortlist and
                  award of Marina Bay IR<br></span></strong>In November 2005, the
                  government set the price of the Marina Bay site at S$1.2 billion
                  instead of calling for an open tender. This allowed the bidders to
                  compete on the strength of their concept proposals. The government
                  also announced the judging criteria for the bids: tourism appeal
                  (40%), architectural concept and design (30%), development
                  investment (20%) and track record of the operator (10%). The
                  winning bidder would have a 60-year land tenure and a 30-year
                  concession for the casino (with a 10-year exclusivity period) with
                  its gaming area capped at 15,000m<sup>2</sup>.<br> <br> The proposals were whittled to a shortlist of four formal bidders:
                  Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Harrah’s Entertainment partnered by Keppel
                  Land, Genting International partnered by Star Cruises, MGM Mirage
                  partnered by CapitaLand. LVS had been partnered in its bid by
                  Singapore property developer <a rel="nofollow" href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1760_2011-02-01.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">City Developments Limited</span></span></a> (CDL), but CDL later withdrew citing the invasiveness of probity
                  checks.<br> <br> In May 2006, LVS was awarded the rights for the Marina Bay site.
                  Its proposal had the highest investment value of S$3.85 billion, in
                  addition to the land cost of S$1.2 billion. LVS’ strength in the
                  meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions sector as well as
                  the distinctive design elements of its proposed architecture were
                  cited as key factors in its winning bid. Analysts had previously
                  ranked LVS behind the other bidders, in part due to its lack of a
                  local partner.<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Development<br></span></strong>Construction
                  began soon after the award of the project, now named Marina Bay
                  Sands (MBS). In 2008 however, LVS was reported to be in financial
                  trouble. A global economic and financial crisis had hit its
                  businesses and affected its ability to raise financing for its
                  projects. Its share price fell more than 90% from peak levels and
                  the corporation was reportedly close to bankruptcy a number of
                  times.<br> <br> In November 2008, LVS chairman and chief executive Sheldon Adelson
                  flew to Singapore to meet government officials and reaffirm LVS’s
                  commitment to the MBS project. LVS then suspended developmental
                  work on projects in Las Vegas and Macau to concentrate its
                  financial resources on MBS. It also raised S$3.2 billion through a
                  stock offering, with Adelson putting in more than US$1 billion of
                  his own money, and put in a successful request to the government to
                  open MBS in stages.<br> <br> The project continued to suffer construction delays, which were
                  attributed to high prices of concrete after an embargo on sand
                  exports by regional countries and the bankruptcy of a number of
                  sub-contractors. Heavy rainfall and labour shortages also
                  contributed to the delays and the escalated cost of the project,
                  which was now at S$7.7 billion. In December 2009 however, LVS
                  announced that MBS would open on a phased basis and commence
                  operations in April 2010.<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Layout and
                  design<br></span></strong>On a gross floor area of
                  570,000m<sup>2</sup>, MBS houses 2,600 hotel rooms across three
                  55-storey towers, and three low-rise domes which contain a retail
                  mall with over 300 boutiques, convention facilities for up to
                  45,000 people, fine-dining restaurants and casual eateries, two
                  theatres that seat 2,000 each, an indoor skating rink and a casino.
                  The casino holds 600 gaming tables (with a potential capacity of
                  1,000 tables) and 1,500 gaming machines. The resort also includes
                  an ArtScience Museum, waterfront pavilions housing retail boutiques
                  and nightclubs, and other outdoor event facilities.<br> <br> Designed by Canadian architect Moshe Safdie, MBS’s most distinctive
                  elements are its hotel towers topped by a 12,400m<sup>2</sup>, 6.3
                  million kilogramme cantilevered SkyPark, which includes an
                  observation deck, restaurants, nightclubs, a swimming pool and
                  gardens. The ArtScience Museum is shaped like a lotus flower, while
                  the low-rise domes feature wave-form roofs. Safdie also integrated
                  around S$50 million worth of art installations within his design
                  for the resort.<br> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operations<br></span></strong>MBS
                  began operations on 27 April 2010 with a phased opening, and
                  officially opened on 23 June. In its first full quarter, MBS made a
                  pre-tax profit of S$315 million on revenues of S$631 million, and
                  these figures rose to S$390 million in pre-tax profit and revenue
                  of S$560.4 million in the following quarter. The figures broke LVS’
                  records for quarterly profit and profit margin, and made MBS one of
                  the most profitable properties in the LVS group. During its first
                  year of operations, MBS drew 19.6 million visitors and hosted
                  nearly 2,000 meetings, conventions and exhibitions.<br> <br> <br> <br> <strong>Author<br></strong>Alvin Chua</p>

              <p>For those who are confused about the exclusive rights.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva; font-size: small; line-height: 22px;">One of the biggest questions out there right now is whether Singapore will ever allow more IRs (casinos) to be built. The exclusivity periods provided for the first IRs operators (MBS and RWS), in theory, end in 2015 and 2016 respectively.</span></p>

              <div style="margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%; font-size: 10pt;">On August 23, 2006, MBS entered into the Development Agreement with the STB to design, develop, construct and operate an integrated resort in Singapore called Marina Bay Sands. The Development Agreement includes a concession for MBS to own and operate a casino within the integrated resort. In addition to the casino, the integrated resort will include, among other amenities, a hotel, a retail complex, a convention center and meeting room complex, theaters, restaurants and an art/science museum. MBS expects the Development Agreement will be amended to reflect an agreement between MBS and the STB once approval is obtained on the final design plans of the integrated resort. MBS is one of two companies that has been awarded a concession to operate a casino in Singapore. Under the Development Agreement, the STB has provided a ten-year exclusive period <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(the “Exclusivity Period,” which began January 29, 2009)</strong></span> during which only two licensees will be granted the right to operate a casino in Singapore. In connection with entering into the Development Agreement, MBS entered into a 60-year lease with the STB for the parcels underlying the project site and entered into an agreement with the Land Transport Authority of Singapore for the provision of necessary infrastructure for rapid transit systems and road works within and/or outside the project site.</div>

              <p style="border: 0px; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #666666; text-align: -webkit-auto;">“I’m dying to go to Singapore,” Wynn told Singapore’s Business Times in an interview. “That’s my next goal in life — to build a hotel in Singapore.”</p>

Genting Singapore’s Resorts World at Sentosa opened in February last year, while Las Vegas Sands’ Marina Bay Sands started operations in April.</p>

              <p>Casinos or the next IR resort is inevitable, this is not new, it had been floating among peoples in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The directives of govt is to go into high tech and high service industry, high tech meaning you need higher skill and competence people, so far those who have not been upgrading all these years, they will face structural unemployement, meaning, got job but you cannot do it due to lack of skill or qualification to do it. This inbalance will result in influx of so called FT into our city to make up the shortage, low industrial like making pen, shoes, food, paint or shampoo is going to be factory of yesterday, in fact, now you hardly see them.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is imperatives for Singaporeans who are looking for job could end up with no job in a tight labour market situation as Singapore. end up most took up TD or security guards, there are insitution that can help one to upgrade, train and place, skill development, and one of them is e2i, purely for singaporean, so is learning Hub which provide WSQ certification, Working Skill Qualification that allow you to take up a higher skill and higher paid job.</p>
              <p>Opening of casino is not a problem, we already got experience people within, unlike the first time, but to train the peoples is a task, because most Singaporeans do not to go back to school, even with per hour pay, not much is forthcoming.</p>
