              Many has been trying to say ..... OMO those efforts and money earned must be justifiable .
              
              Many at a later stage , realized ...... "knn my friend got relief earned more than i earned ."
              
              "Working time shorter than mine ."

              <p>Meant for solo and be able to persevere and to slog it out.</p>
              <p>Meant for solo that can be very independent and keep on polishing and reflects.</p>
              <p>Meant for solo that don't fxxk around and don't like to be a boss around.</p>
              <p>Good thing is you can start at 7am - go break and sayang your homeboss at noon time and OTR until 7 pm or 8 pm and pack up go home again.</p>
              <p>Very good life right?</p>
              <p>But need to emphasize again for newbie.  Heed and listen to Pool and the team advise not to OMO.  Read those Post of those OMO that give up OMO.</p>
              <p>I am not selfish to prevent newbie from OMO but once you try you will know. READ Khoon's Blog.</p>
              <p>Once you go through the OMO process than things will slowly start to creep in. If you started OMO during good economy time is a very different scenario from starting during bad economy time.</p>
              <p>By the way, i survive from newbie till now ( to date) being OMO - no regret becos i know what to do during lull time, during bad time, where and when to make it up.</p>
              <p>My Wishes is to "super-relief" one of this day - suka suka take job. Don't like the bugger don't super relief for him.  No "super-relief" job never mind.  Take my bicycle ride round the island lor.</p>

              <p>I believe there are choices in life, just a matter of how many choices, in TD, you hv OMO, relief and super relief, so to take up which one is all depend on your lifestyle, your family needs, age and your strong and weak point of working/driving, some like to idle, some really hard working.</p>
              <p>Generally, to go OMO, you need to choose a lower and yet efficiency vehicle to go along, and I would say OMO for Transcab Wish is the way to go, but then for those who are younger and still energetic, whatever comes along, as long as they can make it, why not? There is another reason for OMO for driver who had working wife and school going kids to pick or send, so for that matter, it cover his family expenses for transportation, which can be taken into account. They are the main actor.</p>
              <p>Relief is more for people who like to maximise profit within a shorter hours, more free time and perhap a constant timming working hrs, unlike OMO, which is flexible. It therefore takes into account to forgo certain perks given by the companies, and also not in real control of a job. It is ok if you manage to pick a timming that suit you and make money out of it, but it may change overnite, for that, a relief must alway be prepare. They are the co actor</p>
              <p>Super relief is more for people who looking for lower rental than the norm to churn a better profit out of norm in the shortest possible period, he certainly can create his own freedom and timming, but if he have to search and find the right combination of timming and hirer to get a good deal out of it. Super relief tends to lead idle mentality if not proper disciplined, because in any human, given freedom, laziness may set in. They are more like supporting actor.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Wish must take 1.8 ok? Every month 665. But fuck lah. Lousy workshop. No call. Pump gas/petrol. Where got time? CDG best lah. MDT ding ding go where also no scare. I take less time and effort to earn same amount with high overheads. But count back only rental high but compensate back with low fuel cost, no down time in pumping/going empty pump gas. Lost time empty cab to town if kanna ulu places. Lol</p></div>

              <p>Split shift waste of time? I can go home after AM peak 10am at home song song on air con do own things, watch TV, sleep, bid job. Happy happy come out 5-6pm drive another few hours to 9-10pm. No need slog under hot sun driving with NO EXTRA and have to compete with day shift YAO GUIs for pax. Also no need do midnight stunts like empty cab back to town and queue for pax or snatching pax from night YAO GUIs. Like that call waste of time?</p>
              <p>Please lah if driving taxi you cannot afford to throw 1-2 weeks rental then might as well go back to work. What happen if fall sick? Also need to throw right? What if got family emergencies? Also need to throw right? Then cannot afford throw rental how? If sick 3 days how? 4th days must come out 4 days rental. Can drive 4 days rentals in a day just after recover? We need back up right? Go holiday if throw rental then next few weekend earn back slowly loh. What's the big deal?</p>
              <p>And dun forget OMO can have the <strong>convenience of a vehicle at your disposal</strong>. Dun come tell me half shift earn more then full shift. Ok if the half shift relief earn more then the OMO but if the relief go buy a car in the end who nett earning more? Must consider this factor also what.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Last time I work pay more then TD but after I pay for car end up nett less. And my car last time is cheaper then now(2008). And work for others I stress. Not as happy as now/ Even now I work pay is almost double as what I earn as a TD but still I hang on driving part time. Why? Because overall it is still cheaper then buying a car.

              <p>When to OMO?</p>
              <p>- You need a car to do other stuff that have a fixed schedule (ferry loved ones for medical, run errands)</p>
              <p>- You drive Taxi just to earn 'pocket money'</p>
              <p>- You are so dedicated to driving that you dont need to have 'off days'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When NOT to OMO ?</p>
              <p>-  You have a tendency to 'park' the taxi</p>
              <p>-  You cannot do split shift (unable to rest in between)</p>
              <p>-  You cannot drive long hours (old or medical problem)</p>
              <p>-  You cannot accept the fact that Reliefs takes 2 hrs to break even, whereas you take 5 hrs.</p>
              <p>-  You have a lot of 'other things' to do</p>
              <p>-  You want to spend more time with your loved ones (your pet dog?)</p>
