              <p>Well, that is very true. I can never get use to taking bus. Though only been driving for 3 years, tried being a relief, being a hirer with relief and OMO. OMO is still better for me. Less problems. Don't need everyday wash car, don't need rush for time. Suka suka what time want to drive also can. Pro and cons lah. <strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>There's always this problem pumping "diesel"</strong>, when I was a relief hirer always say I pump not enough. End up after pumping at coy I drive to the nearest kiosk to pump till the brim but still say I pump not enough. Don't know why when OMO my diesel usage is always lower. With relief is always higher, 4 to 5 litres diff.</p>
              <p>Now looking for relief for 6am to 1pm. Can find got at least $25 more to my daily income. Cannot also nevermind. Think too much, Everything also cannot do.</p>

              <p><br> Super doesnt come easily, if got, also lugi quite a bit for rental.
              For throwing rental, let's say if going for 1 week holiday, r u
              going to give 7 days' rental to taxi company? That $$ aint
              cheap..</p>
              <p>Compare driving 12 hrs (1/2 rental) to 12 hrs (full rental),
              it's no brainer which shift can earn more. But if ur talking bout
              split shift driving for OMO, time is wasted on in between rest (
              Either u go home zz or do ur own stuff for that period).</p>
              <p>As for weekend, no doubt few hrs can cover rental or maybe
              diesel cost as well. But ur driving for free just to pay

              <p>For me no diff on income, same driving hrs. everyweek one day off. My MDT not on steroid. Though sometime lots of ping but weekly i only take 3 to 4 calls.</p>
              <p>Night shift: Mon;Tue;Thur;Sun. After midnight not easy to find pax, it's all waiting game, like fishing.</p>
              <p>Day shift: also certain timing pax not easy to come by but know all the Hotspots then all will be easy. Better than night.</p>
              <p>Friday, Sat and eve of Public Holidays confirm night but still need to drive smart.</p>

              Though only been driving for 3 years, tried being a relief, being a
              hirer with relief and OMO. OMO is still better for me. Less
              problems. Don't need everyday wash car, don't need rush for time.
              Suka suka what time want to drive also can. Pro and cons lah.</p>
              <p><strong>There's always this problem pumping "diesel"</strong>,
              when I was a relief hirer always say I pump not enough. End up
              after pumping at coy I drive to the nearest kiosk to pump till the
              brim but still say I pump not enough. Don't know why when OMO my
              diesel usage is always lower. With relief is always higher, 4 to 5
              litres diff.</p>
              <p>Now looking for relief for 6am to 1pm. Can find got at least $25
              more to my daily income. Cannot also nevermind. Think too much,
              Everything also cannot do.</p>
              </div>

              <p>I am lucky to have a nice hirer to start off with. Malay chap very chin chai one. Diesel no problem he says just pump 1st click auto stop can liao. But only drive for him less then 2 months get my own Wish liao.</p>
              <p>Ya very good no need everyday wash car. Sometimes 1 week never wash just use garden hose spray away the dust/bird shit can liao. Lol</p>

              <p>Split shift waste of time? I can go home after AM peak 10am at home song song on air con do own things, watch TV, sleep, bid job.

              <p>Please lah if driving taxi you cannot afford to throw 1-2 weeks rental then might as well go back to work. What happen if fall sick? Also need to throw right? What if got family emergencies? Also need to throw right? Then cannot afford throw rental how? If sick 3 days how? 4th days must come out 4 days rental. Can drive 4 days rentals in a day just after recover? We need back up right? Go holiday if throw rental then next few weekend earn back slowly loh. What's the big deal?</p>
              <p>And dun forget OMO can have the <strong>convenience of a vehicle at your disposal</strong>. Dun come tell me half shift earn more then full shift. Ok if the half shift relief earn more then the OMO but if the relief go buy a car in the end who nett earning more? Must consider this factor also what.</p>

              <p>Split shift style is something like waking up start to drive, sleep in between then wake up again to drive, definitely time is wasted in between. Unless you use the cab for ur personal disposal, then maybe its ok.</p>
              <p>For throwing 1 or 2 weeks' rental, i think its silly &amp; not worth it. Why slave for the company &amp; parting with own hard earned $$ for nothing? For me, i admit i can't afford to do that.</p>
              <p>Yes OMO can have the convenience of a vehicle at your disposal. For OMO wanabe, can take that into consideration. As for earning between 1/2 or full shift, its up to individual's earning capability. 1/2 shift driving can give more quality personal or family time which full shift can't.</p>

              <p>For me no diff on income, same driving hrs. everyweek one day off. My MDT not on steroid. Though sometime lots of ping but weekly i only take 3 to 4 calls.</p>
              <p>Night shift: Mon;Tue;Thur;Sun. After midnight not easy to find pax, it's all waiting game, like fishing.</p>
              <p>Day shift: also certain timing pax not easy to come by but know all the Hotspots then all will be easy. Better than night.</p>
              <p>Friday, Sat and eve of Public Holidays confirm night but still need to drive smart.</p>
              <p>When I started, everywhere I go. Rubbish truck. Anything take. Slowly u learn your trade.</p>
              <p>Advise to newbies, don't OMO. Learn first.</p>
              <p>One newbie form CityCab ever call me. Drive 6am to 11pm. Income worst then half shift.</p>
              <p>When was new as a relief income was half of now as OMO.</p>
              <p>Pay $50 to $55 to learn instead of $100; $104 or $115</p>
