              <p>Not sure about now. Last time average  for FASTEST time to get yout TDVL is about 12 weeks, but it could be done in 8 wks (trust me I did it)</p>
              <p>First it takes 4 weeks after the first time you apply to LTA before you get the prov letter. LTA did mean it when they say it takes 3~4 weeks processing, they will take their own sweet time. :(</p>
              <p>With the letter then you can register with SMRT or CDG for their courses. It may take a couple of weeks before they call for initial briefing. Just tell your grandmother story and try to get to that week briefing. At this briefing you will be given your pasword to the online course.</p>
              <p>Finish the online course within one day and register for excursion. Again the next available excursion may be 2 weeks away, call them up and tell another grandfather story to join the same week excursion.</p>
              <p>After excursion you can book the exam time. Then you will get your TDVL in about 2-3weeks after passing the exam.</p>
              <p>Good luck!!</p>

              timing for express course ... 3pm to 6pm and 7pm to 10pm
              duration : 3 weeks (mon to sat)
              you will take the exams immediately after the 3 weeks course with one day break. my course ended on a wed, friday I took the test.
              for express course, you can sign up with SMRT, Comfort or STA (Singapore Taxi Academy). Normally SMRT and comfort will advertised in Straits Times and just go down to the various locations to sign up. SMRT and comfort will provide benefits for people who sign up with them on the express course and subsequently sign up with them as Taxi Drivers. But then, signing up with them with the express course does not mean you need to sign up with them after you passout from the taxi course. Some of my classmates sign up with STA direct; but anyway taxi companies (Not all) will reimburse the taxi course fees if you sign up with them as a taxi driver. 
              
              Forget abt the online course, is better to attend a classroom course...why ? you gets tips from the trainers. Also, it is very interesting and the trainer always crack Taxi jokes. In fact, I always looked forward to the classes and have never skip a single session.

              Technically speaking...super express course 3 weeks. If you pass, 2 days to inform you the results, 7 days to process the TVL. Therefore, slightly more than a month to get the Taxi Licience. 
              
              For me, I signed up with SMRT on 11 March
              My first session starts on 21 March
              Course completes on 6 April
              Exam on 8 April
              On 11 April, I got a call to say I pass with test
              21 April - Can get my TVL.
              So overall, 5 weeks plus I got my licience.
              
              Remember you need LTA approval prior to the start of the course. LTA takes approximate one month to approve. SMRT is kind enough to let me start the express course without approval from LTA. My approval date from LTA is on 4 April.
              Comfort on the other hand need you to have an approval from LTA before they sign you up with the express course. 
              
              There fore, if you go thru normal procedure.
              i think it will take 3 months to get the TVL provided you pass the first time.

            <div class='col-md body'>
              Another impt point...
              if you have criminal records or kenna charged with CBT, LTA may not approve you to be a taxi driver. Therefore if you sign up with SMRT before getting LTA approval, you may end up spending $400 plus and lan lan waste your time attending the 3 weeks course then later find out you cannot take the exam. They will not refund you the course fee. You are not allowed to take the exam without LTA approval. Also, you need to pass a medical test prior to the exam. 
              
              To be safe, pass the medical test first and get approval from LTA before paying for the course fee...Not cheap hor...course fee $400 plus

              <p>Yup, I did the same.  Did the online test while cross referencing the manual at the same time.  For me, the entire process from applying for LTA's approval to having the license in my hand is about 3 months, if I remember correctly.</p>

              If not working, take express course.
              If working, take normal classroom course, I think lesson starts 7pm.
              Online course...I dun encourage.
              Trainers are experience taxi drivers n lta officers.
              U would gain much from them.
              One example, street directory.
              I thought I know how to use ,until they give me more insights into using one...
              
              I think the shortest possible time to get a taxi licence is to enrol for super express course...good luck.
