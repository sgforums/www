              <p>I dun have such problems ....</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>
              <p>Cos i am a defensive driver , are you ?</p>
              <p>If i am at a "go straight lane " like you say ..... and if left lane meant to turn left , i for one , expect some kayu driver , whether or not they will do it , to cut in .</p>
              <p>If they signal their intention , good , be it a civilian driver , or taxi driver , i will let them go thru .</p>
              <p>Good driver or not ... depends on how defensive their driving skills , not how fast they go .</p>
              <p>Good driver or not , not all the time depends on how well you control your steering , it's how good your ROAD SENSE .</p>
              <p>Do you have it ?</p>

              what a difference in my thinking between now and a few days ago before i start driving super relief. 
              
              this what my hirer told me, it is not what accidents will happen, it is only when. if accidents will happen, they will still happen whether one driver is defensive, or both drivers are defensive. so long there suddenly appear another driver from somewhere, which the first 2 drivers cannot see, cannot hear, cannot sense, and dont practise safe or defensive driving.
              
              on the day of reporting, we met a old timer taxi driver who banged into 1 private car from behind at a red traffic light. that private car then banged into another private car in its front. but end up its that front most driver who got serious concussion because he was leaning forward slightly looking into the mirror because he was thinking he already stopped at the red light and the car behind him also stopped, so did all the others cars (that he can see) around them. that taxi driver told me he felt bad because the last he knew that front most driver is a young man who now carries a scar across his face, is still having migraine, seeing doctor and taking medication.
              
              my hirer made a bad joke, if your time is up, your time is up, no matter how many condoms you wear

              <p>Yes, you can sense that the driver in the lane along side you want to change lane, even when there is no signal,  by seeing his vehicle movements.</p>
