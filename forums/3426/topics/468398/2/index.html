              <p>This can be consider as manslaughter, if that dead man's family is rich and get a good lawyer, I think the case will be different.</p>
              <p>What transpired here is still very much political and laws mixture, you notice that anything involved Ah tiong or foreigners so to speak, the sentence will be greatly reduced, offender admitted and case quickly closed.</p>
              <p>If it was Singaporeans, big news lor, some end up with no trial and spent the rest of life in prison. This is a direct unbalance weight of laws as per se.</p>
              <p>With lighter sentences, it only encourage more foreigners to commit offence and take us for granted</p>

              <p>It is not a complain, we all are taxpayers paying the judiciary to take care of our laws and orders of this country, the AG is seeking for an apology, of course force apology can alway be given, Ok, I am truly sorry..</p>
              <p>With the Singaporean first motto that govt will listen to our view constructively and work toward Singaporean benefits and gain, and now they are seeking for an apology just because of comments that something need to do better than what had sentenced.</p>
              <p>The AG should therefore hold meeting with the judge involved and see what improvement in near future they need to do, that is AG job, not asking people to apologise, the right person to seeking an apology is the judge who gave the sentencing, not the AG, he is paid to perform higher important task/job, not seeking apology on behalf of a judge.</p>
              <p>If you said that PRC guy is insane, then MOM must wake up their bloody idea of getting insane worker into our country??? are they going to improve the screening??</p>

              <p>Mr Bowah, judges do not give interviews or explanations to the press on why they sentence someone. That would be wrong because judges have sworn to judge cases on the facts presented to them and nothing else.</p>
              <p>They may take into consideration society's distatse for certain offences but they have to treat all offenders at the same starting point. Only when the facts of the case, the accused's plea of mitigation and the prosecution's request have all been presented can the judge make his decision.And finally previous guidelines issued by senior judges.</p>
              <p>He takes NO instruction and musnt be influenced by any other factors besides these. The correct procedure when either party disagrees with a sentence passed by a Sub Court judge is to launch an appeal to the High Court, who decision in the matter is final.</p>
              <p>Lay people like us may take certain views and want certain punishments, but we are neither qualified nor in possession of the facts to make that judgment.</p>
              <p>Rather we should not direct our anger at judges who are compelled by law to act in a certain manner (eg, the prosecution lays a lower charge, the judge cannot impose a higher penalty). We can criticise the AGC for preferring such charges or failing to consider other factors.</p>
              <p>To suggest a judge would show favour over a foreigner as opposed to a Singaporean is a grave allegation, it is wrong and entirely stupid.</p>
              <p>We have too many experts here who just blabber and make wild statements as if they know everything. (and I'm not referring to you)</p>

              <p>We certainly did not direct it to the judge, and for allegation, there are only a few, but as open as we are, aren't we given the right to just said something out of curiousity, just like Huh? take a taxi without permission, without license, drive and whack dead a person and yet destroy other property, and you just get 25 months at the expense of our taxpayer money?</p>
              <p>This is not an accident, this is an intention of a person knowing what he is doing out of his own anger that causes other people wife and children to suffer.</p>
              <p>The judge is sworn in to protect the laws and orders of Singapore, as such, laws and orders are passed by the bill in the parliament thru proposal and debating to approval by those Ministers and MP elected by the people.</p>
              <p>And since we cannot question the judge nor can we interfere anything because indirectly speaking, we approved the judge, so come the next election, we know what to do to change the judge</p>
