              <p>Ah you are back. Kind of miss u.</p>
              <p>Normal, very normal. Nowadays all like that. Too much taxi on the road. All super yao and I thought Hungry Ghost season over already. Nowadays nobody care to signal right or left. Last night at least 3 near miss. One was at chinatown after smith street, two sonatas waiting. Suddenly second car just turn out cos he saw people walking out 30 metres away. CB I had to E-brake and horn at the same time.</p>
              <p>Any idea we can modified our HORN? Nowadays need super loud horn. Thinking of fitting up fog horn.</p>

              <p>On The Road, there are all kind of people with difference issue, we as a Taxi Driver, living on the road, should not get affected by common issue, and must be able to live with it.</p>
              <p>That is road experience, when we day in day out we meet all this issue, and still did not learn to accept the existence and get agitated, you have not learn from experience, your experience is ZERO even 20 yrs of driving.</p>

              <p>Cant believe I encountered the same 'hungry taxi driver in 2 days'. Both at CQ.</p>
              <p>Friday pick pax going out of taxi stand this Citycab number 117, from 2nd lane from so far start high beam.</p>
              <p>High beam ar, ok lor, I go even slower. Best part he already got pax, high beam for fuck?</p>
              <p>In the end he turn into CQ hotel side lane, most prob to drop the pax, like that also wanna high beam. In a rush for what fark, I dunno. Not say got no pax.</p>
              <p>Then Sat night again at Clark Quay. Pax already hop in my cab, I moving out slowly, all 3 lanes jam, standard one at that hour. Then gues what I see this Citycab again, I already into 2nd lane going out, he going staright empty, mati mati dont want to let me out!</p>
              <p>I think what fuck, I got pax, want to fo, you empty trying to get pax, switch places la, no he die die wanna go on. So let him, but other vehicles also blocking, he desperately tryng to squeeze between lanes. Got 1 private car also trying to get out, he still wanna come, I dunno how they didnt hit each other.</p>
              <p>In the end he managed to do his interviews.</p>
              <p>So desperate, selfish. I think it's only a amtter of time, he'll get into an accident.</p>
              <p>I dont need to curse him or swear at him, this rate and this pattern, you know it's only a matter of time, he will get into an accident.</p>
              <p>Drive cab, yes must be daring, but you can still be conscious of whats yours and isn't yours. Also if you miss 1 pax, you can easily find another. Don't need to treat every pickup as a battle.</p>

              <p>I remember 1 time as a cop, I was waiting behind a cab at a red light. After the junction got pax waiting for cab. This after midnight. There was a cab coming from the other junction, if he right turn he will get the pax.</p>
              <p>Then what happen? This cab infront of me, beat the red light to pick up that pax. This was Middle Rd x Waterloo. Not busy.</p>
              <p>In my heart, I said wtf. I know taxi difficult to find pax, after midnight, but don't be like that lar. This one not yours, but the other driver's, he also trying to eke a living what.</p>
              <p>So what I do? On blinkers and stop him la. He sorry, sorry. I f him, Told the pax, to get down and take another cab, as this was gonna take very long. Pax took off in another cab.</p>
              <p>This driver - no chance. Summoned for beating red light.</p>
