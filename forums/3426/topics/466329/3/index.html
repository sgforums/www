So the best way to experience is to drive one first. He mixed with many people and  he listen to many stories. Like himself I also joined all the four operater except TC, Smrt and Yellow Top. So in the end I joined Smrt.  Only one thing he cannot changed is his football passion and badminton routine.</p></div>

              one is old bird experience which drive kim gu at a later stage
              
              one is totally new bird driving kim gu at the begining stage
              
              cannot compare
              
              there are indeed many new bird who start off driving kim gu end up throw key
              
              reason, don't have the understanding of driving kim gu
