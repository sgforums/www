            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is human nature. Some people are always negative in whatever they read or do. Some are positive. Most important is to open ur eyes and ears and see then u will know who is giving u right advise. I for one is amazed at how much effort is needed to maintain this forum, if the owner or moderator is not doing it to share his knowledge then what? I have followed this forum since I started taking my TDVL lessons. And I have always heard Poolman say that TC Wish is good cab to drive but he dislike the fish market and management. I personally have experienced how this forum has helped many just like taxi driving. I am sure most of u will have the IQ to tell what is right and what is wrong. Imagine many newbies going out to get Kim Gu to drive. U think u are doing this newbies a favor or are u trying to eliminating competition right away. Please remember these newbies are here driving taxi for one reason only, to make money to feed family. So give ur honest opinion and advise. </p></div>

              <p>Being relief very simple , vehicle spoilt inform hirer , as simple as that .</p>
              <p>At the least ..... vehicle spoilt down time no relief problems , very simple , hirer's problem .</p>
              <p>Having a working partner is important as well , when each one need to go for a decent holiday , partner can help cover up .</p>

              Many years back, after driving with Smrt abt 1 yr, I tot of trying kim guâ€¦At tat time they were pushing kim gu at quite good rate/benefits compared to old merc. I applied to upgrade from crownâ€¦later was call-up to collect kim guâ€¦But before tat I had a talk with their fleet guy...
                      
              
              He advised me exactly wat lao jiao says â€“ kim gu more for seasoned drivers, better to hv or willing to build own client base/kang taoâ€¦most hv to do OMO cos difficult to find reliefâ€¦good biz on Sun (bookings). More stress due to high rent/FCâ€¦then...tat time kim gu cannot q AP limo counter somore...advised me to consider carefully as some throw key after a short whileâ€¦ I changed my mind after tat, cos old liao ...cant tahan omo/stress n Sun cant drive much. They accepted my cancellation on the spot.

              <p>Currently there is one OMO forumer who wanted to go holiday ,

              <p>Sounds very nice.... very cool but u forgot one thing. Without hirer got relief?</p>

              <p>Without my power hirer , i will have a steering to peng?</p>
              <p>Instead , you should be encouraging a 2 driver system instead of an OMO . Either being a hirer with a relief or a relief attached to a hirer , that sounds more logical.</p>

              <p>Anyway, ying yang rule apply here.</p>
              <p>As for Kim gu, it is up to individual, some are doing very well with it. The diversity of cabs can help us in a way of giving us more choices, you wouldn't want to keep eating the same dish all the time right?, so given choices, just take it or leave it. Like me, keep taking the bak bak ones also sian, so once a while take the bak kut one also not bad.</p>
              <p>As for newbie taking limo or kim gu orh ni is up to them, whether they have listen to this advice or read the forum or that the forum had helped them is very much of individual decison. There are both ways in learning a trade, especially taxis trade, one is top down, the other is bottom up.</p>
              <p>When one decided to take the top down learning curve, he would enter the limo trade immediately and for all he knows, he struggled without any knowledge about normal cab, and if he is happy, so be it, some people like stress, good stress. But if he failed, he can fall back to normal cab and realise, knn, so easy, then tell himself, at least I tested the limo trade, may one day go back there without any problem.</p>
              <p>And when one like most of us, take the bottom up learning curve, then it is just normal, but still itchy to touch the limo..hehehehe..</p>
              <p>In skill, the most easiest to adapt and learn skill command the cheapest $$, some skill craft men take decade to learn a skill, some just a day, like sweeping or washing, and for TD, a few weeks or months, you will get the gel of it, therefore it had never commanded a high $$ return.</p>

              <p>All this is part of Kimgu life story.  Also dun forget the
              4 Kimgu counter and 2 Ikeas. We just relax and the durian jobs will
              come naturally. For street jobs , pax will flag us when there got
              no sampan. See what I mean.</p>

              <p>Ya very cunning company. I took the TDVL course with them. When I sign up they straight away whack us $20 or $30 for the manual. But later realise if sign with CDG not compulsary to buy one. Cos one of the taxiuncle member collect the manual from me and he told me.</p>
              <p>Then after passing went down to take picture to make the TDVL straight away they jio me drive their Azera. Tell me no need deposit can take. Even pay me monthly salary plus commission. After go back calculate if I can collect the amount I can earn more then what they offer me....Lol</p>
