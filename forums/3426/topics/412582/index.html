              <p>I beg to differ. Although he writes well, I believe cabbies here've equally if not more interesting stories to tell. It's all in a day's job. As a Phd holder, he could've easily landed a better job than a TD. My guess is his shock therapy generated the desired publicity intended. With the outpouring of sympathy came numerous offers from various institutions. As he has stopped driving a taxi, he probably has a plump job. His blog hasn't been updated since 30th April.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He lost his job under acrimonious condition. Each side has its story and we'll leave it as that. Through his blog, he went on a personal vendetta against the authorities. His rants and gripes against the police, ERP etc. cuts no ice with me. I would rather he move on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With his book available to a world wide audience, he's probably laughing his way to the bank. Judging from the comments in his blog, he proves to be quite an auntie killer too. Well, some guys have all the luck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It would be nice of him to return and acknowledge the support he'd received instead of making a disappearing act.</p>

              The stories are interesting to non-cabbies
              
              cabbies on the road would encounter much more, but some are for your eyes and ears only
