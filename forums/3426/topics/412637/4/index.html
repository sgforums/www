              <p>Well i do not take taxis often, so if you say its official, its official then, i see no point trying to prove anything. Then she is just a cheapskate customer then.</p>
              <p>But all these call centre, how does it work man. ANy company can join right? You mean the companies do not mind? cos it means taking away their bookings also right meaning they earn lesser.</p>

              <p>But if you join a company anywhere, you follow and abide by a company's rules and policies right? If I did not get you wrongly, you are saying Comfort sacked this guy on the basis that  Comfort rules already stated that Comfort drivers cannot join such association or take on such calls unless these are calls given by them right? So if this rule exists, then drivers have to follow it, thats how it works.</p>
              <p>Of course, I am not in the taxi industry, I do not know whether that is a fair rule to have or not. If it is an unfair and unreasonable rule, then someone got to bring up to the relevant authorities. If no one bring up or dare to bring up, then its just too bad, you got to follow their rules then if you want to drive their taxis, there is nothing to complain about when you get sacked for violating rules. Then just join another taxi company that you think will treat you well, dun go around breaking rules.</p>

              <p>As a TD myself, the rules of thumb apply, if i pick up someone not on call, i will not take the $2.50, whatever call centres who charge $2.50 or so call, bao the place or location is not a concern to other TD who are not register with them. Its so simple, if on call, charge the $2.50, if not, just normal fare.</p>
              <p>Sometime i feel that it is not the matter of $2.50, it is the ego of most TDs who do not want to say that they are wrong. Most are mature men doing a decent job, take pride with full of ego in it, and that ego can sometime go overboard, it will harm them. Rules and policies are make by people, putting that aside, there is alway a room for negiotation and acknowledgement of wrong doing. We may see that the sacked comfort driver is a mistake of breaking the rules, a mistake that he may be misled by other TD into collecting $2.50, but what happen in the comfort office conversation, nobody knows, he may had get angry and scolded the official incharge rather than acknowledging the mistake, apologise and learn a lesson. Communication do play an important role, I believe if he had been cool, understandable and acknowledge the flaws openly, he can makes frens instead of getting sacked.</p>

              <p>I think your statements are very fair. If he has apologised for breaking Comfort policies and still got sacked, Comfort is being an arsehole for sacking a repentant TD over such a small matter. But if this TD refused to back down or quarrel, then I guess Comfort is sacking not only because of the 2.50 thing but more likely of bad attitude.</p>

              <p>So if Comfort never stated such rules at all, on what basis they sack this guy? THey have to give a reason what. Was it because this driver was not on call, but go collect on call booking charge? Hmmm...if there was no official rules that stop drivers from taking calls from such independent call centres, then Comfort better had a good reason to sack this guy</p>
