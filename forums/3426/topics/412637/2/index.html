I was told by the cabby that I had to pay an additional "booking fee" of $2.50. He added that the hotel had made the booking. But the taxi had arrived at the stand empty and its "For Hire" sign was not lit up.<br><br>According to the cabby, this was a common arrangement by the hotel for its guests' convenience, as it was difficult to get a cab there.<br><br>It is unfair to assume that all guests are willing to pay the additional fee. The hotel is not far from One Fullerton, where cabs are readily available.<br><br>Shirley Tan (Ms)</p>

              <p>before we go further, allow me to understand the full pic.</p>
              <p>this lady wait at a taxi stand of a hotel, the taxi showed "for hire", and when the lady went in, the driver said to pay $2.50 more. to check, is this a standard practise for all hotels? if the hotels booked the taxi for their VIPs, shouldn't it show "booked" instead of "for hire"?</p>
              <p>so if no one is at the queue, and I went for a meal @ the hotel, not a staying guest, and I got a "for hire" taxi at the stand, must I pay $2.50 more?</p>
              <p>for me, I don't mind paying if I am informed correctly by the hotel by a sign or notice that this is the normal practise.</p>
              <p>A better approach would be for the lady to feedback without the taxi's license plate, so as not to get the TD into 
              trouble. </p>
              <p>One thing hor, $2.5 seems very small for some, but given most of us have to work hard for money, let's not belittle it unless you are Peter Lim or rich enough not to work.</p>
              <p>Also, given some here think it is so small, absorb the surcharge la. why phui here and there?  Don't NATO, if U do it, I applaud you.</p>
              <p>I think singaporeans' attitute sucks.. no denials.. but pardon me, you TDs, all from where? africa huh? </p>
              <p>Not to offense any, but we all try to squeeze what we can from what we can earn leh. We earn $1, we try to get $2 value. this is normal. now, earn money hard. For some, they take taxi, also no choice, how to buy car, rain, heavy things, elderly, right? yes, some still live in the money bigger than the buckwheat wheel era la. but just hope that everything see big picture or even 3D la..</p>
              <p>-&gt; No offense, pool man and bros.</p>

              <p><br>On a Friday night , 11.30pm , when MBS needs more than 100 taxis , and long Q everywhere in town , Fullerton Bay Hotel every 5 minutes booked 5 taxis to clear the Q . Base on their customer's agreement .</p>
              <p>1000 Fullerton's pax agreed , just that bitch dun agree , still she hop onto the cab , paid and complaint , . That's it .</p>
              <p>Have you been to town area on a Friday night ? Ask yourself this question .</p>
              <p>On the busy friday night , do you need to book a cab ?</p>
              <p>That bitch just wanted cheap taxis on a friday night ?</p>
              <p>At a hotspot like Fullerton Bay ?</p>
              <p>And a location so near to MBS ?</p>
              <p>Think again .</p>
              <p>MBS has $3 surcharge , this taxi driver is such a nice chap to service Fullerton Bay Hotel customers at a booking rate of just $2.50 .</p>
