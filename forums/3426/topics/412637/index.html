I was told by the cabby that I had to pay an additional "booking fee" of $2.50. He added that the hotel had made the booking. But the taxi had arrived at the stand empty and its "For Hire" sign was not lit up. <br><br>According to the cabby, this was a common arrangement by the hotel for its guests' convenience, as it was difficult to get a cab there.<br><br>It is unfair to assume that all guests are willing to pay the additional fee. The hotel is not far from One Fullerton, where cabs are readily available.<br><br>Shirley Tan (Ms)</p></div>

              <p>It is all these 'occasional ' commuters who are creating problems to TDs. No taxi they complain , 2.50 surcharge they complain , city surcharge they also complain.</p>
              <p>If there is going to be another fare hike , all those regular office and shop commuters better remember Sally Tan &amp; Shirley Phua.</p>
              <p>Give an example , last 2 days ... as i woke up late and calculated that going to my home ground is going to waste another half an hr or so , i picked a street pax just outside my car park.</p>
              <p>Wanted to go lavender food centre , upon reaching fare was $20 exactly. judging by the way she pass me her ATM card , i know she is going to have something to say.</p>
              <p>U know , $20 is like going from Bt batok to airport leh... i was like huh?? hello miss now peak hr ... go airport? prepare to pay at least $34.</p>
              <p>Look at her sulky face also sian.</p>
              <p>Funny Pax from tuas pay me $44 to kallang airport also never say anything.</p>
              <p>Thats the diff between a regular and an occasional commuter. For me i will take the regular anytime.</p>

              <p>Many types of commuters around , for me i always remember who are the ones that give me my constant income rain or shine , monday or friday.</p>
              <p>I can go empty up to support my 'members' rather than pick an occasional one who only need cabs on fridays and saturdays .</p>

              <p><br>This pax agree and aware that the taxi that came along , was book by Fullerton Bay Hotel for their VIPs , if they want , they can chose to take and pay $2.50 fee . If they don't agree , can chose to book their own cab .</p>
              <p>This pax chose to take the cab that came faster than Comfort , and not willing to pay .</p>
              <p>Typical singaporean , and sadly so , Comfort chose to side with the pax , cheapo pax .</p>
              <p>That is why , we cabbies , dun give a damn to local one , fuck type .</p>
              <p>When in need of taxis , Singaporeans will be first to book , or must book .</p>
              <p>We have manage to despatch 1000  taxis to Fullerton Bay for their VIPs , all no problems , cos most ang mor , $3.50 or $2.50 , no problem , they are treated like VIP afterall .</p>

              <p>Just to inform Comfort , we had despatched 1000 of taxis to service Fullerton Bay Hotel , all with distinctions . How we know ?</p>
              <p>Cos all pay not only with bookings $3.50 , they paid CBD $3 surcharge , and round up fare , which is always more than the total meter fare .</p>
              <p>All no problem .</p>
