              Foreigner pax asked me why no TP on the road. I reply him that you only see them in major accidents, they got LTA Road Marshall as their assistants already. To me, TP only work hard only when appraisal for their bonus are near. They are venerable to all other road users, they drive in a way they think is right, who cares, they says. Here money talks, if got money can hire best lawyer to fight for you in court. This is what I feel living here. 
                
              So many traffic accidents OTR. Still see so many drivers disobey traffic rules on road. Nowadays especially those driving luxury car drivers talking on their phones with no ear piece or bluetooth while driving? See them no up. These smart ppl out there dun bring their brains out. Thats why I say Drivers here like to Risk(æœ‰å†’é™©ç²¾ç¥ž). To me, I refers them as road idiots, always make other road users a bad day.

              <p><br>yeah TP should be hard on all this TD , nv signal can cause accident , best is if they let all this TD who dun signal sent to jail , i nearly got into a accident with a taxi who suddenly cutted into my lane without signalling. And i have to jam brake , my vehicle have got passenger and so is his cab , he is endangering the safety of the pax in his car and also my vehicle. But yet some taxi forumers here still can support him. tsk tsk , nth to say. And i mean some hor. not all =))</p>

              veyr common. agreed changing lane is skill but i think also a bit of luck. one time i saw in front lane one car moving right into centre lane, should be quite safe. but suddenly rightmost lane car break, the car behind it caught by surprise also swerve left together into same centre lane, both almost bang, both horn like crazy, each one blaming the other, but if accident already then how?

              not everyone good boy good girl like you. another time i was on small road leading out from a school. one driver very gan joing, without signal jump into my lane. i stamp break i think almost 1 Foot or 12 inches from the back. my passnger witness also very shock. later when at traffic light we come up next to that car, then we realise the driver is mother parent scolding her child next to her about her homework, they having heated exchange about some exercise book. the woman dont even know we all looking at her next side, shes very engrossed in getting upset with her child, keep looking down sideways and backseat. ifi you look carefully, sometimes certain drivers also purposely dont give signals and drive haphazard, they hope you will hit them by slip of attention, because their back already got damage, maybe its not their car or company vehicle, or they owed casino.
