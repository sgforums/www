              <p>Yesterday, I picked up a passenger at just before midnight(about 11:50pm) at geylang. He told me destination is Pasir Ris Dr 6. Being the kind hearted soul, i took him.</p>
              <p>I proceeded to take PIE from paya lebar rd. I also entered the address into my GPS just in case i forgot the location.</p>
              <p>Nearing the junction of Pasir Ris Dr 4, I asked the passenger: "Do i turn here or the next one?(Dr 6)"</p>
              <p>Passenger told me next one so i proceeded to the next junction which is Dr 6.</p>
              <p>After passing the junction, he said: Uncle, you took the wrong turn. Supposed to be Pasir Ris St 21. I only have $11, cant pay you your fare if you took the wrong turn.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching destination, fare came to about $14. He pushed $11 to me and tried to open the door and run out.  But i already locked it so he was stuck inside.</p>
              <p>He refused to take out his ATM card and refused to ask his parents to come down to pay his fare for him. He kept insisting that i missed the turn and he wouldn't tell me to go to Pasir Ris Dr 6 if he stayed in St 21.</p>
              <p>I was very pissed since i confirmed the location twice with him and contemplating calling the cops. Seriously, $11 can't bring you to Pasir Ris with midnight surcharge.</p>
              <p>In the end, i gave him a scolding and let him out. Would you make a police report?</p>
              <p>For people who did not read the whole thing. This person purposely told the driver a different location from his address. Then insisted on being right and getting a big discount off the fare.</p>
              <p>Lesson learnt: "Never pick up anyone from Geylang before midnight!"</p>

              <p>Thanks TS for the info, I believe that issue is not about the $3, but more on the cunning side of pax. Anyway, there are many different types of people in this world, at times, we get good tips and at times we get pissed off, people tends to take TD for granted, pychologically speaking, most think we are stupid uncles, good for nothing, that is why end up driving taxis. But as long as we do not steal, take, cheat and con, I believe we stand better than most company directors who cheat and massage account figures all the times for their own interest.</p>
              <p>There will no end to all these minor teething issues on the road with paxs, because the conflict of interest exist between both parties, the believe of pax is alway TD is trying to be funny, if can cheat uncle, why not, and the believe of TD is pax is cheapo when they want to take the cheap way, the non peak hr, the no surcharge location and so on. The engagement has no rules, it is alway a stranger meeting strangers, a new trip and a new conversation, new issues, and as a TD, you hv to bear with it, afterall, you get the fun of it too.</p>
              <p>Making police reports can be done later, it is for your own good and also for the TD circle, Police do not isolate just by a case, they compound it, once thing happened too often, then take note and action, like recently the news on robbing of taxis come into the picture only after several cases was reported. So, if we as TD, do our part, we could get their attention.</p>
