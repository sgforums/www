              <p>Frankly, I never know taxi driving need so much thinking. I
              remember when I first started 3 years ago as a weekend relief I
              thought its only driving from 1 point to another. One smart alex
              came on board tell you the destination next moment make hell lots
              of noise just because we didn't go by his/her regular route.</p>
              <p>Ended up with a lot of sarcastic remarks like unscrupulous just
              wanted to make extra by using a longer way (oh my foot over 20/40
              cents) This people just have a way to be brought up. We are not
              their worm of their brain how the hell do we know they wanted
              their regular route.</p>
              <p>I'm wondering how do taxi companies react to such complaint. Can
              the driver be making a lot going another route? Is this
              overcharging as the driver took a longer way as pax claimed. Damned
              it.</p>

              <p>dun worry, lta's coffee is at least $20. anything less than that, only company will call &amp; ask about the case. worst is a verbal warning.</p>
              <p>many years back i have a case of challenging pax to complain against me. it was the pax who started saying "i want to complain to your company". i only remind her to "remember" to file the complaint. blue company called me &amp; ask about the case and in the end didn't even come back to me &amp; the case is close. best is when my hirer return vehicle, they even called me and ask whether i want to take over the cab. so i assume i am not blacklisted with the blue company.</p>
              <p>after that incident, i always believe that whichever company you drive for will not penalise you if you are not at fault.</p>
              <p>i dun believe that "customer is always right", i believe in "REASONABLE customer is always right"</p>

              <p>Taxis co dun blacklist a cabby because of just complaints, complaints is not a charge against us, with the nos of old cabs sunbathing in the sun with insurance paid rot in the car park at the expense of the company write off debt, they blacklist you for what?? It is only accidents disparity and other serious offences that involve the public and govt body, then they kick you out. In fact taxis company seldom blacklist Cabbies, it is cabblies who blacklisted them more</p>

              <p>3rd Guards ? Fuck lar mai kung liao ....</p>
              <p>One word during my time : Shiong !!!</p>
              <p>Mine CO was the only CO with 3 crabs , Colonel .</p>
              <p>The rest just Major for 1st Guards and 2nd Guards .</p>
              <p>He so on the ball , he targetted Best Battalion Unit of Singapore for year 1989 ( was already there ) , during 1991 , they got it !!! The last time was 1981 when 3rd Guards got it .</p>
              <p>Proof ?</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/safday/safday2007/awards/pastwinners/1991-1995.html">http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/safday/safday2007/awards/pastwinners/1991-1995.html</a></p>
              <p>Was really tough to be men from 3rd Guards that year ..... GSI so on the ball sian .</p>
              <p>GSI stands for General Staff Inspection .</p>
              <p>One of those good memories in the army .</p>
              <p>Yeah because of tough schedule like that , that kind of attiude migrated into my daily life . Then into taxi driving .</p>
