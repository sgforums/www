              <p>Why not we all dun drive let those cheapo rots. Last time first started find so easy to drive on Sunday. No need skill everywhere got people. Then after that find that it is not productive. Meter no extra so need to cover more km and use more CNG to earn same amount of fare. And also will encounter alot of nonsense people. Cos Sunday alot of cheapos non regular pax will take taxi beacuse it is cheap!!! So I am actually doing them a favour by not getting fark by me.</p>
              <p>I tell you loh some Sunday pax damn CB one loh. You take them instead of being grateful them will kpkb at you about Sun difficult get taxi lah, why TD always off Sun so make life difficult for them. Alot of nonsense. KNN they Sun can off we cannot ah!!!</p>
              <p>But still got people drive Sun. Some is part timer earning extra money. Please lah Sun is for you to rest. It is really pathetic to work on your off days. Earn less spend less loh. Why must work so hard. $$$ is not everything.</p>
              <p>Even now when I switch over to full time TD I earn less then what I used to earn. But my lifestyle improve. I have more time to spend with my family, friends and that makes me overall a happier person.</p>
              <p>So I appeal to those Sunday drivers. If can dun drive on Sunday lah. Let those asshole rots, spend more time with your family and friends. Dun waste time lah. People work Sunday got double pay one leh. We have what? Nothing!!! So please wake up your farking idea ok....</p>

              I believe many drive on Sunday just to make enough to cover rental and fuel.
              
              Sunday or not, rental still have to pay wor...

              <p>At first, I thought sunday people go diving, like commit suicide. Dive into the sea.</p>
              <p>Yes, you can be right, sunday is actually a off day for peoples to rest and spend wonderful time with their family. But then, there are lots of peoples still working, from bus to train to airport to shopping, food centre etc etc, many are still working, funny how, those work get double paid, but taxis fares no only no surcharge, also no peak period, by right, sunday full day is a peak period. But if you drive sunday, time pass very fast, cos lots of connection, but olso very tiring.</p>
              <p>There are people who also need a partime job to support his or her family, more so with the current high cost of living, inflation at 5% and going strong, meaning what you earned is short of 5% against the prices of goods. Naturally, there will be relief drivers or partimer taking over from hirer, and if you look at those cabby hirer looking for relief on sat and sun, there is hell of a lot of them.</p>
              <p>We alway tends to look at ourselves earning less, but there are many who are earning even much lesser and poorer, give people a chance to drive as you give yourself a chance, if paxs cannot find a single taxi on sunday, do you know what will happen??</p>

              <p>Not hate all my customer. Just hate those cheapo customers. You pay peanuts so dun expect good service. Do you know no extra $10 share by 4 pax is cheaper to take taxi then bus/mrt? Yet they still expect alot from us. Wait too long kpkb, dun go by their route kpkb, drive too fast kpkb, too slow also kpkb. So these people dun deserve to take my cab.</p>
