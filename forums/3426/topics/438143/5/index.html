              <p>Guess taxi companies must really look into this matter. I'm just a weekend relief driver might not impact me very much. But I also think and agreed the authority should look into it ASAP. Rather than receiving so much pax complaint about not getting a cab they should be proactive. The best way forward which pleases both (pax &amp; driver) is to add surcharges. Drivers r motivated to go full force on Sunday which pax benefited by taking taxi easily. Its really ridicious 4px take a cab is cheaper than taking bus/MRT during Sunday.</p>
              <p>The other area, taxi companies should also consider seriously is to abolish the penalty system for "Calls". I have been getting a lot of no show after reaching the location worst off when I arrived earlier than the clocking time e.g. 5 mins pax missing.</p>
              <p>Aiya, dont the companies know that we also need time and diesel to arrive at the location how about the lost opportunity of picking flaging potential customers along the way to the destinated place.</p>

              <p>Agreed. We also want to make money. But its an issue, then they need to acknowledge and fix it. Sunday its a rest day for everyone in the world. Pax need taxi because they're in the mood for leisure and relax. Taxi driver are motivated with incentive to work.</p>
              <p>They dont even need to adjust the taxi meter as its need the authority approval. They can give back the hirer the incentive for driving Sunday by packaging the rental terms. Drivers with Sunday a special package and a normal package for driver who chose to rest on Sunday.</p>
              <p>I'm sure with these special scheme hirer can then pass it on to relief to ensure taxi availability. More taxi on road less pax complain. Drivers are happy with the special scheme as rental are lower lor.</p>
              <p>I'm sure they would not want their mood to be dampened as there is no cab available when they need them or they faced with a long taxi queue etc.  </p>
              <p>I just wonder why taxi companies can relax when they know there is a major gap for them to improve their business and services. Guess they only do thing when it become serious matter. "If is aint broken don't fix"  </p>

              <p>those foreign immigrants know when to take taxi ? when not to take taxis ?</p>
              <p>that is why u see so many cockcroaches on Sunday taking taxis .</p>
              <p>ON CALL also cheap $2.50 .</p>
              <p>But they didn't know ..... MBS and RWS has got $3 surcharge .</p>
              <p>Do they know ?</p>
              <p>They dunno , they just know : " Why taxi on green do not go into the taxi stand they Q-ing for ?"</p>
              <p>Also they do not understand the Supply n Demand Theory for taxis .</p>
              <p>In Singapore , when taxis in demand , supply became less , when supply became less , u have to pay more .</p>

              <p>But now , more n more Comfort / CityCab boycott call zones area , esp those near MBS , they rather : " Hello Tampines Tampines @ anywhere " when in demand .</p>
              <p>Many Comfort and Citycab drivers , knowing $2.50 to bring them to Jurong , they'll die . , they rather " Tampines Tampines " , and pick N go at AP with $5 surcharge !!</p>

              <p>Frankly, I never know taxi driving need so much thinking. I remember when I first started 3 years ago as a weekend relief I thought its only driving from 1 point to another. One smart alex came on board tell you the destination next moment make hell lots of noise just because we didn't go by his/her regular route.</p>
              <p>Ended up with a lot of sarcastic remarks like unscrupulous just wanted to make extra by using a longer way (oh my foot over 20/40 cents) This people just have a way to be brought up. We are not their worm of their brain how the hell do we know they wanted their regular route.</p>
              <p>I'm wondering how do taxi companies react to such complaint. Can the driver be making a lot going another route? Is this overcharging as the driver took a longer way as pax claimed. Damned it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As i said earlier, people works sunday got double pay, some got a day off in lieu which is equivalent to a day pay, TD work for peanut fare, worst then weekdays fare. And worst, sunday full of shopping bags, baby strollers, 4 in one group, 2 to 3 destinations and calculative paxs who take cab only on sunday. No doubt sunday can hv more paxs, but it is also very tiring for TD, should be better compensated. TD also human.</p></div>

              <p><br>Taxi drivers are business minded, whichever way benefit them more they take</p>
              <p>If you just drop off a pax at MBS hotel, to go suntec to get a pax, you need abt 5mins(which equates to abt S$2 of your time, using equation of S$25.00/hr) plus abt 20 cents diesel, so the opportunity cost is abt S$2.20</p>
              <p>Can you guarantee a good trip / one that you like to go at suntec ?</p>
              <p>Or would you rather shout tampines, tampines at the bell boy or if you more hiong can shout air pot, air pot !!!</p>
