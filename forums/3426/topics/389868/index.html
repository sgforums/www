              <p>If you don't believe just try from CTE to Vivo City after Bukit Merah exit turn right to Lower Delta...sure you kenna f**k, you must turn left to kampong Bahru, than this correct. So those f**ker paxs behind are king.</p>
              <p> Why? cannot... the destination.</p>
              <p> So f**king by them is a must, so that why? taxis driving just only those few dollars and just that turn a few cent more also cannot. isist very hard?</p>
              <p>as new cabby who the f**k say cannot. If you provoked them, them LTA is involved, coffee is free no charge free flow from them. A warning letter, bo wah right.</p>
              <p>this is basically what is taxi driving a must F**king by pax, and speeding also a must.</p>

              <p>ya , most Singaporeans is like that .....</p>
              <p>Or 90% of Singapore taxi drivers , or business people is like that .</p>
              <p>They are never honest about how much they get . Esp those all oldies cabby . Nevermind , i tell others how much i earn , to tell people i earned $3000 a month , no a really big deal .</p>
              <p>IRAS ? Nay , they wanna catch sugar cane juice seller how much they sold one day , and how many fishballs the fishball noodles sold in a day , or how much second hand cars dealer import parallel cars ..... not taxi drivers how much they get each night .</p>
              <p>No offense , LTA knew how much we earn . Cannot escape one , 90% $3000 or more , less than $3500 .</p>
              <p>From CDG diesel sales and those figures from Comfort's MDT , all thanks to those prolific Comfort drivers to be able to provide the correct accurate datas for research purposes .</p>
