              Itâ€™s the same with SMRT, Iâ€™ve seen a thick file of my profile,,, complaints, commendations from day oneâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got a lot of complaints when newbie cos didnâ€™t know how to siam n handle some situationsâ€¦ but Im not so concerned about thoseâ€¦I make sure I return every single items left n found in my taxi and try to maintain a good record in tat aspectâ€¦ I saw in papers last timeâ€¦a case where a cabby was suspected of keeping some valuables + laptop left behind in taxiâ€¦The police went quietly and raided his houseâ€¦This is something I wan to avoid (n a clean record may help)â€¦ imagine the trauma to yr family if tat happens cos of some stupid/false accusationsâ€¦

              I had experiencing the same problem myself. I was on wheel chairs for 3 months. Every other day, I need to hire a cab. Some immediately switch to busy. Some c wheel chair just ask location n go. Not surprised.
              
              If you have car camera, just post to YouTube ., don't need complaint one.....

              <p>This behavorial apply to all trade, not only TD, I can understand from the point of a wheel chair bound view, and for me, I will alway pick them up and end up with lots of thank you thank you.</p>
              <p>We of course can get angry to those who do not want to pick them up, but these are also our TD brothers, and for years, it had been like this, because, graciousness and empathy aside,  like most business people, you would want to do a hassle free and quick profit business, like in shipyard, contractor cheat here and there just to get the ship moving and collect money from owner, people who make food, add this and that without the care of health, but just to get their food tastier, people Q up to buy and make money out of it. So, the ethic of some of our TD brother could be the same, I am doing business, and I want good business that is easier to ferry and move on.</p>
              <p>And that is the nature of our world, even walking some help the old, some bochap, and like wise when come to driving TD, that behavorial shall exist, couple with the time factor of having to cover high rental and fuel, that mentality switch to be a cunning one which most business people are behaving, and that include our govt.</p>
              <p>By and large, not only handicap on wheelchair are not taken, even families with childrens, shopping bags, craddle and stroller are also avoided by some TD.</p>
