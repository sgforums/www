              <p>Driver knocks down foreign worker, then offers him $100 to 'stand up'</p>
              <p>A driver knocked down a Chinese foreign worker in Geylang on Sunday (Jul 10), but still had the audacity to tell the man he would give him $100 if he could stand up. According to a Lianhe Wanbao report, the accident happened around 9.20pm at Geylang Lorong 23. The man, who drove a black car, told Chinese national Zhang Lian Xiu 'Get up, get up!' The driver then tried to help him up, but to no avail. He then told bystanders that it was Zhang was at fault in the accident. The driver then became angry when Zhang asked why he lied. Enraged, he taunted Zhang, saying he would give him $100 if he could stand up. However, Zhang retorted that the driver should not look down on others. A bystander also remarked, 'Have money so what?' After the police arrived, Zhang was sent to hospital for treatment. STOMPer Dhino commented on the report: "A person is hurt, he must be attended to and sent to hospital. Why did the driver who caused the accident still accuse and taunt the poor man? "This is crazy. That driver is inhumane! At least have the decency to help a fellow man when they are in need! "How would you like if circumstances forced you to work in another country and someone did the same thing to you?" this might spark a trend, if drivers pass nearby, the pedestrians, especially Chinamen, might suddenly 'sit down' on the road and claim injury its very high time to install, not just normal camera, but ultra wide angle video camera!</p>

              <p><br>Cannot be lah, PAP loves and help foreigners, this driver seem to hate foreigners.</p>
              <p>I think base on the incident where the public will alway pity the one who got injured, I can say that driving along geyland road, there are many pedestrians doing jaywalking, from local ah bengs, uncles to foreigner prositutes and workers. A few time, I saw fatal accident there too, most just dash across the road.</p>
              <p>Perhap to that PRC guy, it is simple, just like Taxis, once you get hit from the back, ho sei liao, can rest, still got money. And as for him, can take a time off to go back hometown.</p>
