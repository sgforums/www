              <p>One of my member owed rental money to Premier Taxi abt $3k. So times are bad and my member is willing to pay to Premier in installments. So he called up and speak to this Miss Zarina who is the person in charge of this . This lady says there is no installment what so ever and he has to pay in full. He pleaded to them but the answer is still NO.</p>
              <p>Recently 2 guys from Nation and Associate Pte Ltd came to his house pounding at his door demanding for  the money he owed . Once again he told them he has got no money to pay. Again he proposed to them that he will pay in installment but his request is being denied .</p>
              <p>So members any idea how to settle this matter coz the debt collector is harrassing my poor  friend . He tried talking to Premier but they got no empathy towards him . What Premier wants is MONEY . He tired to settle this with Premier but they said they have push the case to Debt collector. How to settle ah ?</p>

              <p>Sorry for the late reply . Just wake up from sleep. Actually my friend kena accident and hutang14 days of rental. Usually if you can clear payment within 14 days , you can get 1 free Sunday rental . The 1k deposit burn coz break contract after 10 months. Coz they mix diesel rebate of $100 not given for the past 10 months coz sway sway kena accident after 1 month of driving.</p>
              <p>They say must clear the excess b4 they can give you the diesel rebate .But the thing is diesel rebate got nothing to do with accident installment. This is the issue here . So in order to get the diesel rebate you must die die clear the accident installment.</p>
              <p>So Premier mixed  this two together  so that is why my friend decided to quit this coy and slowly take his time to pay the rental. Even if he has the money , he will slowly take his time to make payment. They are hundreds of ex Premier taxi still hutang money to Premier.</p>
              <p>My question is will Premier take drastic measures to sue my friend over $3k ?</p>

              If they are already using the service of a debt collection agency, then it is likely that they will sue. 
              
              The worst case scenario is that they will engage their lawyers to issue your friend a writ of summons, thus complicating matters by bringing it to court. If your friend refuse to compound the payment, this writ of summons will be reflected in his credit report - which will be scrutinized by banks or other institutions when assessing his credit worthiness.

              Yes of course we wish upon a fairy tale ending.
              
              If your friend feels aggreived yet want to settle the matter amicably, why not bring the case to the taxi association and put their words to it and see how they manage for the welfare of taxi drivers?
              
              I'm intrigued to see if such trade unions are useful or not.

              <p>Well my friend tried to talk to Premier about paying in installment but was rejected by them. They said they have passed  the matter to the debt collector and thats final. So he spoke to debt collector to pay in 10 installment meaning he will clear in 10 months time but  this proposal was rejected  too. He is now at a lost.</p>
              <p>Lately the debt collector has been calling his house many times everyday  and demand 100 % payment. But he told them he got no cash in hand but he made the proposed installment. Again rejected .</p>
              <p> Recently I was been told that the debt collector agency sent someone to watch over his house at 2 am hoping to get cash payment . Crazy ?</p>
              <p>My friend  has approached the police for assistance but they too can't help.</p>
              <p>So I have told him the only way to settle this is seek MP help to write to Premier or he has to get loan to settle this matter .</p>
              <p>Is this the only solution ?</p>

              <p>This farking premier think they wad? dont bow down to them. Thats why i always tell my friends and those i know not to drive for all this half fark taxi Co. at the end of the day , you got no $ to pay rental , they still come after you like wolves.</p>
              <p>As long as not over 10k , ask your friend mai worry. i owed SMRT 1.9k for accident. after offsettin my deposit, still owe them 900. send me letters , called me , send people up my house all i ignore. up till now i am still happily driving. ask your friend dont give in to these pple.</p>
              <p>no way they can bankrupt you. Debt collectors have a limit to what they can do in singapore. They wont set fire to your hse unlike Mr Long.</p>

              <p>From this thread , hope everyone knows not a single taxi co is good in singapore. Out of all the bloodsuckers , i stick to confort coz of the sonata and the call booking. other than that , confort is also the same but it is the best of the worse!</p>
              <p>thank you :p</p>
