              <p>Copied and pasted from the above blog...</p>
              <p>Rich taxi drivers? In Singapore? Yes, I think some taxi drivers
              in Singapore are really rich. How else can you explain the fact
              that many of them can afford to pick and choose their
              customers?<br> <br> Think about it, how many times have you stood waiting beside the
              road for a taxi, and then watched in rage and frustration as
              unhired, empty cabs whizzed by? How about trying to get a cab
              between 11pm and 12am, just before the midnight surcharge kicks
              in?<br> <br> If empty taxis ignoring passengers happened at only a particular
              time, such as meal times, or in the late afternoons or evenings, it
              would still have been understandable as the taxi drivers may be
              going for their meals or to for shift changes. However, this
              phenomenon can be seen everyday and at all times of the day.<br> <br> It is no secret that rather than pick up a regular fare on the
              street, these taxi drivers prefer to cruise around and get a
              telephone booking or hopefully, pick up a passenger from the
              central business district to earn a extra few dollars.<br> <br> Some might say these drivers are trying to maximise their earnings
              or that since they are self-employed, they are free to do as they
              wish. I agree, but I also say these taxi drivers must not forget
              they are providing an essential mode of public transport and as
              such, they are not the same as other self-employed people and
              cannot do as they please.<br> <br> The bottomline is, these taxi drivers are not hungry enough. They
              are the people who whine the loudest when taxi rentals or when
              diesel prices increase and they always exclaim how difficult it is
              to make a living as a taxi driver. At the same time, they can
              afford to ignore a ready customer who is beckoning to them in
              search of more profitable ones who may or may not appear. Compare
              them to taxi drivers in Hong Kong or Bangkok where passengers have
              no problem getting a taxi at any time, even late at night, with no
              additional surcharges to boot.<br> <br> These taxi drivers should really 'wake up their idea'.</p>

              believe idiots encounter the above when they want to "try their luck" in
               getting a taxi either at difficult locations or outside the CBD just 
              before the gantry. Between 11pm to 12am can't get a cab? Call for cab! 
              Don't be a cheapo! If can't call for cab, then sms a cab, use iPhone app
               to get a cab, why whine? Many people are also able to get home before 
              the midnight surcharge, be smart, don't be cheapo will get u home 
              cheaper than midnight surcharge.</p>

              if(s)... Why is empty taxis ignoring passengers? So many reasons to 
              ignore, #1: wearing black from head to toe and flagging taxi at dark

              no secret then why still complaining? Doing business selling ur stuffs, 
              would u rather sell it cheap or get a better customer who isn't so 
              cheapo and willing to pay to earn that EXTRA FEW DOLLARS to FEED your

               a win-win situation to benefit both the commuters and the taxi drivers 
              to feed their family. There is no way to compare Singapore taxi drivers 
              with Hong Kong or even Bangkok taxi drivers. Why no problem in getting 
              taxi in these 2 other countries? Because 1 simple trip alone is anytime 
              more like a Chrysler already. So what to complain? Look at the 
              comparison below MORONS!<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hong Kong<br> 10km fare: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HK$80!!!</span></strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Bangkok<br> 10km fare: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">70 baht!!!<br> <br> </span></strong><strong>Singapore<br> 10km fare: $8.90 - non-peak &amp; $12 for peak

              $18.30 compare to HK$80 and 70 baht??? If the blogger is willing to pay 
              SGD$70 OR SGD$80 ANYTIME, I mean ANYTIME! Which taxi driver here would 
              reject / ignore?<br> <br> Check this website out for some morons who are nothing but whiners<br> http://www.asiaone.com/Travel/News/Story/A1Story20080108-44110.html<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I say: </span></strong>This blogger should really wake up his/her idea.</p>

Many people are also able to get home before the midnight surcharge, be smart, don't be cheapo will get u home cheaper than midnight surcharge.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong><br>Idiot says:</strong></span> If empty taxis ignoring passengers.....</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I say:</span></strong> If all taxi drivers would strike toto, if the rental would be cheaper, if diesel is FOC, so many if(s)... Why is empty taxis ignoring passengers? So many reasons to ignore, #1: wearing black from head to toe and flagging taxi at dark areas?<br>#2: flagging taxi at areas where it's difficult for the taxi driver to stop at?<br>#3: and the list goes on....<br><br><span style="color: #993366;"><strong><br>Idiot says:</strong></span> It is no secret that rather than pick up a regular fare.....<br><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I say:</span></strong> Since already mentioned is no secret then why still complaining? Doing business selling ur stuffs, would u rather sell it cheap or get a better customer who isn't so cheapo and willing to pay to earn that EXTRA FEW DOLLARS to FEED your family? Use your brain la!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong><br>Idiot says:</strong></span> Some might say these drivers are trying to maximise their earnings...<br><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I say:</span></strong> Providing an essential mode of public transport is right but to people who can afford to pay for taxi fare, for cheapos, it's better that they take public transport.<br><br><br><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Idiot says:</strong></span> The bottomline is, these taxi drivers are not hungry enough....<br><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I say:</span></strong> It is obvious that taxi drivers are VERY HUNGRY that is why they are driving the smart way to people who really NEEDS taxi and can AFFORD to pay for taxi so that it's a win-win situation to benefit both the commuters and the taxi drivers to feed their family. There is no way to compare Singapore taxi drivers with Hong Kong or even Bangkok taxi drivers. Why no problem in getting taxi in these 2 other countries? Because 1 simple trip alone is anytime more like a Chrysler already. So what to complain? Look at the comparison below MORONS!<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Hong Kong<br>10km fare: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HK$80!!!</span></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Bangkok<br>10km fare: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">70 baht!!!<br><br></span></strong><strong>Singapore<br>10km fare: $8.90 - non-peak &amp; $12 for peak hours.<br><br></strong></span>I shall calculate the BEST SUMS for CHEAPOS out there to understand.<br><br>Even a 10km fare trip $12 (Peak Hours) + $3.30 (Booking) + $3 (City Surcharge), how much is the total may I ask? $18.30 ONLY! OMG! What is $18.30 compare to HK$80 and 70 baht??? If the blogger is willing to pay SGD$70 OR SGD$80 ANYTIME, I mean ANYTIME! Which taxi driver here would reject / ignore?<br><br>Check this website out for some morons who are nothing but whiners<br>http://www.asiaone.com/Travel/News/Story/A1Story20080108-44110.html<br><br><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">I say:</span></strong> This blogger should really wake up his/her idea.</p>

              <p><br>Brother, base on $1 sing equal to $5.9 hongkong dollar, actually 10km in Hongkong is only about $12 sing dollar</p>
              <p>and 70bahts is about $3.50 sing dollars lah.</p>
              <p>Hongkong are still using crown, change gear at steering wheel, and their cabs are private but need to join a company to get licence to drive and also for calls. Recently I board one in HK, starting HK$20, that is about $3.50.</p>
              <p>As taxi driver are small businessmen, we hv the right to do our business in the way most businessmen and women will do it day in and day out. Just like if you cannot get a seat in a crowded foodcourt, dun blame the foodcourt, go eat at the nearby restuarant, get serve better but must paid abit more. So, next time, if cannot get a taxi, you should know what to do, but dun blame it on TD.</p>

              <p>bro bowah,<br> <br> It is because of this way people using conversion rate to calculate taxi
               fare that caused the problems. Now we are talking about the issue of 
              locals complaining about the taxi fare hike. Do u hear complains from 
              foreigners complaining? No! Because it is still cheap to them due to 
              conversion rates from their country too! People from US, Australia, New 
              Zealand, they still give tips on top of the $8.90 10km ride rounding it 
              to $10 or $12 sometimes. Get it?<br> <br> Why not just simply ask the HK citizens and Bangkok citizens if they can
               AFFORD to take taxi in their own country? Bangkok citizens with their 
              given salary will not even take taxi @ 70 baht! Do u know how much u can
               eat with 70 baht in Thailand?<br> <br> Try asking the Japanese citizens too, most of them will only use taxis 
              when in need &amp; 1 trip alone costs them hell  alot. When they are in 
              Singapore, they find the taxis here SO CHEAP! 1 end to the other from 
              Jurong to Pasir Ris the most $45 WITH MIDNIGHT charge. In Japan, would 
              have easily cost u $100+++SGD ok?<br> <br> So pls do not use the conversion way to discuss about this issue. We use
               other countries local salary vs singapore local salary. Be glad these

              <p><br>Hi brother, no war lah, just a discussion, agreed with the cost of living, for bangkok, it is a total different scenarios, from wages to rental to cost of living like foods, they are totally much cheaper, that is also why many cheapo flown there to enjoy life. And the farker can come back and compare with singapore.</p>
              <p>As for Hongkong, their wages is much higher than us, why, because they own the cab, a crown is $40,000 sing dollar only, you take it, can paid by loan or one shot off, after 3 year to 5 years of hard work, loan finished, the taxi is yours, but you need a operating licence, that is why you need to register with the cab companies who issue licence and on call business thru walkie talkie, you hear their on call in cantonese...v funny one, can tio tio here and there, in Singapore, you rent taxi, paid until u die, taxis is also not yours, in Hongkong, after fully paid your loan, you can trade in for newer one or sell off your taxis or drive with free rental, so, they can afford to give lower fares. In Hongkong, they also never practice relief driver, most driver pass on their taxi to their sons or relatives, so that they can carry on making money out of it, HK control the license, not the taxi. Once you give up your licence, you very hard to get it, cos someone would had took over. Unlike singapore, you cannot find someone holding TDVL but not driving. So, you need to drive if you want to get a licence, and that is why they are more professional, they are call master, shifu, not uncle hor, no age limit,</p>

              <p>The HK taxi driver I talk to also told me, unlike our sg govt, who feed their people and expect them to submit, Hk peoples are left alone to find food for themselves, so since young, they are very independent and have to find food for themselves.</p>

              <p>why people like HK taxi so much? and always comment that there are Taxi available anytime, but those drama always shown people are fighting for Taxi leh, isn't that reflex the Taxi culture there?</p>
              <p>Singapore Taxi are more easily available, more then 20 hours a day you can see Taxi queueing to serve you. In fact, the queueit had become a nuisance to our road user.</p>
              <p>Singapore Taxi are much more cheaper, because we Taxi driver are cheaper.</p>

I dare the transport minister to use Chinamen to drive Taxi! It has not stop them before. Trust me it has crossed their mind also. I seriously look forward to see how much more Singapore willing to sell us for money. Enough is enough man. Since independence we had "healthy" flow if FTs to suppress our wages.
