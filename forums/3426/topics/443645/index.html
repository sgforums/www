              <p>Copied and pasted from the above blog...</p>
              <p>Rich taxi drivers? In Singapore? Yes, I think some taxi drivers in Singapore are really rich. How else can you explain the fact that many of them can afford to pick and choose their customers?<br><br>Think about it, how many times have you stood waiting beside the road for a taxi, and then watched in rage and frustration as unhired, empty cabs whizzed by? How about trying to get a cab between 11pm and 12am, just before the midnight surcharge kicks in?<br><br>If empty taxis ignoring passengers happened at only a particular time, such as meal times, or in the late afternoons or evenings, it would still have been understandable as the taxi drivers may be going for their meals or to for shift changes. However, this phenomenon can be seen everyday and at all times of the day.<br><br>It is no secret that rather than pick up a regular fare on the street, these taxi drivers prefer to cruise around and get a telephone booking or hopefully, pick up a passenger from the central business district to earn a extra few dollars.<br><br>Some might say these drivers are trying to maximise their earnings or that since they are self-employed, they are free to do as they wish. I agree, but I also say these taxi drivers must not forget they are providing an essential mode of public transport and as such, they are not the same as other self-employed people and cannot do as they please.<br><br>The bottomline is, these taxi drivers are not hungry enough. They are the people who whine the loudest when taxi rentals or when diesel prices increase and they always exclaim how difficult it is to make a living as a taxi driver. At the same time, they can afford to ignore a ready customer who is beckoning to them in search of more profitable ones who may or may not appear. Compare them to taxi drivers in Hong Kong or Bangkok where passengers have no problem getting a taxi at any time, even late at night, with no additional surcharges to boot.<br><br>These taxi drivers should really 'wake up their idea'.</p>

              <p>Very true, we taxi driver not hungry enough very choosy, selfish etc.</p>
              <p>But dont forget we also got take taxi. We also got experience all 'these problem', but I dont wait until 11.30pm to take taxi back to CCK or Woodlands, outside the CBD, send 3 or 4 my friend home and then pay by card.</p>
              <p>At least i got the courtesy to go home earlier or after midnight, I am not stupid to be waiting at the end of a 1 way street just meters fromt he CBD zone so to save money. If I want to save money then I take a train or bus home.</p>
              <p>I am not an idiot to wait 30 mins or more for a cab and then grumble, write to press, blog or stomp. I wait 15-20 min, no cab, take a bus somewhere further get down and take a cab where it's easier.</p>
              <p>Very easy to criticise until you go drive yourself or ask your family member who drive. See if it's fun to always get passenger who book a cab, somemore outside CBD then hop on the 1st 1 they see and not cancel, make you wait like a fool. See if it's fun to get 3 or 4 pax who wait until 11.25pm to catchÂ  a cab and then say uncle we go hougang, sengkang 2 place and finally punggol, then reach at 11.50pm, they say can pay by Nets!</p>
              <p>Yes, 1 time 2 time, 3, 4, 5, 6 time you do this it's ok but becomes an everyday event, and you drive back all the way empty to town and reach at 12.30 am on a weekday, town got no more pax, you drive and drive maybe lucky get 1 midnight pax. Everyday, you do, see fun or not, see easy or not.</p>
              <p>You see very easy or not when you need to roll your daily expenses, pay for your kids, wife and yourself, pay diesel and rent, all by cash but end of the shift, you only end up with $10 or $20 in hand, the rest you wait for 3 day to collect.</p>
              <p>On top of that pax eat in your cab, leave droppings for you to clean or for cockroaches to come, pax drunk go and vomit, argue the slightest when they never say which way to go, cough in your cab burp in your cab or fart in your cab, all these we must tolerate.</p>
              <p>You want to take a cab, use some common sense. Dont wait at the end of a 1 way street or simply 1 way streets are the worse place to hail a cab in evenings. You just outside the CBD, call a cab, state your destination, surely got some driver who wants to go there, dont make it like a lottery never state your location, taxi driver will also play lottery and not take the risk. You go shopping got a lot of stuff, call for advance booking and wait for your cab, not hop on the 1st available one.</p>
              <p>If raining, just too bad, we also drive in the rain and get stuck in jams, we complain to who? You got money in the bank, atms are everywhere now, you too lazy to go and withdraw, why must we suffer? Tell the companies to give better compensation for card payment, surely got more drivers willing to take.</p>
              <p>You say HK and Bangkok taxi very good, yes but do they pay by nets, credit card for journeys less than $10? You go there, you get inside in the cab you shut up and let the driver send you, here you act like king and treat the drivers like low class servants, you expect drivers to reciprocate with a smile on their face?</p>

              <p>Very true, we taxi driver not hungry enough very choosy, selfish
                  etc.</p>
              <p>But dont forget we also got take taxi. We also got experience
                  all 'these problem', but I dont wait until 11.30pm to take taxi
                  back to CCK or Woodlands, outside the CBD, send 3 or 4 my friend
                  home and then pay by card.</p>
              <p>At least i got the courtesy to go home earlier or after
                  midnight, I am not stupid to be waiting at the end of a 1 way
                  street just meters fromt he CBD zone so to save money. If I want to
                  save money then I take a train or bus home.</p>
              <p>I am not an idiot to wait 30 mins or more for a cab and then
                  grumble, write to press, blog or stomp. I wait 15-20 min, no cab,
                  take a bus somewhere further get down and take a cab where it's
                  easier.</p>
              <p>Very easy to criticise until you go drive yourself or ask your
                  family member who drive. See if it's fun to always get passenger
                  who book a cab, somemore outside CBD then hop on the 1st 1 they see
                  and not cancel, make you wait like a fool. See if it's fun to get 3
                  or 4 pax who wait until 11.25pm to catchÂ  a cab and then say
                  uncle we go hougang, sengkang 2 place and finally punggol, then
                  reach at 11.50pm, they say can pay by Nets!</p>
              <p>Yes, 1 time 2 time, 3, 4, 5, 6 time you do this it's ok but
                  becomes an everyday event, and you drive back all the way empty to
                  town and reach at 12.30 am on a weekday, town got no more pax, you
                  drive and drive maybe lucky get 1 midnight pax. Everyday, you do,
                  see fun or not, see easy or not.</p>
              <p>You see very easy or not when you need to roll your daily
                  expenses, pay for your kids, wife and yourself, pay diesel and
                  rent, all by cash but end of the shift, you only end up with $10 or
                  $20 in hand, the rest you wait for 3 day to collect.</p>
              <p>On top of that pax eat in your cab, leave droppings for you to
                  clean or for cockroaches to come, pax drunk go and vomit, argue the
                  slightest when they never say which way to go, cough in your cab
                  burp in your cab or fart in your cab, all these we must
                  tolerate.</p>
              <p>You want to take a cab, use some common sense. Dont wait at the
                  end of a 1 way street or simply 1 way streets are the worse place
                  to hail a cab in evenings. You just outside the CBD, call a cab,
                  state your destination, surely got some driver who wants to go
                  there, dont make it like a lottery never state your location, taxi
                  driver will also play lottery and not take the risk. You go
                  shopping got a lot of stuff, call for advance booking and wait for
                  your cab, not hop on the 1st available one.</p>
              <p>If raining, just too bad, we also drive in the rain and get
                  stuck in jams, we complain to who? You got money in the bank, atms
                  are everywhere now, you too lazy to go and withdraw, why must we
                  suffer? Tell the companies to give better compensation for card
                  payment, surely got more drivers willing to take.</p>
              <p>You say HK and Bangkok taxi very good, yes but do they pay by
                  nets, credit card for journeys less than $10? You go there, you get
                  inside in the cab you shut up and let the driver send you, here you
                  act like king and treat the drivers like low class servants, you
                  expect drivers to reciprocate with a smile on their face?</p>

              <p>Lots of steam-venting here. I need to let off some too!</p>
              <p>1. It's not courteous to hop on another cab after booking one without cancelling the booking. Neither it is for them to dirty the cab without cleaning up after themselves. That, I agree.</p>
              <p>2. The midnight surcharge should set in mid-trip once it's 0000 hours even if the passenger boards before midnight. If this is not the case, cab drivers should be suggesting this to the management and not blame the passengers for not "choosing the right time to go home" (which sounds ridiculous, by the way).</p>
              <p>3. I don't see why shouldn't a group of passengers share a cab. More so if cabs are not readily available for service. I'm not here to tell you to be more green, but really, getting them to split up and take separate cabs is just wasting more fuel to achieve the same objective.</p>
              <p>4. There are various reasons why someone would happen not to have sufficient cash with them. If a cab driver is unhappy with NETS payments whether it's because of the processing fees, or the processing time before he sees the money in his account, he can either:<br>a. Inform the passenger upfront that he only accepts cash payment (doing so may or may not violate the transport company's regulations)<br>b. After (a), suggest to the passengers that he'll drive them to the nearest ATM for cash withdrawal<br>c. Bring this up to the management to see if they can make arrangements to reduce the processing fee/time.</p>
              <p>If a cab driver can't even take the initiative to take this issue up to the management level, I don't see what position he has to even complain about a passenger's right (not privilege) to pay via whichever payment method allowed by the transport company his cab belongs to.</p>
              <p>5. If passengers are trying to hail a cab on the street in the rain, and all you can comment is "too bad", then you shouldn't be in the service sector.Â Do you prefer getting stuck in the jam in a vehicle orÂ to be out in the rain for half an hour?</p>
              <p>6. It's a vicious cycle. If cab drivers in general continue to provide bad service, then don't be surprised when consumers respond poorly towards them, and worst still, push all the blame onto consumers as if none of it has to do with how they conduct themselves.</p>

              <p>Lots of steam-venting here. I need to let off some too!</p>
              <p>1. It's not courteous to hop on another cab after booking one
              without cancelling the booking. Neither it is for them to dirty the
              cab without cleaning up after themselves. That, I agree.</p>
              <p>2. The midnight surcharge should set in mid-trip once it's 0000
              hours even if the passenger boards before midnight. If this is not
              the case, cab drivers should be suggesting this to the management
              and not blame the passengers for not "choosing the right time to go
              home" (which sounds ridiculous, by the way).</p>
              <p>3. I don't see why shouldn't a group of passengers share a cab.
              More so if cabs are not readily available for service. I'm not here
              to tell you to be more green, but really, getting them to split up
              and take separate cabs is just wasting more fuel to achieve the
              same objective.</p>
              <p>4. There are various reasons why someone would happen not to
              have sufficient cash with them. If a cab driver is unhappy with
              NETS payments whether it's because of the processing fees, or the
              processing time before he sees the money in his account, he can
              either:<br> a. Inform the passenger upfront that he only accepts cash payment
              (doing so may or may not violate the transport company's
              regulations)<br> b. After (a), suggest to the passengers that he'll drive them to
              the nearest ATM for cash withdrawal<br> c. Bring this up to the management to see if they can make
              arrangements to reduce the processing fee/time.</p>
              <p>If a cab driver can't even take the initiative to take this
              issue up to the management level, I don't see what position he has
              to even complain about a passenger's right (not privilege) to pay
              via whichever payment method allowed by the transport company his
              cab belongs to.</p>
              <p>5. If passengers are trying to hail a cab on the street in the
              rain, and all you can comment is "too bad", then you shouldn't be
              in the service sector.Â Do you prefer getting stuck in the jam
              in a vehicle orÂ to be out in the rain for half an hour?</p>
              <p>6. It's a vicious cycle. If cab drivers in general continue to
              provide bad service, then don't be surprised when consumers respond
              poorly towards them, and worst still, push all the blame onto
              consumers as if none of it has to do with how they conduct
              themselves.</p>

              <p><br>ya i seriously shld be thankful for my good attitude even towards lousy drivers i guess. Understand that we do have bad customers ard in sg... been in service industry and seen it try it. BUT that does not mean that we as customers have not come across lousy service provider. What alex said was fair and just imo that things are both sides. Dun blantently push everything off to the customer. I tink you should also be thankful that even though u get lousy customers u dun get dangerous customers right?</p>

              <p>Alex say we should bring to company attention&gt; Yes, very correct, But you know how many times and issues are raised by drivers tot he companies and how many times they are implemented?</p>
              <p>You think when fare are increased, rental diesel prices are raised, we are consulted?</p>
              <p>Changes to cashless payment made, are we consulted or considered?</p>
              <p>LTA make rules, are we considered? Our feedback taken and certain rules changed? Rules, even silly ones have ramained for over 30-40 years, no change, thank you for your feedback.</p>
              <p>Let me give you just 1 example: Do you know if a driver hires a taxi on his own he is NOT allowed to put changing shift when he wnats to go home?</p>
              <p>Eg: Hirer stays in AMK. He is now in Jurong or Changi and wants to end for the day. He cannot put change shift on no matter what. He cannot ask any pax who wants to go near his home location! Either he drive with for hire or busy but do not stop and ask, why? Because he got no relief means he got no change shift!</p>
              <p>That is just 1 rule. You think CBD rule who draw up? Were TD consulted, was the public feedback fully considered also?</p>

              <p>But doesnt mean I am unreasonable. Doesnt mean all pax outside CBD I ignore altogether. Sometimes I see women and children struggling or waiting under shelter in the rain, I also got stop. I see old folks or handicap doesnt mean I avoid.</p>
              <p>I will help those with lots of bags etc and the old or handicap, but if you got 2 or 3 pax, surely you can manage without my help?</p>
              <p>I may now second gues pax, I no longer stop and ask, but that doesnt mean i am dishonest. I dont overcharge or take long route and act blur. If I make a mistake no need to say, I will deduct more than whats required on the fare. Before vehicle stop, I already stop the meter, I only on when you get in.</p>
              <p>So many time pax got give me extra. 2 days ago 1 AngMo gave me 1 ten dllar bill and 1 100 bill for a twenty something fare, he mistook the 100 for another 10. I immediately returned the 100 and told him his mistake. Pax many time overpay by mistake, I will always give back. Just outside CBD, I wont press city charge only inside. Pax leave wallet, hp etc, also I return, never ask for money or reward. No need for press article or award, I dont need to rewarded for doing the right thing.</p>
