              <p>The key is motivation. I ferried a passenger from TTSH to Joo Chiat 
              today for $7.20. Minus diesel and rental I should make about $4 for that
               20 min journey. The author claims we not hungry enough... I personally 
              feel I am too hungry to carry on driving to scavenge for scraps.  Even 
              though protest in Singapore is illegal, I believe we are falling into a 
              natural reaction to low wages.... If I continue to take scraps the whole
               day.... the earnings can't get me anywhere. Look at how the hardworking
               TDs are, putting in so much effort just for another $3.... It IS a 
              clear sign that we are too hungry and chewing on grass cannot keep us 
              alive anymore. We rather expand a little more energy to get some carrot.</p>
              <p>My sentiment is if our wages do not continue to improve, it will
               get worse as the older generation of cab drivers (whom already have 
              homes bought cheap during their time and children grown up) fade away. 
              Nathan recently commented how the educated people questions his 
              leadership and how he appreciates the old and ignorant people that 
              blindly trust the government. Too bad. Many of us Singaporeans are no 
              longer ignorant like before and overwork for peanuts. The Singapore 
              government can rage it's final act against it's low waged citizens and 
              fully destroy our livelyhood and get China people to drive their cabs. 
              Or things have to change for the better for us. Based on how things have
               turned out in Singapore recent years, we might eventually be collateral
               damage for the sake of economic growth! Look at who are driving our 
              local buses!! Reports have been out. Singapore Cab drivers are the most 
              short changed in developed countries! Is that not enough to convince the
               not-so-smart Singaporeans!?!?</p>
              <p>Is there some TD from ex HR 
              profesion to tabulate the benefits and compensation schemes based on 
              time spent, effort and risks to convince people that TDs are paid 
              peanuts!? Keep feeding peanuts and I am the monkey! You have to kill 
              this monkey first, them import a rat and tell people the rat is more 
              hungry than the monkey and this rat is here to help everyone pluck 
              coconuts!</p>

              Haha it's funny don't you think? As a td, I always listen to my pax complaint about their customers their management etc. But I understand it's not like you could just go and bring it up to the management and get it striaghten out. So how do you expect a td to go tell the management then management implement the system???? Gee even CFOs or some what vp also have problems with their policies.... And just Ll sit and see lah. Or maybe suggest we td go parliment and make sure they implement our suggestion. Even some pap mp feel something wrong about the policies also LL in parliment. 
              
              Actually I would like to thank alex for his comments. Please write in to the forums or taxi operators, then yeah adjust the fares again.
              
              Going 3 places each additional stop add $2 to meter, that will solve the problem.
              
              Raining surcharge add $5 for extra insurance or to enhance td to risk an accident and drive. 
              
              Haha yes we will be a little richer then.
              
              If a coffee shop is crowded and it's the only coffeeshops there during lunch time and u need to eat what do u do???? Wait lar, or yes pick up the phone call for delivery and pay a bit more lor, and when it rains macdonalds say they won't deliver, taxi drivers must work when it rains???? Gee I think macdonalds is bigger then cdg plus trans plus premier plus smrt plus all taxi company add together.
              
              The thing is it's business, profit = business. 
              
              Why no one complain go japan taxi so expensive and yet Japanese themselves don't complain?????? 
              
              We are hungry that's why we choose. Haha get it???? You want a better paying job, you look for one, you don't just ok lar pay me cheap cheap I work like fark... And that quote is not from me, but from my customers....

              <p>No matter how much I earn as a cabby, I do not feel rich. </p>
              <p>1. Being rich means being able to go for 2 week December holiday with whole family to places like USA or Japan, and checking into first or business class.</p>
              <p>The last I remembered, I was sending HDB folks for their December holidays. I felt damn fucking poor.</p>
              <p>2. Being rich means I am able to get the concierge of my UOB Privilege Reserve membership to book an airport departure in a maxicab or private viano, and pay $45-$65 per trip without a wink. Nevermind my pickup location is Jalan Minyak or some rental house in Circuit Road because my rich parents live in Ridley Park, Tanglin Hill, etc.</p>
              <p>The last I remembered, I was busily collecting this fare. But ask me pay hor, I will be sweating.</p>
              <p>So how to feel rich? Rich means being able to pay top dollars for first class service. The bugger who is doing the collection of that "BIG MONEY" is just a poor man.</p>
              <p>What MAN, $65 per airport departure was BIG MONEY? That made me felt like a bankrupt!!!</p>
              <p>Fetching rich people makes me feel so poor. Very very poor.</p>

              <p>The key is motivation. I ferried a passenger from TTSH to Joo
              Chiat today for $7.20. Minus diesel and rental I should make about
              $4 for that 20 min journey. The author claims we not hungry
              enough... I personally feel I am too hungry to carry on driving to
              scavenge for scraps.  Even though protest in Singapore is
              illegal, I believe we are falling into a natural reaction to low
              wages.... If I continue to take scraps the whole day.... the
              earnings can't get me anywhere. Look at how the hardworking TDs
              are, putting in so much effort just for another $3.... It IS a
              clear sign that we are too hungry and chewing on grass cannot keep
              us alive anymore. We rather expand a little more energy to get some
              carrot.</p>
              <p>My sentiment is if our wages do not continue to improve, it will
              get worse as the older generation of cab drivers (whom already have
              homes bought cheap during their time and children grown up) fade
              away. Nathan recently commented how the educated people questions
              his leadership and how he appreciates the old and ignorant people
              that blindly trust the government. Too bad. Many of us Singaporeans
              are no longer ignorant like before and overwork for peanuts. The
              Singapore government can rage it's final act against it's low waged
              citizens and fully destroy our livelyhood and get China people to
              drive their cabs. Or things have to change for the better for us.
              Based on how things have turned out in Singapore recent years, we
              might eventually be collateral damage for the sake of economic
              growth! Look at who are driving our local buses!! Reports have been
              out. Singapore Cab drivers are the most short changed in developed
              countries! Is that not enough to convince the not-so-smart
              Singaporeans!?!?</p>
              <p>Is there some TD from ex HR profesion to tabulate the benefits
              and compensation schemes based on time spent, effort and risks to
              convince people that TDs are paid peanuts!? Keep feeding peanuts
              and I am the monkey! You have to kill this monkey first, them
              import a rat and tell people the rat is more hungry than the monkey
              and this rat is here to help everyone pluck coconuts!</p>

              <p>I am fretting coz I really kindda like the job. Amonst the arses you meet, there are some pax that make your day. But the kindda money we are making can't get us anywhere. The anywhere I seek is a more secure financial plan for my family needs. The risk reward being a TD in my opinion is very high. I actually fell into this trade after hearing all the "jin ho tan" stories. Now I gotten into it and realise the "jin ho tan" is actually 12 hrs a day, 7 days a week. If work reasonable hrs will ensure sufficient meals for myself and some reasonable leisure with no savings.  Until things change for the better, for the time being I just work like a dog..... I am starting to la kopi more and more during those hrs I make $8/hr. That is 8+8 mins of scouting time and trip of $6 + $6 minus off diesel and rental.</p>
              <p>You already heard our government's theory. They want hungry people. Its has always been carefully planned to ensure minimal wage is paid out in Singapore to ensure "efficiency". And they sucessfully breed some into thinking that's all they ever deserve. As long as there are enough happy people, wages will remain low. But I know too big a percentage of older generations are fixed with a "be contented with whatever is spared for you" mindset. Until these people eventually dissappear, perhaps enough resentment will force a change. Nice finding a place to howl after 12 hrs of scavenging. The day might come when the dogs are fed proper and form a true pack rather than the starving dogs chewing each other's heads off.... really too long hours... my mind's messed up now... need to find one corner and lick my balls....</p>

              <p>The last I remembered, I was busily collecting this fare. But
              ask me pay hor, I will be sweating.</p>
              <p>So how to feel rich? Rich means being able to pay top dollars
              for first class service. The bugger who is doing the collection of
              that "BIG MONEY" is just a poor man.</p>
              <p>What MAN, $65 per airport departure was BIG MONEY? That made me
              felt like a bankrupt!!!</p>
              <p>Fetching rich people makes me feel so poor. Very very poor.</p>

              <p>Aiyo bro,</p>
              <p>This month is a <strong>great month for Maxi</strong> TDs... even @ airport are mega fast for Maxi Q.... don't have to compare this and that with <strong>RICH LOADED</strong> passengers.... <span style="color: #0000ff;">we are in different leagues</span>.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>But if you compare with other professionals within your TD industry,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> you are already a <strong>head star</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span></strong> becos I know how much a Maxi TDs make in December. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I have been to HK a couple of times.... economy ticket (in Dec) cost ard $8xx.  business class at 2.6x more @ $2,215.  First Class @ $4,300... 5.3 times of economy.... different of more than $3,500.  I rather spend the different in the meals &amp; stays in Hong Kong over the flight class....anyway it is only 3hrs 45mins away from Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>
              <p>For many passengers whom travelled 1st class / business class,<span style="color: #0000ff;"> their flights are paid by their companies</span>.  If coming out from their own pockets.... they will prefer to pay less...or even take budget airlines<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">... (except for those with no more empty space to squeeze in access $$$<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">).</p>
              <p>So, it is really difficult to compare all the time.... never going to end... <span style="color: #0000ff;">Just be contented with your lifestyle</span> and <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>feel RICH</strong> in your own ways</span>....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p>I am fretting coz I really kindda like the job. Amonst the arses
              you meet, there are some pax that make your day. But the kindda
              money we are making can't get us anywhere. The anywhere I seek is a
              more secure financial plan for my family needs. The risk reward
              being a TD in my opinion is very high. I actually fell into this
              trade after hearing all the "jin ho tan" stories. Now I gotten into
              it and realise the "jin ho tan" is actually 12 hrs a day, 7 days a
              week. If work reasonable hrs will ensure sufficient meals for
              myself and some reasonable leisure with no savings.  Until
              things change for the better, for the time being I just work like a
              dog..... I am starting to la kopi more and more during those hrs I
              make $8/hr. That is 8+8 mins of scouting time and trip of $6 + $6
              minus off diesel and rental.</p>
              <p>You already heard our government's theory. They want hungry
              people. Its has always been carefully planned to ensure minimal
              wage is paid out in Singapore to ensure "efficiency". And they
              sucessfully breed some into thinking that's all they ever deserve.
              As long as there are enough happy people, wages will remain low.
              But I know too big a percentage of older generations are fixed with
              a "be contented with whatever is spared for you" mindset. Until
              these people eventually dissappear, perhaps enough resentment will
              force a change. Nice finding a place to howl after 12 hrs of
              scavenging. The day might come when the dogs are fed proper and
              form a true pack rather than the starving dogs chewing each other's
              heads off.... really too long hours... my mind's messed up now...
              need to find one corner and lick my balls....</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Ya. Might be offensive to some. I try often to get my point across without upsetting anyone. Frankly, "Jin ho tan" and "be contented" are main ingredients to low wage. I was trying to do my maths. Didn't work out. Plus got scathed on the rear bumper @ viviocity by a sonata today driven by a retard. His "reasoning" was I alighted pax on left lane and should stay @ left lane and got no right to get out. Then all I remembered was i started barking and he said sorry and hmm... now my balls are clean. I go sleep now, maybe i can start thinking like a man again. Good day to you.</p></div>
