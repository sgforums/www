                              <p>In New York and most major US cities, taxis come with bullet
              proof glass, shielding the pax at the rear and the driver. No front
              seat pax, unless if driver allows. (or maybe they got seating rules
              only for rear)</p>
              <p>Anyway, logbook is only $30 fine and that also if you leave many
              days unaccounted for. But if you got log in MDT, usually they will
              waive.</p>
              <p>Anyway all this every common one, just ask the old timers,
              everytime, there is a demand of taxis by hirers, and/or some
              complaints by pax, LTA will be super on the ball.</p>
              <p>When there are lots of empty cabs parked in variosu depots, LTA
              disappear liao. Their thinking someone once told (from there
              department) - taxi driving is a very lucrative business, therefore
              they need to enforce their rules. Only during SARS, 1997-8, 2008
              market crashes, then it becomes un-lucrative, and LTA will
              relax.</p>
              <p>Still who cares, I still drive with slippers, only when driving
              Azera, I am forced into wearing shoes. (but without socks, of
              course!)</p>

              <p>This is what happens when unverified stories get retold and retold. From a small issue it becomes into big issue.</p>
              <p>Let me assure you, as I got this summons once, the fine is no where close to $100, it is somewhere from $30-50. I cannot tell exactly because when I got summons, I got 3 - 1 for not displaying pass, 1 for not updating and 1 for smoking - I think total was $115 for 3.</p>
              <p>In the end, I only got fined $35 for the smoking offence, the other 2 were waived after I raised a storm of protest.</p>
              <p>Why? Because who says must write at the start? Why can't write at the end?  Are we in the military or police? Go check randomly any Govt vehicle, see how many will write the name and mileage at the start? If you can find 20% considered very good liao.</p>
              <p>As long as you verified yourself before starting that the last entry matches the numbers of the odometer, you can proceed. Thereafter when finishing you can add in your details.</p>
              <p>As for name, if your driver name Lee and you are the only relief and your name is Tan, when you write down Alex Tan, instead of Tan Kok Kiong (for eg), what's the problem? How many other Tans are driving the cab besides you and the hirer?</p>

              <p>This one no need scared one and listen to rumours. You follow the rules as best you can, small allowances will always be given to ensure compliance, no need for strict to the last letter kind of detail or enforcement.</p>
              <p>Why do some LTA officers act like this? Well this is a very common syndrome, that all policemen (current and former) will attest. It's called the 'I wanna be like a Cop Syndrome'.</p>
              <p>Some ppl, be they security guards, Auxilliary and other govt department officers who have some form enforcement power (which also all police officers have), wanna make full use of their limited powers to enforce the laws, to the the last letter without any room for leeway or common-sense. They think just because the law states something, it means literally like that - 100%, no room for argument. But what they don't realise the Law also got exceptions for certain cases, and there's such things like the spirit of the law - if you observed the law but the manner you went about it, isn't 100%, maybe 80%, then you will not be summoned or fined etc.</p>
              <p>So when LTA officers say, cannot write Alex Tan, when you the only Tan driving, plus your id is entered in the MDT, the handwriting is the same, and the hirer also calls you Alex, then you know the officer is suffering from the syndrome. Even if summoned, once you appeal and make a fuss, inform you will also write to Minister, CEO of LTA etc etc, automatically, common-sense will prevail.</p>
              <p>And we are only TDs, not army regulars or policemen, we don't need to follow 100% military discipline. In the Army if your supervisory NCO or officer say must fill up before starting, then you must fill up before starting, that's an order. In civilian life, as long as you fill up within a reasonable time during your or just after your tour and before the other guy takes over, it's ok and very acceptable.</p>
