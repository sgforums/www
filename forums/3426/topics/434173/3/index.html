              of Savanna condopark.</p>
              <p>fare was $11.20. the small girl gave me $10 and started digging

              <p>Suay suay I saw them again and picked them again to same place

              From iTODAY:Taxi fare not paid, passenger goes free
              
              Letter from Ong Swee Huat | Jul 29, 2011 6:00 AM
              
              LAST week, a passenger - who is a foreigner - refused to pay the S$7.80 taxi fare.
              
              I then drove her to a police post. As I was lodging a report, she ransacked the glove apartment while in my taxi. This was witnessed by an officer.
              
              The police asked the passenger to pay but she refused repeatedly. They asked for her passport or a valid document but she said she did not have any on her and gave only a telephone number.
              
              She was allowed to go free despite all this.
              
              I was told by the police to contact my taxi company for assistance and that it was "a small matter and the police have bigger roles".
              
              My company's response later was: There is nothing it could do (although it is willing to compensate the amount).
              
              I asked the police, for instance, about the lack of checks on whether my passenger had valid documents to stay in Singapore and what protection there is for cabbies who face such incidents.
              
              The police replied that the offence of not paying taxi fare comes under the Land Transport Authority for enforcement and that such an offence "does not allow police officers to arrest without a warrant", which was why the officers "had no legal grounds to detain the passenger".
              
              The reply also stated: The officers had followed procedures "by ensuring there was no breach of peace and that the particulars of both parties involved were obtained".
              
              I am shocked and indignant to see such injustice - the irresponsible act of letting a non-fare paying passenger go without punishment and the callous remarks made at the police post.
              
              The issue is this: How will this help eradicate a frustrating situation that innocent and hardworking taxi drivers face in Singapore?

              Quoted from the SINGAPORE Statutes :
              
              Chapter 259B of the PUBLIC TRANSPORT COUNCIL ACT
              
              Section 24D - don't think you can just run away from the TAXI without
              
              paying. Better Think again.
              
              EXTRACT :
              
              PUBLIC TRANSPORT COUNCIL ACT
              
              (CHAPTER 259B)
              
              
              Failure to pay taxi fare
              
              24D. Any person who, having made use of a taxi service and without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to pay the fare as indicated on the taximeter shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 and, in the case of a second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

              So which authority here in Singapore can help our poor Taxi Drivers whose passenger refused to pay at the End of Trip. I feel that the Singapore Police Force did not handle the case properly. As a law enforcer, they should have a solutions to excecute the charge of PTC Act 259B. If the authority don't apply the right S.O.P, then who will be helping the citizens here which look like being bullied by Foreigners. It is such ashame and embarrassing to hear Policeman had no way to detain people for commiting a crime or issues a charge to them. Then the authority is wasting the tax payees money, foreigners will take this excuse for not paying taxi fares.

              No thanks to Mr SH ong for exposing this in the public. I guess more people will use this tactic after reading the flaw.
              
              For the road sweeper brothers out there, you have to be more careful now.

              <p>It is not my first time handling such idiots. I never drive them to the police station. Waste of my time. What with sending them to a their requested destination for free, and then to the nearest NPP for free some more? Only to see those chee bye kia police who cannot arrest the non-paying pax? If I am an MP, anything also can constitute an arrestable offense. For ordinary citizens with no connections to the government, anything without bloodshed or physical theft is non-arrestable.</p>
              <p>Pax who do not pay? Scolding them first. If it does not work, threaten them in the most aggressive and provocative manner until they attempt to run away or hit you. Then you return them the favour but avoid bruising them in self-defense. By this time, the pax sure pay already. If they still have not (never encounter such case before), then call for police and claim either he hammer you or that he tried running away after grabbing your money, and now you got a pax who has committed an arrestable offense. Never say pax never pay for service because police cannot arrest them.</p>
              <p>Its the same for those "eat first pay later" food establishments, but consider yourself lucky because food outlets cannot change location, so they must eat humble pie and let these idiots off, or change business model to "pay first eat later". But we as TD do not station at the same place everyday, so we can afford and must teach these idiots a lesson. If we dont, then those old taxi uncles are really the ones to suffer. There is a time and place for using force on people. The police cannot encourage it. They will never publicly ask people to hammer others for any reason. Their public stance will always be to call the police. Never act alone. But they forgot to tell you that there are crimes which can be committed without any consequences. No need to even produce their IC or passport. Like I told you guys before. The police got no right to force you to show IC or passport, unless you are at customs checkpoint.</p>

              From iTODAY:Police actions were appropriate
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â Letter from Lau Kian Keong Assistant Director, Public Affairs Department, Singapore Police Force | Jul 30, 2011 6:00 AM
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â We refer to Mr Ong Swee Huat's letter, "Taxi fare not paid, passenger goes free" (July 29). Our enquiry revealed that this was a dispute between Mr Ong and his passenger.
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â The officer handling the incident intervened in the dispute and prevented the situation from escalating. Both parties were also interviewed.
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â According to the passenger, she refused to pay the taxi fare, as Mr Ong took her to the wrong destination: Boat Quay instead of Boon Keng. The passenger provided the officer with valid contact details as well as her particulars, which were verified.
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â In the process, both parties were advised to keep the peace and to settle the matter amicably.
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â The failure to pay taxi fares falls under Section 24D of the Public Transport Council Act, Chapter 259B, which is a non-arrestable offence if the identities of the parties are known.
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â The police officer attending to the case had to act within the confines of the law. He, therefore, advised Mr Ong on how he could seek recourse on the unpaid fare from his taxi company.
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â Regarding his dispute with the passenger, he was informed that he could lodge a complaint before a magistrate should he wish to pursue the matter further. The magistrate, after considering the facts presented, may then direct the police to take further action in the case.
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â -------------------------------------------------
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â 
              Â Â  Â  Â  Â Singapore Police Force reply so fast, and now throw this matter to the magistrate court if the TD want to persue the case to recover the fare. Poor Mr Ong should next time call Shin Ming or Wan Bao, at least the press will pay him $50 for providing his story to print out in the night papers. Nowadays the authorities got their good way to siam, so nothing serious, we ppl better don't waste their precious time.Â 
              Â Â Â 
              Lastly, get your passenger to tell you the correct destination, if not they don't pay your fare. If they say Bedok, dun bring them to Geylang, Okay??!!!

              this might sounds shiok but be careful might backfire on the driver. if passenger is female, end up the police on the spot thank you for driving over surrendering yourself to the police station and will detain you on the spot once the passenger point finger at you claim she molested, anything else argue later none of their problem. at that point, its your turn to beg her to ask her how much she wants hehehe.. if its a fight between 2 persons, the police will detain both, but from what i experience, they usually side with the party that they believe more, like white collar or decent looking, usually they dont have good impression of TDs. if theres a dispute, the passenger might claim it was the driver who was aggressive and provoke them, then to the driver surpise, the police might take harsher attitude towards the driver instead, and worse if the driver cannot show proof or witness, they might ask the driver to see doctor if necessary and then pursue it privately himself. if the driver make more noise, they will warn him in front of the passenger not to make public nuisance or risk charged, that he should be luck they letting him off because the passenger no longer wish to pursue the matter and just want to go home him or herself. dont laugh ok its true!

            <div class='col-md body'>even beggars one level above taxi drivers, because they can sit around and dont have to do anything they might get paid. taxi drivers have to keep moving and do everything from start to end and still might not get paid! joke!</div>

              <p>Looking at it, pax will always have the upper hand. Not satisfied with taxi, complain to company or LTA, then driver kenna kopi, fine or revoke of licence. Dun even need police involved. One email will do the job.</p>
              <p>Driver face problem, wonder if the company or LTA ban the pax from taking taxis? Anyone heard or experience help from company or LTA against pax?</p>
