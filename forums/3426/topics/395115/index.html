              <p>Crysler or Silver Arrow is better for OMO? I really like Crysler both exterior and interior alot more than the Silver Arrow, but I heard the Arrow is faster, but when I see the word SILVER, I <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> liao</p>
              <p>Anyone can share the lobang for both?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And btw, what can do with a Casino Chip? I picked up a previous passenger from the Casino because that last time he forgot his passport, that night he purposedly parked his Lambo just outside the Casino becos he is very upset they dont allow him to pay the $100 and insist to see his passport. Hes damn fedup. Then I chat with him along the way, we both laughed like crazy and I offered to wait for him to pick up his passport so he can head back to the Casino. Then that night he said he won big (i recalled he said his favourite game that hes very good at is poker), lucky they didnt let him go in earlier! He then gave me the chip he said I also made him feel alot better along the way becos he had actually wanted to f off liao</p>
