              <p><br> Firstly, there is no more such thing as poor resale value, korean
              had in a way make the japanese down on their kneel, most Jap car
              sale reported less profitable or loss in their P/L report. It is
              good to see so many of these cars around from different source,
              competition benefit the consumer at large.</p>
              <p>I remember long ago when I visited Borneo Motor to look for
              toyota brand, the sales guys are as proud as the statue of Stamford
              Raffles,</p>
              <p>Just few week ago,</p>
              <p>I just happen to be there for van servicing next door, as I step
              into their show room, I was immediately treated to a free buffet,
              free test drive with free gift, end up, I did not buy anything and
              yet still get a bow and lots of thank you. You could see the
              competition from the koreans is no joke, from Kia, to hyundai to
              samsung, LG, you name it.</p>
              <p>When I was in Busan, Hyundai Shipbuilding and Yard as a seamen,
              the koreans told me, their main objective is to beat and down
              Japan, because by taking down Japan, they know they would had taken
              the world. So, with that motto, they strive ON.</p>
              <p>And FYI, taxi driving is a profession, we do not need to be
              professional, we are the professional taxi driver, but the problem
              is, the public in Singapore do not take us as professional TD. So,
              no matter how you want us to be professional as we already are, if
              the public do not acknowledge it, some treat us as the lower rung
              of the society, what can we do?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I'm sorry, but I have to clarify on the resale value matter; While it is true that the resale value of new Korean cars have increased a great deal in the last decade, the stats will show that new and old Japanese cars still have a much higher resale value in most Asia- Pacific countries. Not because Japanese cars are really THAT good, but because of the naive perception of the Asian people who are unwilling to accept the fact that the era of the Japanese car (1975-1995) has come and truly gone. Even if Korean cars are as good or better than Japanese cars today, it will not make a big difference if the people are unwillingly to recognise the reality. This kind of mentality will only change with the passing of time and generations. </p>
              <p>As for the taxi driver profession part; I strongly agree with what you said. It's the people who make the real difference here. So it's up to each and every one of us to change this social stigma in favour of our taxi drivers then. </p>

              <p>Personally I honestly believe that our taxis will 1 day be
              fleeted with China made cars.</p>
              <p>I remember in the 80s and 90s, people mocked Korean cars, now
              they are of really good standard, not as good as some premium
              Japanese makes but they can hold their own in most makes.</p>
              <p>So Chinese cars will grow in stature. While like many of you, I
              am somewhat angry with the influx of FTs and like you complain
              about them (Chinamen), I have nothing but the highest regard for
              China as an industrial and economic power.</p>
              <p>China has grown leaps and bounds, their vehicle and auto
              industry is bound to follow suit sooner or later, and we know taxi
              companies will always go for a cheaper model, hence my view of
              Chinese taxis say in 10-15 years time.</p>
              <p>But in no case, should we ever buy Indian made vehicles (that's
              another story altogether).</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Same here. I have a feeling that a large majority of developing and newly developed countries will fall to the allure of Chinese made cars in the next few years. Already you can observe this phenomena in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. </p>
              <p>Why not Indian vehicles too ? I've seen some of their recent ones and they're quite okay really. Comparable to some Chinese cars. No doubt they're terrible compared to even the worst of the Korean cars today, but as far as I'm concerned, Indian and Chinese cars share common motives.</p>

              <p>LOL okay, I respect your take on the subject, as with everyone elses.</p>
              <p>Toyotas are durable alright, but at what cost ? In business, it's about profits and efficiency. If someone else can do it better, then there's no reason saying no. For now, Toyota may be king, but next decade, it could be anyone's guess.</p>

              <p>Why toyota and Nissan make thailand the detroit of Asia, because
              of cheap labour, within the cost of Japanese wage bills, toyota and
              Nissan cannot make it, and fyi, Nissan is now under Renault, so in
              order to stay competitive, they had shifted to Thailand their
              assembly lines. The money generated still flow back to Japan.</p>
              <p>In 70s and 80s, with Deming productivity ideology, the Japanese
              are no doubt, nos 1, but since 90s, because of the change in their
              youth thinking, whom are not as hardworking with a samurai attitude
              like their father, work less and are more interested in animation,
              av models, PS3 and so on than in engineering, and at the same time
              demanded higher wages, till now, the Jap is underperforming. Of
              course, cheap labour in china do play a part. And FYI, Volvo is now

              <p>Agreed somewhat. You have been keeping up with reality, give yourself a pat on the back. VERY FEW people in Southeast Asia are willing to accept the fact that the Japanese, no matter their acclaimed history, have slacked greatly in the past 10-20 years. Most of us are all still sticking with the '' Japanese car/tv/girls are always superior '' mentality. The reality is so very different. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Fair enough. Although the initial motion in my first post
              specified '' comfort (budget) '' taxis, there is no reason why we
              should oppose '' VIP (luxury) '' taxis for countries and cities
              with high- per capita income like Singapore. There is clearly a
              market for such a service. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
