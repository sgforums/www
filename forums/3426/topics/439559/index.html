              <p>There iwas  this ang mo at Holland V TS, it was a long Q, when it was his turn and my cab was in the front, he asked me to wait, he then pushed out a wheelchair old pax with his old wife, he said, "Sir, can you take them, I only Q for them, I am not taking your cab" Quickly, I get down to unfold the chair, put it into the back, the Q was quite long, but no taxis, I shaked the hand of this ang mo and told him, "If more are like you sir, this world will be a much better place to be"</p>

              <p>My wife also says if I do that next time when I wheel chair bound then my retribution will come when no one take me. Please lah. I will always book a taxi next time if I old liao must sit wheel chair. Got money scare no taxi sit meh?</p>
              <p>Those children who, taking their wheel chair parents pleae book a cab. KNN so unfillial, few dollars also want to save end up your parents have to wait and smell smoke at the road side. Dun be a cheapo lah, your parents bring you up but you still want to save the few dollars booking fee?</p>
              <p>But hor I see wheel chair I also take lah. Bcos those pax are the ones who will appreciate your service. Ferry them around also happy. They will usually thank you. I will round down the fare for them. At least better then those NTUC, SS fully loaded trolleys. Those kind take liao will spoil your whole day.</p>

              <p>Dun care got good trip or not. When your pick them and they appreciate your kindness that alone can brightens our days. Actually I also dun understand why people dun take them. Ok mah, just need to load up a wheel chair. Not like that full trolley type KNN confirm more then 10 over plastic bag and you will never knows what is inside them.</p>
              <p>And those move house ones is more KNN super cheapo dun want to call mover. Cos mover at least charge them $50 minimum. If alot of things they take cab 3-4 trips if within same estate they dun even need to pay $30. Phuii....</p>

              <p>Well, Aln's post, I agree with, especially if its peak hour.  I will only stop for those if they are accompanied with able adults who can help them into and out of the cab.  Else, sorry...</p>

              My driving philosophy for such cases is clear cut ...
              
              You pay me , i'll do it .
              
              They cannot flag for me , wait til i load all wheelchairs on board and tell me : " Tee ar , i no money , can sent free to my house ?"
              
              No way , i am not a charity man .
              
              Comfort got a hot line booking to do charity , not TransCab .

              <p>Fare must collect, on the other hand, some even want to give me tips for picking them up, Isay no, you keep it. It is not much on retribution, whatever was seeded, is past, we must be compassionate both as a driver and human, and you have to agree that such compassion shown is cashless, no money in this world can buy it. The feeling of giving a seat to a old person or disable person give you the utmost emotion and feeling that no amount of money can buy, and you keep that deep inside you, nobody can take that away, whether you gain from it or not by doing good deed, accept no return.</p>
              <p>Destiny is in yr hand, it all up there in your mind, you choose to be TD, so be it, but you can also choose to be a bartender, baker, cook or a GM if you want to be, alway remember that there is a choice in Life, and the destiny premediate that choice you undertake. The mind alway like to see what the eyes want to see, what the brain want to think and where the body wanted to go. If you can control your mind over the body, you will be better as a person. That is why people use to say Change your mindset. But it is not easy.</p>
              <p>Your ability, strength, characteristic and past, conditioned you to be what you are today. It is like a destination you want to go, and how you want to go about getting there is up to you, on the way, you may divert or change direction, and that destination can or cannot be reach is still subjectives, but if you are determine, focus and be objectives of what you want, you can get it provided is it achieveable and within your means. Meaning you need to know your strength and weakness, spell them out truthfully.</p>
              <p>Whatever you pick, strike or get out of a sudden is said to be Luck and some called it coincidences.</p>
