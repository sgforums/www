              said, "Sir, can you take them, I only Q for them, I am not taking
              your cab" Quickly, I get down to unfold the chair, put it into the
              back, the Q was quite long, but no taxis, I shaked the hand of this
              ang mo and told him, "If more are like you sir, this world will be

              i share a wheelchair story one driver told me. reader decide.
              
              he saw 1 middle age woman with older wheelchair pax at roadside so he thought he helpful. but the moment he stop and open door he know big mistake
              
              the middle age woman start to curse and swear at him maybe because temper no good or cannot get cab
              
              the middle age woman insists the driver must load the older wheelchair pax inside because she no strength, then he found out the older wheelchair pax very guai lan also, cannot touch here cannot knock there, must be very gentle and slowly and comfortably. end up he struggle half day sweating, the middle age woman already sit inside using only eye, mouth and finger power.
              
              the middle age woman also shout him to load the wheelchair carefully without damage else they wont pay cab fare and will complain his company to pay for any damage.
              
              along the way the two pax inside the taxi complain the cab looks very lousy not as new and shiny, keep complaining very hot will fall sick demand driver up aircon bigger then bigger somemore. every road along the way they make sarcastic remark driver waste their time want to cheat their money, but they wont listen.
              
              at the end, the driver told me, at first he take the job to help people, end up he do charity, he didnt take their money because he didnt want them any excuse to report police or company in case something happen to them right after they alight, or they might say he try to be funny or rude
              
              so after that, he never take any wheelchair pax again unless its someone he knows like friend or regular

              <p>I think your friend he is a timid driver, as TD, as long as logical, you can lecture pax anytime, be it wheelchair or no wheelchair, if you are timid, shy and paiseh type, you cannot make much, those lousy paxs will find way to eat you.</p>
              <p>My view is, if this is true, this middle age and wheel chair women had long plotted to get a free ride. If it is me, I will tell them, if you want a free ride, say so, do not need to waste time shouting and flare temper, not happy, can get down, I can place the wheelchair nicely, call police if you want, copy my nos if you want, but do not come and play with me.</p>

              ok next time i see that driver i tell him your "brave" idea
              one thing, taxi drivers always have a lot "brave" ideas when they kaypoh comment, but when come to ownself, dont know where hide under whose mother skirt already hahaha. dun mind the pun bowah not directed at you but general taxi drivers lah

              <p>Haha, quite true brother, one thing for sure, when we ply the road, we are alway alone, and being alone, the brave factor tends to lower abit, 2 paxs alone can overcome us anytime, we are actually very prone to accuses and complain, but being alone gives us and yet need to service for $$, sometime, we hv to bite the bullet and drive on. Who knows the hardship and plight of TD than he who drives? Nobody gives a damn, as nobody owes you a living.</p>
              <p>If in a coffeeshop, you and me and a few other brothers are together, we tends to be more brave and dare to challenge anyone now there to said bad about cabby. Just like Man U, without the unity, a single Rooney can kick grass, same goes to a firefigher, if he is alone in the mid of the fire, he is very much at risk to be burnt.</p>

              <p>it's a mistake to help the wheelchair pax into the taxi. if anything bad happens while you are helping him/her into the taxi, you sure jiat beh liao.</p>
