              <p>No lah, I think to stay young, you need a very positive thinking, alway be humorous, eat less salty food which most middle age men love, less fatty food and hopefully if can, less outside food. Salty foods lead to hair loss and many other problems. And of course smoking and drinking as all of us know, is bad for health.</p>
              <p>As we age, our tongues begin to lose those taste buds, it will command more salt, more chilli, more oily, and more junky foods. Do not get tricked by your tongue.</p>
              <p>And then, most of us do not groom ourselves enough, it could be due to our living style, like me, the ah beng type, but like it or not, like a fish or plant, if you want to nurture it, you need to groom it well. Wash and take care, do some light exercise few times a week, and if can do good meditation, it will be perfect, but please do not meditate until siao.</p>
              <p>You can groom your cab, service it well, drive properly and maintain good condition, but if you fail to groom yourself, then too bad, you should learn to take care of yourself before you can care for any non living things.</p>
              <p>Postiive thinking involve a very enlightened mind, you need to be able to think out of the box and have a good knowledge of social life in SIngapore, how the rich behave, how the poor behave and how you look at thing from different perspective, it call for a very imaginative and creativity mind. And to nourish it, you need to be adaptable to suffering, stress and unhappy moment, once you accept that, suffering become a path for learning, stress become good stress, and unhappy moment become a just a norm in our day in and out life.</p>

              <p><br>The easiest way to positive thinking is to think down more than think up.</p>
              <p>So you are the TD, someone wearing tie and smart shirt order you here and there, you feel belittled to tell yourself</p>
              <p>"Fark lah, me only Taxi driver, knn, howcome people can go posh office, drive mercs, got nice office ladies, travel first class, and I farking no use, just a TD, one of those job that might had fallen thru the social fabric of the ever costly society"</p>
              <p>Well, if you have the ambitious and the time left, you can be like them, go upgrade yourself, but I guess most of us including me will think, siao ar? go back study for fark, so you end up getting frustrated most of the time, and frustration come with stress, high blood pressure and bad temper just waiting to flare, which could make you worst than what you are now, a TD.</p>
              <p>By thinking down, you think people who work as cleaners, the old guards, the workers and many more singaporeans who are scrapping their daily life as it goes by, the handicap, the unfortunate ones from illness to poor health, or peoples who had been a top person but end up caught up with the laws and everthing is gone for them</p>
              <p>Once you think of all these people, you feel you are actually, good, earning an honest living, serving others, a contributor to the society and certainly, a helping hand to those handicap and childrens who needs to go home. Then perhap, you can sit up and drive with more pride and confident by telling yourself "Nabei, driver taxis, driver taxis lor, own time own target, can see here and there, and at time can fark paxs, not bad after all"</p>
              <p>And as you drive happily, you smile and laugh more often, ultimately your facial nerves will perk up more and you can see people telling you, "wha lau, you look good men" that would mean, you are an enligthened TD</p>
