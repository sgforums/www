              Story not very clear
                  
              Pax  offer to pay extra 12 on top of the meter 
                  
              Reach destination your meter fare reflect 14 plus include the peak hour but have not add
                  
              The extra 12 which was being offer right?
                  
              So pax is not happy to pay the extra 12 offer to get a taxi or pax is not happy about the
                  
              Meter fare which reflect 14plus? 
                  
              Anyway for the,  I normally collect it as extra consider pax offer, never reflect in the meter.
                  
                  
              Cos to me it is pax offer, not a request by me.

              <p>I got the similar incident fom Ap T3 on eve of CNY. PRC  pax came out from door with 3 trollies and 3 person. On that trollies they are two  huge picture frame and 4 big bags.  This case confirmed cannot go in unless I put down my 3rd row. I am now in normal queue and so why I must put all his barang barang when I know there are no extra. I told PRC pax politely that he needs two taxis to put all his barang. He said No. So I said no deal .</p>
              <p>PRC pax still insist If he wants this MPV taxi I told him that this a MPV counter which charges $60 flat rate .I tried to reason but he still insist I must take him or otherwise he wants to complain . So I said carry on and PRC pax took some pictures with his phone .So I assume he has stayed here for quite some time and knows the system . My next pax happen to be with golf bags which can put into my taxi without putting down the 3rd row.  At lease I drive this pax without feeling heart pain.</p>
              <p>So today office call me and ask me what happed. So I told them the story. They told me I have to take the pax no matter what. So if thats the case I will take whatever fine they want to give me if there is any . So I support you bro. PRC pax are troublesome and we must be wary of them. God knows if how many PRCs like them   are coming to Singapore by 2030.</p>

              <p>I think Pax initially agreed to pay $12 + Meter.</p>
              <p>So Terry enter $12 into the "Extra" (Surcharge) part of meter.</p>
              <p>But peak hour then kicked in to the $12 extra included 25% surcharge so end up "Extra" shows $14+</p>
              <p>Pax not happy cos he only agree to $12 + meter. but meter shows $12 + 25% + Meter.</p>

              Not that I like PRC paxs,,, but in TS case think this pax hv a point. Imagine agreeing to extras of $12 then turn out to be $14. Its more to do with the presentation of taximeter...
              
              
              Think now that many periods of the day hv 25% surcharge or 50% surcharge,,, the top main fare column shud just show the total fare to be collectedâ€¦i.e. as standard fare liao. 
              
              Then during off-peak, fare shud be presented as â€œoff-peak discountâ€� given... Tat way paxs will be happier rather than to see so many surcharge added. I got no specific/practical suggestion on this thoâ€¦
