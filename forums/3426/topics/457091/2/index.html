              <p>Should we be responsible for EVERY accusation pax made? Especially at the result of paying less or even not paying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What if pax claim that your car suspension is bad, causing them injury on their spinal, asking you for a compensation?</p>
              <p>What is pax claim that your diesel engine is too loud, causing them with hearing issue, asking you for medical fees?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't kar lang kar bo when treaten to complaint......... let them find their way to reflect their intention, let the company/LTA or even judge to verify it, and we just got to sit and wait, and later decide are we going to accept the..... outcome.</p>

              <p>It up to individual, if you come and tell us pax said slowly meter jump faster, than go prove it yourself and also to the pax, of course for you and me, we sure to ignore such comment, but my post is typically for brother foolsh, not everyone.</p>
              <p>If really want to go technically, the rotation of the wheel determine the distance travelled, so it is 2 pie Radius in calculation of circumferences of circle, given the wheel perimeter is lay out on a platform, the cirucmferences shall be the distance of a wheel, then from there you place the length to 400m, fast or slowly also the same.</p>
              <p>Therefore if a pax is to tell me that taxis slow, meter jump faster, taxis faster, meter jump slower, I will tell them, taxis slow, you can reach your destination safe, taxis fast, you and me can go join Mr Ma.</p>
              <p>To pax who threaten that they go complain, I alway tell them, lai lai, we welcome complain, it alway improve us, we take it as a feedback for improvement note, the mouth and hand belong to you, you can say or write whatever you like, just make sure it is factual, truth and justitable.</p>
              <p>Knn, already driving TD, what is there to worry about complaint if you are doing a normal day in day out ferrying people for a living. If worry this and that, very fast up lorry one ok</p>

              <p>To be confident, drive without border, most of us had worked in a bordered strait jacket type of organisation, book/clock in at 8, book/clock out at 5, everything need to ask for permission and apply for leave or absent, a strict top down hierrachy system that governed our life more of a modern slave than a human with a heart.</p>
              <p>Of course, we can alway go back to those days of 8 to 5 job, get ordered left and right, and fighting for that piece of cake with many other of your peers, who look friendly but still can somehow make your life miserable.</p>
              <p>It is of these cirumstances that peoples like you and me wanted a release, a new life that not only can support our family, ourselves and our inner self. And that is where we went back to classroom after many years and start to take up a Taxis license and become a TD.</p>
              <p>For some, because of loan, get hitted by inflation that unable to bring more happiness to family or simply, fallen into the society greed hands and end up struggling day by day just to keep a job. They became TD.</p>
              <p>In understanding why we become TD, for whatever reason, everyone has a story to tell, behind every TD, be it relief or hirer, there will be a case to ponder, dun tell me at the end of the day, you holding the steering wheel and tell me I dunno how I become a TD.</p>
              <p>Therefore, in knowing why you become a TD, it shall determine your confident and strength to drive on, because for most TD, after few years of driving, they forget that initial purpose of why they become a TD and that is when the morale dip, and some can end up regretting their decision that ultimately, end up as zombie driver.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Driving slower doesn't make the meter jump more</span>...but it'll certainly cost the pax more when driving slower than usual on the same route, that's maybe why some pax may feel that the meter jumps more. LOL</p>
              <p>Fact: All taxi meters have the 45 seconds waiting time.</p>
              <p>What constitute the 45 sec?</p>
              <p>Not sure about other companies, for Comfort its <strong>applicable when travelling below the speed of 30.8km/h.</strong></p>
              <p>Therefore when travelling slowly like in a traffic jam, other than the $ for the distance travelled, TD also get compensated for the time spent stuck in the jam<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Chriss Reed system very simple but costs $70 for every 10 kilometer.</p>
              <p>Chris Reed tells the destination and Taxi Driver tells the charges. Chris Reed Pays the full amount and then goes to sleep in the taxi.Taxi driver proceeds to Chris Reed's destination and wakes Chris when he reached.</p>

              <p><br>Once I a TD gives me extra change, he thot I give him $50, actually only $10, but then as brother, I give back to him, he thanked me many times, if I took it, not only got free rides, somemore got money to take, end up taking free taxi with money.</p>
              <p>There are also cases that taxi drivers give double clipped 10 dollars notes, therefore, it is advice to rub your notes before giving, cos $10 plastic notes like to stick together with static electrical properties. $2 and $5 notes also can be doubled, it given double, the lost would not be as much as $10.</p>
              <p>As such, changing is critical, ensure proper change, if not end up losing out, as TD, I understand time is a factor on the road, especially in those ping piang kio hours, png, connection, advance calls, but if you end up people gives you more, it can demoralise you mood.</p>

              <p>In this society, you have to open your eyes in dealing with peoples, there are many hard core gamblers, party goers and maybe drug addiction peoples who like to cheat peoples here and there, alway learn to test the water before committing to anything.</p>
              <p>Ironically, a person who tends to accept all your conditions, whatever you said also can be done, mostly end up as so called unable to deliver the goods or promises. Therefore, a easy going person can also be a cheater, those who are good in words expression coupled with reason after reason to evade a you owe me money issue, you need to be wary.</p>
              <p>The hirer and relief relationship do not enter a contractual agreement whereby letters of exchange with a third party witness are signed upon agreement. As such, the laws do not take into any consideration as there is no contract on paper. Therefore, the risk of individual is very much on your own.</p>
