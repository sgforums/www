              <p>SINGAPORE - A cabby was beaten up by three youths after a jaywalking dispute along Coleman Street near Peninsula Plaza on Sunday, Sept 16.</p>
              <p>The fracas left him with a bruised eye.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The victim emailed citizen journalism site, Stomp, with his account of the story.</p>
              <p>The cabby, who is in his 60s, said he was driving along Coleman Street at about 1pm when he spotted three youths by the road, waiting to cross the road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But one of them was unable to cross due to my slow-moving taxi. I was blocking his way," said the cabby.</p>
              <p>"Angry with me, he banged on my right side door mirror causing it to flip forward."</p>
              <p>The cabby said the youth challenged him to a fight, when he wound down the window to adjust the mirror and ask him what he wanted.</p>
              <p>Said the cabby: "I must be crazy, as my wife was with me and I am a 60-plus old man, to respond to fight with three energetic young men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I kept on driving turning my car into side road behind the Plaza."</p>
              <p>The cabby said the youth's two friends began to join in the provocation by following his taxi and kicking it.</p>
              <p>He then decided to pull over by the side of the road. Before the vehicle could come to a complete stop, the cabby said one of the men pulled open his door and attempted to unbuckle his seat belt.</p>
              <p>When he tried to stop him, the cabby said the man started to punch his left eye continuously.</p>
              <p>The others also joined in the assault, until they saw that his face was bleeding.</p>
              <p>"They then stopped and left, shouting 'I will see what the f...ing police can do for you," said the cabby.</p>
              <p>The cabby called the police and was ferried to the Singapore General Hospital for treatment.</p>
              <p>According to a statement from the police, officers received a call at 1.15pm on Sept 16, requesting for assistance.</p>
              <p>Two men have since been arrested for the assault. Police are investigating the incident.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fark lah, must whack them whether is drunk ang mos or youths. This is self defence, got baseball bat also no wrong. You saw movies, police always come the last to the scene, I drive I sure got put something in vehicle. But unless provocated or my life is in danger, I will not be first to act offensive, now everywhere smlj lang also have, mian kia one. Phui those culprits x100.</div>

              <p>if fight with few people, must be quick. I learned this from the interview given by Donnie Yen many years back. He said his mom school in USA last time, often got people come to challenge for a fight, but he didnt say in the interview if he won or how the fight ended, but I think he won comfortably.</p>
              <p>to be able to do this, you must have some martial arts background, else you can't do it. hit it where one punch or kick can knock out the person, or at least  make the person stay in the ground in pain while you deal with others.</p>

              <p><br>Xiao di di, if you want to eat Arab street's nasi bryani or starbuck's coffee, no problem with me, I can spent you, but not garden by the bay chicken rice, heard $25/plate</p>
              <p>Other than that, I am afraid you need to go for a eyes checkup.</p>
              <p>For your info, next year, I will be a grandfather, I think I did told someone at the BBQ.</p>
              <p>But frankly, after going thru so many kind of manly jobs, sadly, I have to say, Taxis driving is one of the most stressful one, because the brain cells need to keep thinking and yet be alert at all times, any shortage of sleep will deprive the energy, and any personnal problem may deprive the alertness. And any fark up paxs would also make a bad day for taxis driver. Therefore, I see a premature aging in most taxis drivers, but not all, meaning, most them look older than their actual age, and this is alarming and truly shown the stress, the anxiety and brain drain both mentality and physically.</p>
              <p>Take care brother, life is not a race. Tho some may said, easy easy or no problem, but deep inside hide the difficulties and wanting very much to get away from it, this is only referring to some, not all. Even my former casket driving, or my current ship contract job, sorry to say, people do not look as stress as TD, you can see the struggling and the eyes bags forming which show signs a hard life.</p>
              <p>We therefore must learn to balance life, spent time exercise abit and more with family, and that is why, a hirer preferrably get a relief, and vice versa, but then, there are happy drivers like many in this forum, we should then learn from them. Smoke less (or if can, dun smoke), eat less, and remain truly happy is the key to good health.</p>
