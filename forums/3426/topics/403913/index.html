              <p>The rental for KIA (no contract or 3-month contract) is $102.72.</p>
              <p>Pool has always advise newbie to start off as a Comfort relief. Please listen to his advice.</p>
              <p>Dun drive full shift as you are starting out. While you are learning the rope of the trade, start with as low a cost as possible.</p>
              <p>Some companies allow you to pay the deposit in instalments. Call them and check it out as policies changes frequently.</p>

              <p>Normally Comfort only allow those who already registered as relief driver to search for hirer through their system. Since you haven't got a hirer, you may go to Comfort's office at Sin Ming Drive and ask them to help you find a hirer near your place. I dun know whether they will entertain you if you telephone them.</p>
              <p>I think Comfort can allow up to 4 instalments. However, the group insurance is only available when the deposit is fully paid.</p>
              <p>I have just quit Silvercab, I dun recommend them.</p>

              <p>If you are driving as a relief, all company policy is almost the same. Half shift = half rent. Full shift = Full rental.</p>
              <p>Just that certain hirer are more generous and they like to round down (eg Full shift $102 they run down to $100). The reason behind why u should go for Comfort is that u can depend on calls when you experienced difficulties in sweeping the floor.</p>
              <p>With calls, you can really learn the trick with reasonable good starting income initially. When you have become more experienced after a while, then start thinking about what's next.</p>
              <p>Dun be hasty, just wait a while longer to find the perfect hirer u need.</p>

              <p>Another way is to put notes on taxi's wind screen to see whether any hirer is looking for relief driver for Sat &amp; Sun. I think your desired time slot have high chance cos hirers would like to rest on these 2 days.</p>
              <p>You can also try Sat on one vehicle and Sun on another if you can't get 2 days on the same vehicle.</p>

              <p>Hi, All, thanks for your help,</p>
              <p>Anyway, I will go down to comfort maybe tomorrow and apply, then see how, wait for 2 weeks, and also, hold that hirer, in fact, my hirer is a woman, seem like she is driving morning and her husband driving night, cos when I spoke over the phone, i heard a man at the back telling her to quote the rental price. And, thank Teolk for you info, I will try to bargain with them if Comfort is too long to wait. If Choa Chu Kang, i have to talk MRT or bus there, another cost.</p>
              <p>As I read your post, I bet saturday can earn more than Sunday. Maybe just relief for one day will do.</p>

              <p>To put that notes, I have to go carpark all over the west side, by the way, I am in Boon Lay.</p>
