              <p>Anyway to sum it all up , u guys shouldnt hammer CDG until they are not worth a cent esp Poolman. Almost new topic started by u is abt CDG. come on , move on since u are in transcab now.</p>
              <p>All got pros and cons , wat is important is at the day , despite our difference in views , we still can sit at KTM , have a hot kopi and mee soto and TCSS.</p>

              <p>Bro, with your skill and wealth of experience there is no doubt that you can make it with any coy you join, but I do feel that you are very biased against CDG leh.</p>
              <p>Actually with a little of analysing and A LOT of common sense we could try to minimise those inconveniences caused by CDG "no destination" calls.</p>
              <p>I ever put those strategy in details somewhere in this forum (or was it on my "blog"?), so will not elaborate here.</p>

              <p>Let Junior Riskman share share his thoughts with the big brothers here. I wouldn't dare say CDG MDT is like shit. Sometimes, i get solid calls &amp; of course lousy calls too. Sometimes, CDG MDT actually can save your day from a quiet day.</p>
              <p>I believe walkie also have their fair share of lousy calls. The extra advantage is that drivers were able to know the destination and decide whether to take up the call or not. Imagine, walkie groups not able to know destination, Poolie going to phui x1000?? Hahaha....</p>
              <p>It is the same thing for CDG MDT, it is all come down to the driver's judgement (based on what time, where is location when calls in etc....) of course plus abit of luck to decide whether to take the call or not.</p>
              <p>To me MDT or got walkie, it is just a tool to enhance your earning.</p>

              <p>Relax lah TCL. As I said if TDs want to apply some common sense while accepting/ rejecting calls, it may ends up similar to your strategy :)</p>
              <p>Me an easy driver lah. Got calls or no calls, or got good calls or kenna lousy calls (even when we tried to minimize it) it's OK. So what if Ms Suzuki goes to Hougang St 11 or Ms Carter goes to Bt Panjang HDB estate? At the end of the day, the diff in earning may not be significant enough to warrant the stress.</p>
              <p>Poolz always complain about the rejection/ suspension from CDG. Actually I am not against this system, as it will restore some order and prevent abuse from drivers. However, I think CDG should implement credit points for each cancellation or no show as well. For example when you are -2pts from two previous rejection then got cancelation on next, you should be back to -1pt (ie, got chacnce for 2 more rejections), and so on.</p>
              <p>How TCL? I heard you are a major shareholder of CDG, can ask them to implement or not ah?</p>
