              <p>Its not a coincidence that some drivers never get into accidents, some occasionally, and yet others frequently. It is said that we need 2 hands to clap. If so how do you explain that some drivers never involved with an accident. Sure they are lucky. But I also think having good driving habits plays an important role. It is very hard to change a driver's bad habits, but it is very easy to change the driver. So guess what CDG decides to do?</p>
              <p>What can we do? Just try your best not to get into accidents lor. Take a short break if you are dozing off from driving many hours. Beyond that, just hope you dont strike TOTO on the road.</p>

              <p>With the sonata , it is very very hard to get into a at fault accident coz the brakes are very good. Unless u are following so so so close that even the ABS cant save u , in general , it is quite safe.</p>
              <p>Most Of the rear end cases involve crowns as they suck big time , the brakes, the tires , everything.</p>

              <p>I left CDG of my own accord. <strong>Never tio terminated, no owe rental (I'm a relief) &amp; no owe accident excess too.</strong></p>
              <p>They used to allow drivers delay the accident excess payment if the other party have not file a claim.</p>
              <p>My case was that CDG "extort" $1k from me even when the other party have not claim against me. This pissed me off and made me tell them to terminate my account and suck that $1k deposit if they so desired.</p>
              <p>Never look back since. I told myself that even if all the taxi coy in Sing rejected me, I won't want to go back to them. F**k all these GLC.</p>

              <p>They used to allow drivers delay the accident excess payment if
              the other party have not file a claim.</p>
              <p>My case was that CDG "extort" $1k from me even when the other
              party have not claim against me. This pissed me off and made me
              tell them to terminate my account and suck that $1k deposit if they
              so desired.</p>
              <p>Never look back since. I told myself that even if all the taxi
              coy in Sing rejected me, I won't want to go back to them. F**k all
              these GLC.</p>

              <p>bro  sorry for making such a sweeping statement but u gotta admit people who left CDG on their own accord are rare.</p>
              <p>i can count myself as one who left CDG too without owing anything to drive with SMRT in 2003 and i must say that is probably the worse move i ever made in my TD life.</p>
              <p>Most of the CDG drivers know wad they are in for when they decide to drive for em.i for one know they</p>
              <p>(1) are a bastard co who sides more with commuters than the drivers.</p>
              <p>(2) very strict when it comes to complains even from fucking motorists which in the 1st place is NOT EVEN A FUCKING CUSTOMER</p>
              <p>(3) sends out enforcement regularly to catch drivers.</p>
              <p>(4) changes their tones and attitudes according to market demand for their taxis</p>
              <p>U think no CDG driver know their chow pattern? can tell u 90% know la but LLST .</p>
              <p>Most are like me cannot forgo (1) the bookings (2) the cheaper diesel (3) the ease of cashless payments</p>
              <p>So until such time they kick me out for watever infringments , then will i think of driving for other cos.</p>
              <p>SMRT has given me one bitter lesson and i dont wish for another.</p>

              <p>Poolman is such a nice guy to invite singaporeans to drive taxis , even willing to coach them , post earnings somemore for all to see.</p>
              <p>But has this resulted in more demand now and taxi companies adopting a fuck care attitude towards the existing pool of TDs?</p>
              <p>Think about it  for a moment , in 2001 the taxi Q list was very long . Taxi cos got no shortage of drivers and hirers got no shortage of relief drivers ( which made it damn hard for me to find a hirer) but wad time were those? bad times , retrenchment everywhere, people going bankrupt.</p>
              <p>Hmm what about now? stock market up , property up , everywhere booming but still got a long list of people in Q to be taxi drivers?</p>

              <p>Last thing to add , accidents are unforseen. Who would have thought a lorry's tyre can come flyin into my direction and whacking my front ?</p>
              <p>But there are ways to prevent other collisions from happening and that is rest or stop when u are tired. My personal dos and donts still remain with me.</p>
              <p>Dont continue if u feel your eyes is closing, Tell the pax to chat with u coz u feel tired. Alight liao just stop and take a shut eye.sometimes 15 mins of snooze can work wonders.</p>
              <p>ask yourself , u wanna make that measly $20 ( assuming long trip hor ) or u wanna risk $2k? choice is yours.</p>

              <p>I have been looking for a job for 6 months before I started to drive taxi again. The 1st question they asked is your age. Once over 40, the standard reply was "Sorry, we want only those younger than 40."</p>
