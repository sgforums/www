              <p>Agree with WizQ</p>
              <p>I take whatever CBD calls. We thrust ourselves to the element of luck the moment we start our evening. Common sense and experience're secondary though necessary. CDG calls don't come in rapid succession like before. Reject a few lousy (u think) calls and you're in the same spot after 15 mins (and still no job and $ while hot period tick away). Name guessing of pax not reliable, time consuming + stressful. I'd go Woodlands (if suay) and have $20+ in pocket (20 mins). Then I shoot to city when its hot. Enjoy a hoon kee in the process. No queueing at Causeway pt for $4 fare. We've limited hot hours.</p>
              <p> LV jobs've destinations. How many TD would accept Ah Wood Ah Kang or Ah Soon? The next TD is as smart as us rite? How would pax take to the long response time for cab if any? Does it bode well for the organisation in the long run? Well, just a thought.</p>

              <p>Just take note CDG drivers , now quota each driver maximum cap 8
              calls a night . For $3.50 calls , except for Special Day .</p>
              <p>Once hit 8 , u'll lose out to those who did less .</p>
              <p>Don't tell me u everyday get 14 .</p>
              <p>One trick to get midnight job .</p>
              <p>Ur 5pm to 12MN , don't take call , or keep low , hahahah</p>
              <p>I mean on a normal night .</p>
              <p>If u get 6 calls in a night , and a driver get 2 calls in a
              night , during midnight , side by side , he'll get it .</p>
              <p>If your set is normal type , then the system is default that way

              <p>haaa dont know about you guys... me still in BMT training....
              loads of call in the morning and sunday from MDT, think mostly from
              you guys who rejected the call and bound to me... haaaa....... but
              wtf.... most of the time dont know where the fark the place is or I
              just drive pass it then beep.... fark lar.... SO, till now......
              record number 1 call booking almost 1 month driving..... welcome to
              FTOPNCBDC (Fark Type Off Peak No Call Booking Drivers
              Club)......  kekekeke....</p>
              <p>Funny thing is, think my MDT screw up lar.... today, even on
              Scheme B, I rejected all the booking, kena suspension for 1
              hours.... haaaaa............. better for me so no need every few
              min beep beep beep... phui....</p>
              <p>Also, for the past few days, the centre keep calling me say I
              activate the alarm.... wtf.... firstly, the MDT never show the
              usual msg, and secondly, either I driving, right foot on pedal, how
              the hell I activate.....or I already go for break and engine
              off...... KNS....</p>
              <p>But if come a day I am confident enough to take call..... think
              it will help my bottom line.... kekekekeke.....</p>

              <p>I like yr outspoken ways in dealing with CDG. Wow! din know about yr contributions to MDT fine tuning. It's CDG's loss with yr departure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, I think the best format was the time where u could set yr MDT to "auto" and "manual " bid for jobs. The "can bid" option while taxi is hired was also a boon. Today's format is a far cry fr that.</p>
