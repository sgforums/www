              <p><br> Other jobs networking is a must for business and dependency, you
              use me, later I use you, more of a colleagueship relationship, it
              can end up stabbing each other kind of networking.</p>
              <p>For TD, you network to get true friends and buddies, and that
              can be done after you finish your shift, would not it be better the
              gather together, TCSS with no time limit, jokes and be merry.</p>
              <p>But of course if you manage to be near each other, than it is ok
              to take a break. My advice for you to be a OMO is either take back
              Wish, cos of it lowest cost of operating or take cdg, those morning
              calls alone can make you forget about break.</p>
              <p>Since from getting your TDVL, you had been somehow sway into
              Trans due to following the footstep of most here at that point of
              posting, you see all the bad and curse on cdg due to many old birds
              then having their own personnal issue toward Cdg, but soon, many of
              your kakis and old birds also switched to cdg, either merc or
              sonatas, see the picture. The red gang had disbanded, even your
              chief had changed, go into cdg and see the different, I believe to
              be a real TD, one had to finish it course with driving for cdg
              before he can truly understand TD. Even chief started from Cdg</p>

              <p><br>Yes, we TD must be simple and contented, you can set a goal to buy or bring yr godson or parents to a tour at the end of the year, that allow you to look forward to it and strive on to achieve it, even you do not end up in beijin with them, at least you can be in HK or BKK with them. There are short and long term goals to set, short meaning less than a year.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, as simple as we are, in any problem, we can use the mind mapping method, draw your problem in the centre, least out all your difficulties, then from there move out,</p>

              <p>This will help to set our mind, if not you keep going round and round, it is sort of noting down our thoughts, then go back and see what we had written, and some of it may help.</p>
              <p>Like from Tampines, no pax, 5am, how? Go into bedok, simei, indian paxs? try pasir ris? note the paxs movement around these area after a fortnight, come back and re adjust, or worst, hv to go into bedok, malay paxs! yummy. If still OBK, how? slowly you will get a pattern, ask pax about their habit of taking taxis and if around there place, are there many peoples waiting for taxis, do your research, take note and so on.</p>
              <p>Once I took a surgeon at NUH on call at 5am, from then, I alway wait at NUH, because I asked him, he told me almost all surgery are perform at nite, there is a medical reason behind it, and after the surgery, all of us very tired, nurses, clerks, doctors, surgeons all need to go home, So if I manage to pass by NUH, I will go in but shhhhhhh, keep it to yourself.

              <p>Hi khoon, when it was mentioned that call is everywhere is also have to reference to timing. Daytime got day time call and also specified place and night time got night time call also specified place.</p>
              <p>I understand the U-turn of the CDG cabs but there are also other color cab doing too now thus let's be fair that nowaday all company cab able to perform this type of stunt. The only questions I asked myself worth or not to do it? We had to weight against safe and dangerous. So let them be if they want. What we want is just to have a safe and happy journey. I only drive weekend day and thus wont understand and not in the position to comment on the stunt. </p>
              <p>Let me know if u have a break and I also can join if nearby. But me is blue hope no offence. Cos ever msg u once but no reply from you and thus no chance to meet. Ha ha...</p>
              <p>Anyway, hope that you can resolve your problem soon and thus join Ang at your convenient. At the meant time, find a relief if possible and look positive and happy while driving. Everythough u met with unhappy scene (such as customer or otr), just take a deep breath and everytime take it as back to normal.</p>

              <p>Hi khoon, when it was mentioned that call is everywhere is also have to reference to timing. Daytime got day time call and also specified place and night time got night time call also specified place.</p>
              <p>I understand the U-turn of the CDG cabs but there are also other color cab doing too now thus let's be fair that nowaday all company cab able to perform this type of stunt. The only questions I asked myself worth or not to do it? We had to weight against safe and dangerous. So let them be if they want. What we want is just to have a safe and happy journey. I only drive weekend day and thus wont understand and not in the position to comment on the stunt. </p>
              <p>Let me know if u have a break and I also can join if nearby. But me is blue hope no offence. Cos ever msg u once but no reply from you and thus no chance to meet. Ha ha...</p>
              <p>Anyway, hope that you can resolve your problem soon and thus join Ang at your convenient. At the meant time, find a relief if possible and look positive and happy while driving. Everythough u met with unhappy scene (such as customer or otr), just take a deep breath and everytime take it as back to normal.</p>

              <p>$25 per hour is Super OBK?</p>
