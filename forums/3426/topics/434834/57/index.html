              <p>Just remember to know your audience, it will help you in your
              approach to anything. As I said, TD is are happy go lucky lots, for
              most of us, we already put career at the back of our mind, most
              would had planned for what they wanted, but some still with no
              direction.</p>
              <p>And these group here, be it bro komade, JLKL, BCL,  khoon
              or pool, they are actually joyful good peoples, I bet they had gone
              thru much in their life and our approach is to more or less should
              be  in par with them, not putting ourselve in a position of
              what we think we are and hit the nail directly on the spot will
              also get a rejection somewhere here and there, everything had a
              culture, by and large, this forum in a way had it own culture, and
              that is, be merry and stay Happy.</p>
              <p>Some said they hate driving, but like it or not you are driving
              taxis, so be it. Unless you are willing to change and take risk,
              otherwise why keep cursing your own trade, but of course for the
              sake of stress relief, it ok.</p>
              <p>To be gracious and understanding, you need to think for other
              thought and put words or thing in a way of not hurting
              their feeling, otherwise, it plain naiveness.</p>
