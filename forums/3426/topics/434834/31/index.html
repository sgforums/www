              <p>Morning strategy</p>
              <p>Before 1400 hrs</p>
              <p>Salmon Fish Theory, Salmon is the only fish that swim against the flow. In the morning, the flow is all about toward town and industrial area, we somehow will begin bring to these area by the flow. Do not stay there, even in Town there are Hotel to support but it is too saturated with Taxi. Be a Salmon, drive against the flow and back to the starting stream line again and again.</p>
              <p>Head to the expressway immediately, do not exist on the nearest Estate, many Taxi will be plying there too, go all the way to the starting point, for</p>
              <p>1)West side, forget about jurong west st 90+, st 80+.......St 60+, too many Taxi from Tuas will passby there, Start at st 40+ to 50+</p>
              <p>2)North West, Bukit Pangjang will be the best area, tons of call.</p>
              <p>3) North Area, Woodlands anywhere</p>
              <p>4) North East, Punggol. Also many call</p>
              <p>5) East, forget about Pasir Ris and even Tampines, many Taxi from Airport will ply there. Start at Bedok. </p>
              <p>Do not waste time to queue at MRT station, all cheapo trips, do not worth your investment on travelling back empty and time on queue. </p>
              <p>Ply along those small road, there are pax waiting for you for more then 1/2 hour type.</p>
              <p>For me, Bukit Panjang and Punggol is enough. Go there wait for call.</p>
              <p>Of course, never  say no to any connection, it is our bonus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Lunch Hour, 1200 to 1400</p>
              <p>Do not waste time at shopping mall, many feeder services and usually bring you to a place with no connection. </p>
              <p>Just follow above strategy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After 1400 hours</p>
              <p>Idiot Proof Time, even an idiot can make it at these hours. Just anyhow drive, anyhow queue. go anywhere also can.</p>
              <p>Afterall, only 1 to 2 hours more to hand over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Target</p>
              <p>0500 to 0930 - $100 collection</p>
              <p>0930 to 1400 - $80 collection</p>
              <p>1400 to 1600 - $40 collection</p>
              <p>1600 to 1700 - Pang Kang Liao, got people give you money to go home somemore.</p>
              <p>Inclusive of reasonable Break Time.</p>
              <p>Target i put up is rather at the conservative side, should be able to do more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i usually do not like to disclose strategy and collection, but today "ki siow"</p>
              <p>Hope this will serve as a reference for our dear morning shift partner.</p>
              <p>Good Luck????  If want to depend on luck, go but 4D or TOTO. The return is more promising.</p>

              <p>just my opinion. If u are going to take epica at $115 , why not
              take Mercedes instead?</p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>DAY 173 OTR THURSDAY</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>With the new Fare Structure, Day Shift Drivers with conventional Change Shift Hours have seen a decreased in their collection of between 20% to 50%.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Khoon tried out a new strategy over the past few days which seems to work, but will need to fine tune and test out over the weekend to see the overall results.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There are a few more strategies to experiment with over the next few weeks before concluding which is the best approach; and would probably need to draw up a few templates that is interchangeable for reaction to different situations.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It is not overboard to say that the New Fare Structure is largely centred around CDG's Call System, especially for the non-peak hours. Khoon did a trial by behaving like a CDG Driver one day and tru observing the strategies of a very smart CDG Driver.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>TransCab, the second largest taxi fleet, but with a half past six Call Centre which doesn't even seems to match to that of SMRT's, went ahead to follow the de-facto big brothers whim for fare change. Unless TransCab can pull up its act to increase our call volume, we will see the continued trend of more Red Drivers throwing key to join the Blues.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>If the in-coming new SMRT chief sees the potential of her taxi business and revamp its operations, they will regain their second position in the industry in no time, given their financial muscles and GIC connections.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In reaction to the New Fare Structure, we are seeing partnerships break up to each go OMO, Day Hirer asking Nite Relief to share a higher percentage of the rental, Day Hirer driving extended hours to have a bite of the evening peak with the Nite Relief driving shorter hours for lesser rental.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Another trend we are seeing is more partners going for unconventional change shift hours like 12-12.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It will be tough for for Day Shift Drivers with Conventional Hours to see Collection similar to that of before the Fare Adjustment, given the 10% reduction during the crunch morning peak and slower meter jump.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Change is The Only Constant.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>To Survive Change, Either Go with The Flow or Do The Unconventional.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Either Ways We Embrace Change.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Khoon would prefer taking The Middle Path of </span><span style="font-family: SimSun; color: black; " lang="ZH-CN">ä¸�å�˜åº”ä¸‡å�˜</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> to see where the path will lead to.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>(Maybe it will lead right to under the Coconut Tree? Or to Tuas South Ave 14? Or to Defu Fish Market to throw key? Ha Ha)</span></p>

              <p><strong><span>DAY 173 OTR THURSDAY</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>With the new Fare Structure, Day Shift Drivers with conventional Change Shift Hours have seen a decreased in their collection of between 20% to 50%.</span></p>
              <p><span>Khoon tried out a new strategy over the past few days which seems to work, but will need to fine tune and test out over the weekend to see the overall results.</span></p>
              <p><span>There are a few more strategies to experiment with over the next few weeks before concluding which is the best approach; and would probably need to draw up a few templates that is interchangeable for reaction to different situations.</span></p>
              <p><span>It is not overboard to say that the New Fare Structure is largely centred around CDG's Call System, especially for the non-peak hours. Khoon did a trial by behaving like a CDG Driver one day and tru observing the strategies of a very smart CDG Driver.</span></p>
              <p><span>TransCab, the second largest taxi fleet, but with a half past six Call Centre which doesn't even seems to match to that of SMRT's, went ahead to follow the de-facto big brothers whim for fare change. Unless TransCab can pull up its act to increase our call volume, we will see the continued trend of more Red Drivers throwing key to join the Blues.</span></p>
              <p><span>If the in-coming new SMRT chief sees the potential of her taxi business and revamp its operations, they will regain their second position in the industry in no time, given their financial muscles and GIC connections.</span></p>
              <p><span>In reaction to the New Fare Structure, we are seeing partnerships break up to each go OMO, Day Hirer asking Nite Relief to share a higher percentage of the rental, Day Hirer driving extended hours to have a bite of the evening peak with the Nite Relief driving shorter hours for lesser rental.</span></p>
              <p><span>Another trend we are seeing is more partners going for unconventional change shift hours like 12-12.</span></p>
              <p><span>It will be tough for for Day Shift Drivers with Conventional Hours to see Collection similar to that of before the Fare Adjustment, given the 10% reduction during the crunch morning peak and slower meter jump.</span></p>
              <p><span>Change is The Only Constant.</span></p>
              <p><span>To Survive Change, Either Go with The Flow or Do The Unconventional.</span></p>
              <p><span>Either Ways We Embrace Change.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Khoon would prefer taking The Middle Path of</span> <span style="font-family: SimSun; color: #000000;">ä¸�å�˜åº”ä¸‡å�˜</span> <span>to see where the path will lead to.</span></p>
              <p><span>(Maybe it will lead right to under the Coconut Tree? Or to Tuas South Ave 14? Or to Defu Fish Market to throw key? Ha Ha)</span></p>

              <p>i cant say much since i have not started driving yet. But from what i have observed before and after the fare adjustment, as i travel by taxi to the same location on almost every monday morning peak from hougang to toa payoh, i do see a drop in the fare amount that i am paying ranging from 50cents to $1.</p>
              <p>but i guess most consumers on the street wont study to such details, as the only factors that keep them away is paying more.</p>
