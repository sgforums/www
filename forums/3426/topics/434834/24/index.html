              <p>I heard similar stories too. If you know the call operator personally, they can pass you jobs directly. This happens in CDGE, SMRT and also Woodlands Transport Company in airport.</p>
              <p>That is why I am so against the call centre operations. Let the pax get used to 'goCatch' app, then there will be no more middle man nonsense. The pax contacted the cabby directly. No kelong at all.</p>
              <p>We have to pay the levy for each call we take, but others with connections, get the juiciest calls with no levy? Where is the love? </p>

              <p>I think along the same line as you. I also wonder if it is really worth all the trouble just to get this call benefit. I rather be relax mode, call come, if easy within reach, just take n go. Otherwise let others have it. No obligations to anybody.</p>
              <p>But it is a different story if your daughter is working inside call centre hor. This kind of kelong is big money kind. No need to invest time and entertain the call girls, because its their daughter. Which daughter dont want their father to huat?</p>
