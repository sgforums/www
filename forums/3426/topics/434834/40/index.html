              <p>Gentlemen,</p>
              <p>Let us first pray (in whatever religion or believe you are in) for a Huat time first.</p>
              <p>Now, everyone has their own way of living, some OBK, some Huat, some just average, and I believe most of us are just average, meaning Half OBK, Half Huat.</p>
              <p>Sound advices are given out by both side of the arguement/discussion here, and discussion usually lead to showing of ego and pride, even friendly match can end up fighting, corporate meeting can end up bashing each other, and some parliament can end up fighting and slapping, so it is naturally, as human, we cabbies also have our arguement and dissatisfaction of each other position, be it 69 or 96.</p>
              <p>In pure discussion, which issue focus rather than people focus, you may able to see and learn more here, but sorry to say, with simple issue of OBK can turn more into a personnal issue leading some attack on each other,  end up, making unwarrant advices go sway toward personnal pride.</p>

              <p>Let us re focus back into the issue.</p>
              <p>TS driving a Transcab epica  said he OBK from 4am to 10am</p>
              <p>Advices start pouring in</p>
              <p>Then came a figure of 150 to 200 pts can be achieve from 4 am to 10 am</p>
              <p>Some agreed, some do not. But not much reason or advices given on how??</p>
              <p>Instead it become, can make it and cannot make it, and arguement started.</p>
              <p>So if you focus into it,</p>
              <p>TS is driving a transcab epica, and he getting OBK in the morning 4am to 4pm one shift only. Cdg is another thing, that is up to TS to take up  or sign up. But is there any brother here driving EPICA having the same problem?? No, if you ask me, because sometime, I also drove Epica as super relief.</p>
              <p>1.From 4am to 10am, 6 hours, 2 hrs midnite charges, and nearly 3.5 hrs peak hours, you should be able to make it at least 120pts, because if not, you should know that in the late afternoon, it will get worst before you hand over your vehicle.</p>
              <p>2.Good practices is to start on the dot, be discipline with punctuality yourself. Do not deli dali your time, every minute jump 22 cents. Be good in time management.</p>
              <p>3.From 4 to 10, do not go for break except toilet breaks, make arrange to meet up with buddies at 10 to 10 30am for your break at zion or hoy fatt. But you should not make it a necessity, if got pax, can break some where alone also can, best is to meet up after off hour, like me, go drinking with my both my taxi/casket's gfs and buddies after work.</p>
              <p>4. If base no pax, head straight to town, midnite road is easier to travel, whack all the nitespots, hotels (early departure), hospital claim (especially body claiming department) and all other zombies.</p>
              <p>5. Keep all your personnal issues or things to be done in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>6. Make use of this 6 hrs, which is half of your shift.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>And I believe 150 can easily be done by you in a merc or
              otherwise! But to say for others in normal cabs, 5 to 10 am, up to
              $200? In a consistent manner?</p>
              <p>80% of the time I can acheive average 30 per hr (non peak) but
              what about the other 20%? If being responsible, do I go around
              telling ppl I can easily make minimum 40 per hour?</p>
              <p>To cannon about oneself (not referring to you) is one thing but
              to state that certain figures can easily be acheived by everyone is
              another. It belittles the person seeking advice too.</p>

              <p><br>Friends, just word of advice..... Driving TD no loyathy one, pocket more important...... In this situation, not to side CDG, if u thinking starting shift at 4-6am, must drive CDG taxi....... Most of my friends driving normal also start around this time everyday half shift, by the time reach 10 am, collection usually 150-200.....CDG can solve your OBK problem...... Driving taxi is about balancing, whole day down the road, mixture of long and short trips, mixture of current and advance booking, mixture of road sweeping and queueing......if u short of something in above especially everyday u ply the road so early, something is wrong somewhere..... My friends driving normal cab recently if not driving CDG also all switch liao....... Unless u jia pa buy bao type, than ignored what I had say........ TC only things good is, if u pay rental in one mth advance, grab all benifit than driving will have no stress, if u plying road and depend on daily income one, think what I had say.....</p>

              this is a very realistic figure.</p>
              <p>What I dun like is others saying 4-5am to 10am, 150 to 200, no
              breaks and didn't even mentioned possible bad days.</p>
              <p>Can it mean 51/2 hr 200? Even if he cannon an extra 5 per hr, if
              you extrapolate 5$ x 6hr = $30. $30 x 20 days = $600 more,
              conservative estimate for 1 month. And that's easy easy he
              claimed.</p>
              <p>I was concerned that newbies and other readers might take it at
              face value.</p>
              <p>Wanna action and state big claims must be prepared for intense
              scrutiny and robust debate, right?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am not taking that primary school cannon seriously
              anymore. He is firing at such a rate that he forgets what he has
              just said the very next instant!</p>
              <p>Maybe he just rubs ppl the wrong way with his writing style and
              he is actually a real humble guy!</p>
