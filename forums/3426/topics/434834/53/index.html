              Wah lau eh. That day many aunties go market leh. Boh bian. My eye sight is very bad nowadays. I can only see "Cai Na", cannot see auntie's hand flagging. 
              
              Then Auntie always complain to me, say taxi uncle "ai si arh". She stand there so long but nobody stop. Half way through the journey. Auntie say " ah di arh, lei ai si arh, ai ni san liao, peh teksi". " lei kan na chee cheong fun arh".
              
              Reached destination, fare is $4.50. She give me $5 and tell me to keep the change and to eat more. I "how boh but sai" 
              
              Ah khoon, I tell you don't blog so much liao. Now you become MillionHair Taxi Driver. 
              
              But hor, I still always find time to read. Yes, I am biased. Yes, ah khoon is attention seeking, boring to the core and immature. Worse of all he loves to act cute.
              
              He even chooses who he talks to and break with. End to end, he is not a very nice guy. 
              
              But if you think I am reproaching him in a mocking, insulting or even comtemptuous manner. You are sadly mistaken.
              
              For every time I am on the road, one eye of mine is looking out for "cai na", the other is looking out for ah khoon's taxi to sound a friendly horn or to flash my lights at to tease him.
              
              He knows it and i know it, upon a call from him, I can literally drop everything to heed to his distress call. 
              I am only known for two things. The day shift market Auntie driver and being the ki Siao one. Please do not even dream about disturbing the harmony of the day shift gang or ah khoon's blog.
              
              It is always good to stay literally passive.

Then Auntie always complain to me, say taxi uncle "ai si arh". She stand there so long but nobody stop. Half way through the journey. Auntie say " ah di arh, lei ai si arh, ai ni san liao, peh teksi". " lei kan na chee cheong fun arh". Reached destination, fare is $4.50. She give me $5 and tell me to keep the change and to eat more. I "how boh but sai" Ah khoon, I tell you don't blog so much liao. Now you become MillionHair Taxi Driver. But hor, I still always find time to read. Yes, I am biased. Yes, ah khoon is attention seeking, boring to the core and immature. Worse of all he loves to act cute. He even chooses who he talks to and break with. End to end, he is not a very nice guy. But if you think I am reproaching him in a mocking, insulting or even comtemptuous manner. You are sadly mistaken. For every time I am on the road, one eye of mine is looking out for "cai na", the other is looking out for ah khoon's taxi to sound a friendly horn or to flash my lights at to tease him. He knows it and i know it, upon a call from him, I can literally drop everything to heed to his distress call. I am only known for two things. The day shift market Auntie driver and being the ki Siao one. Please do not even dream about disturbing the harmony of the day shift gang or ah khoon's blog. It is always good to stay literally passive.</p>

              <p><br>Other jobs networking is a must for business and dependency, you use me, later I use you, more of a colleagueship relationship, it can end up stabbing each other kind of networking.</p>
              <p>For TD, you network to get true friends and buddies, and that can be done after you finish your shift, would not it be better the gather together, TCSS with no time limit, jokes and be merry.</p>
              <p>But of course if you manage to be near each other, than it is ok to take a break. My advice for you to be a OMO is either take back Wish, cos of it lowest cost of operating or take cdg, those morning calls alone can make you forget about break.</p>
              <p>Since from getting your TDVL, you had been somehow sway into Trans due to following the footstep of most here at that point of posting, you see all the bad and curse on cdg due to many old birds then having their own personnal issue toward Cdg, but soon, many of your kakis and old birds also switched to cdg, either merc or sonatas, see the picture. The red gang had disbanded, even your chief had changed, go into cdg and see the different, I believe to be a real TD, one had to finish it course with driving for cdg before he can truly understand TD. Even chief started from Cdg</p>
