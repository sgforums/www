              <p>Yes, you talk sense and I respect you for that. That's why I say use average taking/hr more realistic.</p>
              <p>What I dun like is some who claim to be driving merc for the last 6 yrs, and therefore missed experiencing even the previous fare hike conditions in Dec 2007, advising other TDs on takings for normal cabs like as if it is his own experiences.</p>
              <p>After all, isn't what he's saying about acheivable income derived from what he heard from others? Probably also big cannons?</p>

              I had to stress again, I'm not any mentor or someone you can look forward too....
              
              I also non of any of your friends down here cause in real life we don't even know each others....
              
              I don't just post from topic A to topic Z, but I make some effort to read through them.....
              
              What is friends for, Mr Khoon know many forumers here, this blog been around for years....recently his blog always ended with OBK, what advice you lao jiao had given to him including MR TECHO......NOTHING!!!!you guys just read with pleasure, he OBK none of our business.....
              
              I feel something for Khoon, so a simple advice, need not to agreed with me, need not to reply, he can think and judge himself, anyway this threads is created by him.....
              
              Without proof I don't put 150-200, and since when I tell MR TECHO don't go toilet or smoke break.......most TU morning shift only start to break around 10 plus.......and most forumers know, afternoon time is OBK time for everybody including CDG.....
              
              But o this fellows come in and challenge my English, My words, and not to the topics.....he even post something like irritating blar blar blar, nothing to do with my advice....
              
              Agreed with some forumers meet up with Khoon and guild him also, but me jia ba liao, forum is just topic, suggest, debate and over......real life friends I will do that, but not here.....
              
              I post some comment in some topics, no reply is ok for me, I look at viewers colume, figure show everything liao, as long forumers read, whether agree or not is beside the point......
              
              I don't need any respect from here, you also don't need to respect me, cause we don't even know each other, but MR TECHO, u still don't dare to answer me this question, ARE YOU DRIVING CDG? If yes, more to come from me, if no, than sorry, we are at wrong channel.....

              <p>Khoon....today thanks for the "free lunch" at the lodge....heee heee Khoon donate on my behalf at the lodge. May good Kharma befalls on him. He is really struggling with the insurance excess behind him. But hor dun forget it can be off set from your deposit lah. Really you should try CDG. So far I drive ok leh. No more cheapo make me angry. Cos mostly I take the call those caller steady one leh. Their calls really power! Just now less then 2 min I on my MDT at the free parking place come liao....Wilmer Hourse 3min I press reach in 2min...Take CDG can bypass those cheapos who dun book cab.

              CDG drivers is not Yao like what you describe.....
              
              Any taxi as long you have meter have all the right to ply the road.....
              
              Street hire, queueing, current job, ADVANCE job, limo job, hourly disposal, special arrangement.....etc is part and parcel of TD life.....
              
              It depend on which type of taxi you are driving at......
              
              Street hire is the most common type of picking up by TU......
              
              If you can pick, why CDG cannot, so don't put Yao this word on anybody....
              
              Advantage for CDG drivers is, beside snatching pax on the street from you, they have other better option to earn that $.....
              
              So I say on my first post, balancing......even we MERC cab also pick up from street, so we also Yao?
              
              Anti CDG is one things, plying and earn that $ is another issue, like what Teolk say, end of the days, fast fast earn that $ and spent more quality time with family, who care about what colour you drive....
              
              Jasmine is my good friend, but if she can provide me all the necessary tools to earn that $, why not? But I stay put in CDG, I give some suggestion to Khoon, I believe others do that also during coffee shop, but don't be bias to any cabbies on the road, everybody just need to earn that $ to feed their family.....unless you are telling me you drive taxi for fun....

              we don’t even know each others….</p>

              effort to read through them…..</p>
              <p>What is friends for, Mr Khoon know many forumers here, this blog
              been around for years….recently his blog always ended with
              <span>OBK</span>, what advice you lao jiao had given to
              him including <span>MR TECHO</span>…...NOTHING!!!!you guys
              just read with pleasure, he <span>OBK</span> none of our
              business…..</p>
              <p>I feel something for Khoon, so a simple advice, need not to
              agreed with me, need not to reply, he can think and judge himself,
              anyway this threads is created by him…..</p>

              <p>Advice do not have to come from forums. Khoon post obk ? are we suppose to feel for him?</p>
              <p>hello for 10 days in a row , i also obk , why noone advise me huh?</p>
              <p>The last time i mentioned to him was to change to a mercs but he chose to stick with his very costly epica. So if the options are closed to him and his partner , what advice u give also is futile.</p>
