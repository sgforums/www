              <p>for me, if potential relief use the word "help" or "favour"....no need talk further liao.</p>
              <p>it's his attitude, very clearly in the wrong sphere! Help is only true when he dosen't collect any money.</p>
              <p>you let him hv vehicle to do biz and he's helping you??? Hirer and relief is a partnership.</p>
              <p>unless you wanna play him till you get a better one else it is a waste of time...</p>
              <p>but then again, I dun think you are that kind?</p>

              <p>Seem like my view of OBK and your view of OBK is very different.</p>
              <p>I had some kakis, either blue or red or green or white....experience OBK everyday...plying the road for 14-16 hours, due to stubborn driving habit or other funny reasons...fail to secure balance income and slog like nobody business.</p>
              <p>We don't use OBK for fun, some back log on rental, bill pile up...children no pocket money, school fee forever late....they are desperate for advise....HDB going to be reprocess soon....</p>
              <p>Ok, maybe I'm just being busy body...no problem...and now I understand why most of your forum kakis don't bother to reply in your blog even you keep on saying OBK which is not in real life, don't need to meet, I can sense....</p>
              <p>Just treat this reply as another siao DOG barking.....lol</p>

              <p>Of course, OBK is infinite in a sense, it all depend on individual, like the rich, drop 500 is sup sup water, I drop 500, knn, siao liao.</p>

              <p>but give me calls to connect my trips even during low period,not just rush hrs</p>
              <p>why should i need calls during rush hrs? 1 pax no show waste at least 15mins of my peak hrs</p>
              <p>rush hrs sweep the best</p>
              <p>off peak period take calls</p>
              <p>that is ideal</p>
              <p>but how many company can provide calls even during low period?</p>

              <p>Sharing of information should be all ways unless we are sharing nonsense, not once I had rebutt on anybody because most topics are true facts..As a strangers here, understand that people will rebutt on me whatever I had post although is true facts..</p>
