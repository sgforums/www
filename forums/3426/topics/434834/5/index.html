              <p>U know surely huat , so OMO drive night , rhythm for body sudden switch , took a toll on the body . ..... but on National Day itself , rental the same , but body punctured , no energy chiong , chiong also cannot match for those normal days .</p>

              <p>In fact, most job after 10 years, all sian already, working life is the same, you got youngs FTs and younger peoples coming in to take over you and these young bosses who do know nothing begin to say you do not contribute much but salary very high, like forcing you to resign or look for another job, everyday is demand, target and profit, and profit is not for you alone, but for many managers, generel managers, directors, CEOs and all those shareholders who keep setting new goal and objectives for you to follow,  everyday, you see superior faces also fed up.</p>
              <p>Tell me how you become a TD in the first place, either get fed up with working or army life or get retrenched , got into this line and stuck with it.</p>
              <p>For us working class, everyday hope to have Overtime or promoted to make some more money, but hv to back stab each other, some carry balls one get it, favoritism, nepotisim, curry flavor or whatever flavour you name it, power and money craze condition, it is all there. So, tired of driving taxi already? You better look at the good side of driving taxi, it is not the end of the road, at least you get a healthy and happier mind. And many TDs drive their whole life with graduates childrens. Never look down or be sian with what you have now, if you look down, pple will look even more down on you. You go try working again, every morning 8 must clock in, then,  hell begin until 5.30pm.</p>

              <p>but i think the point is that a lot of newbies got the misconception that taxi is easy money... i got a friend who just pass call me and ask me whether can earn XXXX amount [1st figure is not a low figure hor], i told him can but maybe he will give up in 1 month if his body can take it... if body weak, maybe 2 weeks bye bye liao... he say chun bo, i told him go find a job better lah... must be realistic lah... taxi driving makes easy money?? go think about it, got so easy meh??</p>
