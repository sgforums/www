              <p><br>Other jobs networking is a must for business and dependency, you use me, later I use you, more of a colleagueship relationship, it can end up stabbing each other kind of networking.</p>
              <p>For TD, you network to get true friends and buddies, and that can be done after you finish your shift, would not it be better the gather together, TCSS with no time limit, jokes and be merry.</p>
              <p>But of course if you manage to be near each other, than it is ok to take a break. My advice for you to be a OMO is either take back Wish, cos of it lowest cost of operating or take cdg, those morning calls alone can make you forget about break.</p>
              <p>Since from getting your TDVL, you had been somehow sway into Trans due to following the footstep of most here at that point of posting, you see all the bad and curse on cdg due to many old birds then having their own personnal issue toward Cdg, but soon, many of your kakis and old birds also switched to cdg, either merc or sonatas, see the picture. The red gang had disbanded, even your chief had changed, go into cdg and see the different, I believe to be a real TD, one had to finish it course with driving for cdg before he can truly understand TD. Even chief started from Cdg</p>

              <p>I know that to change is difficult, no body like to change, all prefer to be in their cosy corners and life goes on, but then, change is inevitable, even if you dun change, the surrounding forces will change you, eg like our chief, he do not want to change for his 2.0 wish, but external circumstances forced him to think otherwise.</p>
              <p>To contradict myself, actually once a mind is set, it is very hard to change, so how can I ask you to change your mindset when it is already set.</p>
              <p>Again all these come back to purpose of life, what do you want? It is not that being a TD there is no goal, it can be building a family or buying bread for your son, or buying bricks in some foreign 3rd world land for your lovely wife to have a nicer toilet.</p>
              <p>Once you set your target or goal, go for it, but of course it must be achieveable and attainable, not set a target to kenna toto, then god bless us all, you will be everyday at singapore pool.</p>

              <p>if really make the switch... den end up not doing any better
              (there are drivers khoon know... tat switched to CDG but end up not

              cannot be right?</p>
              <p>already said (or posted) couple of times... at this point in
              time... no economical sense to switch...</p>
              <p>really wonder why all so concern about khoon not wanting to
              switch to CDG? really puzzles me...</p>
