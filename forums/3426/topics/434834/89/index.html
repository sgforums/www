              <p>This two evenings , got communicate with Khoon ....</p>
              <p>realized he made some mistakes , within that split seconds decision .</p>
              <p>Thursday he chose to Q at T1 .... which i chose to Q at T2 .</p>
              <p>What happened was we went to AP together , same family of paxes .</p>
              <p>My cashless terminal down .... so have to wait for him to SOS .</p>
              <p>He arrived and SOS my ass .</p>
              <p>I followed him ... no idea where he going ?</p>
              <p>I also no idea where to go ?</p>
              <p>Then realized he chose to Q at T1 ..... taxi Q until below the bridge .... i think think : " Wow so long ? Think i better go Changi South pump my diesel and see how ?"</p>
              <p>After finish pumping diesel , Khoon still inside T1 Q .</p>
              <p>I charge back to T2 , almost 10 minutes later , i am off from T2 .</p>
              <p>He still stuck inside . My T2 pax destination Bedok Reservoir 700+ .</p>
              <p>After Bedok Res , i hit back town .</p>
              <p>Khoon still inside .</p>
              <p>I grap a job inside town ..... then heard he reaching Bishan .</p>
              <p>I got 2 jobs ..... he got 1 .</p>
              <p>I am in town , he is at Bishan , picking up controller home .</p>
              <p>Just a lesson to share , Khoon believe the sign board which indicated 44 taxis inside T1 Q , but was a gimmicks .</p>
              <p>Never believe the signboard .</p>
              <p>Not serious updated .</p>
              <p>Just that split seconds of wrong decision , can cost you the whole night .</p>
              <p>Hope Khoon learnt from those minor mistakes . </p>

              <p>At around 8pm , i will never entertain any to or from Teck Whye paxes , CCK paxes , Bukit Panjang paxes .... waste time one .</p>
              <p>So in order not to have such trouble , i never go CCK Teck Whye Bukit Panjang for my shift , if can siam , i will siam . .</p>
              <p>The chances of getting a pax to Marsiling Woodlands Yishun Sembawang from CCK and Teck Whye is relatively high chances .</p>

              <p>At around 8pm , i will never entertain any to or from Teck Whye paxes , CCK paxes , Bukit Panjang paxes .... waste time one .</p>
              <p>So in order not to have such trouble , i never go CCK Teck Whye Bukit Panjang for my shift , if can siam , i will siam . .</p>
              <p>The chances of getting a pax to Marsiling Woodlands Yishun Sembawang from CCK and Teck Whye is relatively high chances .</p>
              <p>Teck Whye hope one to go Clarke Quay ?</p>

              <p>From Hilter, to Mao, to the Jap emperor and almost all emperors in china, they start with a good intention and helping, but as times goes by, with power, money, status, they start to dictate people lives without any consideration.</p>

              <p>It ok, let them go and do their disposal and whatever they think can make more, because for what I see and forecast, as long as you are a TD, how you roti prata your schedules, your strategies and your wanting of good paxs and money, it will not make you a millionaires, and to be bad, not even a thousandaires. I guess, everybody knows it.</p>
              <p>It is pure hard work and luck in TD, we TD already very stressful with paxs, roads, rain and shines, here and there, TPs, LTAs, breakdown, accidents, where got time for all  these plan and that plan, just drive, got drive, got hope, no drive, then wait lor, wait for durian drop</p>

              <p>you are too nice to use great people as references. One common great people have is, they gained acceptance, earned respect, from not all, but most from the general public thru the show of "caring" of public interest.</p>
              <p>This forum is not visited solely by Taxi Driver, people from all walk of life visited here, include the media (which pool strongly believe)</p>
