              <p>Poolman answered the differing posts and opinions the best in my opinion.</p>
              <p>As I said, I'm also guilty of this. Why? Sometimes got things on my mind, I'm distracted or in a bad mood. I know logically this is wrong, but even parents make this mistake, sometimes bad mood come home, your children ask for something, you jump at them. It's wrong, but that's human nature.</p>
              <p>I also have to take taxi home every night, my relief stays in AMK, myself in Bishan area. Sometimes some taxi driver hear Bishan, I know they also fed up, drive whole night, ding dong here and there and still nevr make enough, see someone flagging hopes rise only to hear a $5 fare, so they feel instant disappointment.</p>
              <p>Never talk never mind, important is get you there safe and sound, because that's what you paying for. Only 1 time I fuck 1 char boh drive SMRT Cedric, she drive very aggressively, turn also never slow down. That one, I give her piece of mind, I take a cab to go home , not to get involve in an accident, you not happy don't drive. You dont want to go, say so. She lan lan say vehicle is old, I say dont talk cock, i also got drive old vehicle.</p>
              <p>As for BJ, no need to compare your SOP with others here. Here is a forum to express your views and let others express them, You can disagree but respect the others right to express his. I don't necessarily agree with everything Poolman says or suggests, sometimes I think hammer is too aggressive and so forth with others. But i respect them for sharing, and realise I must in their position at the material time to judge. Even then if I was, who am I to judge. We all make mistakes. I also got make mistakes on the road.</p>

              <p>From the way u post this comment, I gather that you are well
              educated.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I think you can make a good accountant, doctor or whatever you are
              trained for but I dun think you will make a good taxi driver with
              yr following comments:</p>
              <p style="color: #ff0000; margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Expect (<span style="color: #ff0000;">some more from only a few
              dollars biz</span>) and you'll be disappointed.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Be a TD longer then see if you feel the same way!</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">If you have that concept that for just a few dollars, you expect me
              to smile, this service industry, with always that few dollars,
              certainly looks miserable to you.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Worst till, with such education standard, one would expect you to
              be more tactful than going around criticising ppl's education
              standard.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Just for your info, Public Relation, the art of dealing with
              people, doesn't need a degree ok?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Have u read today's paper, the SMRT CEO's failure is her PR
              skills?</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">PR skils are natural, ah beng, ah seng, or ah lian ah huay can have
              it.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">It's just saying the right thing at the right time in the right
              manner which obvious u are lacking in spite of your high level
              education.</p>

              <p>For me, i take greeting as a Art, the Art of Communication. It

              <p>Sir,</p>
              <p>Taxis drivers are just like any other human beings, they come with all kind of characters and behavior, same like bosses, some good and some damn bad</p>
              <p>Some TD drive slow because they are wary of the road safety or wary of the $$ gone if hit others or oldies with poorer eyesight like me who drive with more care.</p>
              <p>And reach your destination may not imply that the TD will get another fare quickly, sometime you drop off someone, you can go on an hour without any paxs. Therefore, all these are subjectives, and i can bet you that all TD hates hurrying pax, it put pressure on us and also destroy our mood</p>

              <p><br>The analogy here is to ask, yes, i agree that customer is always right, but right in what??? there are rules and regulations governing your rights, even traffic which give you the right to go straight, it is still subject to rules and regulations.</p>
              <p>All this phrases are the works of capitalism, it benefit only the buyers and the investors, never the servicing people. The phrase "customer is always right" gives the buyer (your paxs) the upper hand in any dispute, it also gives the investors more leeway to exploit you by making you hungry, work harder and earn peanuts, if there are still peanut around.</p>
