              <p>TD are daily expose to social publicity, they are mould in a way of their experiences, what come out of their character is more of the experiences they had gone thru which can both be wrong or right.</p>
              <p>The question here is, how the society at large look at a TD, his status in the society, the reputation and publicity, and the experiences the society face with TD in a day to day occurences.</p>
              <p>If you think the society/public look at TD as a profession or a businessman, in the context of singapore, you are damn wrong. To my opinon, 70% dun even give a damn about TD, many think we are failure, that is why end up driving Taxis. So, in communicating with TD, they tend to have a few level up and feel proud of themselves by alway assuming that TD is stupid and do not know much thing.</p>
              <p>In long run, when a TD start to experience such pax who tend to upper his level in society against TD, then silence is the best policy for this TD, that is what he adopted.</p>

              <p>Dr Cai must be the highest educated cab driver in spore. he became a cab driver after A*Star did not renew his contract and NUS/NTU did not offer him a job. so he became a driver. he got a PHD and educated at prestigious uni in US.</p>

              <p>talk when necessary, even if you are in a bad mood. its hard to control your feelings once you are moody, but then it is necessary to adopt some decent customer service skills. the driver is probably tired or distracted after a long day driving. but whatever the reason, he should have tell the customer the fare at the very least when the pax asked how much.</p>
              <p>how doe he feel when the pax said go to bedok when boarding. the cab driver asked the pax, bedok where? the pax remained silent, then say out bedok north. then the driver asked, bedok north street? the pax is quiet, then say, tell u when u reach there.</p>

              <p>Should or should not be a TD is each preferences, if TD cannot take the true of what is happening to sinkapore, than he can continue to dream on as tho he is the boss, the director and the managing director of his taxis, brother, no offence, I feltyou misunderstood my post.</p>
              <p>In life, like it or not, there are social status, some rich but still humble, some look up only. So, in communication, you have to tackle it carefully, being poor myself, if one director enter my cab and put a air on him, of course, I remain silent and take him to where he wants to go.</p>
              <p>But there are also rich who come in and ask how are you, how is your earning, and the conversation goes on, because that rich guy can lower his status to meet mine type, like a radio, once the frequency is well tune, you get the best communication.</p>
              <p>Brother, me sec 2 level only leh, u guys dun look down on me, i very happy liao.</p>

              <p>The way some ppl here react is very funny.</p>
              <p>Understand this is a TD forum and as TD will should side each other and protect each other's interest.</p>
              <p>But this is also a forum for ppl like pax to feedback and for us to learn how ppl on the other side of the fence feel.</p>
              <p>It is normal to take side but when it comes beyond reasoning and you need to twist and turns the facts in other to protect your fellowman, I think it's way to much.</p>
              <p>As a TD, the standard protocol would be :</p>
              <p>1. to greet the pax</p>
              <p>2. ask them where they are going</p>
              <p>3. their prefered route they like to take</p>
              <p>4. if they are comfortable with the air con</p>
              <p>when reaching their destination:</p>
              <p>1. ask them if they like to stop here or continue before pressing the meter</p>
              <p>2. ask them if they like a receipt</p>
              <p>This are the basics expected of a TD.</p>
              <p>For my above post, am I asking all that? I only expecting you to tell me that price and not just point to the MDT, is it too much to ask?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">What u mean by the world to move according to your biddings?</span></p>
              <p>The purpose of this forum is to share TD's grievances and well as mistakes so that we all can learn from it. If u will to protect until so obvious, what's there to talk then?</p>

              <p>I used to be angry and moody all the time. i realised when you are angry, you have expended alot of energies in it and its not good for your heart too. later you spent time and energy brooding over it, for what? what for you punish yourself with what other people say and you are angry over him/her for a few days. is it worth it?</p>
              <p>I mean I still get angry, but I tell myself, why are you punishing yourself over a small matter, a frivolous remark. if you are angry with that person, that person is in your mind, so why you want to do that? its akin to bringing that person with you home, 24/7.</p>

              <p>That is a misconcept that driving slow the meter go faster, taxi goes by distance.</p>
              <p>Short trip slower could be because the trip is within the town with more traffic lights and other crossing, and the limit is max 70km/h. Longer trip mostly hit one of the highway and exist as much near to pax destination, so end up feeling shorter.</p>

              <p>Dr Cai must be the highest educated cab driver in spore. he
              became a cab driver after A*Star did not renew his contract and
              NUS/NTU did not offer him a job. so he became a driver. he got a
              PHD and educated at prestigious uni in US.</p>
