              <p>Understand this is a TD forum and as TD will should side each
                  other and protect each other's interest.</p>
              <p>But this is also a forum for ppl like pax to feedback and for us
                  to learn how ppl on the other side of the fence feel.</p>
              <p>It is normal to take side but when it comes beyond reasoning and
                  you need to twist and turns the facts in other to protect your
                  fellowman, I think it's way to much.</p>
              <p>As a TD, the standard protocol would be :</p>
              <p>1. to greet the pax</p>
              <p>2. ask them where they are going</p>
              <p>3. their prefered route they like to take</p>
              <p>4. if they are comfortable with the air con</p>
              <p>when reaching their destination:</p>
              <p>1. ask them if they like to stop here or continue before
                  pressing the meter</p>
              <p>2. ask them if they like a receipt</p>
              <p>This are the basics expected of a TD.</p>
              <p>For my above post, am I asking all that? I only expecting you to
                  tell me that price and not just point to the MDT, is it too much to
                  ask?</p>

                  by the world to move according to your biddings?</span></p>
              <p>The purpose of this forum is to share TD's grievances and well
                  as mistakes so that we all can learn from it. If u will to protect
                  until so obvious, what's there to talk then?</p>

              <p>From the way u post this comment, I gather that you are well
                      educated.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I think you can make a good accountant, doctor or whatever you are
                      trained for but I dun think you will make a good taxi driver with
                      yr following comments:</p>
              <p style="color: #ff0000; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Expect (<span style="color: #ff0000;">some more from only a few
                      dollars biz</span>) and you'll be disappointed.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Be a TD longer then see if you feel the same way!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If you have that concept that for just a few dollars, you expect me
                      to smile, this service industry, with always that few dollars,
                      certainly looks miserable to you.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Worst till, with such education standard, one would expect you to
                      be more tactful than going around criticising ppl's education
                      standard.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Just for your info, Public Relation, the art of dealing with
                      people, doesn't need a degree ok?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Have u read today's paper, the SMRT CEO's failure is her PR
                      skills?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">PR skils are natural, ah beng, ah seng, or ah lian ah huay can have
                      it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It's just saying the right thing at the right time in the right
                      manner which obvious u are lacking in spite of your high level
                      education.</p>
