              <p>A cabby was sentenced to two weeks jail for obstructing a public 
              servant from discharging his duties.</p>
              <p>Tan Teck San, 46, parked his 
              taxi half a metre behind an ambulance at Marina Square around noon on 20
               Feb last year.</p>
              <p>The paramedics had been dispatched to a clinic 
              there because a patient was feeling breathless.
              
              
              <a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=v8/3962/0/0/%2a/n;44306;0-0;0;39581173;4307-300/250;0/0/0;;%7Esscs=%3f"><img src="http://s0.2mdn.net/viewad/817-grey.gif" border="0" alt="Click here to find 
              out more!"></a></p>
              <p>While they could open the rear doors of the 
              ambulance, they could not move the patient from the stretcher into the 
              ambulance.</p>
              <p>When one of the paramedics asked the cabby to shift his
               vehicle, Tan said he couldn't because of another vehicle parked behind 
              his, and added: "So what (if) you got (a) call?"</p>
              <p>He then asked the
               paramedics to move their ambulance forward.</p>
              <p>Tan is now out on 
              bail pending his appeal against his sentence. For obstructing a public 
              servant, Tan could have been jailed three months and fined $2,500.</p>

              <p>Yes the ambulance can move forward and save the day, but the taxi still obstructed the ambulance.</p>

              <p>well, speaking from a taxi driver pt of view, a clap.</p>
              <p>I think this was just a bit too much. Why does it need to involve Jail? A fine would have been enough for it will hit the driver hard and message sent.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, we all read the story, but we dont know what happened before like, maybe the taxi driver was involved in some other incidents, and in that thought, the ambulance driver.</p>
              <p>Normally, the AO or ambulance officer or we called vehicle commander is the officer who will make the call.</p>
              <p>And in this case, she/he must have been pushed over the edge.</p>

              <p>U guys dun forget , every ambulance has got a camera to take down all those things u did .</p>
              <p>They have reached their limits for this case , and with evidence , they can proceed with pressing charges against that taxi driver .</p>

              <p>Not only the vehicle commander can be the wtiness , ambuance driver also can be witness , beside those evidence taken from the camera .</p>
              <p>My advice , whatever ego u can have , whatever obstructions u can have , at least u try to make way for ambulance .</p>
              <p>They are there for a rescue mission , not la kopi .</p>
              <p>This is certainly a wake up call for those ignorant driver .</p>
              <p>Whatever anti-PAP or anti-government , pls la ....... Ambulance are there to save your fellow Singaporeans , fellow lives .</p>
