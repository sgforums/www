              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The New Year Countdown party at Singapore's Marina Bay is expected to draw in a bigger crowd this year, with the completion of key developments in the area and more vantage points on offer.<br><br>The Marina Bay Singapore Countdown, touted as the nation's biggest party, has attracted thousands every year and this year, some 300,000 are expected.<br><br>But unlike previous years, the Esplanade Bridge will not be available as a vantage point as it will be opened to vehicular traffic. But revellers will have many other vantage points with the opening of new public spaces.<br><br>Fun Siew Leng, Group Director of Urban Planning and Design with the Urban Redevelopment Authority, said: "This year is a very special year, it's a culmination of a whole year of events of 2010, because 2010 marks the completion of many major developments around the Marina Bay including the Waterfront Promenade, the Helix and the key developments such as the Marina Bay Sands."<br><br>As part of the Countdown sequence, a new element has been added to mark the final 10 seconds of 2010 before a brand new year begins. This set of surge lights you see behind me will shine rays of bright lights that will converge from opposite ends of Marina Bay, forming a distinct canopy of light shining over the entire Bay. And at the stroke of midnight, there will be fireworks for eight minutes.<br><br>The spectacle will be accompanied by an original score by local composer, Iskandar Ismail. Wishes from community leaders and well-known personalities will be shown in the form of video dedications. Revellers will also be treated to free performances and art activities that will begin from 5pm to 1am.<br><br>Those at home can watch the countdown live on MediaCorp's Channel 5 from 11pm onwards.<br><br>The show will feature homegrown acts like Jill-Marie Thomas - winner of talent show, One Moment of Glory, local rock band Rancour and taiwanese star, David Tao.<br><br>With the expected bigger turnout, security is not taken lightly.<br><br>Central Police Division Commander Tan Hung Hooi, said: "As this is the first year that the bay area is fully opened, we are deploying about in total 1,400 officers for the event, the number includes police officers, auxiliary police officers, as well as event security officers. Due to the large number of people expected in the area, we advise members of the public to be patient and very importantly to cooperate with the officers. This is to ensure that while they have a good time here, they can also go home in a safe and orderly manner."<br><br>Crowd control barricades and directional signs will be put to facilitate safe and orderly crowd dispersal. Bag checks may also be conducted. Women are advised to be vigilant against those who might commit molest in crowded areas. Police said in some cases the culprits have been known to spray foam onto the victim and take the opportunity to commit the act in the process.<br><br>And to ensure a smoother flow of traffic, party-goers are urged to take public transport. Some roads near the venue will have lane closures, with full closures only kicking in from 11.30pm on some roads, to facilitate people to the venue before the countdown begins. The footway along Benjamin Sheares Bridge will also be closed to the public from 6pm to 1am due to public safety concerns like overcrowding.<br><br>The Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2010/2011 is being jointly presented by Esplanade and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.<br></span></span></p>
