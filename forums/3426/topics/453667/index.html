              <p>Knocked out cold.<br><br>That’s what happened to a taxi driver after picking up a passenger from a hotel in Pasir Panjang, according to news reports.<br><br>Police arrested a 30-year-old man on Wednesday morning after he allegedly beat up the taxi driver until the latter was unconscious, reported <a class="inline" href="http://www.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20120607-351182.html"><span><span style="color: #006ec2;">Asiaone</span></span></a>. <br><br>According to Chinese daily Shin Min Daily News, the 48-year-old taxi driver said he had picked up his passenger from a hotel in Pasir Panjang through a telephone booking. <br><br>Trouble began when the passenger, reportedly a Korean male, vented his anger on the cabby for driving a "lousy car". Speaking fluent English, he proceeded to raise his voice at the taxi driver while ordering him to head to the airport after throwing his luggage into the boot. <br><br>Despite repeated efforts by the driver to calm the passenger down, he refused, even breaking a door handle while trying to force the door open. <br><br>It was at this point the taxi driver decided to call the police, which only served to infuriate the passenger further, reported Asiaone.<br><br>The man allegedly began punching the driver's head and back -- knocking him unconscious – after the taxi driver tried to take the man’s photo.<br><br>When the cabby regained consciousness, the passenger allegedly continued to attack him until the latter begged him to stop. Police arrived just as the passenger was retrieving his bags from the taxi. <br><br>Said <a class="inline" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=ComfortDelGro&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;vm=r&amp;cs=bz"><span><span style="color: #006ec2;">ComfortDelGro</span></span></a> spokesperson Tammy Tan, "We are shocked to learn about the incident and certainly do not condone passengers displaying such aggression towards our cabbies, especially since our cabby had done nothing to provoke the passenger in this instance."<br><br>Tan added that their immediate concern is the well-being of their driver and the company will be assisting the driver with his medical bills. The taxi operator is also currently working with the police for investigations.</p>

Comes the point when men are unsure of the role they play, everything gets messed up. Down here many men treat their women too good, then their women go fxxk someone else, u agree meh?</p>

              <p>Tats what u say la. They way SG men treat their women here is a
              joke to many other parts of the world also. So many like slaves for
              them. wtf is mcp anyway? Comes the point when men are unsure of the
              role they play, everything gets messed up. Down here many men treat
              their women too good, then their women go fxxk someone else, u
              agree meh?</p>

              <p>Knocked out cold.<br> <br> That’s what happened to a taxi driver after picking up a passenger
                  from a hotel in Pasir Panjang, according to news reports.<br> <br> Police arrested a 30-year-old man on Wednesday morning after he
                  allegedly beat up the taxi driver until the latter was unconscious,
                  reported <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20120607-351182.html"><span><span style="color: #006ec2;">Asiaone</span></span></a>.<br> <br> According to Chinese daily Shin Min Daily News, the 48-year-old
                  taxi driver said he had picked up his passenger from a hotel in
                  Pasir Panjang through a telephone booking.<br> <br> Trouble began when the passenger, reportedly a Korean male, vented
                  his anger on the cabby for driving a "lousy car". Speaking fluent
                  English, he proceeded to raise his voice at the taxi driver while
                  ordering him to head to the airport after throwing his luggage into
                  the boot.<br> <br> Despite repeated efforts by the driver to calm the passenger down,
                  he refused, even breaking a door handle while trying to force the
                  door open.<br> <br> It was at this point the taxi driver decided to call the police,
                  which only served to infuriate the passenger further, reported
                  Asiaone.<br> <br> The man allegedly began punching the driver's head and back --
                  knocking him unconscious – after the taxi driver tried to take the
                  man’s photo.<br> <br> When the cabby regained consciousness, the passenger allegedly
                  continued to attack him until the latter begged him to stop. Police
                  arrived just as the passenger was retrieving his bags from the
                  taxi.<br> <br> Said <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=ComfortDelGro&amp;amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;amp;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;vm=r&amp;amp;cs=bz"><span><span style="color: #006ec2;">ComfortDelGro</span></span></a> spokesperson
                  Tammy Tan, "We are shocked to learn about the incident and
                  certainly do not condone passengers displaying such aggression
                  towards our cabbies, especially since our cabby had done nothing to
                  provoke the passenger in this instance."<br> <br> Tan added that their immediate concern is the well-being of their
                  driver and the company will be assisting the driver with his
                  medical bills. The taxi operator is also currently working with the
                  police for investigations.</p>

              <p>If the korean had taken the sonata i took yesterday, he would have killed the taxi driver. The car was doing "Rock &amp; Roll" all the way from Hougang to Woodlands. It was like taking a boat ride. Sampan would be the right word. Felt like I was back in JB. Wasn't TD fault, stupid Com..f..k doing. This kind of "Budget Maintenance" standard also road worthy. What is LTA doing? Sleeping</p>

              <p>Even taxis is lousy, you cannot lay your hand on others, I believe this is more of an isolated case whereby this fucker korean maybe got sacked and ask to leave, or that he missed singapore so much as a Foreign talent and now have to go back to korea to be worker again.</p>
              <p>It is also true that those sonatas are hell of a noisy after 2 to 3 years, but the damn company have yet to breakeven the investment, how to renew, and being savy, employed Foreign service people who careless about you and their bosses, but more about their saving and homeland.</p>
              <p>It unlike yesterday where we work with passion and loyalty, today where got passion, loyalty and teamwork, all wants $$ and work selfishly.</p>
