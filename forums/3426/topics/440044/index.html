Last vehicle B sped past too fast &amp; rear door is accidentally rubbed against taxi's front bumper. 100% on taxi or vehicle B or 50/50?<br><br>Scene C:<br>Taxi on slope, vehicle C reverse back due to slope and hits taxi front. This is clearly vehicle C's fault but weird enough, vehicle C managed to claim on taxi.<br><br>Appreciate everyone's feedback as it will guide us all drivers a good knowledge on accident issues to prevent it from happening &amp; a better place to drive for.<br><br>**Above all are based on true scenarios and open for honest opinions and discussions.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thanks for your explanation Poolman, learnt something.<br><br>One more if u don't mind, u know those small roads that have stop line especially in Syed Alwi Road, Desker Road along Jalan Besar /  Serangoon Road? Those cars always likes to from small lane turn out to main road without checking and caused main road vehicles to slow down dangerously.<br><br>What if vehicle A from small lane (Syed Alwi along Jalan Besar Road) with stop line turns left to main road SLOWLY and then straight vehicle B from Jalan Besar Road hits vehicle A, whose fault will this be then?<br><br>Also, there's 2 situation,<br><br>Situation 1: veh B hits veh A's FRONT right side near tyre area, A or B or 50/50?<br><br>Situation 2: veh A managed to turn out fast in time but slowed down and veh B hits A's rear, A or B? or 50/50?<br><br>Situation 3: veh A SUDDENLY inched out of small lane SO MUCH that almost half the vehicle is on the main road when veh B was approaching fast towards Syed Alwi. veh A clearly knows that veh B is travelling fast but still inch out and dare not turn left to move. If veh B unable to stop in time and hits veh A right on at driver's door, whose fault again? A or B or 50/50?<br><br>The above happens so often with idiotic drivers who turns out from small lane to major roads and EXPECT major road vehicles to give way which during driving lessons, we are being taught to "Slow Down" when approaching small lanes in case there's vehicle suddenly speeding to avoid an accident. But in real life situations, those bastards just "misunderstood" the meaning and abuse it causing all the unnecessary traffic situations.</p></div>

              <p>I also have a accident scenerio to seek opinion. This happens last year October at Jalan Besar Rd.</p>
              <p>My car stopped at the left side of the one way road, just before a left turn small lane. I turned on hazard lights and ask a passerby for road directions.</p>
              <p>When finished, I switch off hazard lights and start to SLOWLY move forward. This pickup on my right want to turn into the small lane on the left. So he swerve SUDDENLY across my path and his left side crashed my front right bumper and headlights.</p>
              <p>His argument say I should not stop just before the left turn, so he has no choice but to turn in front of me. I argue say that he should check his left side before SLOWLY turning.</p>
              <p>Who is correct? Anyway, his insurance pay me a partial sum after I insist he compensate my repair fees. I think become 50/50.</p>

              <p>That's a good link mancha, thanks so much.<br><br>But sometimes looking at the scenario given, it's very subjective &amp; also quite arguementative which the pdf is perhaps just a "guideline" for people to play safe like the highway code.<br><br>Highway code says don't this, don't that, but all drivers "by right shouldn't this, shouldn't that" will follow the "by left law" instead when no TP/law enforcer is watching...<br></p>

              <p><br>If that pick up has a video cam, you can be wrong, you cannot stop so near to a turning lane, you are quite lucky to go 50/50. For those who needs to ply on the road daily as a mean of earning a living, get a cam, it can save you alot of trouble in argueing. In highway codes, there are restriction in the way you stop yr vehicle from fire hydrant, bus stops, junctions, turning lanes and so on, some with 3 car lengths, some 6 car lengths. But you tends to see vehicles just stop anywhere, nothing happen is ok, but once, touch wood, bang only, all kinds of codes and laws start to fly</p>

              <p>how to win</p>
              <p>1. from small road out , drive fast fast out to the main road and don't hesitate...  Why? --  cos if you are slow, the on coming vehicle hit your front,  you loose case, no need to talk or argue,  (small lane give way to main road)</p>
              <p>if you drive fast out .............. by time the car hit you,  most likely hit your car back side... you say lay... of course unless the other car got install  camera. bo bian lor</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. if you are on the main road , car from small lane turning into main road, if you think no confident to stop and will hit the car. then you better ramp fast and hit the front of the other car..  if not you hit his back side( and no camera install) you likely lost case,  normally pax in your veh to be witness not very strong case</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Brother, no offence, sound like you want to create accident than to prevent it.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>From small road, you should drive slowly before flitering out, look out on the right, once no car, move on, sometimes when there are alots of car, and you cannot move out, I use to wave at the on coming slow vehicle to let me out, and most of them will wave back and let me go, it makes both our day happier. Same for main road, you should also beware of small road car or even bicycle and motorcyle coming out, prevention is better than cure. If you think you are tired, take a nap or rest.</p>
              <p>I think whether we are in the right or wrong, tell ourselves that we do not want accident to happen, once hit, all kinds of arguement can come in, nobody involved benefit, not even the cab or insurance companies, only the repair shop gain, and they are waiting for these kind of jobs</p>

              <p>yes wave some time are given way.</p>
              <p>i am not creating any accident, it's for sure accident  case like i have say. teaches you that  sometime you try  to brake to prevent hit but cannot avoid.</p>
              <p>cos hitting (a small road turning out car) got different when you touches the front or the back portion spell different when insurancer.</p>
              <p> try to determine who's fault.</p>
              <p>just like  brother hammer, if he move faster enough , the case he will have higher chances to win, in fact if he do so, the SBS bus may not even be seen in the video</p>
              <p>i handle lot of case so know how insurance company work on accident to determine who right or wrong</p>
