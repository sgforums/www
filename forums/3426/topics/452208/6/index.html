              <p>What the fuck, this China bastard killed so many people? What more, the taxi driver was the sole breadwinner in the family. It's not like taxi drivers earn alot in the first place, how is his schooling children able to live on from now? He was only trying to earn a living doing the night shift when he could have slept at home, then out of nowhere this China cheebye came and beat the redlight and crashed into the taxi?<br><br>Ditto for the Japanese tourist in the cab, she could be back in Japan enjoying life.</p>
              <p>Anyone seen the irony in yesterday's (12 May) Shin Min report on Page 2 of the newspaper? The top half of the page was the Ferrari accident and how PATHETIC AND PITIFUL the China bastard died. PUI.</p>
              <p>Then the bottom half of that same page was the report on a NS man who died while serving NS, which ironically is to protect Singapore. Huh protect simi lanjiao? Protect Singapore so that more of those China fucktards can come and kill more of us made-in-Singapore people? (the term 'Singaporeans' can't apply anymore, China bastards 10years in Singapore can become PR and then later Singaporean already)</p>
              <p>It's bad enough <br>1) you beat the red light. <br>2) You drive a Ferrari in the wee hours. <br>3) You drank (Witnesses said the dead China driver reeked of alcohol anyway)<br>4) You killed other innocent parties.<br>5) Who the hell was the girl beside you in your Ferrari? Your wife was happily sleeping at your East Coast landed property anyway eh.</p>
              <p>Seriously, the Government needs to look into their welcome-all-PRC-idiots policy right now. This is getting way out of hand. Sooner or later in 10 years, this small island right beside Malaysia would just become a satellite state of China, just like Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. </p>

              <p>The guy who beat the red light and killed three person is protrayed as a kind and charitable guy.</p>
              <p>The fact is that he commited a crime and should be reprimanded instead of seeking public sympathy because he is rich.</p>
              <p>So, the rich can commit a crime and get away from it.</p>

              <p>Look, drivers driving have to keep a lookout more so in training area where it's dirt track. Furthermore at Marsiling, as far as I still remembered it has steep slopes. speed control is very important on top of looking out for road condition...</p>
              <p>Driving has to keep everyone safe. Simple as that...</p>
              <p>As for the Ferrari accident, locals also do tat.. On Friday I ended up seeing 2 BMW beating red light aft 3 sec at 2 seperate junctions.. Are those tiongs? No they aren't, more look like locals.</p>
              <p>I can say tis, if there's maniac local drivers, bound to have foreigners thinking it's acceptable.</p>

              <p>The guy who beat the red light and killed three person is protrayed as a kind and charitable guy.</p>
              <p>The fact is that he commited a crime and should be reprimanded instead of seeking public sympathy because he is rich.</p>
              <p>So, the rich can commit a crime and get away from it.</p>
              <p>What else is the press hiding ?</p>

              <p>LOL. I also know it's a vehicle incident. Don't have to shoot me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> But what's the purpose of NS in the first place? Isn't it the purpose of protecting the country and it's people? That's what the government had been preaching anyway isn't it. You might be all patriotic and all, I'm just trying to reflect what alot of us here are thinking.<br><br>I understand your point that we have bad drivers, but I'm just highlighting that this policy of getting more and more PRC in Singapore is getting way out of hand. <br><br>So be it if you don't see my point of view.
