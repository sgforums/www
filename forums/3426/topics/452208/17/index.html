              <p>The late Ma Chi was driving a limited-edition Ferrari when he allegedly tried to beat the traffic lights and slammed into a Comfort Delgro taxi, then a car and a motorcycle. A 52-year-old taxi driver and his 41-year-old passenger was killed as a result, with three others seriously injured and himself killed.</p>
              <p>The accident was recorded by an onboard camera mounted in a vehicle that was in the vicinity and subsequently uploaded online. The video went viral and was widely reported by the Chinese media, both print and online.</p>
              <p>Viewed by netizens in as far as China, Chinese netizens purportedly conducted a “human search” and managed to identify Ma Chi as the brother of a fugitive mafia boss in ChongQin (China). Ma Yong, supposedly the mafia boss, reportedly ran to GuangZhou after the crackdown on secret society was initiated by the Chinese authorities.</p>

              <p>what a load of BS but coming from u , why am i not surprised? So if the ferrari were to hit the 2nd taxi or the black car , are u going to turn around and say why drive so slow? he should have driven faster to avoid getting hit mah!</p>
              <p>It just so happens that  the faster car off the line gets hit and u saying Mr cheng drive too fast?</p>

              SINGAPORE - The daughter of taxi driver Cheng Teck Hock - who was killed in a high-speed crash involving a Ferrari - will have her school fees taken care of should she qualify for university, while her family will receive "all necessary assistance", including legal assistance, said Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam.
              
              Mr Shanmugam, who is the Member of Parliament for Nee Soon GRC - where Mr Cheng's family resides - gave this assurance yesterday when he attended the wake for Mr Cheng at Block 306, Canberra Road.
              
              He said Mr Cheng's daughter, Stephanie, 21, who recently graduated from a polytechnic, need not give up her hopes of going to university to work and support the family.
              
              Mr Cheng, 52, had been the family's sole breadwinner.
              
              Mr Shanmugam said: "Education is not an issue here and as long as she qualifies for university, we will make sure it will be taken care of."
              
              As for the long-term needs of the family, such as their outstanding payment of their five-room HDB flat, Mr Shanmugam said that "a package will be put together" with help from the constituency's welfare fund, NTUC, Mr Cheng's employer ComfortDelGro, voluntary welfare organisations and well-wishers.
              
              Details of the help that will be given have not been discussed as the family has called for time to grieve, he added.
              
              Mr Cheng died after a crash early on Saturday morning involving a Ferrari, his taxi and a motorcycle. The Ferrari driver, Mr Ma Chi, was killed, as was Mr Cheng's passenger, Ms Shigemi Ito.
              
              Mr Ma's passenger, an unknown Chinese woman, and motorcyclist Muhammad Najib Ghazali, 25, are still in hospital.
              
              Mr Cheng had been a taxi driver for 10 years. He leaves behind his wife, two sons and a daughter.
              
              -----------------------------------------------
              
              Nothing in the media mention about the info of latest investigation progress.  
              
              Disappointed, but hope Mr Shanmugam will fulfills his promise to help the family all the way.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE</span> – The daughter of taxi driver
              Cheng Teck Hock – who was killed in a high-speed crash involving a
              Ferrari – will have her school fees taken care of should she
              qualify for university, while her family will receive “all
              necessary assistance”, including legal assistance, said Law and
              Foreign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam, who is the Member of Parliament for Nee Soon
              <span>GRC</span> – where Mr Cheng’s family resides – gave
              this assurance yesterday when he attended the wake for Mr Cheng at
              Block 306, Canberra Road.</p>
              <p>He said Mr Cheng’s daughter, Stephanie, 21, who recently
              graduated from a polytechnic, need not give up her hopes of going
              to university to work and support the family.</p>
              <p>Mr Cheng, 52, had been the family’s sole breadwinner.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam said: “Education is not an issue here and as long
              as she qualifies for university, we will make sure it will be taken
              care of.”</p>
              <p>As for the long-term needs of the family, such as their
              outstanding payment of their five-room <span>HDB</span> flat, Mr Shanmugam said that “a package will be put together” with
              help from the constituency’s welfare fund, <span>NTUC</span>, Mr Cheng’s employer ComfortDelGro, voluntary
              welfare organisations and well-wishers.</p>
              <p>Details of the help that will be given have not been discussed
              as the family has called for time to grieve, he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Cheng died after a crash early on Saturday morning involving
              a Ferrari, his taxi and a motorcycle. The Ferrari driver, Mr Ma
              Chi, was killed, as was Mr Cheng’s passenger, Ms Shigemi Ito.</p>
              <p>Mr Ma’s passenger, an unknown Chinese woman, and motorcyclist
              Muhammad Najib Ghazali, 25, are still in hospital.</p>
              <p>Mr Cheng had been a taxi driver for 10 years. He leaves behind
              his wife, two sons and a daughter.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Nothing in the media mention about the info of latest
              investigation progress.</p>
              <p>Disappointed, but hope Mr Shanmugam will fulfills his promise to
              help the family all the way.</p>

So what he is the sole bread winner of the family? What about the passenger of his cab? She is paying money to get a ride home end up dead because of the negligence of the cabby. Yes to me both the driver of the Ferrari and taxi are AT FAULT! Why? Because he assume green light then step on the pedal, on turbo and there he goes. Never bother to check. Take things for granted. For a Ferrari to go do fast and in the middle of the night we would have heard the car before we see it. Why did the other taxi driver that took the video footage stop in time and this Sonata driver didn't? Because simply BO CHAP. Green means step pedal and go. </span></p>

And the other just simply BO CHAP. I am not a saint, I also speed but only when I am taking call and I do look out the surrounding when I am speeding for other road users. But when taking pax is a different thing, I never speed because I am responsible for their safely</span><span style="color: #333333;">. </span></p>

By the way from what u write u sound that he don't deserve any help from u but now u say u Have done your small part to help the family? After all you have already done a big part hurting them. </p>

              <p>from what we see, imagine if HH88 is behind Mr Yeo's taxi and Mr Yeo's taxi is slow in moving, most likely he will horn like mad or just cut out to the other lane and speed away...</p>
              <p>and one very fine example that he cant wait till green line to move off, is that accident with the double decker bus in the yellow box at Chinatown area last time? he claim that he move off into the yellow box as he anticipate that the light is GOING TO TURN GREEN.... now he is saying that ppl move off too fast even after the traffic light have turn green?  how ironic....</p>

              <p>i would think that the ferrari driver tot the 1st traffic light at bugis village is the first traffic light of the junction (i.e mistaken that after that traffic junction is the traffic junction) so he just speed through it. since it should be green and he forgotten about the next junction at his speed of driving.</p>
