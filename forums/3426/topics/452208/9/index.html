              <p>I have received email from CDG appealing for donation for the cabby. So what he is the sole bread winner of the family? What about the passenger of his cab? She is paying money to get a ride home end up dead because of the negligence of the cabby. Yes to me both the driver of the Ferrari and taxi are AT FAULT! Why? Because he assume green light then step on the pedal, on turbo and there he goes. Never bother to check. Take things for granted. For a Ferrari to go do fast and in the middle of the night we would have heard the car before we see it. Why did the other taxi driver that took the video footage stop in time and this Sonata driver didn't? Because simply BO CHAP. Green means step pedal and go. </p>
              <p>I dun pity any of the driver cos one simply have no regards of the traffic rules and use the road as his private race track. And the other just simply BO CHAP. I am not a saint, I also speed but only when I am taking call and I do look out the surrounding when I am speeding for other road users. But when taking pax is a different thing, I never speed because I am responsible for their safely. </p>

              <p>Where got time to react? But before that he SHOULD heard the F599 coming. If not why the other taxi can take video of the accident? Obviously that TD is taking thing for granted or not paying attention. I really pity the poor Jap pax who just want a ride home. He die due to his own negligence and carelessness is his own business. I dun see why we should donate anything to him. So many people die on the road everyday if we want to help how many can we help?</p>

              <p>Now everything happened, talk like so easy like that. Just by hearing you can tell what happen.</p>
              <p>From that few seconds of video footage, we can tell that 10 sec before the red light, the Ferrari should be no where in sight, even if u can hear the sound, u know instantly what's happening? What to react? Now I know la, cos I watch the video. Of course I can say these and say that right?</p>
              <p>From the way u talk about the taxi driver taking video, u dun seems to know anything about how these video works. The recording starts the moment you start work and it just keep recording, once it reaches the limit of your memory space, it overwrite the one before that.</p>
              <p>Not the case that Mr Yeo saw what happen and start to record, haha, what a joke. How could that be possible, it happens so fast.</p>
              <p>Btw, u think the Ferrari driver want to die? He must have over estimate the speed and the red light and if you notice from the video, he did take action to steer left to avoid headon with the cab, that's why the impact is slightly to the left. If it is direct headon, the female pax could have been another death victim. Agreed?</p>
              <p>As that Mr Yeo told the New Paper, he could be the one who got it, but Cabby Cheng is faster at the start? Reason? someone on top say so? His load of one lady pax is definitely lighter that Cabby Yeo's 4 pax, that's why affect the pickup? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>

              <p>Wah.....you are thinking very logically. Actually this accident is very suay for the TD. The ferrari was going at 200 km/h, that's about slightly more than 3 km/min. Caught the TD by surprise I believe. He would have avoided if he could. Negligence? Nono.</p>
