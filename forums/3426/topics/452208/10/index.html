              <p>Whoa! No chance to evade man... Ferrari 599 GTO, V12 - 600++
              HP.. 0 to 100 KM/h in just over 3 seconds. RIP to such an awesome
              car. Even if the driver didnt rev it and gun for it... he was
              already on cruising speed. No chance man... by the time u would
              have heard it, it would be too late.</p>
              <p>Unlucky taxi and an even unluckier passenger in the taxi.
               I can see ppl starting to speculate the presence of the china
              girl. Which reminds me of a few incidents I was aware of.
               Sometimes u get busted  hanky panky, and sometimes u
              dont.  Sometimes u get busted hanky panky after your demise
              and that.... is way worse. No way to defend yourself. And the truth
              pretty much laid bare right under such circumstances.</p>

              like u only hv 1 yr experience on the road n inhuman..; v.s.
              Poolman is more human n speaks like he got 20yrs experience on the
              road.. the taxi with the webcam got the life saving position given
              by God as he was nearest n given the clear view of the on coming
              Red Ferrari n was partly blocking the view of Mr Chian who got the
              right way on green light..if this position were to be switched..the
              dead TD is 99% Mr Yeo n not Mr Chian</span></p>

              <p>How many times you see Sonatas zooming off when light turn green? Not all but most do it. IF he died without any pax I still will feel empathy for him because I can understand it is very competitive business with the high overheads that make us YAO.

              <p>How about the black car beside Mr C? He is block by 2 taxi leh. And you see properly Mr C cab is way ahead so if he bother to check to his left he would have zam big brake and siam. If you notice he din even brake at all. His right foot is firmly pressing on the accelerator thats why he is pulling away from the others. So it got nothing to do with life saving position given by God.</p>

              <p>Maybe Cabby Yeo dreaming, listening to pax conversation or digging his nose. You never know right? When he pick up slow, he makes Cabby Cheng looks like going faster right?</p>
              <p>From the video show, I dun see any shooting off, but more of a regular pick up speed. People already died liao, at least give him a benefit of a doubt la.</p>
              <p>You are practically driving a motion to prevent or rather discourage ppl from donating to his family stating that he deserved it too. How u think if his family, already devastated from losing a love one, get to read your post?</p>
              <p>How would you feel if you happens to switch role with cabby cheng now?</p>
              <p>Do u think the Cheng family now have a windfall with lots of money coming in? U want to be in their shoes now? Honestly, even if we can donate $50-$100 now, with or without it doesn't really make a different to them. BUT, your donation will create positive karma for YOURSELF which will come back to u in many folds in "dunno when u need it"</p>
