              Recently three sonatas, two vehicles caught fire, now one driver killed.
              Is it really an auspicious take a ride or drive a sonata?
                      
              I am sympathy with all parties involved. As I know, accidents like this will not end anytime now. I think the relevant authorities have to address the issues, it concern a singaporean's live and the rider Mr Najib (motorcycle) who is still in hospital. 
                      
              Had anyone forget the Sengkang East Road accident involving SBStransit Bus and 66yr old lady? It was case closed. Well, just because of that lady was a malaysian. Die injustically.
                      
              To me, my garment let me down, I work hard driving long taxi hour, paid my house and medical and I gain peanuts. So if 10 yrs later, my health allows, I will shift out from here.

              <p>Seriously speaking, it is quite disappointed to see such
              comments coming from hammerhammer8888 a fellow TD. You sounded
              as though Cabby Cheng deserve to die. I don't see the cabby is
              reckless in any form. He move off when is good to go (green lights)
              just that he move a little faster than anyone else. Is this his
              fault? Do you know red light (ferrari direction) change to green
              light (cab direction) takes about 2 seconds. And most likely it
              takes about another 2 to 3seconds to reach the path of the
              ferrari.</p>
              <p>4 to 5 seconds of red light (ferrari direction) , yet the stupid
              guy fail to stop.</p>
              <p>We are all cabby , if an outsider doesn't know our hardship on
              the road, i could understand. But for you hammerhammer8888 a fellow
              TD slamming the same colleagues on the road is pretty sad
              scene.</p>
              <p>That night i did pass by the scene aftermath just before 0450am,
              it was in a mess. Whole road is block off. Next day i learn the
              news and saw video, my first thought was my wife and my 2
              daughters. Chill down my spine.</p>
              <p>I believe most of the TD brothers also have this thoughts. What
              happen if that cab was me.</p>

              <p>Recently three sonatas, two vehicles caught fire, now one driver
              killed.<br> Is it really an auspicious take a ride or drive a sonata?</p>
              <p>I am sympathy with all parties involved. As I know, accidents
              like this will not end anytime now. I think the relevant
              authorities have to address the issues, it concern a singaporean’s
              live and the rider Mr Najib (motorcycle) who is still in
              hospital.</p>
              <p>Had anyone forget the Sengkang East Road accident involving
              SBStransit Bus and 66yr old lady? It was case closed. Well, just
              because of that lady was a malaysian. Die injustically.</p>
              <p>To me, my garment let me down, I work hard driving long taxi
              hour, paid my house and medical and I gain peanuts. So if 10 yrs
              later, my health allows, I will shift out from here.</p>
              <p>If you guys feel brave enough to drop your views to the
              ministers, I have the details. If moderator feels my thread is
              discouraging, please feel free to lock me out.</p>
