                              <p>What the fuck, this China bastard killed so many people? What
              more, the taxi driver was the sole breadwinner in the family. It's
              not like taxi drivers earn alot in the first place, how is his
              schooling children able to live on from now? He was only trying to
              earn a living doing the night shift when he could have slept at
              home, then out of nowhere this China cheebye came and beat the
              redlight and crashed into the taxi?<br>
              <br>
              Ditto for the Japanese tourist in the cab, she could be back in
              Japan enjoying life.</p>
              <p>Anyone seen the irony in yesterday's (12 May) Shin Min report on
              Page 2 of the newspaper? The top half of the page was the Ferrari
              accident and how PATHETIC AND PITIFUL the China bastard died.
              PUI.</p>
              <p>Then the bottom half of that same page was the report on a NS
              man who died while serving NS, which ironically is to protect
              Singapore. Huh protect simi lanjiao? Protect Singapore so that more
              of those China fucktards can come and kill more of us
              made-in-Singapore people? (the term 'Singaporeans' can't apply
              anymore, China bastards 10years in Singapore can become PR and then
              later Singaporean already)</p>
              <p>It's bad enough<br>
              1) you beat the red light.<br>
              2) You drive a Ferrari in the wee hours.<br>
              3) You drank (Witnesses said the dead China driver reeked of
              alcohol anyway)<br>
              4) You killed other innocent parties.<br>
              5) Who the hell was the girl beside you in your Ferrari? Your wife
              was happily sleeping at your East Coast landed property anyway
              eh.</p>
              <p>Seriously, the Government needs to look into their
              welcome-all-PRC-idiots policy right now. This is getting way out of
              hand. Sooner or later in 10 years, this small island right beside
              Malaysia would just become a satellite state of China, just like
              Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. </p>

              Main article: Flaming (Internet)
              When a thread â€” or in some cases, an entire forum â€” becomes unstable, the result is usually uncontrolled spam in the form of one-line complaints, image macros, or abuse of the report system. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other's differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a flame war. To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion and socio-political topics, or topics that discuss pre-existing rivalries outside the forum (e.g., rivalry between games, console systems, car manufacturers, nationalities, etc.)
              When a topic that has degenerated into a flame war is considered akin to that of the forum (be it a section or the entire board), spam and flames have a chance of spreading outside the topic and causing trouble, usually in the form of vandalism. Some forums (commonly game forums) have suffered from forum-wide flame wars almost immediately after their conception, because of a pre-existing flame war element in the online community. Many forums have created devoted areas strictly for discussion of potential flame war topics that are moderated like normal.

              <p>I also sad for the Jap tourist.  She's just a regular commuter. Gahmen likes to impress the foreigners and attract them here.  What message will this accident send to Japan and all other countries?  "A foreigner imported by our gahmen has killed a local and another foreigner"?</p>
