              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>The mystery passenger involved in the fatal accident on Saturday
                      has been identified as a student from China who had just graduated
                      from a hospitality course at a private university here.</p>
              <p>In the latest updates by The Straits Times (ST), the woman is
                      still recovering in a high dependency ward at TTS after being
                      wheeled in to an operation on the afternoon of May 14.</p>
              <p>According to friends who visited her at the hospital, she is a
                      student from Wuhan, China, studying in Singapore.</p>
              <p>ST reported that her name is Ms Wu Wei Wei, and she is a recent
                      graduate from the East Asia Institute of Management.</p>
              <p>The private school has said that it was helping Ms Wu with her
                      insurance claims.</p>
              <p>Her friends, who declined to be named, said that they had seen
                      her with Mr Ma before, but did not elaborate on the nature of the
                      relationship.</p>
              <p>They added that Ms Wu has a boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Her friends also expressed doubt at the rumours flying around
                      about Ms Wu being a nightclub hostess, saying that it was not
                      possible as Ms Wu was a full-time student.</p>
              <p>She did not hold any job, they insisted.</p>
              <p>They added that Ms Wu is from a reputable and financially stable
                      family.</p>
              <p>"Why would she need to work as a hostess when her family can pay
                      for everything?" one female friend said.</p>
              <p>Ms Wu is currently in stable condition, but is weak and has
                      difficulty speaking, eating and walking.</p>
              <p>She declined to speak to the ST reporter.</p>
              <p>Just hours before the accident, Ms Wu was said to have been at a
                      graduation party with her classmates.</p>
              <p>However, details of how she ended up in the passenger seat of
                      the red Ferrari involved in the accident is unclear.</p>
              <p>All that is known is that she was out driving around Singapore
                      with Mr Ma Chi, 31, in the wee hours of Saturday morning.</p>
              <p>In the horrific accident that followed, she was seriously
                      injured in the three-vehicle crash that has claimed the lives of
                      three people so far.</p>
              <p>Those killed include Mr Ma, a Chinese national working as a
                      financial advisor here in Singapore, taxi driver Cheng Teck Hock,
                      52, and the taxi's passenger, a Japanese female passenger in her
                      20s.</p>
              <p>Ms Wu was the sole survivor of the direct crash, but walked away
                      with serious injuries, including head injuries and a fractured
                      right leg.</p>
              <p><strong>Motorcyclist Muhamad Azami Awang, 26, who was involved
                      in the accident described the woman to have long hair which was
                      dyed brown like an 'ah lian'.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>He added that she was slim and fair skinned, and was
                      wearing hot pants and a white spaghetti-strap tank
                      top.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>He told The New Paper that he was surprised to see the
                      woman emerge from the wrecked car.</strong></p>
              <p>Friends of Mr Ma told The Sunday Times that they have no idea
                      who the woman is. They also said they did not know why she would be
                      in the car with Mr Ma so early in the morning.</p>
              <p><strong>However, reports by Shinmin Daily point to the mystery
                      lady being a hostess at a popular nighclub.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It is believed that Mr Ma patronised the nightclub on
                      the night of his death, and brought the girl for a
                      spin.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>According to eye-witnesses, his red Ferrari had been
                      spotted several times at the nightclub premises. But the nightclub
                      valets interviewed by the paper said that they have never seen the
                      Ferrari at the location.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The paper further reported that there is indeed a
                      nightclub hostess at the club that has been warded in
                      hospital.</strong></p>

                  frames per sec and measured via google map the distance from the

                  following is the result:<br>
                  11 frames for Ferrari to travel from white line to taxi =
                  0.367sec<br>
                  Distance traveled estimated to be 18.9857m<br>
