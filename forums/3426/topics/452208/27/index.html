Remember the caucasian women run down the family of 3 @ Alexander road? No charge at all coz she was "momentarily blinded by the Sun"! I know Singapore, This is my country.

              <p>Those that remember the FT woman that killed the family of 3 at Alexander Rd. How possibly can that driver be acquitted without charge? But it did happen.</p>
              <p>My mockery is towards a perhaps questionable judicious system in Singapore. Those that are following the Woffles Wu case would know. Why is there no answer yet how that elite is getting a mere fine when the 'ordinary' Singaporeans gets jail term. No one is saying shoot the person causing death on the road, but no charge?!?!. I even cited examples of other rich people killing pedestrians on the road.  So Mancha's reply to me was pure trolling. The country claim no corruption I buey song. If you can buy your way out of trouble like all other corrupted countries, at least be honest about it.</p>

              <p>Brother, I share your sentiment, sad it might be, but the laws works in a way of intention and no intention, every accident is consider as no intention, that is why it is call An Accident. I bring you to a case many years ago,  a local teacher who while driving, dropped her keys and bent down to retrieve it, her car went up the pavement and killed a father and son. The father was my former colleague.</p>
              <p>End up also acquitted due to no intention, it is not a murder or manslaughter, it is mistake of a human fault operating on a human built machine that require a lot of safety on the road. It is then termed as neligience, get suspended, fined with no jail term due to the nature of the accident and also the teacher profession at stake.</p>
              <p>Our laws derive from the Common laws since independent, and it had been reviewed, changed and passed time after time as the world changes, it somehow works toward the employer and govt flavour and also at time the one at fault, unlike some other countries where you can bring up a person to court at many levels of the judiciary till you are full satisfy with it, Singapore laws, is in a way, one laws said it all.</p>

              <p>Brother, I share your sentiment, sad it might be, but the laws
              works in a way of intention and no intention, every accident is
              consider as no intention, that is why it is call An Accident. I
              bring you to a case many years ago,  a local teacher who
              while driving, dropped her keys and bent down to retrieve it, her
              car went up the pavement and killed a father and son. The father
              was my former colleague.</p>
              <p>End up also acquitted due to no intention, it is not a murder or
              manslaughter, it is mistake of a human fault operating on a human
              built machine that require a lot of safety on the road. It is then
              termed as neligience, get suspended, fined with no jail term due to
              the nature of the accident and also the teacher profession at
              stake.</p>
              <p>Our laws derive from the Common laws since independent, and it
              had been reviewed, changed and passed time after time as the
              world changes, it somehow works toward the employer and govt
              flavour and also at time the one at fault, unlike some other
              countries where you can bring up a person to court at many levels
              of the judiciary till you are full satisfy with it, Singapore laws,
              is in a way, one laws said it all.</p>

              <p>in this case, the guy intended to drive like a lunatic, intended to try to break the sound barrier on public roads, intended to run red lights... and in the event of intending to be a maniac on the roads, people are killed...</p>
              <p>what kind of intent and punishment if the asshole survived then?</p>

              <p>Serpent33 I think it is you that is trolling. You don't understand what a wrong is. And start accusing the government and justice system of kelong. You are clearly trolling.</p>
