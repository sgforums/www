              <p>I think you are assuming and not very fair at that too.</p>
              <p>Even if most Sonata shoot off upon green, u cannot assume that
              Cabby Cheng does that too right? Just because others do it.</p>
              <p>DoesCabby Cheng goes faster than cabby Yeo's makes him looks
              faster?</p>
              <p>Maybe Cabby Yeo dreaming, listening to pax conversation or
              digging his nose. You never know right? When he pick up slow, he
              makes Cabby Cheng looks like going faster right?</p>
              <p>From the video show, I dun see any shooting off, but more of a
              regular pick up speed. People already died liao, at least give him
              a benefit of a doubt la.</p>
              <p>You are practically driving a motion to prevent or rather
              discourage ppl from donating to his family stating that he deserved
              it too. How u think if his family, already devastated from losing a
              love one, get to read your post?</p>
              <p>How would you feel if you happens to switch role with cabby
              cheng now?</p>
              <p>Do u think the Cheng family now have a windfall with lots of
              money coming in? U want to be in their shoes now? Honestly, even if
              we can donate $50-$100 now, with or without it doesn't really make
              a different to them. BUT, your donation will create positive karma
              for YOURSELF which will come back to u in many folds in "dunno when
              u need it"</p>
              <p>So let's not plant negative karma be it verbal or physical
              ok?</p>

              surely he is not the only one speeding on the road.  in fact who wants to say he has never exceeded speed limit in his whole life driving on the road?  so do all who speed deserves to die?

              I dun think this gotta do with cautious and not cautious... it's green light...<br><br>The only one at fault is the speeding ferrari, be it drink driving or speeding or maybe the hostess give ahtiong driver blowjob or watever la...<br><br>
              
              even if u got superhuman reflex, ur car still wont accelerate or reverse fast enuff... The only reaction most ppl will have is either "siao liao" or "WTF" then bang~<br><br>
              
              besides u see the ferrari, it might not alarm u until u notice how fast it's going... but by then u'll already spend 2-3 second to judge that it's extremely fast, already no more time left... It's easier to judge speed if u see something zoom pass u, but for something coming staright at u, harder to judge speed becoz u need to judge distance first...

              <p>not sure abt the pick up speed of other cab at the scene, maybe the the cab tt caught the footage is just about to move also but it happened within that 1.5 secs<br>or isit bcos got many passengers so slower to move?</p>

              i dont understand why certain people get so worked up for.
              
              its an accident, not a deliberate act.  
              
              there is no need to insult him.  what has the fact he was a PRC and drove a ferrari got to do with anything?  would he be less blamed if he was a singaporean who drove a less expensive car?
              
              and what has his personal life got to do with the accident?
              
              please show some respect for the dead.  even if he made a mistake in life.  moreover he already paid with his life.
