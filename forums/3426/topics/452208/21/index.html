              SINGAPORE - The number of speeding violations in the first quarter of this year has fallen compared to the same period last year.
              
              Figures from the Traffic Police, released today, show that there were 46,650 violations in the first quarter of the year, a drop of 13,650.
              
              However, on a yearly basis, the number of speeding violations increased by about 20,550 last year when compared to 2010.
              
              The Traffic Police stressed that it would be relentless in carrying out anti-speed operations.
              
              The police added that besides various static speed cameras located island-wide, officers also carry out anti-speed operations on a daily basis.
              
              Motorists who are caught speeding will be slapped with a hefty fine and given demerit points.
              
              This update comes in the wake of the fatal Ferrari crash on May 12 that claimed three lives.
              
              To date, police have interviewed 12 witnesses, including the taxi driver who caught the accident footage with his in-vehicle camera.
              
              The video footage, and those from LTA's surveillance cameras, have also been seized for investigation.
              
              The video footage will be considered by Police in conjunction with other avenues of evidence, such as witnesses' accounts, to establish the cause and circumstances of the accident.
              
              The police will also obtain a toxicology report of the driver which could help establish if the driver had been drinking. CHANNEL NEWSASIA

              SINGAPORE - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said he is deeply saddened by the unfortunate loss of lives in the accident involving a Ferrari, a taxi and a motorcycle along Rochor Road on May 12.
              
              In a post on his Facebook page today, Mr Lee also extended condolences to the victims and their families.
              
              He said he agreed with Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee's Facebook post on Wednesday.
              
              Mr Teo had said on his Facebook page that he has directed the Traffic Police to be tougher with motorists who speed or drive recklessly.
              
              Mr Teo had also cautioned against blaming all foreigners.
              
              He noted that it was good that many Singaporeans and foreigners expressed sadness and gave support to the families, in a common bond of humanity.
              
              In the accident on May 12, the driver of the Ferrari, Mr Ma Chi, died at the scene.
              
              A passenger in the taxi, Ms Shigemi Ito, died in hospital shortly after the crash.
              
              ComfortDelGro taxi driver, Mr Cheng Teck Hock, succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead on May 13. CHANNEL NEWSASIA
              
              -----------------
              
              Serious leh, so many days and three people had died and now then talk in the press. But I think TP will still continue catching the small flies, maybe hire the pest controller here to do the job better. I don't remember seeing TP catching sriving of speedy monster machine drivers in recent times. Only lorries more, maybe easier for Yamaha and Subaru.

              <p>I told you my version , i personally passed by Victoria Street , and now i elaborate how the traffic light's timing work .</p>
              <p>Say if i am at Grand Pacific Hotel , towards Middle Road , after passing Middle Road , the lights at the bus stop will suddenly turned amber after Illuma , so the case was , Ma accelerated thinking that was the traffic lights at Rochor Road junction !</p>
              <p>It was just too near .</p>
              <p>He was trying to beat the amber lights , thinking it was the Rochor Road's junction .</p>
              <p>That China girl said she do not know Ma suddenly accelerated , there must be a reasonÂ .</p>
              <p>Other than to beat the Amber light , i dun see other reasons .</p>

              i dont think there is a foolproof way to prevent accidents from happening.
              
              killing someone on the road is not even a jailable offence.  maybe its time to change the laws.
