              <p>Aiya!!! Is the Driver. Not the vehicle. Be it a Taxi, Pte car, lorry, pick-up, van, eg........i see until sian. As a driver myself, i believe sometimes i also made mistakes without knowing it. If nothing happen's, just live with it. (Err... don't misunderstand that i encourage this type of driving). 3 days ago, i even saw a car move before the traffic light turns green to our favour. I was behind him. Somemore the car is sky blue on the upper body and dark blue on the lower. You guys know what car is it? Too bad i didn't keep the video with it.</p>

              <p>Agreed, in the begining, i already said, by going public on taxi way of driving is not going to help us, it makes us a fool to the public, and who knows, with the license plate and all these, you can get the guy off the job which ultimately his family will suffer.</p>
              <p>Day in, day out we see all kinds of driver, be it born to be or just naive or wanted to play with others, we already learnt to live with it, those who drive anyhow will meet there own fate eventually, then they learn.</p>
              <p>In cyber world, just like facebook or youtube, peoples had lost their job for commenting and giving critics, I hope TS be more mature to understand that, we already disapprove other from making police report on TD on matter that can get him sacked, and now we TDs ourselves are showing bad about ourselves in the public, it is what people said, diggin your own grave.</p>
              <p>What is car cam for?? taking video of our poor cabbies way of driving or for accident proof purpose?? If the bus driver who drive new buses with cam wanted to show their video to their company and public on TDs cutting bus lanes and blocking their way here and there, many TDs will be in deep trouble, but they know that it is kind jali makan (earning a living in the society) way of TDs. The most they will just horn and let go, and we just wave to apologise.</p>

              <p>Just look at how this Comfort Mercedes cut into my lane when
              very near to Traffic light . I of course will stop when approaching
              the Red lights .</p>
              <p>He cut in without signalling , and stop .</p>
