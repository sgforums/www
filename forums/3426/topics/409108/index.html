              <p>Been driving the 1.8 Wish for a month plus, so far no complain. Nice to drive, very comfortable. But only issue is the topping up of gas. I dun usually drive until the gas is empty then go top up as I dun like the idea of running on petrol to pick up fares. Not economical viable. So my style is whenever I near to a CNG pump I will just go in and top up. Then whenever I drive around 150km mileage and my gas left 2 bar I will start to stress up. When picking passenger always hope they can go west or north. If go east side then sianz liao. Have to empty cab to top up gas. What make it worst is the pump nearest to my house, Serangoon North, always chut pattern. Everytime run out of gas. And best is yesterday I went there at 3pm put a sign GAS SOLD OUT PUMP CLOSE. KNN what time only dun want to do business. They are the most expensive pump and worst service, Jurong island one ah neh very attitude. Stand there waiting for me to open the bonnet for him. As for receipt also he ba bodoh. KNN cheap also not like that do business one right. After the PUMP CLOSE @ 3pm incident really piss me off. Really spoil my day. Then after considering the running cost and opportunity cost wasted to go pump gas 2-3 times daily and the stress it is giving me. I went down to CDG and queue for a less then a year Sonata.</p>
              <p>Fellow lao jiao drivers can share with me how you manage? What are you driving pattern? Do you use petrol to run when gas is empty? Like that still cost efficient? Please advice....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p><br>Yes it's quite common to use petrol to run our business when CNG is empty .</p>
              <p>CNG per litre $1.04 , petrol per litre $1.30 max $1.40 , fuck la . I dun calculate so much , as long i take home got money , petrol no big deal .</p>
              <p>How much can i run on petrol &gt; 100km ?</p>
              <p>100km only cost me maximum $16 , but to me , i dunno about you , i got the skills to earn more than phui $50 with 100km , very phui amount liao .</p>
              <p>As long as meter is running when CNG is empty , and on petrol , u will not lose too much .</p>
              <p>Unless your calculator big one , calculation very precise , every minimum detail also count in , then very difficult to drive CNG cabs .</p>

              <p>That was the $716 reason i went into hirer , Uncle Poolman me , anytime can make it at Comfort , i want it or not only .</p>

              <p>I had been in CDG 7 years , sick about their calls .</p>
              <p>Pay them Top Dollar , treated like a football . And need to pay them levy somemore , phui .</p>
              <p>Pay levy for good trip nevermind , pay levy for donkey trips to Woodlands , phui .</p>
              <p>The day i left CDG , was the days when they slashed the booking from already low $3.50 , to even lower $2.50 , and need to pay $0.40 levy for getting kick like a football .</p>

              <p>If Hammer is contract for 6 months , bear with it , dun part with hard earn money , trust your capability and visions .</p>
              <p>For a learning curve , this CNG is a good tool , cos it pay you an assurance at end month .</p>
              <p>If u cannot make it at TransCab , what makes u think u can make it at Sonata ?</p>
              <p>Make it for 6 months , not 1 month , then u see where u stand .</p>
              <p>Now almost year end , busy time , take this Wish as a learning tool , then 6 months , next year February , after CNY , when u are a better driver , then u switch .</p>
              <p>Why switch at that time ?</p>
              <p>Cos u are a better and more experience driver by February .</p>
              <p>Stop thinking u are good and can make it anywhere .</p>

              <p>CDG is good , for people like TCL , FT , Sonata83 , myself , ALN . Accidentally all reliefs , nevermind .</p>
              <p>Cos their calls so many , from HDB to Condo , to Office , to Industrial . And we are fitted for that sort of bookings , Hammer to do like one of us ? 3 years maybe , not 1 month .</p>
              <p>If u are going to do what u did with a Wish on a Sonata , i will be very worried for you .</p>
              <p>Cos u are not using for something u paid for , that's what i thought .</p>
              <p>Given my experience , Sonata anytime can earn that $105 . Still i opt to say no , cos i scare i fallen sick . Same to TCL .</p>
              <p>And mind you , we are all warrirors ! And we actually say no to OMO sonata .</p>
              <p>Sonata not for someone like Hammer , got a day job and need to OMO for rental on somedays , and work fullday on off day .</p>
              <p>To work like that for just on the convenience of diesels , don't sounds logic to me .</p>
              <p>Go and try on a Sonata , 1 year contract , and tell us what happen for the 1st month on Sonata .</p>

              <p>omo with a sonata? i think u better think twice. $105 with only $300 + every 4 mths + 1 day free rental. it is fucking siong.</p>
              <p>CDG cabs are not meant to omo.. u can omo now but sooner or later u will kio tolong coz the rental is juz too expensive.</p>
              <p>for this . heed poolman's advice. polish your interview skills rather than having to pay more for everything</p>

              <p>Hello uncle Poolman. Thank you for your time to give me an inspiring lecture. By the way petrol can get $1.30 a litre? Can advise? So far I really want to boycott the stupid Serangoon Pump. Really CMI.</p>
              <p>Ya I will try and persist on for another few months. Will be quitting my job end of the year until I get my AWS. Want to learn more skills and switch to full time OMO. So far my earnings to date from 1st of the month to 25th is about $1800++(Exclude rebate), I been driving from 7am-12noon 4pm-4am during my off days and 8am-12noon 4pm-7pm on my working days. So I think be a TD can make a decent living. After I quit my job will be driving lesser hours because wife a bit unhappy cos sometimes din see me for days.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Yes after considering uncle Poolman's advise I think I just have to persevere with my CNG fire engine. I drive relief for CDG for a short stint. Less then a month in fact, Already got experience cancelled call and no show. So call is actually not a pull factor for me. At least for transcab sometimes out of the blue can get a call. Bonus for me. If not in the mood or earn enough liao can reject no fear for suspension. LOL</p>
              <p>The incentive $665 is really a booster. Effective it shave off 6 days rental for me in a month. Dun have the dough to qualify for the $715 yet. Hopefully by next month can earn enough to do full payment 1 shot.</p>
              <p>So will be trying harder to push myself. By the way how do we interview customer? Everytime I do that feel a bit pai seh. Have to be think skin ya?</p>
