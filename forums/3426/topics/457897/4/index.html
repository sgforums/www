              <p>Of course the newer cabbies would prefer a GPS or smart phone to guide them, but then, guide being guide, one of these day, you should be able to drive without them, it is like having milk bottle and teddy bear when you are new to this world, then as time goes by, you should start to off loan all these stuffs and be independent.</p>
              <p>The case should end up with no GPS or smartphone, you cannot drive, that will be no good at all.</p>
              <p>Taxis driving is a labour intensive job, it is not going to be some stockbroking or banking firm whereby software can take over human labour, same goes to construction and shipyard jobs, it is labour intensive, you cannot go on with no labour, unlike some electronic firm, it can use robotics.</p>
              <p>Being labour intensive, we need to be independent, of course, technology today do helps us in a way of locating the exact places and traffic conditions. But as time goes by, by the rule of thumb, you should be able to drive without all this gadgets, it is like releasing all your dependents and set free.</p>
              <p>Allow me to show you a news on the new labourless industrial that will take future world without labour, and china, being the factory workers of the world, will suffer if the west start it, and in fact, it had started, so brothers, let be up to date and open your eyes the true of Business without border and workers.</p>

This year, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made the case for a rapid transformation. “The pace and scale of this encroachment into human skills is relatively recent and has profound economic implications,” they wrote in their book,<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span></span><span lang="EN-SG"><a title="Book Web site" href="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/"><span style="font-size: 14.5pt; color: #666699;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Race Against the Machine.”</span></span></a></span></span></p>

The analogy is not only to the industrialization of agriculture but also to the electrification of manufacturing in the past century, Mr. McAfee argues.</span></span></p>

And people are pretty good at figuring out, how do I wiggle the radiator in or slip the hose on? And these things are still hard for robots to do.”</span></span></p>

              <p>driving already so dangerous , but it make it even more

              i have to disagree with you
              
              There are many advantages driving with GPS if it is used smartly
              
              It will pin point to you the exact location and you do not need to waste time searching for it. Sometimes while searching for a location while driving without a GPS could be more dangerous, change your mind about turning right and then suddenly you make a left turn...
              
              Knowing the exact location creates shorter customer turnaround time and that will create more trips per session.
              
              GPS will direct you the right way to a one way street so that you do not need to waste your time and customer $$$ . For example mosque street... a disatrous journey if you turn into New Bridge road instead of North Bridge road...
              
              Of course GPS will lead you to the exact location but you do not need to follow the exact route that it leads you. You can go via your own route and it will re-direct once you are nearer to your location.
              
              Out of my 26 trips a session, i may use 3 to 4 times. it is indeed a useful device for Taxi Drivers and I urge all drivers to have a GPS on board the taxi.
              
              If you visit Taipei, most of the taxis have a GPS on board...
              
              My 5 cents worth of contribution...

              Another example...
              
              I was CCK Ave 1 last sunday and a philippino couple boarded my taxi.
              
              They wanted to go to church of dunno wat Mary at Bukit Batok.
              
              I asked if they knew the way cause I told them I dunno.
              
              The right way to do is to take out my street directory and search ....knn waste time right.
              
              So I just key in church into my GPS.... bingo st mary pop up
              
              I press GO , reached and collected my fare.
              
              Save time , save hassle 
              
              Even if customer knows the way, it is a hassle for them to direct you all the way.
              
              Imagine you yourself sitting behind enjoying a taxi ride, do you want to direct the taxi all the way. What you want is just to relax and let the driver drives you to the destination...

              Of course you do not need GPS if you know that hill top church .
              
              It also depends where you are at that moment the pax board your taxi
              
              You may be familiar with bukit batok but may need some guidance to get out of the place where you are situated.
              
              GPS comes into play 
              
              Once you are nearer to bukit batok, your brain will take over
              
              no hassle

              <p>If you do not have GPS and you do not know the place how! Tell pax to take another taxi? If passenger complains,Taxi company will ask driver why never use Street Directory. lol. GPS is an electronic street Directory. But even Taxi Company still run by Old School methods.</p>
              <p>Just imagine pax tell you to go to a place and you refer to Street Dirtectory. While driving you make a wrong turn and continue driving until you or the pax realises this. How? Find a near spot to park safely and refer to the map again. If possible, stop at bus stop and wait for the next bus then ask bus driver for directions.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Street Directory is the Old School. GPS is the New School. Does not mean those who use GPS are idiots. Just like Old School use street Directory and learn slowly, GPS users will also learn slowly.</p>

              <p>New drivers are New Drivers. They must learn the routes. GPS or Street Directory. Old School, New School is no different. Difference is just in the technology.</p>
              <p>But this forum full of Old School Hardcore people. They hate GPS. They love Street Directory.</p>
              <p>Must get Traffic Police to make sure they always carry the latest Street Directory with them ALWAYS!!</p>
