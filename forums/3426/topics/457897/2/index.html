              <p>There is this group of peoples who in a wider aspect, do not believe the existence of deities and gods, and thereby, chose to believe in themselves. And there are also people who chose to believe in facts, reality and proven events like formula and proven sciences. This are term as free thinkers, and there are also people who just believe in one god, this is call theism, if I am not wrong.</p>
              <p>Therefore, when you said you are a free thinker, we taxi brothers of course can accept it, but to any other laymen on the street, they can confuse of you saying praying to yourself, a free thinker do not pray, they only respect, but if there is facts and proven to be true, they will accept it and respect it even more.</p>
              <p>Just like buddhism cause and effect, your action create an effect, you drive anyhow, you get accident, you park anyhow, you get summons, you chiong too much, you get tire and unhealthy. It is proven, even you sex too much, you get weaker, both physical and mental. Being realistic in a sense, teaching like buddhism is therefore consider a free thinker expression.</p>

              <p>GPS can both sabotage and aid TD in many ways.<br><br>If you're free, feel free to take buses and wander around, especially landmarks around the CBD area. Sooner or later, you'll get used to it.</p>

              <p>sometimes GPS does help esp taking call booking,just punch in postcode and follow along,u will reach ur destination even if it ask u to go in carpark,just follow!but sometimes GPS go to backdoor!and don't use flyover!</p>

              <p>Read this thread a few days back, have to say it brings back a lot of memories.</p>
              <p>I was a Mickey Mouse driver when i first started out. Although, i did feel i kind of knew most major roads and E-ways during that time, i wouldn't "die of a horrible death". </p>
              <p>Of course, i did spend a considerable amount of effort to read through "right leg" and "left leg" posts.</p>
              <p>So i started, without a street directory in the cab (wasn't intentional, my hirer and night relief didn't use it). The only thing i rely upon was the google maps on my iphone(thank god i had no trouble spelling out the street names).</p>
              <p>Then it happened, during the morning peak hours, i dropped someone at the fourth most "ice cream" place for day shift drivers. I didn't have any thoughts on where to go next, just wandered aimlessly.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, there was a pax running after my cab.  As expected, the pax was unfashionably late for work. I knew the fastest way but i didn't know where was the nearest E-way entrance and the exact drop off location was.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pax was really nice and kind to guide me along. Upon arriving at the destination, i fumbled with the NETS payment. The pax told me two words "jia you" before alighting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That was my turning point, from then on, i put in every effort in knowing my routes. Three reasons. One, i can only be new for so long, not forever. Two, if "right leg" and "left leg" can do it, why can't i. Three, i don't want to disappoint another pax.</p>
              <p>Someone has posted a lot of threads and posts, which to be honest, i do not agree with most and i find it to be crap for the rest. But i for once do agree with his this post (statement).</p>
              <p>What i can only say is the phrase "i don't know" does more harm than good to oneself in the long term. Then again, i am a nobody and if the others in the trade who still carry on with this phrase in their minds whenever they start their engines everyday, so be it.</p>
              <p>Although i drive a normalsine, there are 2 types of grease i carry and use occasionally. Light duty for locals. Heavy duty for non locals. People who know me well, have heard in real time over the phone when i used the grease. No prizes for guessing who has the louder or only voice in my cab.</p>

              <p>Ask a Primary School student what is 10 x 3. Some will say don't know. Some will say 13. Some will say 30. Ask a Secondary School student the same question and most will say it is common sense. Some still might say 13. But no one will say don't know because it is supposed to be common sense by now. Ask a graduate what is 3047 x 5723 / 21, and all won't know unless they use a calculator.</p>
              <p>Most new TDs' are like primary school kids. Don't know most routes which are common sense to secondary school taxi drivers. All secondary school taxi drivers were once primary school taxi drivers too. Some TDs' act like graduate drivers but I dare say that there is NO such driver who knows every building, road and route in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Primary school taxi drivers must learn the routes. How they learn and how long they take to learn depends on their capabilities and tools at hand. But to be riducled by secondary school taxi drivers saying it is common sense is just too much.</p>
