              <p>TD is a job that after 30 years, still a TD, it is more or less
              a stagnation job, so it is sometime know as no motivation job,
              even security guard can promote to supervisor guard, by TD can only
              self promote himself, from sweeping to on call to limo and so on,
              but still driving, still hold the steering wheel, still hv to step
              the pedal, still hv to look out here and there, still hv to face
              all kinds of paxs, still at the mercy of Taxis companies and
              finally, still hv to pay yr rental promptly.</p>
              <p>Even if you work as a storeman, by 20years, you could at least
              be a foreman or senior supervisor or even manager thru company
              upgrading courses, sit in office just order here and there, only
              sometime work abit driving forklift or taking stock.</p>
