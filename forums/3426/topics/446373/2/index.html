              <p>Someone must be in charge of the taxi fare. Cabbies cannot be decision maker. This point no need to argue one. Otherwise for over charging cases, who do the pax look for? If LTA wash hand, there will be worse problems. </p>

              <p>As I mention earlier, taxi COE can be as expensive as the government wants it to be. No need to lose money. But also no need to be so high that cabbies cannot earn a living. The current scenario results in Cumfark getting 100% of the blame for rental increases that cabbies have no choice but to swallow.</p>
              <p>With a taxi COE, it is the cabbies who bid up the price. Cumfark and LTA wash hands. Cabbies bid too high, end up screwing themselves. When cabbies bid, they have to remember the taxi fare was pre-determined by LTA already, so there is a ceiling to the taxi COE, beyond which road sweeping techniques will not provide the desired income.</p>

              <p>I thought about this for many months liao. By leasing out the MDT, but mandating the cabby service his vehicle at CDG approved workshops saves CDG alot of problems. LTA can also mandate cabbies to purchase their own taxi from CDG, or allow cabbies to continue renting an old cab.</p>
              <p>With this change, cabbies will have more incentive to drive carefully and not miss periodic maintenance. Currently many epica and sonata cabbies whack their cabs because it does not belong to them. With this change, the cabby will think twice before driving like an idiot.</p>
              <p>Profit margins can still be maintained or improved. It is all about revising their taxi business model.</p>

              <p>Imagine CDG is allowed to lease their MDT, payment terminal, sell us a brand new LTA approved cab model, sell us a special low priced cabby insurance, sell us a taxi maintainance package after the free first 3 yrs warranty.</p>
              <p>Jiak buay liao lah. I think and think, its the best way to change Singapore's taxi business without harming GLC's profit margin.</p>
              <p>Cabbies who do break the regulations will have the MDT confiscated or disabled remotely. The taxi becomes a normal car, and CDG dun have to find a new driver or spare parking lot or engage a tow truck.</p>

              <p>Brother, ownership in singapore is only for the rich, even a 99 lease condo or HDB is consider as leasor not owner, with this, the govt can manipulate enblock and all other reason to shift your house like the case of rochor road, to put it more precise, the govt wants control.</p>
              <p>Same goes transportation, Govt want a control over taxis, you keep talking about MDT, without a MDT, people still can drive, still got private radio calls and other gadget like smartphone calls which can go GPS, and even cards acceptability can be set up with any banks, they will take it graceful, it is a business to them, just swipe, a dollar plus goes into their coffer.</p>
              <p>I bet you that if Taxi is to go back to ownership, people may not want a silly MDT, instead put a latest galaxy better, tio bo, brother pool. When it come to ownership is a freedom of association, in another words, I am the real boss now. Even if I take it as a private car, so be it, then if all take it as private car, what will happen on the road? no cabbies? Privately, cabby can go into private business, drive for corporate or regulars only, why not, if I stay near Jurong, I can get many customers, print more namecards, just get Jurong island Esso only, jiak buay liao.</p>
              <p>Control is the key here, the govt wants control, and to control, they cannot allow ownership and freedom of association. And if you look at it probably, they also make sure that not only they can make profit, they must ensure that you are alway hungry, so that you work, your drive and you serve. Then by spreading out the surcharges and peak period, they can shift your driving pattern, your livinghood, and your destiny.</p>

              <p>Leasing out mdt, if just the hardware and software, could make CDG some money. No harm done for CDG drivers, I feel.</p>
              <p>If not, who gets the call charges? Can't be red TDs paying CDG right? Also, competitor how to share call centre?</p>

              <p>No I think we are missing the point.</p>
              <p>LTA has already stated some months back that they will not consider another operator unless that company will have a huge fleet. Even then, they are unlikely to approve because there are presently enough operators so in essence there should be enough competition.</p>
              <p>I think what they will be looking at competition. Now more or less CDG sets the tone and everyone follows. They are instead likely to come out with a system that forces companies to be more competitve and ensure enough cabs are on the road.</p>
              <p>And like any government agency, that almost certainly involves penalties and fines. They go after the companies and force the companies to go after us.</p>
              <p>Of course companies cant fine us, so they instead will offer discounts, if the taxi is on the road at certain times when demand is high, there must be some incentives for doing so.</p>
              <p>But before we start saying hurrah, companies will likely raise rental first and then offer the discount.</p>
              <p>And LTA will will surely go on the warpath, with a lot more enforcement to ensure compliance.</p>
              <p>In end we will all grumble and complain, yet be forced to accept the changes. Don't forger that as far as LTA are concerned we are at the bottom of the totem pole.</p>

              <p>Nobody mentioned anything about having a new taxi operator. I was proposing a revision to the way taxi business gets run in Singapore. All the details have been laid out above.</p>
