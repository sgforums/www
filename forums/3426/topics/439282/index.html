              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SINGAPORE</span>: Traffic police will use unmarked patrol cars in addition to their normal fleet of marked cars to conduct enforcement patrols.<br><br>Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Home Affairs &amp; Trade and Industry, S Iswaran, announced this at the launch of the 5th Bukit Batok Driving Centre Ride Safe 2012 campaign on Saturday. <br><br>Mr Iswaran said: "Road safety is every motorist's personal responsibility. It underscores our commitment to safeguard the well being of not just ourselves and our families, but also that of other road users and their families.<br><br>"Hence, we expect motorists to adhere to traffic rules at all times, and to exercise due consideration for other road users, especially the vulnerable users like motorcyclists, pedal cyclists and pedestrians."<br><br>Traffic police officers in the unmarked cars may either stop the offending motorists to issue them a summons or make a record of the offence and send them a summon later.<br><br>Traffic Police will also form a dedicated patrol team that will focus on motorcyclists.<br><br>These patrol officers will interact with motorcyclists on the roads to convey road safety advice. If necessary, they will also take enforcement action to correct dangerous riding behaviour.<br><br>According to traffic police, the number of fatal accidents has gone up to 193 last year, from 183 in 2009.<br><br>Eighty nine were those of motorcyclists last year, while the number was 54 in the first six months of this year.<br><br>Senior staff sergeant Neo Chin Loong said: "Traffic police will continue with our education efforts and also with our enforcement efforts.<br><br>"We will be clamping down on drivers and riders who are having irresponsible and bad driving behaviours. This is so that we can make the roads safer for everyone."<br><br>The last time time Traffic Police used unmarked patrol cars was in 2004.<br><br>Volunteer motorcyclists will be going around the island to distribute road safety pamphlets to motorcyclists.</span></span></p>

              <p>For once, I urge the TP to look into cyclist, not alway on motorist, if you go down jurong or many other industrial estate and dormintory, These Foreign cyclist do not know the rules of the traffic, yet do not have any light on them at nite and also cross the traffic light at a fast speed.</p>
              <p>I believe that the laws was passed to summon cyclist who do not have lights on them during nite, but, no enforcement was there, not being racist here, those indians and bangalas somehow like to wear black, take back bicycle with no light.

TPs was there, 2 motorcycles and one BMW. Both when into inspection immediately, I was asked to wait awhile, so bought packet coffee and watch from far with many others. Immediatey, the cars was stripped, photographed, all parts recorded into laptop, and both the drivers was arrested with rolex on.</p>

              <p>Their action is due to public complain.Many pple complain
              nowadays there are no TP in sight on the road except hiding on OHB
              taking photo.I think they also "keng kah liao" &amp; wayang with
              this action.If pple complain next that there no TP on the road,they
              will said not true;we have our unmarked patrol car.But how we
              normal folks know?</p>

              <p>me also agree that unmarked TP vehicles are dangerous.  I also think TP should pay more attention to LGV, lorries and cars travelling on lane 2 at 60~70km/h speed in our expressways, those buggers' action really cause the chain effect to those behind them.  If wanna go slow, drive on the most left lane.</p>

              <p>Yes, those road hogger had been neglected so far, they are endangering other road user too. </p>
              <p>Speeder can only irritate you for a second, but hogger can irritate you for minutessssss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who like to complain to LTA and hopping for a better change, please do think again.</p>
              <p>When there is a brilliant man who manage to solve all traffic issue, congestion, accident rate, speeding etc,  what will happen to their revenue on COE, ERP, Fines etc. This brillant man will soon out of job, and properly become Taxi Driver.</p>
