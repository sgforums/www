              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Nice to meet you all. I am a local Singaporean Android developer and I have just released my new Singapore Cab Pro app onto Google Play. You can search "Singapore Cab Pro" on Google Play for my app.</p>
              <p>This app will help you with booking (both SMS and by phone numbers) and it also comes with a taximeter which is guaranteed to be accurate within 1 dollar compared to the actual one on the taxi.</p>
              <p>I hope you can get the chance to try out this app and let me know what you guys think about it. I also hope that this app is also helpful to all the taxi uncles out there to use a backup taximeter in case the one on the taxi fails.</p>
              <p>Please and please: I am not really try to spam or anything. This is more like
              an announcement. I hope I didn't break any rules here. If I do, I hope you guys
              can let me know before locking or moving my thread and I will comply
              accordingly. Thanks.</p>

              Not very practical for taxi drivers who are most of the time otr. MDT and talkies are more useful. Why? We can't utilise our hands while we are on the road driving. I mean road traffic act ban us using handphone. I will not risk my driving licence for smartphone apps.
              It will be good if the apps can link into the booking systems of all taxi companies here. Cheers for your development.

              <p>Thank you for all your replies, criticisms and feedbacks. I appreciate them all. The point of this app is mainly to break down the surcharges for taxi users. Taximeter is mainly a side function. I know there are quite a lot of taxi users (even local Singaporeans) get confused by the surcharge system in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This app will show you what kind of surcharges that will incur during your trip. It uses both GPS and AGPS as a backup in case the taxi goes through a tunnel or through area where there is no GPS signal.</p>
              <p>I really didn't mean any disrespect, it's simply a taximeter and I tried to utilize all the location capability on the phone to make one since I haven't seen any Singaporean developers made one yet so I thought that it would be a good idea to make one.</p>
              <p>This app also has SMS booking and phone book of all the taxi companies so it's not purely about taximeter.</p>
              <p>Once again, I am a young and inexperienced local developer, I really just wanted to contribute to the local community by making an app that I thought everyone can use. I really didn't mean anything else. I hope I didn't offend anyone with this app :(.</p>

              <p>Actually, please and please, before you make any harsh comments, please at least try out the app.</p>
              <p>This app can calculate waiting charge very accurately. I have carefully studied the surcharge system when making this app. Also at my current job, I have to travel by taxi quite often so I got the chances to thoroughly test out the app. The waiting surcharges were extensively tweaked and calibrated so that it won't deviate much from the actual waiting surcharges.</p>
              <p>I don't have access to the API for Comfort Taxi so I can't access their booking database. I am communicating with the taxi companies at the moment to see if I can do so. I promise that I will definitely look into it.</p>
              <p>And finally, please, I am developing this app not for money, this app is offered for free. So please do not be so harsh toward me. I haven't done anything wrong. I only want to support the local community and our beloved Singaporean citizens by developing Android apps that everybody can use and enjoy. I have spent a lot of time on this without asking anything in return so before you made any comments, please at least think about my position. Somebody helps out the community and does she/he deserve to be bashed and criticized so much ?</p>

              <p><br>When develeoping this app, did you come from the commuters (pax) perspective or the TDs perspective?</p>
              <p>Commuters wants to save booking fee, TD wants to earn booking fee... How are u going to please both?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately a middleperson app must be able to statisfy both side, if not, despite the many taxi apps out there, why is there non which suceed?</p>
              <p>There are many views here in this thread, it will be good if u spend sometime to understand why. It's helps in product development, helps to cater the product more the needs of the stakeholders/customer (TDs, commuters).</p>

              <p>Thanks for your reply. I develop this app from a commuter's perspective since I don't know any taxi uncles personally to ask how he/she feels about the app.</p>
              <p>Regarding booking fee, if you don't like booking fee, the best way is to flag down a taxi and not using the booking function since SMS booking or telephone booking both have a $2.30 charge and it doesn't matter whether you are using my app or not.</p>

              <p>Sorry I don't have LTA seal since this app is meant to be for casual users. I don't earn any money out of its and it's not for commercial purpose so it would make no sense for me to go that far.</p>
              <p>Sorry for all the taxi uncles I have offended. Just want to say that I love and respect you guys very much. I have met a lot of nice taxi uncles as well. That's why when I developed this app, I wanted to make sure that it's as accurate as possible so that the taxi users won't cause you any trouble. Again, this app is mainly for the users to check the applicable surcharges during the ride, the taximeter is a side function. It's not meant to replace the main taximeter on the taxi.</p>

              <p>Without your supply TDs, you will have commuters also no use becoz no TDs. U must have something in order to entice TDs to use this apps.</p>
              <p>Best is to ask them what type of feature would they like to see on this product and whether are you able to achieve it. Tat why, your product will improve with suggestions.</p>

              <p>I find that TS like to say sorry alot of time, to cool him off, nobody is personally attaking you, when you seek feedback, you need to take the knocks of it and truly work on it.</p>
              <p>But I admired your bold action in creating an apps, but not the acceptance of comments from TD here, you do not have to apologise, you did nothing wrong, just tell people that you will think about it, thanks for the feedback and so on.</p>
              <p>With regards to apps, every apps go thru a trial run, no one apps can be successful without some touches here and there to suit the users, and there are many taxis apps on the market, some even go all the way to AP and give us Taxis Uncle pamplets, kind of like matching paxs and TD, but no call charges, end up all thrown into the bin beside the toilet.</p>
              <p>As poster Acid said, you need to have a marco perspectives of the whole taxis industrial players, from taxis companies, to drivers, to paxs, to the systems etc inorder to fully appreciate it and thereby create an apps that satisfy all, then once it popular, patent it, put a copyright on it, and perhap you can start to further create more apps for many other things.</p>

              brother, we members her are all nice guy apart from what you see how we comment here.
              
              since you have good intention , maybe the right way is to consult LTA as the authority are trying to aim to improve the taxi service , with some of your ideas and what lta is looking forwards to have for future, you may be able to come out a near perfect app which is useful for the commuters but of course for we taxi uncles also need to be consult too, do not make it a one way traffic .
              thanks for your effort you have put in but sorry that still need for improvement
