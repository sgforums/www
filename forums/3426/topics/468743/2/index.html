              <p>Must be cheapo short trip that's why dun want to take Maxi. Even black car also dare to take so must be very near. Ya loh sibeh KNN one 2 trolleys also dun want to call Maxi.</p>
              <p>Those tie rubberband one really CMI. Everytime I see I sure take pic complain to LTA, TP, Taxi company. It's really a hazard to the road user too. Imagine there is a motorbike behind and the rubber band break and luggage fly down and hit the bike how? KNN</p>

              <p>for him to rave on non stop, he could v taken another cab n vamoose, his tone was not nice, he was rude and downright arrogant, typical behaviour of expat indians from india any sgreans will encounter in cbd area</p>

              <p>we have a clear mind to judge becos we are not at the scene at that particular moment of time. When the dust has settled, it is always easier to analyse and conclude what should be the rightful way the situation be handled.</p>
              <p>For goodness sake... if u were the TD at that moment of time, u only have 2 choices to choose: <strong>GIVE IN</strong> or.... <strong>DON'T GIVE IN</strong>.</p>
              <p>I whole-heartedly applaud the TD decision at that critical moment of time.</p>
              <p>Taxi Driver is never a glamorous job... but at least many i met are still <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TRUE BLUE SINGAPOREANS</span></strong>. Those foreigners who have been having a good time bullying the locals here.... my advice is: Try ur luck on TD.... u may be in for a BIG surprise.</p>

              <p>If you notice that there was no taxi accept this i30, it show a long wait, he must has had Q'ed for 45minutes or more, then end up getting this kind of pax with these type of fark up luggages, worst then a Flora road trip.</p>
              <p>And then end up with tireness and a bad day on the road, as TD, I also understand his frustration, no doubt, he should be more self compose and reject politely, but then, not many of our Taxi brother have that kind of cooliness after a hard day driving.</p>
              <p>As for airpor warden, they should also advice and recommend paxs with those type of luggages to take Maxi or whatever deem appropriate, 1st world class airport, 4th world taiko wardens??</p>
              <p>I alway like to be a first world class Taxis driver, but with this type of paxs, this type of wardens, this type of AP canteen kopi and foods. I think otherwise, if not I will be in long sleeve and tie liao.</p>

If I'm caught in such an ugly scene, I would had drop luggage n drive off ASAP. Where got time to argue n let pesky film so much footage hahahahha.

              <p>luggages and packages should be put in the boot,not on the passenger seat,this is taxi not van/lorry.what if the seat get torn ,who pay?so if put in the seat is just doing a favour, we can dont need put on the seat if cant fit.they bring so many things over yet want save money then we suffer?then what is the use of maxi-cab?</p>
              <p>Once i meet this type of case,i struggling spend 10 mins to fit in the boot with her luggages the indian lady just stand there watching me,i ask her to fit the small baggage in to the front seat to save time,she fold arms and watch like indian chief.dulan i tell her sorry cant fit she tell me try put this that way i ignore her and i walk to taxi co-ordinator i tell him cannot fit ask her call a maxi-cab or try the chrysler.he insist on trying to fit for her i tell the co-ord u follow me to her destination and unload for her ok and if my seat spoil u pay ah.after that he give me another pax and ask the lady sit the toyota crown lol.this type thing dont need argue with pax just tell the co-ord straight,that is his job to co-ordinate.</p>
