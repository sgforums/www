              i heard this from a fellow td who came over to our side asking for 2nd opinion
              
              he say he was head first into this small carpark, but the carpark both sides lots all taken (except a couple near the entrance/exit behind him), its too narrow for 3pt turn, so he put hazard light, check no cars behind, twist his body back to get better view and slowly reverse.
              
              when he was near the entrance/exit, he notice a suv about to turn into the same carpark, he stopped. then he notice it slowed down for a while, so he thought the suv giving way, so he slowly move backwards somemore. then  the suv suddenly speed up, turn corner into carpark and park bumper to bumper behind him, then horn like crazy.
              
              this td was like huh?? but he cant move, neither can the suv. the suv kept horning, until finally the indian driver got down and angrily gesture to this td to move forward...all the way inside, so that that suv can go in to park already, THEN the td can reverse back out again
              
              the td gesture a few times he was reversing and also point there is some empty lots near the entrance/exit right next to suv, but the suv just ignore and refuse to move. so both cars stop there at the entrance/exit. finally the suv driver reverse back a bit and park head first into one of the empy lots on the side. the td then reverse out fully. but the suv driver shouted out loud "there is law".
              
              as far as the td confirm, there is no collusion and he stay inside his vehicle all the time with windows wind up because hes concerned the suv driver look like hes looking for aggression. 
              
              question, so what is this situation

I will light up my cigerette and take out my newpaper and start reading. I did that to a bitch in a bmw 5 series. Of course there is law, but I have time. So watch me smoke while you find relevant authorities to come determine law decides who give way. There's no rational behaviour to counter assholes. Again there is so many law in Singapore, I wish there was half the common sense amoungst people though. Let it go. There's always going to be another asshole, everyday : )</p></div>

              when we were discusssing the case, all of us, and obviously including some members here, were all scratching our heads what the heck can that suv be thinking to block passage deliberately, but now after hearing rbs words, now we all know! lack of common courtesy is indeed a common problem here in singapore. when we asked each other, everyone i knew said its simple common sense to let the reversing car back out of a cramp carpark where it cannot do 3pt turn, BEFORE heading in. ironically brother rbs urging everyone to be more gracious of about letting the incoming vehicle push everyone further into the choke first then let the exiting vehicle out. not forgetting the car park is already full in the inside according what we were told, so what happen by then? 2 or more vehicles stuck inside after that? personally speaking if it's me, i don't even think pointing out to the suv to park at the available lots next to it is necessary in the first place, why? because its simple logic any driver would have done so at the first instance without being 'guided' by someone else! someone moving out&gt;you park in available lot&gt;way given, but some strange people (some people call these aholes i notice) CHOOSE not to do that. So welcome to the jam party!
                                                                                      
              but then everyone is still entitled to their own point of view and from the td mouth, this matter was thankfully resolved without further incident (i hope) and its officially none of our business anymore. but i think i learn something here about attitude when i meet this kind. if its me meet this thing, i think i will be in an equal difficult position. somebody behind purposely forcing in, cannot move out, so move deeper in and risk everyone gets jam? so how to avoid? next time insist drop the passenger outside the carpark even if it look a little bit cramp is the best? what if many things to unload or handicap? then how? if there is no common courtesy amongs road users, i think this is what happens, havok

              </p><p>What I really meant is, flow of direction. The incident claim that the TD was sitting inside the vehicle throughout the event, what he should do is to at least get down the vehicle, explain nicely to that SUV driver, what's going on inside.</p><p>
              
              </p><p>Especially he is trying to reverse out the vehicle against the flow of traffic. And 1 thing I'm quite puzzle, with those available empty lots, why he can't make good use of that to do a 3 point turn? </p><p>

              good you admit the carpark is cramp.
              
              as for flow of direction, i already said the td is already signaling hes reversing and is already in the act of reversing before the suv got there? still not clear enough?
              
              i think i also did mention its the suv driver sped up, corner in, park bumper to bumper, start horning aggressively, came down gesturing like an aggressive person. that to me, sounds pretty 'aggressive'?
              
              i think i also did mention the only available lots are at the entrance/exit of the carpark, as the td was reversing, the suv came up behind and block him from even accessing those lots, only the suv is able to park into those lots and the suv knows that but it choose not to do it. but which the suv did in the end.
              
              i think theres a lot of readers out there who dont read but able to jump to irrational conclusion by themselves pretty quickly. agreed with you the suv truly deserve the finger

            <div class='col-md body'>my feel is this matter is not even a complex problem, its so simple even a child can solve instantly, the reason its worth mentioning is to highlight to everyone, not every driver out there think rationally or act rationally like an adult, its always better to practise vigilance, common courtesy and a bit of patience and everything will turn out fine eventually. actually this ending here was a fine ending, someone reversing with no space, someone found parking, way given, everyone move on. its just that the process of getting to that fine ending was made rough and unhappy by the SUV and those people alike. thats why so many foreigners mention to me, even have money also dont want to drive on singapore roads, its a playground for idiots. as tds, we have little choice but to roll in the mud day in day out, but if given a better choice, i think most of us would exit the mudpits asap. if anyone enjoy rolling in the mud, no need to argue whats right whats wrong, you have my blessings to continue rolling happily. go ahead knock yourself out</div>

              you sure live up to your words and know how to act innocent. you yourself admit i refer to you only  in 1 of my posts but not in my last post. but yet your last remark was referring to my last post which did not even mention you or your nick, you still havent my question, in what way do you find my last post unncessary, what has it got to do with you you feel?
              
              thanks for bringing up about me making the mistake of referring you as brother at first. after i found out who you really are, what kind of person you are, i would NEVER have refer to you the first place or ever again you havent notice it? if not that you come budging into my thread, posting all the irrelevant things about you and what you feel about your silly nick, i wouldnt have even bother replying you at all. 
              
              but i am glad at least you still have the basic eq to finally get the message, buzz off before you get a nosebleed

            <div class='col-md body'>since 'brother rbs' wont be returning here ever again, to everyone, rbs is the exactly the kind of personality those idiotic drivers carry with them on the road. come gatecrashing a party unwelcomed, roughen up the process, then hit and run with tail between legs when their true identity emerges. sad but real.</div>
