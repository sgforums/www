              <p>hi all , just wanna share with u all something i encounter last night at Raffles Hotel beach road entrance at around 9pm.</p>
              <p>it was because i was being flag in by 1 of your bellboy at around 9pm at the beach road entrance to pick up the guest. i drive in then i bit sian liao cos i see there were around 5-6 luggage ,cos surely need to go up AP but no choice since i already in , i alight to help them placing the luggage into my car boot and my front seat. but after placing all the luggage into my vehicle, there still no sign of passengers for around 5-10mins, then i ask 1 of the sikh bellboy where is the passengers, to my surprise, he say that the passengers is settling the payment inside the hotel. while i am asking him, there are around 5 paxs also waiting for taxi . then i ask why they wanna flag me in and stored the luggage while the guest is still making payment. To my surprise, he actually talk back as in shouting at me , <strong>So u still wanna wait and take them or not</strong>.</p>
              <p>Upon hearing this comment, <strong> i am a taxi driver and time is precious to me, money is important to me but i m not a beggar</strong>, i can easily find other passengers anywhere i like at 9pm, so i straightaway tell them to remove the luggage, i initially wanna take those paxs in queue for taxi since the initial guest have not settled their bill yet but this sikh fellow stop me from picking them up saying that he will not let me pick anymore passengers from there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, for me , i m going to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>boycott</strong></span> this stupid hotel from now onwards... even got booking from my company comfort or lakeview, u will not be hearing 83 bidding for this asshole hotel no matter how much they r offering...</p>
              <p>me very seldom will get angry easily, komade know me for very long liao , u can check with him did he ever saw me get flare up b4...</p>

Stop in front further away from the Q, after pax alighted, if the next pax is local, quickly press <span style="color: #ff0000;">BUSY </span>and let them smell diesel smoke.

              Mr. Seah, let uncle Kenny tell u a story to console U, One of the uncle pk up a pax to
              Jurong taxi green in color(Smart) after midnite , while arrived at the destination, the pax took a card,told the uncle i pay nets, the uncle face turn green fxxx him n sent him back
              to the pk up pt FOC. he is real piss off. so ur 10mins waiting times is worthy to 
              learn for a lesson, at least the Pax still paid.
              
              Never never in doubt that the uncle is me, am not that SMART. Hahaaa.....
              
              
              I heard that story from some uncle in Royal HTL.
