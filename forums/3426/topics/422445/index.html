              <p>This is not a matter of principle. When you kenna accident with pax overload, then you will be cursing yourself for taking the extra $5 or $10, especially when you're at fault in the accident.</p>
              <p>Paxes are always selfish.  Their main aim is to get home.  Anything they can do to get home, they will do and that includes asking you to go against the rule.</p>
              <p>I had an incident... A couple who boarded my cab at Republic Plaza T/S.  The guy didn't look drunk to me but obviously the gal knew that he had drank a lot.  Within 200 m of moving off, the guy started puking.  I was like... "Fuck! Since you know he is drunk, the least you could have done is to ask whether I have any plastic bag in case he puke."  I got so mad that I chased the couple out of my cab claiming that I had to go clean up my cab and handover shift shortly after.  And the fucking girl has the cheek to say that "you could have sent us back before proceeding to clean your cab right?  Else, it would be very difficult for us to get a cab now." </p>
              <p>Yeah! My fucking problem... She don't even have the slightest idea how fucking selfish she was when saying that.  Send them back and in the process let the guy puke more in my cab???  You can't get a cab, you call.  It's not even midnigh yet and yet they want to save the $2.50 call charge???</p>

If paxs  living in those 3 n 2 rooms HDB type want to save money, I don't mind charging them less, but funny how, these peoples honor the meter and sometime, they tends to be more chin chai, sometime give me tip too. It is those in condos, private properties that really got some miser, 50 cents like Michelin tyre,  no wonder they get so rich.</p>
