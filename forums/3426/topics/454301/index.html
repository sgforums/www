              <p>After reading sotong's thread, I wonder how was everyone's virgin taxi drive?</p>
              <p>Let's share.</p>
              <p>Since I start this thread, I will start 1st.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I started off as a relief.</p>
              <p>My virgin taxi drive was on a saturday 5pm.</p>
              <p>Even though I had been driving heavily for the pass 10yrs, still afraid.</p>
              <p>Cos all old birds told me that usually 1st few drive will not earn or earn very little $$.</p>
              <p>The 1st hour, I basically got no customer.</p>
              <p>Maybe too afraid to pick up or too slow.</p>
              <p>After the 1st hr, I finally picked up my 1st customer, an expat lady.</p>
              <p>After her, it was up down for the next 6-7 customers.</p>
              <p>I stopped the drive at about 12am.</p>
              <p>Guess I was lucky, I managed to earn about $60 after cost.</p>

              <p>I remember my first trip (I think 1995 or 1996). Drive my cousin's cab.</p>
              <p>He drove a bit then tired ask me to take over. I was at AMK, pick up 1 Bangali (sorry no offense, Sikh) family. Woman and her kid together with the grandmother. Wanna go Bedok North St 4.  I think got 1 short detour, send the grandmother Hougang or nearby, cannot recall now. But it wasn't out of the way.</p>
              <p>Dunno how I reach Bedok North St 4, the total fare was $27!! And not even midnight. Remember those days flag down was $2.40 I think and jump only 10cts. Lucky these people also dunno how to go there (visiting someone, not staying there, if they did sure kena f).</p>
              <p>I know she was shocked not so much angry but shocked at the amount, LL she pay, and I say thank you very much. After she got down, breathe a huge sigh of relief!</p>
              <p>I remember her exact words when she boarded the cab; Towkay, please send me Bedok North St 4! Hahaha, haven't start driving already people call me Towkay! Nobody until then had ever used that title on me!</p>

              <p>But something sotong said or realised which is true. When you first start to drive then you realise that it isn't easy at all.</p>
              <p>Those days all manual somemore. I said sure easy la, Taxi driving, after all I drive mata chia for 8 hours for how many years, where got difficult? Taxi also same what, drive for 8 hours or so.</p>
              <p>But what I realised later mata chia, 8 hours is actually maybe less than 2 hours driving in total, plus got stop here, stop there, get out, walk here and there, keng here and there. Not even got 1 stretch drive 1 full hour stretch, 30-45 minutes also very very rare.</p>
              <p>But taxi you must drive continously at least for a few hours, until you break for toilet or makan. Where got time to stop here and there and come out smoke cigarette or do stretching. Time is money and the hours to make are limited.</p>
              <p>After that 1st day, go home, back pain like hell, legs feel so wobbly, cannot stand straight. Body feel like you ran a marathon, exhausted but some more worse cannot sleep just yet. Body clock totally messed up.</p>
              <p>So everyone starts like this, sotong and you shouldn't fell discouraged. It's just a phase, after a few months or years, you'll look back at this chapter and laugh or smile at yourself!</p>

              <p>True, very true.</p>
              <p>TD is not like switch a corporate job to another corporate job, it is entirely different, suddenly you find you are no more a monthly or daily paid staff/worker, you are on your own, entirely on your own. You eat snake, that is your problem, you waste time, that is your lost, and you need lots of patience, once you lost your cool, that is it, you will find it harder and harder to carry on.</p>
              <p>Again, I go back to the starting, storming, after storming and spring period.</p>
              <p>Like all jobs and relationship, you start with a big bang, pass yr TDVL, go office, book cab, all very pink and happy, get yourself up and really to do your best, spirit is high, confident is good, most wish you all the best, then after starting,</p>
              <p>The storm arrived, you see grey sky, madness, disorientated, stress and blur until forget your father name or yr own name. At this junction, you will ask yourself, give up or strive on, jialat, you start to compare your former works and TD, the money, the stress, the time involved, then all end up with no decision.</p>
              <p>As days go by, you start to get a grip and pattern of TD, and by 6 months, you should be capable of picking any pax with any destination without much of a problem, then Spring arrived.</p>
              <p>But having said all, if you got better job, dun be a TD.</p>

              <p>The day I collect Taxi, no rental. Rental starts the next day, so I drive around to get used to the car.</p>
              <p>First working day starts around 3pm, drove out from Telok Blangah and head for Harbor Front.</p>
              <p>First Passenger, Indonesian couple going to Indus Road. Being new, I thought Indus Road was on the Left when travelling on Ganges Ave towards City but he keep telling me to keep Right. He wanted to go Emrald Park.</p>
              <p>So on my first trip, I learnt that there is a short stretch of Indus Road on Havelock Road Side.</p>
              <p>I live in Telok Blangah for almost 20 years, and driving continuously since early 80's and yet I Garbra when someone ask me to go from Harbor Front to Indus Road. First Trip.</p>

              <p>I remember my first trip (I think 1995 or 1996). Drive my
              cousin's cab.</p>
              <p>He drove a bit then tired ask me to take over. I was at AMK,
              pick up 1 Bangali (sorry no offense, Sikh) family. Woman and her
              kid together with the grandmother. Wanna go Bedok North St 4. 
              I think got 1 short detour, send the grandmother Hougang or nearby,
              cannot recall now. But it wasn't out of the way.</p>
              <p>Dunno how I reach Bedok North St 4, the total fare was $27!! And
              not even midnight. Remember those days flag down was $2.40 I think
              and jump only 10cts. Lucky these people also dunno how to go there
              (visiting someone, not staying there, if they did sure kena f).</p>
              <p>I know she was shocked not so much angry but shocked at the
              amount, LL she pay, and I say thank you very much. After she got
              down, breathe a huge sigh of relief!</p>
              <p>I remember her exact words when she boarded the cab; Towkay,
              please send me Bedok North St 4! Hahaha, haven't start driving
              already people call me Towkay! Nobody until then had ever used that
