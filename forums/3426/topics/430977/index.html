              <p><strong>Sorry Tale of Local Professors in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A local professor sent this message to me:</span></p>
              <p>Dear Mr. Tan</p>
              <p>For those who are academically inclined, one common dream is to </p>
              <p>become a university professor. For many countries in the world, this is </p>
              <p>a position worth aspiring to as professorship carries prestige and </p>
              <p>comfortable income.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> For Singaporeans who aspire to become </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">professors in Singapore, it is sad to say that based on the happenings </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in a local university over the last few years, they found it a nightmare.</span></strong></p>
              <p>In this university, many Singaporean professors have been fired when </p>
              <p>they reach the age of around 55 (much lower than the national </p>
              <p>retirement age). Many of these professors have contributed to the </p>
              <p>development of the university for more than 20 years. And to add </p>
              <p>insult to injury, many of the university management who decided to </p>
              <p>fire them are actually foreigners.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the university recruit new professors, many of them are also </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">foreigners and some of them are in their 60s or even late 60s. As the </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">university is heavily subsidised with Singapore money, is it not more </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">logical to hire Singaporeans so that the money is invested back to </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans? Instead, the money is now used by foreigners for their </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">career advancement or retirement outside Singapore.</span></strong></p>
              <p>This situation is particularly sad as Singaporeans have worked very </p>
              <p>hard to accumulate this wealth. So why let foreigners enjoy the fruits </p>
              <p>of Singaporean labour? And to add to the irony, many of the </p>
              <p>Singaporean ex-professors do not have enough savings for their </p>
              <p>retirement. They have to make a career switch at the age of 55 – is this </p>
              <p>not a nightmare?  Even though this situation has been going for quite </p>
              <p>some time, it is not a lost cause. The Singapore government can </p>
              <p>reverse the situation to demonstrate that they truly place </p>
              <p>Singaporeans first.</p>
              <p>Local professor</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><strong>I carried out a survey. </strong>19 people responded. 63% strongly agree, 16% </p>
              <p>agree and 21% disagree with the views written by the local professor.</p>
              <p>Here are their comments</p>
              <p>Strongly agree</p>
              <p>** <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The government has allowed just too many foreign "talents" into </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore. Most of them are not better than Singaporeans. It is OK to </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">have some foreigners but it is absurd when a local is out numbered by </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">foreigners at the workplace.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">** I am a local with a US PhD in biology. I found it next to impossible to </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">get any academic position locally.</span></strong> My field of research is very </p>
              <p>specialised but the few positions that do exist here are all given to </p>
              <p>foreigners. Local life science research bodies prefer big name </p>
              <p>foreigners because all they want is to boost their rankings. Just look up </p>
              <p>any local biotech research institute or university here and you will find </p>
              <p>that foreigners dominate most of the PI positions. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Although most local </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">research is funded by Singapore, it is mostly controlled by foreigners. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Why did I return to Singapore? Singapore makes it mandatory for </p>
              <p>locals who do their postdocs in the US to return here for two years </p>
              <p>even though you were not funded by Singapore. Meanwhile, I am still </p>
              <p>looking for a job... any job.</p>
              <p>** <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wow, welcome to the "Real world" professors! I thought it only </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">happens to private commercial sectors, like me for example. But </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">having said that, if I were to use the government credo..upgrade, retrain, re-skill!! The only "untouchable" sectors right now is the million </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">dollar PAP rice bowls.. We all have to compete with the foreign </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">talents, but our PAP can't or won't even play on a same level field with </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">local opponents!! That is SIN city for you! Didn't you teach that in class </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">to your students? Eat or you will be Eaten !** I know this to be true.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>** I have seen this happening not only in universities but other science </p>
              <p>organizations run by the govt. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Why do out agencies hire foreigners in </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">science jobs (especially WHALES who earn very huge salaries)? </span></span></strong>These </p>
              <p>Whales do not do anything for Singapore. In fact they have been </p>
              <p>repeatedly seen running down our system in international meetings </p>
              <p>abroad. They openly say that they are here for vacation and for </p>
              <p>money. Most of them continue to keep other positions open in </p>
              <p>universities abroad. Why??? Locals suffer, take the most small pay but </p>
              <p>do the most difficult task and still publish the best papers that the</p>
              <p>international community recognizes Singapore for. Please reverse this </p>
              <p>trend. Locals are good enough to take Singapore science to new </p>
              <p>heights.</p>
              <p>** Open your big eye and ear. I studied at a local poly part time more </p>
              <p>than 60% are foreign trash, why are they here if not talent? </p>
              <p>** The long term academic future of Singapore depends on bright </p>
              <p>young Singaporeans seeing a career as an academic rather than being </p>
              <p>replaced by young people from the region and older people from </p>
              <p>further away</p>
              <p>** I am not in the least bit surprised by this as this is also happening in </p>
              <p>the private sector. Our government made a strategic error by trusting </p>
              <p>these foreigners who are happily firing Singaporeans and replacing </p>
              <p>them with people from their own countries. Singaporeans are slowly </p>
              <p>but surely being replaced at all levels except the highest level of </p>
              <p>government ministers. I hope our government realises this sooner </p>
              <p>rather later before it reaches crisis point where our government will </p>
              <p>collapse and a foreign party assumes control.</p>
              <p>Disagree</p>
              <p>** Depends on the rationale and competence of the professors being </p>
              <p>redundant.</p>
              <p>** Any professor who spends 20 years in a local university, without </p>
              <p>overseas sabbatical should probably be fired.</p>
              <p>** Once you get tenure the university needs full board approval to fire </p>
              <p>you, unless you screw it up really bad. And if the professors have no </p>
              <p>savings they have not been spending their 5 digit salaries very wisely </p>
              <p>yah?</p>

              <p>back in the 60s, 70s - bus drivers and truck drivers were prestigious job but what happen? cannot compete with foreigners from 3rd world country who come here to vie for it. Blame it on our Gov Systems.</p>
              <p>Also high rise crane operator, excavators operator etc.....those are one of so called skilled job in 10 to 20 years back...what happen now?</p>
              <p>Can we trust this current "Garment Operators"?  Shouldn't they be replace and also be displace by Hammer and Rocket?</p>
              <p>Taxi Drivers are also vulnerable but we hope not to see this to happen.</p>
              <p>Taxi Drivers in Japan - purely japanese, in H.K, in Taiwan, in Korea, in China, in Indonesia, Malaysia, philippines, vietnam are purely own citizens.</p>
              <p>There's once a foreigner in neighbouring countries (not once but i encounter these question a few times already by different nationalities) asked me one delicate question:</p>
              <p>Can a foreigner or permanent resident drive a taxi to make a living in Singapore? I said currently no and cannot but i throw them back the same question. Can i drive a taxi in your country?  They are stucked and understand why they couldn't let this happen in their country and knew why i say no to it.</p>
              <p>If this issue is "Screw Up", i am sure they will have to regret and repent for the next terms as we are "Daft Taxi Uncle".</p>

              <p>Maybe yes maybe no ... now Mah Bow Tan bowed out , his project "World Class Transport" into the air .</p>

              <p>Another : Why was the caused of those issues PAP finally woke up ?</p>
              <p>Yes ... cost of living , public transport and foreigners .</p>
              <p>Now at least for the next 5 years , unless PAP want to lose power , within the next 5 years , we will see a slow down in foreign intake .</p>
              <p>Taxi driving will be the last .</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>

              <p>No leh , still need to Q for brand new Sonata .</p>
              <p>There will be a possibility , if taxi companies stuck with 100 or 1000 of taxis behind the yard , then this could be a possibility .</p>
              <p>Now they relax relax waiting for money to giro into their bank , why need to worry ?</p>

              <p>If taxis companies really wanted to force the issue of getting foreign workers to drive taxi, they can alway do it, just by making singaporeans driver difficult in fuel and rental, ending up most throw keys and long line of taxis waiting for hire, then they can hv an excuse for employing Foreign TD. But due to the ethical side of it, as most are Govt linked, they utlmately hv to pull the hand brake. And also Luckily, opposition won a GRC, its somehow, in a way, make these Taxis companies to pull the handbrake harder, we actually, indirectly got some help from opposition wining influence, tho they never help us directly, their influence had ultimately affect Taxis companies decision in flavour of us. And I hope that will last.</p>
