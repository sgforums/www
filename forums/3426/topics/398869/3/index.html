              <p>If Honda Stream comes out and it is not diesel engine, dun take it.</p>
              <p>My reason as follow :</p>
              <p>- 7 seaters are big vehicles. They eat fuel like monster. Those who drive SMRT Azera CNG Taxi before should know.</p>
              <p>- It is not worth it even honda stream fit with CNG to save fuel. The main reason why u wan to drive a 7 seaters is so that u can fetch many pax who most of the time has tons of luggages. Can u imagine urself that u are in the situation that u are able to ferry the customers but not the luggages? It is both embarassing and u will be force to give up the job to Ssanyeong and Maxis cab.</p>
              <p>I am a 10months old MPV driver. As such I can confidently said to u dun bother with patrol 7 seaters unless they are Hybrid vehicles.</p>
              <p>However, if u have lots of lobang and doing SATs job wanting to collect 2-3 vouchers at one time, then go ahead. But still I rather drive diesel engine 7 seaters cause no matter how, my cost of maintaining the vehicle is lower.</p>

              <p>But recently I begin to notice a trend of having 4 seaters
              purposely park half a car length behind my cab. Already it is quite
              bad that some pple avoided 7 seaters but then when they do that it
              makes the whole matter worst. Pple will think something wrong with
              this taxi and all go behind.</p>
              <p>And the culprit is usually a comfort cab or older taxi
              drivers.</p>
              <p>Yesterday at Tanglin Mall this happen to me. Never had I
              experience a problem at Tanglin Mall. Even there are pple who
              avoided, it is usually only 1 or 2 pax skip and I would go off in
              no time. Bloody comfort cab purposely park a distance when I go
              forward into the lot like everyone else. kanna skip until my blood
              boil. I so piss off that I simply reverse back and block the entire
              lobby. In the end, less than one min I got a pax and go.</p>
              <p>Crap man, where all the ethics and moral goes to. When I am in a
              queue, even pple come to me i would refer them to the first taxi in
              queue unless I know normal cab cannot take the pax for some
              reasons(eg bulky items or 5 pax and above).</p>
              <p>Now I have to play dirty also, if the 4 seater horn I let them
              be. Damn piss off. usually it wun happen, but now it is getting
              more and more common.</p>
              <p>I wonder has Estima Driver come across this ?</p>
              <p>And today at Woodlands MRT Taxi Stand. Long queue of pax no
              taxi. I go in first lot and no one wan to board. Ok nevermind, I
              take out my story book and I read and ignore those stingy faggots.
              5 min or so pass and still no other cab come.</p>
              <p>Finally one guy from behind the queue approach me and ask me why
              i am infront of the taxi. I told him this fat golden cow (of course
              I never use this term on him just in case some of u think I am so
              daring) is actually a taxi and if he wan to board. In the end
              he did, the one bloody pax 2nd in the queue can say Why the fuck I
              block the taxi stand.</p>
              <p>So damn piss. I am begin to experience penting up of anger
              inside me these few days. tulan man.</p>

              <p>Hi La2534,</p>
              <p>Sometime is not the pax stingy want to save the 20 or 40 cents starting fare or afraid more expensive but dosen't know the SsanyYong 7 seater is a taxi?!!!</p>
              <p>Some pax even asked me why the Chrysler starting $5 whereas mine's only $3.20? Dun know how to answer them...</p>
              <p>Worst is many times when I'm in the first que, others 4 seater taxis purposely left almost a car lot space behind me, and many times pax would have just thought I'm just a private vehicle waiting in the taxi stand and hop in to the one behind me, and the next pax just follow and the next and the next!!!</p>
              <p>Once I was having a foulday, I just simply reverse all the way to the tip of the 2nd taxi , and he got the cheek to horn me!? Me is genarally a nice guy but sometime must be guai lan a bit... Things that pissed me off...</p>
