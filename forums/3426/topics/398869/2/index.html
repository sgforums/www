            <div class='col-md body'><p>Those people who complain, when one day they decided to drive taxi, then will understand and appreciate the 3 dollar surcharge. Pure mileage only fare charges will be a disaster for consumers. If that is the case, no cabs will enter CBD during ERP operation because we cannot get the money back from pax. Call bookings in CBD will be mostly ignored too because again cannot claim back ERP. In the end, if TD earnings fall below a certain level, they might as well quit driving and work at McDonalds or become a delivery driver. Taxi companies will suffer because of all the returned taxis, passengers suffer too because they cannot get a taxi. I think it will be even worse off.</p></div>

              <p>Your suggestion is great.</p>
              <p><br>If rental is gone, then of course all surcharges should disappear as well............</p>
              <p>But then let us see....hey we still need to pay rental to taxi company^^. So sorry dude, surcharge stay.</p>
              <p>U should not tell us to remove surcharge cause we are not the one who set it. All of us are in a limited sense a business man. Like everyone, which include u, we seek to maximise income with the amount of time spent outside home. We go where the businesses are.</p>
              <p>As such, you should write to LTA tell them to reissue private licenses and let us purchase vehicle at pre tax rate and no COE. Then we can pass the saving to the customers.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, we taxi driver cannot help u. We operate within the rules set by LTA (not including those TD who like to disobey them. But yeah most of us obey rules).</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am quite sure that we earn more than u unless u are senior management that earn 5 digits. Quit ur job, just be a relief. No politics. Can talk crap like crazy. Can see girls or handsome men (depending on ur sexual orientation) or both if u are heterosex. And good money. Really I dun bluff u.</p>
              <p>And u have the support of the community here. I garantee u that u will do well (well at least after 1-3months depending how fast u learn). So why are u waiting, come join us ^^ YEAH baby!!!!!</p>
              <p>I think I can be a LakeView recruiter........man I am so good.....</p>

              <p>As such, you should write to LTA tell them to reissue private
              licenses and let us purchase vehicle at pre tax rate and no
              COE. Then we can pass the saving to the customers.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, we taxi driver cannot help u. We operate within the
              rules set by LTA (not including those TD who like to disobey them.
              But yeah most of us obey rules).</p>
