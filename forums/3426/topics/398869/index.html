              <p>As you guys know I am driving a big fat golden cow.</p>
              <p>But recently I begin to notice a trend of having 4 seaters purposely park half a car length behind my cab. Already it is quite bad that some pple avoided 7 seaters but then when they do that it makes the whole matter worst. Pple will think something wrong with this taxi and all go behind.</p>
              <p>And the culprit is usually a comfort cab or older taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>Yesterday at Tanglin Mall this happen to me. Never had I experience a problem at Tanglin Mall. Even there are pple who avoided, it is usually only 1 or 2 pax skip and I would go off in no time. Bloody comfort cab purposely park a distance when I go forward into the lot like everyone else. kanna skip until my blood boil. I so piss off that I simply reverse back and block the entire lobby. In the end, less than one min I got a pax and go.</p>
              <p>Crap man, where all the ethics and moral goes to. When I am in a queue, even pple come to me i would refer them to the first taxi in queue unless I know normal cab cannot take the pax for some reasons(eg bulky items or 5 pax and above).</p>
              <p>Now I have to play dirty also, if the 4 seater horn I let them be. Damn piss off. usually it wun happen, but now it is getting more and more common.</p>
              <p>I wonder has Estima Driver come across this ?</p>
              <p>And today at Woodlands MRT Taxi Stand. Long queue of pax no taxi. I go in first lot and no one wan to board. Ok nevermind, I take out my story book and I read and ignore those stingy faggots. 5 min or so pass and still no other cab come.</p>
              <p>Finally one guy from behind the queue approach me and ask me why i am infront of the taxi. I told him this fat golden cow (of course I never use this term on him just in case some of u think I am so daring) is actually a taxi and if he wan to board. In the end he did, the one bloody pax 2nd in the queue can say Why the fuck I block the taxi stand.</p>

              <p>actually these kind of tactics is not new. been thru it so many times . All will occur during midnight hours.  when pax flag me , if behind is a merc taxi , can guarantee u that guy will stop also in the hope that the pax will take his ride instead.</p>
              <p>same for me , if someone flag a crown in front , i also go behind him and see whether the pax will choose to take mine instead.</p>
              <p>if in Q behind me is a merc taxi , 30-70 chance the pax come out will take the merc.</p>
              <p>change to conventional taxi la, less stressful</p>
