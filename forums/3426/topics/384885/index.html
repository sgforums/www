            <div class='col-md body'><p>It was designed to make taxi bookings a lot easier, and that promise has been delivered.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) last Monday launched a new Common Taxi Number (CTN) system - 6-3425-222 or 6-DIAL-CAB - and early signs show that it is a success.<br><br>Commuters seeking a cab dial this common number and they are channelled to the call centres of Singapore's six taxi companies, one at a time, till they get one.<br><br>If the first cab operator's call centre does not take your call in 10 seconds, the system diverts you to the second one, and then the third.<br><br>If that is unsuccessful, you will be asked to try again. If you do, the system will recognise it is your second attempt and connect you to the next three call centres.<br><br>To find out how well it works, seven LifeStyle reporters did a test of the new number, as well as the hotlines of the six taxi companies. <br><br>The reporters made four trips by calling to book a cab during the morning and evening peak hours, with everyone making a call at the same time, and going to the same destinations.<br><br>The $90,000 new system, introduced by the LTA at no extra cost to the <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">taxi companies</span></a>, received a five-star rating from the team for its ease of use and efficiency.<br><br>All calls were picked up almost immediately and then re-directed to one of the six cab operators' call centres. In every instance, the booking was completed within three minutes.<br><br>Reporters who could not get through to their respective <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">taxi cab companies</span></a> or who failed to secure a booking fell back on the new hotline number as an alternative and their calls were also attended to swiftly.<br><br>In the past, you had to remember the numbers of six cab operators here and it proved very confusing for many people, particularly tourists.<br><br>Under the new system, the normal booking fees still apply, depending on which company you end up making a booking with.<br><br>It automatically allocates calls to the <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">taxi companies</span></a> based on their market share of all call bookings. This way, every cab company gets its fair share of calls allocated to it.<br><br>If you prefer a particular <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">taxi company</span></a> but cannot remember its booking hotline, you can call this new line and get its operator to forward your call.<br><br>A check with the LTA shows that more than 4,600 calls were made to the new line in the first four days. Its spokesman says the system can handle 780 calls simultaneously.<br><br>'Even at peak hours, this level of calls would be exceptional,' says the spokesman, adding that during the first four days, the system achieved a 100 per cent pick-up rate of all calls.<br><br>To raise awareness about the new system, 130 posters and 15,500 fliers have been distributed to six major tourist attractions such as the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and Singapore Flyer.<br><br>In addition, 30 Singapore taxi stands also display the new number.<br><br>Those who have used the new hotline give it a thumbs-up, praising it for being hassle-free and convenient.<br><br>Undergraduate Lum Jin Xian, 21, says: 'The common number was useful when I was stuck in the rain trying to recall the various booking numbers of the <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">cab companies</span></a>.'<br><br>In the LifeStyle test, <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/comfort-taxi/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">ComfortDelgro</span></a>'s fleet of <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/comfort-taxi/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">Comfort</span></a> and <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/citycab/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">CityCab taxis</span></a> came up tops too, for its speedy and reliable service.<br><br><a href="/taxi-companies/smart-cabs/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">Smart</span></a> took the last spot. It could not find a cab for our reporter for the first three calls, and the one time when a booking was secured, the cab failed to show up.<br><br>The results mirror a similar test LifeStyle did two years ago, when the new system was not yet in place.<br><br>Singapore taxi companies say they welcome the new initiative, but most of them were reluctant to comment on whether the new system will translate into more bookings as it is still early days.<br><br>One thing is for sure: The biggest winners are the commuters.<br><br>Assistant manager Agnes Seng, 24, says: 'Instead of trying to call all <a href="http://taxisingapore.com/taxi-companies/"><span style="color: #2786c2;">taxi companies</span></a> when I can't get through, now I just dial one number.<br><br>'After all, I just need to know whether I can get a Singapore Taxi, irrespective of the company.'</p></div>
