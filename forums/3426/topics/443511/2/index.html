              <p>Singaporeans find the fare expensive due to the fact they are
              not paid well.  If they are paid well perhaps they will take
              it that it is reasonable.</p>

              <p>I think people like the TS is either stupid or really retarded
                  or just trying to twist the data to deceive people. Personally, I
                  will give him the benefit of the doubt to think he's not stupid or
                  retarded, just trying to deceive people.</p>
              <p>To just put a data out like that is not fair because for
                  example, in those countries, you can buy a car for $20k. In
                  Singapore, $20k can't even get you the CHEAPEST car. Why didn't TS
                  point that out? Is he retard or stupid, this I don't know.</p>
              <p>Also, he miss out alot of important data points, such as in New
                  York, the Programmer salary annually is USD$93,000. In Singapore,
                  that's totally reduced to SGD$30000. Please also note that 93k is
                  in USD, not SGD mentioned for the $30k. For Christ sake, if we
                  are making close to $100k, we won't complain about Singapore
                  taxi fare lah, use your bloody brain!!!</p>
              <p>What TS is trying to do is manipulate a set of data to suit his
                  argument with huge bias, either through his stupidity or his
                  retarded or he's just out to cheat people.</p>
              <p>I also can do it easily... My friend's grandfather lives
                  till 105 years old, he's a smoker. Steve Jobs died of cancer at age
                  50+ and he's a non-smoker. So from this data, we can say if you
                  smoke, you can live to a long age. If you don't smoke, even if you
                  are damn rich, you will die of cancer before 60. LOL!!!</p>
              <p>Please stop manipulating data to cheat people. Thanks!</p>

              <p>Hmm.. Read  my post carefully i never say Singapore cab fare cheap or expensive. In Singapore people want higher standard of service and living, but they expect low price, hence the comparison to india against the more develop countries like  NY, Paris, etc...</p>
              <p>If you wat to compare car price to other country take into the account the size of the country. If car price dirt cheap in singapore i cant imagine the how the jam would be. Peak hour for me to drive from Ubi to Jurong sometimes takes me 1hr. Come out of my office carpark jam liao.</p>
              <p>One reason why the pay there higher also depends on the skills they have. A good Programmer in Singapore also can get higher pay, not as high as in US though. Singapore Degree holder in IT line for example all cannot make it! I've been in IT line for past 11yrs. When i compare with the knowledge and skills of the guys i've deal with from US and UK, Singapore degree holder with same number of yrs experience cant even come close. </p>
              <p>If want to compare, Singapore with US &amp; Europe, yes their pay higher. They don't have CPF, but their GST/VAT higher, UK VAT 15%. Income tax higher, US$40k gross income, income tax US$4k+, food more ex... Take taxi also must pay tip, like in NY taxi tip is 10-20%, eat or drink in cafe also must pay tip. Not like in Singapore tip optional, give tip also give loose change, down there they expect you pay tip!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes living in Singapore is expensive! I also don't like how the men in white run the country. But consumers demands high standard, high standard of living = higher cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People complain here jam there jam, no parking. COE go up, ERP go up. Anything go up everything else will go up. Passengers complain taxi service sucks, taxi company get fine, end up passenger pay the price. COE go up, taxi rental go up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are good and bad living in other countries, i choose to stay in Singapore when most of my relatives are in Canada, Australia, Sweden, Dubai and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't go around complaining like some, complaining and doing nothing about it kindda pointless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why i want to drive Taxi? Why not.. Because my last ICT, one camp mate outside pay $3k, drive taxi part time also. Taxi driver pay use for retirement savings. Another OMO, then got another guy work for some petrochemical company, driving BMW 6 Coupe also want to take TDVL </p>

              <p>Actually the TS has presented a very subjective view. I think yes, most singaporeans would agree that sg is first world and hence the comparisons to first world. However, it is unfair to compare with countries like the US, France or Australia.</p>
              <p>As mentioned by a forummer earlier, different countries have different earning power. If you would like to look in detail, refer no further than the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity). In short, it's a ranking of the spending power of citizens in that country relative to the rest of the world. Not sure about the exact details but last I saw was that Sg is very far behind those countries aforementioned. And all this with whatever VAT and pension tax factored in. So I hope this clarifies.</p>
              <p>Let's not play the TD-passenger blame game here. The ones who are really laughing all the way to the bank are the high level decision making executives from the taxi operators.</p>
              <p>And lastly, if you think a taxi is too expensive...then just take public transport. I never take one unless it's life and death or I'm dead tired. Well, that's also because there's a family car.</p>

              <p>Hmm.. Read  my post carefully i never say Singapore cab fare cheap or expensive. In Singapore people want higher standard of service and living, but they expect low price, hence the comparison to india against the more develop countries like  NY, Paris, etc...</p>
              <p>If you wat to compare car price to other country take into the account the size of the country. If car price dirt cheap in singapore i cant imagine the how the jam would be. Peak hour for me to drive from Ubi to Jurong sometimes takes me 1hr. Come out of my office carpark jam liao.</p>
              <p>One reason why the pay there higher also depends on the skills they have. A good Programmer in Singapore also can get higher pay, not as high as in US though. Singapore Degree holder in IT line for example all cannot make it! I've been in IT line for past 11yrs. When i compare with the knowledge and skills of the guys i've deal with from US and UK, Singapore degree holder with same number of yrs experience cant even come close. </p>
              <p>If want to compare, Singapore with US &amp; Europe, yes their pay higher. They don't have CPF, but their GST/VAT higher, UK VAT 15%. Income tax higher, US$40k gross income, income tax US$4k+, food more ex... Take taxi also must pay tip, like in NY taxi tip is 10-20%, eat or drink in cafe also must pay tip. Not like in Singapore tip optional, give tip also give loose change, down there they expect you pay tip!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes living in Singapore is expensive! I also don't like how the men in white run the country. But consumers demands high standard, high standard of living = higher cost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People complain here jam there jam, no parking. COE go up, ERP go up. Anything go up everything else will go up. Passengers complain taxi service sucks, taxi company get fine, end up passenger pay the price. COE go up, taxi rental go up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are good and bad living in other countries, i choose to stay in Singapore when most of my relatives are in Canada, Australia, Sweden, Dubai and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't go around complaining like some, complaining and doing nothing about it kindda pointless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why i want to drive Taxi? Why not.. Because my last ICT, one camp mate outside pay $3k, drive taxi part time also. Taxi driver pay use for retirement savings. Another OMO, then got another guy work for some petrochemical company, driving BMW 6 Coupe also want to take TDVL </p>

              <p>First of all, sorry for my harsh remarks (sometimes i am abit rash in my words which is my weakness), maybe your intention wasn't what i thought them to be...</p>
              <p>but my point is exactly what you said... you cannot just use 1 set of data points to say whether the cab fare is lower/higher... there are many data points to consider before you can come to the conclusion. if your intention wasn't for anyone to come to a conclusion, then your thread is not helpful. if your intention was to help people come to conclusion about the cost of taxi here, then it's misleading also.</p>

              <p>but my point is exactly what you said... you cannot just use 1
              set of data points to say whether the cab fare is
              lower/higher... there are many data points to consider before you
              can come to the conclusion. if your intention wasn't for anyone to
              come to a conclusion, then your thread is not helpful. if your
              intention was to help people come to conclusion about the cost of
              taxi here, then it's misleading also.</p>

              <p>No need sorry lah. I know you dun mean it one. I sometimes also KNN here CCB there. Lol</p>
              <p>But yes you have a point. It's like comparing apple orange. Cannot compare finish one....</p>
              <p>But in general those whom come here from those western country thinks that our taxi fare cheap. Same like when I go Vietnam I also says their taxi fare dirt cheap. A 15 min trip around US$1 like that. I change alot of US$1 so normally give them UD$2 they happy like a bird. I ask around an average Vietnamese working in the hotel line earns US$100-200 depending on the appointment. So to take taxi for then is consider expensive. I go Bkk also like that. Got once take a taxi only short distance like from Novena to City Hall took 1.5 hours because of evening peak hour jam. I sleep already wake up have reach. End up the fare around 160 baht so I give the driver 200 baht around SGD$9 like that. KNN if singapore peak hours stuck in jam 1.5 hours prepare to pay around $50 leh....</p>
