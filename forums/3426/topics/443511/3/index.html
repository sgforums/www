              <p>Taxi at all countries are expensive to their local. As a low
                  level laborer, will always see it as a luxury, too expensive for
                  them to enjoy. Be sorry for yourself that you ended to be in this
                  low level laborer.</p>
              <p>For those mid level laborer, usually had commited to much in
                  raising their status, no much cash left for disposal hence unable
                  to cope with Taxi pricing but still wish to sustain their quailty
                  of life. These made up the population in Singapore Complianant, and
                  common name for them is "cheapo".</p>
              <p>Taxi is an exclusive services, how cheap can it be?</p>

              <p>Exclusive service is not public transport.  Exclusive service is when the driver is employed as personal driver providing personal service to the boss or his family.</p>
              <p>Also taxi drivers can reject taking in cheapo customers if you deem them to be.</p>

              If no one knows that Singapore is already the most expensive country in Asian?? Hmmm I am surprise! however a maid working in Singapore can still afford to take taxi every Sunday on they day off? Or a blangadashi or china construction worker can take a taxi to geylang??? Hmmn we are not surprise?
              
              Now let's compare a first world nation japan, asked any of the salaried worker how many times they took a taxi paying personnally like once a year maybe or even non. After midnight they miss the train they just sit in an Internet cafe or sleep at macdonalds
              
              Singaporeans sad to say have forgot how to appreciate others. The Thais construction workers take my cab Yishun to golden mile, $17 uncle $18 lah never mind, not a big tip, but from them it's from the heart, they know how hard we work.
              
              A bit irrevelent, when you pump petrol a a petrol station, I have observe quite a number of taxi drivers giving the attendent a small tip, maybe I am wrong, but not seem any of the subaru, hondas etc giving them a tip. Guess that's why I remain poor as a taxi driver haha, but yes I know how hard they work too for the megre pay. 
              
              Taxi fares still value for money in
              my opinion for non peak hours. Of course peak got to pay lor. But then peak hours a lot of people also need taxis, some paid by company for company purposes. So well just need to wake up earlier to reach work if don't want to pay taxi fares lor.
              
              Yes I admit I cheapo also, I take bus lor walk lor, and take taxi only when needed when I don't drive the cab, let those that need them or willing to pay them pay lar. Why all the fuss? If no demand lots of cabbies will throw key, then prices will come down right? That is why before the increase in fare commutors complain, cause prices was too cheap So everyone can take cab lah. Like I said maid, construction workers, etc.

              <p>Ya those pump attendents very little pay and have to smoke the fumes of vehicle everyday. Very bad for their health. So sometimes even I dun pump petrol just park there use toilet and buy drinks I will tip them $2 and they will help me wipe windows etc. Although it's a small amount but see them happy happy brightens up my days. But not everytime I tips lah. Only tips those old man and when I drive up they very enthu type. Those sianz sianz type like that Serangoon North pump uncle can fark off.</p>

              <p>Ya very expensive, we taxi driver every year get 2 months bonus of $6000 (based on the TD in the ST who say he earn 3k every month).</p>
              <p>Comfort very wonderful, July give me 3/4 month bonus, December give me 1 1/4 month bonus, plus I get minimum 7 days Annual leave, also can take MC with pay for 30 days every year.</p>
              <p>So yar for pax taxi is very very expensive because we taxi driver earn 3k every month, plus medical leave, bonus and AL. Rental is very cheap, diesel dont say, got super discount. LTA also very understanding, got so many rules publish everywhere and we are updated on every rule they have ( not just the 6 most serious ppl think, we are told).</p>
              <p>I think taxi fare should be more reasonable like first time I take taxi, starting meter only $1 and jump 5cts. Meter should go back to 1981-2 price structure and become cheap for everybody, no need to take bus or Mrt, take a cab home today!</p>

              <p>Hello, I do think taxi fares here are relatively dirt cheap! Considering we are not spared the expenses of one of Asia's most expensive place to live in, the effort of driving around an extremely over crowded island. Do note relatively cheap does not mean very affordable. Like HDB is said to be affordable but is fxxking ridiculusly priced! By now if you are a Singaporean and don't get this theory, you are just amongst those that are living blindly. I still remember a long time back some women was saying "wah! toyota corola $80K! So cheap now ar?" What I am saying is, Cab fare is relatively dirt cheap considering the cost required to fund the vehicle and driver.</p>
              <p>Shit! If transport minister hears this they will start looking at using China people to drive Taxi already.... fcuk</p>

              Cab fare is relatively dirt cheap considering the cost required to

              <p><br>haha, that few blocks would make much out of property tax for the govt, so govt decided to make road with ERP or satelite ERP to earn much more mah.</p>
              <p>The way out govt work is not just to address one issue with one decision, they make one decision can kill a few birds, including your and me, once road are built, not only ERP, road tax will also go up, and if you hv a good foresight, you can see that this NS expressway is also helping to make malaysians to access our casinos faster.</p>
