              <p>Hi folks,</p>
              <p>Very happy, just got my Approval Letter from LTA.  First hurdle crossed, next stop... SATA for the medical examination tomorrow.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>, as I'm watching my spending carefully, would like to know if the following "price list" is accurate or not...</p>
              <p>SATA Medical Exam: $32.10</p>
              <p>Course Fee: $250 (plus GST)</p>
              <p>Test Fee: $35</p>
              <p>Material Fee: $50</p>
              <p>Did I leave anything out?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Secondly</span></strong>, can seniors here confirm that I can take the course at either SMRT or Comfort and not be obliged to hire their vehicle right?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Thridly</strong></span>, is there anyone here who had just passed the TDVL course/test and would like to sell his/her training materials?  If so, please PM me with your asking price and we proceed from there, ok?</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading.</p>

              <p>Comfort has the most calls. So it is easy for pple to learn their trade at a shortest time without the need to suffer low income over long period of time.</p>

              <p>thanks for the reply,.  Yes, I'm actually leaning towards taking up the online course and now that you mentioned that you got your TDVL within 30 days, it really affirmed my decision. I just needed confrimation that signing up for a company's course <strong>does not</strong> obliged you to be their driver". This, you had done as well in your reply. :)</p>
              <p>But, alas... this morning I went for my medical check up at SATA in Chai Chee and had a minor stumble. Damned! It must be the late nights staying awake and watching World Cup.  But stupid blood pressure is about 171 (1st reading) and then 154 (2nd reading). Even the nurse is a bit shock that at only 36 (ok, I'm obese), my blood pressure is that high.  My blood pressure has never been this high before.</p>
              <p>Anyway, doctor says to do a blood pressure reading again when I collect the report next Monday.  So, it's back to plenty of rest for the next few days... And no late nights too.</p>

              <p>thanks for the reply.</p>
              <p>Yes, I did go through your newbie guide.  In fact, that was the post that led me to this forum when I started research about getting a TDVL.  In addition, it is also my plan that once I got the TDVL, signing up with Comfort as a relief driver is what I'm going to do for at least the initial 3 - 6 months while I learn the trade.</p>
              <p>After that, I will be evaluating the feasibility of hiring a Wish from Transcab (thanks to all the poisoning from Uncle Poolman), but my location being in Bedok is a major negative though. Anyway, it's still too early to talk about this.  I still have to get over my medical check up (which I had a little tumble this morning).</p>

              <p>                     yes truth as what u say but i think u were not well prepared why i say so is cause i saw all the posted messages in the topic and i see u were a bit over confident but never the less its ok, do well in the next 2 paper, listen to the good advice of our seniors here like example  poolman &amp;zero 5  and etc i just passed and got my TVDL recently by e-learning so i saw all the advise they give and the rest of the seniors and juniors also in the forum telling  their thoughts and ideas and that alone i dont think even in class room lesson they will teach you so i wish u goodluck<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Good luck to you for your retest. It's good that the retest can be taken so quickly as all the stuff that we'd studied are still fresh in our mind.  Thanks for the link for the embassies though.  Knowing the location of <strong>ALL</strong> the embassies is one of the most important thing that my brother in law emphasise to me.  (He's a cabby with CDG for many many years already).</p>

              <p>LOL... It's a pity that TransCab did not employ him as their sales staff.  Even more so since now that they have scraped the referral fees.</p>

              <p>That is why i said , whatever call scheme u are in , no use one , Comfort just got too many calls to Woodlands , Yishun , Sembawang , AMK , Hougang esp , Punggol .</p>
              <p>Even now to Pasir Ris , Tampines , Simei , getting rare .</p>
              <p>Cos these Tampines , Simei , Pasir Ris paxes , i would said , they has their own personally cabbies , meaning pax call them personally . Those cabbies that play around AP , would give name cards to them , so that customer can help them connect one more trip .</p>
              <p>They tentatively escape going to rojak places .</p>
              <p>Do u give name cards to paxes staying Woodlands ?</p>

              <p>I am so confident , Beach Road Radio taxis , their strong hold inside CBD , grap major shares of paxes going from town to town , the paxes are so regular for them .</p>
              <p>Hotels , Restaurants , Clubs , tourists spots etc ... beach road radio taxis very strong .</p>
              <p>Cos when they call Beach Road or Lake View , i would say 100% surely got cabs for them . Even under 15 minutes .</p>
              <p>So who are those balance paxes that call Comfort ?</p>
              <p>It's those who everytime call private radio taxis , still nobody take them !!!</p>
              <p>Good ones ? Many people took away liao .... Lake View , Beach Road , Royal Group Limo , IslandWide , personal calls , Taman Jurong , Boon Lay stand .</p>
              <p>With so many group getting the best bites , those loose ones ..... sorry 6552-1111 .</p>

              <p>So pls dun tell me , one night inside CBD , u get 10 calls , all is inside CBD and all solid one .</p>

              <p>But after 8pm ?</p>
              <p>Again , 5pm to 8pm , those who called , will not be local , local dun call-a-cab during peak hours , all Expats that call .</p>
              <p>Then after 8pm , peak hour no more .</p>
              <p>Then locals come out call one , but if got other taxi come by , they would still pick the cheaper option , but later tell cabby : " Uncle , can give me a receipt ? "</p>
