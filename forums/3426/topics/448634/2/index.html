              <p><br> i am not related to the poster. what the above said is exactly
              correct, not just one or two but many many different people
              experience, and i will add my view. those who think the Red Gang
              play nice is misled. they become very very different when drivers
              are resigning and then especially returning. they want body perfect
              vehicle back, like showroom condition, every little thing even
              undercarriage they will deduct 3 digits per dot (repeat: PER DOT),
              non negotiable. if the driver tries to explain or defend back that
              its unreasonable, they will add more charges from somewhere
              anywhere, sometimes its more admin charge, sometimes its more this
              charge that charge. but when driver tries to find the department
              why the extra charge, the department will keep referring to the
              FLOWER (pui!) but the FLOWER (2x pui!) will keep playing hide and
              seek. if driver agreed to arrange to meet any time as long before
              5pm, everyone will say that FLOWER (3x pui!) busy or outside or
              meeting. but once 5.01pm, everyone will say why ask so late, work
              time already over, anything also dont know, come back tomorrrow. if
              driver call office, they will block out the number and email and
              dont reply letters. knnccb the ONLY TIME they will be nice to the
              driver is if driver chooses to remain with the company, either
              change vehicle or renew contract. any other thing, no talk..talk
              more only more charges. and one last thing, its true, that stupid
              FLOWER (4x pui!) has a bunch of kakis that only she favors. if any
              driver dont play by her farkup rules, even if they are right shes
              wrong, they will kanna big time either from her, or usually thru
              her admin or workshop people, its not obvious at first, but if have
              chance the driver can find out over time. as for accidents, driver
              can forget about getting any cent back. after a long long time and
              chasing they will always 'sad to inform you its 5050' but their
              5050 is as good as 100 at fault. as long as driver in any accident,
              fault or no fault, pay up 100% excess, the company will quietly let
              driver continue, but their excess is one of the highest in the
              market, almost like total loss! somemore drivers should expect
              cases, even simple, clear cut ones, to easily drag over 1-2 years.
              the longest i heard is still pending over 3 years almost 4 for
              simple knock i saw the pictures, but the money? in the company's
              bank. dont say i only say negative, there is ONE good thing with
              the Red Gang. they cover up EVERY COMPLAINT CASE. not 1 not 2, but
              EVERY CASE, unless its murder or rape. drivers will NEVER hear any
              feedback, not even good ones, the only thing they will ever hear if
              they are not obedient is how much they still owe the company.
              newspaper you are free to quote me. be very careful when signing up
              the Red Gang, actually all the power is under one fark FLOWER (5X
              PUI!), everyone else is just putting on show to fool the drivers. i
              personally suspect something's wrong inside the company internal,
              maybe they facing financial or management issues, they are sucking
              up as much money as possible from every driver in the shortest
              time. beware what you signing down and handing over. last thing i
              suggest pay by short term cash, dont giro, they now quite regular
              mistake or sometimes try luck over deduct and dont return until
              further checking, but still have to chase like crazy, and then they
              think its the driver irritating ?!</p>

To begin with they already hold my money (Deposit + Incentive) which is pending insurance to close case then refund me. So on paper is they still owe me money right?

              <p>Proceed to file a civil suit for $5xx??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> tell them to go ahead, this farking cab company think they are so big and their corporate lawyers can tekan people with a claim of only $5xx, I think the court will laugh until the cow come home. You want to sue a cabby for $5xx??? Big news lor</p>
              <p>What you are talking with are just unprofessional admin people, the situation is simple to comprehen, "they just do not want to return back your incentives and deposit", with a $5xx tag on it, you can never get that amount, and hopefully, they wish you give up asking them further. This is what they wanted, very unethical business.</p>
              <p>What you can do is go into SCT, small Claim tribunals, but this may need your lawyer advises, because there is a lots of paper that need to fill up and certain representation during registrar meeting of both parties. The fees is about $50, and within 2 weeks, a letter will be sent to Jasmine desk asking for representation of court proceeding.</p>
              <p>Trancab management + you and your lawyer + the court registrar will sit down and settle it, once the settlement cannot be reach, the court will fix a date for the hearing, which both side must prove and show their case, and a final verdict will be announce.</p>

              hammer case is very very familiar. almost all the cases at the RED GANG is like that.
                                                  
              they will NEVER tell the driver the case info, they will NEVER update the driver about case status until driver chase like crazy, they will either say "oh case still pending" or "sorry 50/50, means you lose". 
                                                  
              i personally ever saw one of the so said lawyer letter the admin staff showed to a driver uncle, said is from the other side party, on the letter it wrote "willing to settle 80%". then the admin staff smiled at the driver uncle and say happily, "uncle, this mean you lose everything hor, you understand right". the driver uncle was so angry he was shouting out loud and waving, but the admin staff threatened to ignore his case from then on (meaning stop fighting for him), or throw him out of the office, or sack him if he continued to be this "unreasonable" since case is already decided for him. so that driver uncle lost $2140 in the next minute. actually he did not agree, but they said they will auto deduct out of his deposit and advance payment. if he cannot top up his deposit by the time they deduct, then they will forfeit his taxi immediately and slap him another 14 days termination charge, PLUS TOW CHARGE if he dont drive back. that driver uncle was told to go back and think about paying up:
                                                  
              1. $2140 now, or 
              2. $2140 + 14 DAYS + TOW CHARGE 2 weeks later, or
              3. $2140 + 14 DAYS + TOW CHARGE + COURT after that 2 weeks, OR still if want to fight then..
              4. $2140 + 14 DAYS + TOW CHARGE + COURT + OWN LAWYER 
                                                  
              i suspect this RED GANG might be COLLUDING with auto insurers to eat taxi drivers whom they are betting, dont have the knowledge or the guts or the resources to pick up legal battle. means, they are challenging taxi drivers to surrender 100% once they are scare.
                                                  
              hammer so this is your answer. it can also be your worst nightmare from now on.
              i already checked, getting lawyer to fight them start at about $XXX for consultation and maybe first 1 to 2 letters, if cannot work out then to $XXXX, then still cannot means may become $XXXXX. they are challenging you to eat small shet now or eat bigger shet later, and they are hoping no one will take the lead to challenger them back, becos everyone is still waiting for that FIRST HERO to lead the first step.
