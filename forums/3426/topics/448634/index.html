            <div class='col-md body'><p>Today go office ask why my deposit and incentives not refund. KNN they says I got 2 accident case still not settle. Already pay then the excess but they says case is 50-50 so need to close case then return me the money. So total is $2140 for both cases. But I already paid up $2140 for both cases they says 50-50 cases they will hold till case close. First case more then a year liao, second case also almost a year liao still not close? When I go throw letter I already ask Jasmine she says I got no outstanding. So I pay rental swee swee till last day. KNN if I know like that I will go bang the car until beyond repair let them scarp the car. The most I forfiet another $2140 they will have total loss of 1 Wish. See who lugi more. So for those who got 50-50 cases even you pay your half excess they will also chut pattern hold your money. And they says cases can drag 2-3 years to close so you might not see your money again. Anyway I already engage a lawyer to issue them a letter of demand already. KNN Phuiiii this kind of company. Do this kind of bo standard thing. Imagine 1 hirer they hold back 2K, if 100 hirer they easily hold back 200K. And I belief there is more then 100 loh. To an individual 2K is small sum but to them KNN the money can generate a substantial amount of interest ok!!!!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p></div>

              Hi Bro Hammerhammer, I just done my cab monthly servicing in the Transcab workshops. During the waiting, chat with many cab drivers and discover that now Transcab chu pattern liao. All accident cases even if you are 100% right, Jasmine will tell you 50-50% to hold back your deposit. Many drivers are very angry and I had seen with my own eyes(twice) drivers(1 even with family) went down to quarrel with Jasmine with deposit. Many are either engage lawyer or play the above hide-and-seek pattern. All senior drivers complained transcab had changed from cabby-oriented to money-oriented. Now even you returned back the cab, they will inspect and try to deduct every single dent and scratches on your cab. They expecting you to return a "brand new condition" crown or wish to them. So instead of getting back your S$1500 in full, you may only get back S$1000 or so. They also commented Jasmine had turned into an arrogant lady and stopped taking side with the drivers. They just want to squeeze more $$$ from the cab drivers. Though I just signed up with them, I had decided to throw key...... after listening to all negatives feedback from more than 3 different groups of drivers.      
              
              Bro Poolman, I tried to stay neutral to all taxi companies but above are the cabby feedback so far. I apologised if I offended you in any case.

              <p>I went to look for Jasmine and manage to catch her today. She explain to me the things in detail. Everything is a misunderstanding so I decide to call my friend withdraw the letter of demand. Anyway I not really hard up for the money.</p>
              <p>Actually it is those "chao kar" people that give us hirer a bad name. Because of these people owe rental, owe this owe that we are being stereotype by the cab company.</p>
              <p>Got one hirer's relief got terminated and he go look for Jasmine. Then she check and tell him why she terminate him as he owes company $2K++ excess and he only paid to date $400 in deposit nia. Another guy also accident twice in a month after deduction his incentives still got more then $1K outstanding asking for help. Jasmine tell him settle $550 then balance $1K pay installment. So afterall she is trying to help them afterall but these CB people take things for granted.</p>
              <p>I really dun understand why they like to owe this owe that so much. KNN like that the amount will snowball very fast. When company come tow away their cab they KPKB. In the first place they dun do swee swee for people what.</p>
              <p>So sometimes I think her position is also not easy. Dun help the drivers they KPKB, help them too much they yaya papaya then continue to chut more pattern and she still need to answer to boss Teo. That's why I just give her the bebefit of the doubt loh.....</p>

              <p>Ok I am lucky I only got 3 cats to feed and no need worry about parent. But also no reason for those "chao kars" to owe so much rental/excess. Alot I know they indudge in vices like drinking, warfares, 4Ds etc. Like that how much they earn also not enough lah. My only vice is smoking and some football punting. But hor sometimes I see those 4D siao one weekend buy 4D cost more then my bola...</p>

              those who think the Red Gang play nice is misled. they become very very different when drivers are resigning and then especially returning. they want body perfect vehicle back, like showroom condition, every little thing even undercarriage they will deduct 3 digits per dot (repeat: PER DOT), non negotiable. if the driver tries to explain or defend back that its unreasonable, they will add more charges from somewhere anywhere, sometimes its more admin charge, sometimes its more this charge that charge. but when driver tries to find the department why the extra charge, the department will keep referring to the FLOWER (pui!) but the FLOWER (2x pui!) will keep playing hide and seek. if driver agreed to arrange to meet any time as long before 5pm, everyone will say that FLOWER (3x pui!) busy or outside or meeting. but once 5.01pm, everyone will say why ask so late,  work time already over, anything also dont know, come back tomorrrow. if driver call office, they will block out the number and email and dont reply letters. knnccb
              
              the ONLY TIME they will be nice to the driver is if driver chooses to remain with the company, either change vehicle or renew contract. any other thing, no talk..talk more only more charges.
              
              and one last thing, its true, that stupid FLOWER (4x pui!) has a bunch of kakis that only she favors. if any driver dont play by her farkup rules, even if they are right shes wrong, they will kanna big time either from her, or usually thru her admin or workshop people, its not obvious at first, but if have chance the driver can find out over time.
              
              as for accidents, driver can forget about getting any cent back. after a long long time and chasing they will always 'sad to inform you its 5050' but their 5050 is as good as 100 at fault. as long as driver in any accident, fault or no fault, pay up 100% excess, the company will quietly let driver continue, but their excess is one of the highest in the market, almost like total loss! somemore drivers should expect cases, even simple, clear cut ones, to easily drag over 1-2 years. the longest i heard is still pending over 3 years almost 4 for simple knock i saw the pictures, but the money? in the company's bank.
              
              dont say i only say negative, there is ONE good thing with the Red Gang. they cover up EVERY COMPLAINT CASE. not 1 not 2, but EVERY CASE, unless its murder or rape. drivers will NEVER hear any feedback, not even good ones, the only thing they will ever hear if they are not obedient is how much they still owe the company. newspaper you are free to quote me.
              
              be very careful when signing up the Red Gang, actually all the power is under one fark FLOWER (5X PUI!), everyone else is just putting on show to fool the drivers. i personally suspect something's wrong inside the company internal, maybe they facing financial or management issues, they are sucking up as much money as possible from every driver in the shortest time. beware what you signing down and handing over. last thing i suggest pay by short term cash, dont giro, they now quite regular mistake or sometimes try luck over deduct and dont return until further checking, but still have to chase like crazy, and then they think its the driver irritating ?!

              the problem with that place is its run like a Dynasty, by a kuku Dowager and her network of kuku maids. if anyone notice carefully, they dont have anything that clearly spell out policy that can be explained or clarified, they leave those policy to THEIR discretion. they only make drivers sign one thick shot all the policy those that is definitely to their advantage.
              
              i dont think this is good time to sign any CNG. unless already tied in contract dont want penalty then no choice. so many run road already, still want to rush inside? i think they going to face big problem very soon, recently they so desperate sucking so much money so hard, even want to earn from accident cases that they see as side income opportunity, maybe soon they may even xxx
              
              but if die die must sign with them, mentally be prepared to assume you already lost at least 50% deposit after finish, if not forget about it 100%, must see that open then wont so frustrated until fight or hospital. AND prepare to be 100% no problem from contract start to end, no accident, no mistake, no complain.t  becos starting from one small problem the driver can start to taste the small then to the bigger shet.
              
              if anyone dont believe, very simple, just drop by the office anytime, very soon sure see someone shouting and cursing and swearing at the CB staff, INCLUDING AND ESPECIALLY THE DAMN FLOWER (PUI!).
              
              last time starting i dont understand why leh got people so upset until like that, but now i fully understand. i really pity those newbirds sign up wih them, the cashier and staff sometimes secretly smiling when counting new deposit payment. i also pity those money pay first but never return them, almost cases are so near yet so far.

              <p><br>These including the above highspeed are all my disciples, they all trained to write long and fast, and also know how to read fast, same like lawyers and doctors, and also same like the day you take key to your house or HDB or your new cab, all the policies are written like this, it purposely makes you tire of reading it, then just sign here and there with both eyes close.</p>
              <p>But when I came here, I start to switch to suit it, in public I still type long long essay, and if not typing, my writing is same as doctor and lawyer writing, cannot read, too bad</p>
