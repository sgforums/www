              <p>Today idle as usual, start then stop. 1st trip after re-start kena Woodlands, so after that go Kranji MRT.</p>
              <p>I know today no race night, so go Kranji MRT queue, will surely kena rubbish fares to Kranji and Sungei Kadut, but I haven't cover rental, so bo pian, must take means take.</p>
              <p>And I know the rubbish that happens there, some TDs don't want to take Indian, Bangla and Chinese Fts going to Kadut or Kranji.</p>
              <p>I reach I was no 3. No 1 CDG sampan, No 2 TC Wish. 1 pax come to sampan, kena interview and never take, he go to Wish, Wish take, I become No 2.</p>
              <p>I standby my HP video mode.</p>
              <p>3 Bangla come, go sampan, he don't want. Come to me, my door lock, window wind down, tell bangla go No 1 cab. Then Chinese national come, go sampan, again reject, come to me, I come out start video rolling and tell Chinaman you take him, he don't want to take ask him F.O.</p>
              <p>LL sampan call to first 3 bangla, take them go Kranji, I also take Chinaman go Kranji.</p>
              <p>As luck would have it, return to queue, the same sampan infront of me. Again I No 3, he no 2, No 1 Sonata. 1st bangla come, No 1 never take, but this No 2 sampan after earlier, no interview, straightaway take and go.</p>
              <p>Next came 1 group, go to Sonata this time, he take, my video standby.</p>
              <p>I get 1 makcik going West Coast.</p>
              <p>KNN, wanna queue at Kranji, want what, trip to Changi is it. You wanna eat rice and I eat shit? Sorry hor. I very cool and forgiving, but this trick I wrong person.</p>
              <p>I stay 5 mins from LTA and CDG, my mood bad, I confirm tomorrow morning go LTA lodge report and give statement.</p>
              <p>Video I won't display here, but will give to LTA.</p>
              <p>I dont care which company, be fair. Drive taxi doesn't mean can eat cake everyday. You wanna eat cake do interview on the street, not at taxi stand.</p>

              <p>But all I can tell you is that you will still be getting such pattern at Q in our day in and day out driving, and if you mood remain sombre, the complain will never stop, so what happen if you are in a good mood?</p>

              <p>Good mood, maybe only f him, so far I always good mood with other TDs, let a lot of things go.</p>
              <p>But yesterday was a close run thing. Although maybe today morning I might soften up and not report.</p>

              <p>Then you have to learn to control your mood, as I said earlier, when you drive, you wears the cabby Hat, when you at home, you wear the father or husband Hat and so on, I know it is not easy, but if you can master the way of controlling emotion and be more realistics of what you are and what you are doing, then maybe you can improve your well being, be happier and healthy.</p>
              <p>Alway learn to be realistic, just an example</p>
              <p>Drive 1 hr, no pax, how? Then think, yes, realistically, there is no paxs, either take a rest or move out into other places, then try again. For many TDs, their mood would had changed from good one to a bad one.</p>
              <p>Family got problems, driving keep thinking, mood bad, then think again, family got problem, yes, realistically, there is a problem in the family, but since I am driving, I drives first and later got time, discuss with relatives or dearest one on how to solve it, keep thinking cannot change much, let concentrate on my driving.</p>

              <p>Correct, and if you go home and bring your Taxi hat, you think our kids will play with you, they expect a father hat, a wife expect a husband hat, and yr parents will expect a good son Hat.</p>
              <p>I come from a large family, those old time big family, most of my brothers and sisters are doing well, some very well, but I hv never once ask them for any help.</p>
              <p>Occasion such as CNY, my wife and childrens wear normally, same goes to me, still driving, but others' childrens are wearing addidas, nike, Hermes...and all branded goods, their wivies with this ring, that diamond rings and that coach bags and so on..my wife only wears jean and t shirt. And at carpark, their BM and merc brightened the old HDB carpark that have more pick up and taxis than normal cars</p>
              <p>Their kids talk like foreign trash with ang mo accent, when brothers and in laws chit chat, I feels out of the picture, why? Because TD cum casket driver got what to talk? even talk people also not happy or choose not to listen. And unlike formerly, where we use to greet our elder, these day youngster see me like transparent, most never call Uncle.</p>
              <p>But then who cares, just wear my son hat, pay respect to parents and elderly, smile and be happy.</p>

              <p>Go to ONEMOTORING then choose LTA e-services (login) then login with Singpass then you can submit SMLJ complain also can. Appeal for complain also can. Check outstanding summon also can....</p>

              <p>While I accept that maybe my emotions got the better of me, I think my reaction was also fair.</p>
              <p>I am very fair to other TDs, I never potong jalan in all my years as TD. If I don't queue, I won't go park ahead of queue to try and snook pax - you see this at St James.</p>
              <p>I don't purposely overtake at traffic lights if I on Lane 2 in order to prevent a TD on Lane 3 from taking a pax flagging ahead.</p>
              <p>I always give distance, if you go slow I at Lane 2, I overtake, at least 400-500m ahead of you then if pax flagging, that want you can't say potong, both of us never saw the pax in front, this is 1st come 1st serve.</p>
              <p>But at taxi stand this 1 cannot - I think everyone agrees. You queue you must take, this 1 Changi airport you queue long long pax going to Pasir Ris, infront cab dont take, you take?</p>
              <p>Kranji and some Taxi stand this is prevalent and the result is very unfair to other TDs, as that area on non race days, is dead. Worse if you kena go near Sungei Buloh, wanna come back Kranji also very far, so must not be bullied or kena makan for things like this.</p>
              <p>I don't go bothering what other Tds do, as I said I dont concern myself with things that concern me, but if it concerns me and my rice bowl, I hv a right to defend it.</p>
              <p>If I did something like this, then I deserve to kena too. Just like I interview, that is wrong but that doesn't affect any other TD, on the street. If a pax complain then I must accept.</p>
              <p>Like I drive CDG, I know what they like, if I kena red card, I must accept because I know what they will do or expect.</p>
              <p>All we ask is fairness not just to for ourselves but other Tds.</p>

              <p>You r a good taxis driver, a good driver must also understand that on the road, there are many bad taxis drivers, some think they are the king, and some chute a pattern and not afraid of other at the back farking him, because he takes taxi driving as a battleground, it either you die or I die, his skin is as thick as the zoo elephant, you can go up and fark him. The most he just move off and ply again.</p>
              <p>To them, it is very simple, who the fark are you to tell me what to do or not to do, I flaunt the system is my problem, you r just another taxi driver, not happy just leave the Q lah, kpkb for what..that I frankly can say are  those TD mindset who like to interview at Q.</p>
              <p>And mindset is one of the most hardest thing to change, you can remove a mountain, but you can hardly change a person mindset...set already, how to change??</p>
              <p>Today you might complain this one, tomorrow fark that one..good. But every week in and out, all these are happening. Everyday you get emotional, fark here and there, end up people live long and graciously into their own age, you get heart problem due to mixing anger too much with emotion</p>
              <p>Unless you said, like our chief "Ah Q" spirit,  I fark him already I feel so shiok kind of feeling but the problem is not solve, then by all means take them on, for me, I never give a fark about these people, not worth my scolding.</p>
