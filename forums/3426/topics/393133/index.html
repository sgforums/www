              <p>I am not sure what is the market going, but I met quite a few passengers who ask for free taxi rides when we reach their destination.</p>
              <p>They either say the route taken is wrong or I taken too long or some wrong turn earlier. I always ask for preferred route and will follow unless the passenger say anything also ok, but these passengers give confusing or contradicting instructions (for example they keep saying Turn This Side Turn This Side but Dont Say Which Side or Point Direction), or they say they not sure or I am driver I should know what to do. Sometimes they give very last min instructions, its too late to turn so have to continue, then U-Turn or circle back. Sometimes I follow the route they provided, but then when we reach, they also say I drive wrong, or trying to take advantage.</p>
              <p>They usually say so just about to reach the destination, then they would say the ride costs them so much time they are now  very late or in trouble or other things. They say they are already very kind not to ask me to compensate them $50-$100, but I should be a man and not ask them to pay. When I ask is it so? They say other Taxi Drivers also make mistakes and they dont ask them to pay and this happens all the time, its very normal. Besides, a few of them said our Taxi Companies also gives free rental regularly right.</p>
              <p>On other occasions, they are a few others who jump onboard the cab with a piece of paper with the destination or can only say the destination in one or two words, if the words are not clear, I ask them  if they understand simple English, they then shake their head or continue to speak very quickly in foreign language. When I ask them to ask other people, they also shake their head and use their hands to gesture to start drive, refusing to alight. I make a guess where they are headed and they usually keep quiet until I am about to get there, then they will use hands or fingers to point left, point right or go straight. When we reach, they would see the meter and take out less money, sometimes $1, sometime a few dollars, sometimes 50%. Then when I ask them to pay in full by pointing to the meter, they shake their heads and open their hands to show they have no more money. After I accepted the payment, sometimes, some of them insist to print the receipt for them. Some of them also insist to check the receipt, to make sure its printed correctly, date, time, amount (full meter).</p>
              <p>The last group of passengers, when we reach the destination, they say they no cash (in very simple English), only cards, but when we try the cards, the payment is not successful, cannot approve. These passengers then insist they could use their card just only recently, why now cannot, it must be machine or driver fault, so not their problem. When I offer to drive them to draw cash, they insist I bring them to a nearby mrt station where the ATM is underground somewhere or when I ask further, they want to go to another nearby location where after they go out to draw, they come back saying the ATM is not working. After that again they insist they have no other money, so I shouldnt delay them and should just drop them nearby, becos the problem is the taxi company fault, not theirs.</p>
