              <p>i got some runs for this weekend for some angmors from and to all over town and other non downtown places. i dont think its gonna be one trip one pax one destination type but a mixture, maybe with stuff also. but i also dont think they need runs constantly, just certain periods but throughout a good part of the day (and likely evenings), is there any charging scheme or rough guide to refer to</p>
              <p>the only ones i heard about is usually for the limo or private transport types, but can anyone use that if theres no others, is it alright to charge like XX-YYY an hour for a minimal of ZZ hours, or something i am not sure, thanks first</p>

              <p>Following are recommended Flat Rate :</p>
              <p>Limo :</p>
              <p>Airport transfer $45 Departure $50 Arrival</p>
              <p>Hourly Booking $45 (for taxi company minimum 2 hr booking)</p>
              <p>Normal cabs (the starting meter $3 one)</p>
              <p>Airport Transfer $40/$45</p>
              <p>Hourly $35-40 (I forgot liao)</p>
              <p>Whether u wan to charge more or give discount up to u. The only thing is it must not be done via taunting or during flagdown. Eg, pple flag u down wan to go airport, you cannot charge airport transfer rate.</p>

              <p>thanks so much but i came across this too late. i thought one my seniors (limo) ever mentioned he getting 200 hr minimum 4 or something, so i quoted $120 (with no min) which i thot maybe appropriate for new bird</p>
              <p>but the ang mor fellow i liasing with heard already like boh taiji lei, no effect like that, just yes yes took note, we even set a tentative time for first pickup liao..he even commented how come quite a few those older drivers dont even want to entertain him, like give him attitude like that, or maybe they dont understand english well or what. he said the reason he asked me specifically becos from the time he boarded, i projected a very on the ball, smiling personality to him all the time..so i was like diam diam roh</p>

              <p>Huh? Wad 200 wad 120? I lost u there? 4 hrs for $120?? If u are not driving a limo, $30 per hour although too low but still ok. Take it as a lesson.</p>
              <p>I suggest u dress well on that day. Cause dressing well will give u good impression. Pple pay for looks.</p>
              <p>If got pple ask u so exp if u charge $40 the next time. Tell them it is a personalise service + u will absorb all ERP etc.</p>
              <p>I forgot to tell u, when u charge flat rate, ERP/Peak Hour rate/Booking are all inclusive. To play safe, I always tell customer I absorb up to $5 per hour of booking.</p>
              <p>Ask them give u the locations they wan to go. For value added service, u can give suggestion on what time to go where and how to go to minimise ERP and time.</p>
              <p>U should tell them to give u a SMS for pick up as u will not be parking at paid carpark and will be waiting near by. But pls ah, dun go pick up other short trip just because u know ur customer may be 1 or 2 hrs at the spot. It is both unprofessional and u are taking a gambling. Scarly they wan to leave early then u die.</p>
              <p>VERY VERY IMPORTANT,</p>
              <p>Negotiate such rates only when you are in the taxi with customer or over the phone. Do not taut on the road. U cannot charge flat rate for when customer flag u down.</p>
              <p>After a while, as you are ur own boss, you fix a rate u feel it is worth for u.</p>
              <p>O I forgot to mention, if it is after midnight and before 6am, u can add $12 more.</p>
