              <p>Its true , under the wrong hands , the sonata is a lethal weapon. Its really funny , when i was driving sonata i wasnt like tat , in fact i see wish chiat me like nothing.</p>
              <p>Now i drive wish , i can feel the frustration when these sonatas from 3rd lane cut into 1st lane with no regard for safety.</p>
              <p>The last being one cb kia at lor 33 geylang cut all the way in to pick a flagging pax and behind was a transcab crown. The crown should have been more urgent when he see the flaggin pax</p>
              <p>Pax are also one kind , they should not sit in such taxis. Will their lives be safe under this kinda fucker's hands?</p>
              <p>For me , i sure wont take.</p>

              all other vehicles and at one stretch, at least 90km/hr  and
              above on a road that only allow 60-70km/hr. This indicate both are

              road users, if you go to traffic police, aren't you yourself
              speeding?? the way each one to overtake each other show that both

              <p>@ bowah, why should i challenge a taxi to race? it doesnt makes sense. i rather pick someone my own class. besides as u can see the video, i wasnt speeding all the way this loser has been speeding up and cutting into my lane and trying to get me to hit into his rear. he is probably a accident claim hoax guy and i am just unlucky that he picked me a big suv to get his tail crashed. but lucky i have driving cam. already sent to TP , as officer has told me he will definately get his license suspended</p>

              <p><br>For me,  is just trying make inquiring of what happen before this cab start to cut in, you can call the TP, but TP will interview him too, and he will have his side of the story to tell, from the video, the journey from caltex up is speeding, both of them speeding toward those vehicles far away. Unless he is drunk or got some mental problem, I do not see why he specially pick up on you, a so called big SUV? I thot you should had horned all the way at him, if you ever use your horn?</p>
              <p>At times, while driving, I may not even know I offended someone on my blindspots, and I get middle fingers and horn all the way, I also wave and apologise when I realise that I am wrong. You might, or might not offended him earlier, that is my suspicious, but it could be wrong</p>
