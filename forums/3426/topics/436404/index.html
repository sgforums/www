              lane without signal and jammed hard brakes  causing me to jammed hard 
              brakes to avoid a collision in the video <br> ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqYjYWmnKGs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqYjYWmnKGs</a> ) provided and have  totally no regards for safety for vehicles

              <p>a true bred scumbag loser like this SHA4257A  should be banned from driving and taken off from
               the taxi registry, it has clearly shown this driver does not value 
              others life or his own life. as seen in the video the way he drives, he 
              will one day get into serious accident causing death or serious injuries
               to both other road users and his passengers. he should be taken off the
               company's registry and also banned from driving . his aggressive 
              attitude will bound to have a road rage one day.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Dear Mr Lim</span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Thank you for your email dated 16 August 
              about the driver's dangerous driving manner. We are sorry to learn that 
              both your wife and yourself were put through this.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">We would like to assure you that we view 
              good service delivery as an important corporate value and will not 
              condone any service lapses by our taxi drivers. Our taxi drivers are 
              given clear guidelines of the service expected of them. Any drivers who 
              breach the code of service will be penalised accordingly. Our 
              investigation team has investigated the matter and he has been warned 
              for failing to exercise safety on the road. He is further cautioned to 
              show consideration towards both the passengers on board and the other 
              road users. This complaint has been filed into his performance record 
              and will mointored him closely. We will not hesitate to mete out a 
              heavier penalty or cease his hiring contract should he receive a similar
               complaint.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">To ensure that our drivers adopt a 
              responsible and safe driving habit on the roads, we have put in place 
              measures to reinforce safety. These includes intensive training, speed 
              monitor to alert drivers of the speed limit, campaigns, driver's 
              dialogue session, cabby magazine and close monitoring of driver's 
              performance. </span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">We will continue to explore ways to increase

              <p>I have come across such car drivers and also TD who cut into my path while driving a car. These I take it in my stride, as the reason can be seen. They need to turn ahead, they made a mistake, or they are simply aggressive for that little advantage.</p>
              <p>But while riding a motorcycle, the case is different. Many times I kena car drivers cut into my lane for no reason at all, and then go back to their former lane. Their lane is clear, why cut infront of me and then serve back.</p>
              <p>I believe it is revenge. Some Mat cycle,or Beng Kia on a motorcycle must have offended them on the road and the driver take it out on me plodding at 60kmph on left lane.</p>
              <p>Idiotic unhappy driver taking revenge.</p>

              <p>We only hear and see from you, the part after alexandra and BMerah junction, what happen before that, we do not know, you could had offended him one way or the other before the junction, we need to seek the TD explanation for a clearer picture of what actually happen. On the other hand, from the video, both are speeding above all other vehicles and at one stretch, at least 90km/hr  and above on a road that only allow 60-70km/hr. This indicate both are challenging each other, and that both created a nuisance for other road users, if you go to traffic police, aren't you yourself speeding?? the way each one to overtake each other show that both were at odds with one another, could be due to an earlier incidents which lead to both dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the way you posted aggressively and wanted very much to get this TD out of his work, get banned and charged, shown a deep hatre inside of you because you never thot a Cabby can challenge you on the road if offended.</p>
              <p>As a TD myself, I am not protect my fellow brother here, but given no pax on my taxi, i will go into the left lane and try to look for pax and do my usual business to serve the public, unless it is during bus lane period, I will be in the second lane, and for nothing, I will not go around playing difting and challenge other car like F1 race.</p>

              <p>I do not support such driving manner, but it seem to me it is a challenge more then reckless driving. What had TS done to annoy that Taxi driver? Nevertheless, that should not be the behavior respond to other road user. The consequences is way too high over a small matter.</p>
              <p>On the road, there are too many frustrating incident, too many issues can touches our nerve. If one seat back and look at it again, it is merely a moment of few seconds to a minute of anger, life goes on thereafter.</p>
              <p>Do not be a Street Judge to give sentence, be it using violent or filing a complain. Both are causing unpredicable damages to oneself or the other, it is unjustifiable on a conscious mind over a moment of anger.</p>
              <p>Once again, i do not support the Taxi driver such driving manner.</p>

              <p>This reminds me of an incident for whihc i have posted on here before which happened to my wife and the reply we got from Comfort is also less than satisfactory..</p>
              <p>I am not trying to generalise but it seems we (my wife an di)  only have issues of driving in a reckless manner from Comfort cabs compared to other companies.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>@ bowah, why should i challenge a taxi to race? it doesnt makes sense. i rather pick someone my own class. besides as u can see the video, i wasnt speeding all the way this loser has been speeding up and cutting into my lane and trying to get me to hit into his rear. he is probably a accident claim hoax guy and i am just unlucky that he picked me a big suv to get his tail crashed. but lucky i have driving cam. already sent to TP , as officer has told me he will definately get his license suspended</p></div>
