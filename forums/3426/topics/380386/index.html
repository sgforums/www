              <p>What u think a good cabby should do , and what a cabby shouldn't do ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everydays we got paxs telling us, when on board, Uncle ..I want Fast, I am Late to the destination!!!</p>
              <p>So the other way round they are telling us to SPEED...meaning SPEEDING to fulfill their wish to reach their destination in time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My new trick, Hello... How Fast You Want to Reach Your Destination?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just two incident happen today...never ever sympathize pax on their requests, even old lady like this kind ages about near to 70.</p>
              <p>What happen?  at Tampines St 71... on board shown me a paper written by her son...Jelepang, Bukit Panjang. Poolman homeground.</p>
              <p>She asked me do you know this place?  Yes... me know. So as usual PIE BKE exit Bukit Panjang.</p>
              <p> The only probelm she requested... she wanted fast to her son place the destination. 9am on board 9.20 must reach.</p>
              <p>So I told her I (try)...She asked me again, I wanted fast. So I told her again I (try).</p>
              <p>So at PIE, she is complaining to me that I am not doing fast as I promised her I (try), she is accusing me, those on the first lane my right  vehicles are running  as fast as me, one by one already overtook me. Told her..my meter already shown 90kmh that is the speed limit permitted on this highway.I damn care.... what they doing, I only stayed what am I.... my crusing.</p>
              <p>So as taxi driver (Speeding) is not our way of life. we just earned a living...paxs like this kind really make our day bad, just because they are late and want us to beat the rule for their statisfaction to their destination in time...</p>
              <p>The final part she started to nags nags nags behind. My temperature started to headed the higher side.</p>
              <p>Knn... what you want from me? Just the less that twenty dollars trip... If you are late, next time please prepared yourself.. out early and wait for the taxi, and never ask the taxi to rush for you, you understand!!! if anything happen to this taxi in any case of accident how? i got to answer your son and me my families. Another KNN to her in hokkien to her. Than she... stopped nagging.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and I tell you this conversations is recorded in my handphone mode.</p>
              <p>New trick. Taxi driver must know. LTA coffee not aroma...lah.</p>

So at BKE the traffic is heavy, me at the centre lane...suddenly he told hey.... Taxi do faster ...I am in  hurry cause Halloween need to rush back after from the club. Time short. Pointed the finger to him at my  Sonata speedometer already 90kmh...Sir, highway sign shown (90) not (100).  OOh sorry...this is American... than do as at this speed.</p>

              <p>never alienate your pax. you never know if suddenly involved in accident, the pax won't want to be your witness. then big problem. pax 1 word better than our 1000 word composition.</p>
              <p>minor collision, if can better settle privately. goto comfort, sometimes got picture also no use. if they say 50/50, you kns liao. i last time kena, lorry reversed into my stationary sonata. no witness. got picture, but comfort say cannot prove cos the picture never show the lorry touching my sonata, got about 6 inches gap. knn i thought nab nab cos my cab stationary mah. very important ... witness. if got no need picture or video also nab nab.</p>

              <p>Second incident in the afternoon, accepted  on-call job at Pinewood Grove to American club, another similar case but this is an Ang Mo. As usual asked him which route. So at BKE the traffic is heavy, me at the centre lane...suddenly he told hey.... Taxi do faster ...I am in  hurry cause Halloween need to rush back after from the club. Time short. Pointed the finger to him at my  Sonata speedometer already 90kmh...Sir, highway sign shown (90) not (100).  OOh sorry...this is American... than do as at this speed.</p>
              <p> Poolman...what will be your definition.</p>

              <p><br>I always tell the pax this way : " Sir , i will try my best , still safety is my first priority , not only for me or my family , it's for you and your family as well ."</p>
              <p>I will add that i will speed base on the traffic condition . Like raining condition .</p>
              <p>This will make them think what i said is fair .</p>
              <p>If the road limit is 90km/h , i will speed a bit at 100-105km/h , i will not stubbornly do it at 90km/h , and i will not go beyond the excess 20km/h for overtaking speed limit .</p>
              <p>As in 105km/h is my fastest , good for him , good for me , good for TP , they can close one eye , or summon .</p>
              <p>To drive a Sonata @ 90km/h , not only killing the pax , it will kill me too .</p>
              <p>Speed a bit below 20km/h excess is ok , it must be safe la .....</p>
              <p>To drive a cab if base on principle , u wil be happy , most people will not . Flexible is better .</p>

              <p>Going into war like what Tay said , it's your attitude and motivations towards driving , not a war with other cabbies .</p>
              <p>Pls do not speed if u are cruising for paxes .</p>
              <p>Cruise reasonably .</p>
              <p>Keep left .</p>

              <p>Pls keep your taxi clean ..... especially TransCab Wish drivers , what ur tidiness and cleaniless , can really reflect the images of all TransCab Wish drivers .</p>
              <p>If one fine day , one pax said to you : " I like taking Wish , cos it's so clean ."</p>
              <p>That is the reaction from them when all of us did the same routine of keeping the taxi clean all the time .</p>
              <p>Like the SilverCab i took , so filthy and smelly , the next time i take a SilverCab , i will be really worried the same thing happened again . Smelly and filthy .</p>
