              <p>It happened during one of the saturday. It was 4.30am in the morning, and i just dropped a pax around Jurong East St 21.</p>
              <p>After coming to the main road, I was at the left lane, and joined several other empty taxis and we stopped at the traffic junction.</p>
              <p>At this moment, an elderly man was waiting at the side just after the traffic light. I could hear sound of engine.....ready to zoom off anytime when the light turns green. Several taxi at the first lane are anticipating to get that pax. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, one of the taxi at lane 2 crossed the red light and stopped beside the man. Weird, that man did not flag that taxi and soon after that taxi left.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When the light turns green, I proceed to move off, I did not expect that elderly man would flag my taxi. As I could not understand why he did not take that taxi that dashed the red light just for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was just a short trip, but this incident touches my heart.</p>
              <p>I like to see pax who are faithful and waited for the taxi that they asked to make U-turn.  </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, once in Pasir Ris. I was at the red light at street 21. A lady flag my taxi from across the road. I just nod my head and signal right, then I saw a few taxis going towards her. I told myself gone, sure to flag the other taxi but to my surprised a taxi stop just infront of her and she just stand there waiting for me to turn. So many months of driving, this is the first time such thing happen. when she board my taxi she said very near only, drive 12. Reach her place $6.60. I told her $5.00 can already.</p></div>

              <p>It was a Friday night, month end if I remember correctly. I was coming from CTE Havelock Exit towards Upper Pickering Street &gt; Church Street.  Both sides of these streets are filled with zombies (i.e. human creatures with hands stretched out for taxis...)</p>
              <p>I stopped my taxi for a couple of caucasians and turned out that they only wanted to go to Clarke Quay. So I turned into Market Street and in the process, saw a big group of youngsters queuing at the taxi stand (in front of Golden Shoe Carpark). I was thinking then... "Stupid! Everyone was outside there trying to grab a taxi and you guys are here queuing obediently..." With that, I sms'ed my buddy about the group at the taxi stand just in case he needed passengers... Afterall, it's just PNG.</p>
              <p>After my paxes alighted at Clarke Quay, I decided to go back to the taxi stand and have a look.  But, not before I put <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">[BUSY]</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>since both Upp Pickering St and Church St are still full of zombies.</p>
              <p>And sure enough, the same group of youngsters are still there queuing... However, what's puzzling is that after I stopped at the taxi stand, nobody proceeded to board my taxi.  I thought to myself... "WTF? Don't tell me they not waiting for taxi!!"  After waiting for, say, 20 secs, a very pretty lady from the group approached my taxi and gestured to me, asking whether my taxi is available.  I answered with "2 thumbs up" and she proceeded to board my taxi with another also very pretty lady.</p>
              <p>After they are properly seated and we moved off, I casually passed a remark about why none of their friends boarded my taxi even though I was waiting for about 20 secs already.  It's only then that I realized that I'm still on <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">[BUSY] </span></strong>hence they thought I'm just stopping there for someone else... LOL... I replied that I'm on <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">[BUSY] </span></strong>because I wanted to avoid the zombies along Upp Pickering St and Church St and pick them up at the Taxi Stand.  Not too nice when you are <strong><span style="color: #00ff00;">[TAXI]</span></strong><span style="color: #00ff00;"> and then ignore street paxes when they flag right?</span></p>
              <p>Now it's their turn to be puzzled and one of the chio bu asked... "Uncle, is there a specific rule that you can't picked up the street paxes?" I replied that since it's already past midnight, I'm free to pick up any street pax as long as it is not zig zag line.  That I am doing so is because I see them queuing obediently at the taxi stand and that I returned specifically for them.  I proceeded to explain that everyone was outside there trying to flag any taxi that comes along. By queuing at the taxi stand (on a Friday and past midnight as well), it will be at least 2 am before they managed to get home.</p>
              <p>Hearing this, they feel both touched and paisey... Turned out they are just poly students and currently doing industrial attachment at the banks in Raffles Place.  Really makes me wonder about the effectiveness of the education system here...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am alway touched when paxs said, "thanks for stopping for us/me" and in return, i used to reply "welcome onboard". Some ang mos are real motivators, when you reach their destination, they will said something nice, like "good job" or "well done, perfect" or kind of like "you make our day better", it kind of take me by surprise, but then it really motivate me and make my day happier. I am not implying that locals are no good, but in a way, we should learn some good points from the ang mos graciousness. Last time, I use to only tell my kids to study hard, do homework and why get 60 or 70++ marks only, then I applied what the ang mos do, said some good stuff, like "well done, could be better tho" or "good work, keep it up"..and it true that my kids are performing better now and of course, more happier.</p></div>

              It was last year Barclay Singapore Open weekend.
              â€œOn callâ€� to Sentosa Golf Club at around 0200hrs.
              Pickup two Indonesian men.
              We started to chat. They are gardeners at the club. Need to rush home and back by 0630hrs.
              
              
              
              Reached JW St 41. Pax paid the fare and as usual I printed out the receipt and handled over with the change.(a $5 note and some coins)
              One of them said, â€œNo need receipt, cannot claimâ€�. (Was wondering why donâ€™t catch some sleep at the club.)
              He slowly put them into his wallet (one glance there wasnâ€™t much juice in it) and took out a neatly folded $2 note and hand it to me.
              TD  : No need, thanks you from the bottom of my heart.  I got your fare, no need extra.
              Pax: Thank you for sending us home. Take it and go for a cup of coffee.
              TD  : Thank you, I really canâ€™t take it. You both better go home fast and catch some sleep.
              Pax:  Ha, ha, we already finished work but you are still on the road at this hour... (I refuse to accept)
              
              
              
              They both alight, one them open the front door and place the $2 note on the passenger seat and dash toward the lift lobby without turning backâ€¦.

              <p>It was raining, and I was approaching Serangoon MRT taxi stand along Serangoon road. Saw a lady in her early twenties, with a stroller. Inside the stroller, a baby deep asleep.</p>
              <p>As I stopped by the taxi stand, I was about to get out of my taxi and rendered help, but she beckon me she can handle it.</p>
              <p>She handled her baby with care and put her nicely at the back seat and buckled up the seat belt. Then she proceed to fold the stroller and load it up the boot.</p>
              <p>She spoke politely and told me the destination-Lorong Ah Soo, which is just a short trip. Upon reaching the destination, Fare is $6.40(Including peak hr/holiday s/c). She handed me $5 and 2x$2 notes. I was puzzled and immediately returned her $2, but she wanted me to keep it....., then she continue her usual drills, taking out the stroller and loading her baby all by herself.......it touches my heart......what i see is a strong-willed woman........</p>
