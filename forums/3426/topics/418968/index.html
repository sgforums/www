              <p>Who called the police?</p>
              <p>Anyway, the black sheep got away unharmed.......what is more vicious and effective is to take photo of how he cut into the queue.....but very hard to get rid of a black sheep, they are slippery as snake and can get away.......but how, all are making a living......just live and let live.....</p>
              <p>This is very common and happen in T2, while other TD queue until the flag pole, some TD just drive all the way to toilet and go toilet then join the queue. He saved more than 20mins of queueing time. So what can u do to them? Report them? Make them lose their license, how? I also dunno how.....fk la...dont queue T2 lor....so many fkers.....</p>
