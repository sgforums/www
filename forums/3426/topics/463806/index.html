              <p>1. Find a temporary relief driver for the 2 weeks period on your own/ seek company help.</p>
              <p>2.  NS Make-Up Claim</p>
              <p>What is Make-Up Pay (MUP)?<br>MUP is a reimbursement for any civilian income loss you suffered as a result of having to attend your NS training. Any NSman who is gainfully employed or self-employed is eligible to claim MUP. Please note that MUP is claimable only if there is an overlap between your civilian working hours and the NS training. Any loss of income suffered outside the duration of NS training will not be compensated by MINDEF.<br><br>NSmen’s attention is drawn to:<br>a.    Regulation 9 of the Enlistment (Loss of Salaries and Wages – Reimbursement) Regulation, 1978:<br>-    Authorised personnel from MINDEF may conduct visits to companies to verify the make-up pay claims. Employers/NSmen are requested to give access to the required documents related to the claim.<br><br>b.    Regulation 10(2) of the Enlistment (Loss of Salaries and Wages – Reimbursement) Regulation, 1978:<br>-    If there is any dispute on the decision given on MUP claim, the NSman must notify MINDEF in writing, stating the grounds of the dispute and supported by the necessary documentary evidence, not later than 3 weeks from the date on which the decision on the claim is given.<br><br>c.    Regulation 11 of the Enlistment (Loss of Salaries and Wages – Reimbursement) Regulation, 1978:<br>-    Any person who gives false or misleading information in respect of MUP claims shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding S$2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.<br><br><br><br>How do I claim MUP?<br>You can claim your MUP through online submission at NS Portal (www.ns.sg) or download the hardcopy claim forms from NS Portal and follow the instructions.<br><br>What are my claim options?<br>(A)    NSmen who are civil servants:<br><br>If you are a public servant working in Ministries and Statutory Boards, note that your employer will continue to pay your full salary for the duration of your call-up. You will then not be paid service pay and make-up pay. However, you will only be paid service pay if your call-ups are conducted entirely outside of working hours.<br><br>(B)    NSmen who are employed:<br><br>Option 1:<br>Direct Reimbursement to Employers of Claims for NS Training Scheme (DIRECT) [Optional Scheme for Employers]<br><br>Your employer continues to pay you as per your normal pay schedule and reimbursement from MINDEF will be made to your employer. In this instance, you are not required to file a claim.<br><br>*Note that this is an optional scheme for your employers, i.e. you would need to inform your employers to opt into this scheme by registering online at NS Portal (www.ns.sg)!<br><br>Option 2:<br>Payment to the NSman<br><br>You will be reimbursed directly by MINDEF once your employer certify and submit your MUP claim to MINDEF.<br><br>(C)    NSmen who are self-employed:<br><br>You can choose from the option that suits you best. Note that once an option is chosen for a particular training, it is irrevocable.<br><br>Option 1: Income Tax Option<br>Your monthly income will be calculated based on your average monthly trade (self-employment) income as shown in your Income Tax Notice of Assessment (NA) for the year of NS Training.<br><br>As your trade income for the year will not be available at the time of your claim submission, a provisional payment will be made based on your latest available trade income. Thereafter, an adjustment will be made when the trade income of the year of training is available.<br><br>In the event is there is an underpayment, arrears will be paid to you. If there should be any overpaid amount, it will be recovered from you. Overpayments may also be recovered from your subsequent MUP claims.<br><br>Your trade income for provisional payment and the final adjusted amount will be obtained directly from IRAS.<br><br>Option 2: Average Income Option<br>Your monthly income will be calculated based on your average income earned in the 6 months before the NS training.<br><br>For example, if you are a doctor or a transport driver, you can claim replacement fees incurred when you engage a replacement staff to fulfill your duties during your absence.<br><br>What is the deadline for MUP claim submission?<br>All your MUP claims should be submitted 2 weeks prior to your training commencement to ensure prompt payment. If your claim is submitted after your NS training, you will only be paid your service pay first. MUP will be paid to you after your claim is approved.<br><br>Please note that your MUP claim must be submitted within 3 months from your payment of service pay. All supporting documents can be submitted later but still within the 3 months from the payment of service pay. Thereafter, it will not be accepted.<br><br>How will I be paid?<br>All payments will be credited into your bank account number provided by you during your full-time NS or regular service. It is therefore important for you to ensure that your personal information is updated. You can update any changes on eSelf-Update at NS Portal (www.ns.sg).<br><br>If your employer is on the DIRECT Schemes and wish to change their bank account, please ensure that they log in to eServices at NS Portal (www.ns.sg) to update the company’s particulars.<br><br>Please note that if there is an overpayment of MUP due to whatever reason, MINDEF reserves the right to offset the excess quantum from your future NS payments, which may be in the form of service pay.<br><br>Payment Queries<br>If you have any queries on payment, you can get assistance from the following:<br><br>Online: NS Portal (www.ns.sg)<br>Email: contact@ns.sg<br>Hotline: 1800-367 6767 (1800-eNSNSNS)<br>Fax: 6373 1464 (For employed claims)<br>        6373 1499 (For self-employed claims)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also just went for ICT. Just email your taxi company and tell them you got ICT then they will email you a letter stating that you are a hirer with them and your daily rental amount. Then forward this letter to mindef when you submit the make up pay. This is to claim the rental.  As for the income i choose the average income option and i put 100 per day only. They didnt asked for any documents. But got approved and received the pay 2 days after my ICT starts. But i still drive at night coz my ICT is 8-5 type.  Hope this helps...good luck in your ICT.</div>

              <p>Safer is to just declared using 2 years average, as we know, TD tends to declare lower to avoid paying income tax..........</p>
