              Fewer people taking taxis in Singapore?
              Passenger numbers have dropped as a result of the recent taxi fare revision, said Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew in Parliament on Tuesday.
              According to a report by Channel NewsAsia, Lui said that there were more taxis on the roads after the peak surcharge period was adjusted. 
              Waiting times have also been shortened from nine to five minutes in the city area, while waiting time outside of the city was reduced from four to two-and-a-half minutes, the report said.
              CNA also said that Lui rubbished claims that ComfortDelGroâ€™s market share of 58 per cent constituted market dominance, and that the ministry had no plans to regulate taxi fares.
              He pointed out that Comfortâ€™s market share dropped from 86 per cent in 2003 with the introduction of more taxi companies.
              As it stands, there are now seven taxi companies in Singapore, as opposed to only three before the deregulation in 2003.
              Taxi companies here recently introduced a fare revision, as well as extending the evening peak period for taxis from 5pm to 8pm previously, to 6pm to midnight, which was criticised by some MPs in Parliament.
              In a video clip on CNA from his speech in Parliament, the Transport Minister said, â€œWith the peak period in the past ending at 8pm, there was a lot of feedback on the difficulty in getting a taxi, including through call bookings. Thatâ€™s the reason why taxi companies, starting with ComfortDelGro, decided on the need to extend the peak surcharge period.â€�

              <p>Not entirely true. People like me now think 8-12 not drive for peanuts, drive longer lor. Getting hungry people to do the job is not always the solution. Sometimes just feed them well. Well-provided for dogs perform better. Starved dogs? Starve until they cannot take it will turn and eat the owner. And I say again. At least now 8-12 not drive for nothing one!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly i empathise with commuters that really need transport (of course not the regular assholes). TDs are still underpaid though fares are not exactly cheap for Singaporeans. But before Singaporeans wake up their bloody idea and all understand wages have been suppressed to bare minimal for all. All will have to bear with higher cost until the 60% wake up. Knn as TD read comments by Lee HL about "we cannot benchmark with other countries for minister pay" Damn tulan. Then commoners leh?!</p>
              <p><br>Some TDs refuse $5-6 trips after waiting 30 mins. What to do? Losing business who want to do?Rental who pay? 2 solution. Make the price right, every TD also take. Or, Singapore style, hire dogs to make sure we eat shit.</p>

              <p>I tried to get a cab to work at 645am this morning at Bukit
              Panjang but most were taken up or there were no cabs at all.But as
              long as there are still buses and MRT available,I will not

              <p>My wife and I visit my parents in Tiong Bahru every
              Sunday and we usually take a cab home to Bukit Panjang.Before the
              price increase,it cost around 13 bucks but after the prices went
              up,we had to pay about 17 bucks instead...So I am avoiding
              cabs as much as possible. Rather rent a car to go house
              visiting this CNY than taking cabs.</p>

              <p>I fectched a passenger and he mentioned that this time the fare hike is a joke. It shd be the booking fees that shd be raise instead of the fare meter. He knows that now the booking will be less ppl to press.....</p>
              <p>I think the current fare hikes will have to last at least for another few years or decade before things can be change.....</p>
