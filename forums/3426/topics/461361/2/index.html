              <p><br>As I said before, OTR, there are many stunts, and of course with about 20,000 taxis alway on the road, at every 1 min, you see at least one taxis to 5 taxis, and most of us are plying on the road to earn a living, naturally, somewhere, somehow, even as good as you are, in your early days or even today, you will do a illegal U turn somewhere in a remote places, some, learnt the hard ways because they got summoned or own fault accident and paid until trouser drop.</p>
              <p>Therefore what you see, is alway taxis, 3 accidents, touch wood, one will be taxis, 3 get fined, one will be taxis, 3 stunts on the road, I will be taxis, public complain about motorists, 1 out of 3 will be regarding about taxis, so you see, you cannot run away from the public eyes, even the most breakdown is taxis.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, taxis driving come from all walk of lifes, some bankers to bangers, some rich to poor, some pass time, some in debt, some ah seng and some like me bowah here and there, multi jobs, jack of all trade, but master of done. And as expected, there will be stunts from ah bengs, ah sengs and ah pui or ah san.</p>
              <p>As we are alway within the scrutiny of the public beside MRT, let us be more conscious of ourselves in whatever we are protraying to the public, I would not give a damn if someone is to show a stunt of a pte car or casket van, but I will be of concern if someone keep showing stunts of TDs, because this is a public forum, many viewed but not much posted.</p>
              <p>And if we keep videoing our bad of TDs, we are not doing much flavor to ourselves, the only likelihood is the public will view it as..Knn, Taxis drivers anyhow drive one, becareful of them, these LC kia also post video of their own stunts, alway them.</p>

              <p>TD, day in and day out talk only within it circles of comfort zones, from cdg to silver to tc to so on and on. But if they will to climb the well and look a the bigger scenery, perhap they might find opportunity beyong TD alone.</p>
              <p>Risk there might be to venture far or away from TD, those in early 30s or 40s, should give yourself a relook into your opportunities and choices in earning a living, but if you keep thinking that oh, less paid or lots of foreigners, unable to cope with others, then nobody can change that mind which is already set. And as time goes by, you opportunities and chances detoriate with the age.</p>
              <p>There is nothing to loose in TD, you learned the skill and experiences in handling peoples, you can also make a return if thing do not goes well, but base on your experiences and skills in whatever trades you had gone thru, it could perhap be better use in other service industrial for the good of your future and the economy.</p>
