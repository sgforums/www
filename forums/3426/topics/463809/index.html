              Putting the brakes on speedsters
              Tenders called for system that will measure vehicle speeds over a distance
              by Woo Sian Boon 04:45 AM Jan 03, 2013
              
              
              SINGAPORE - Sharp-eyed speedsters who slam on the brakes when they spot a speed camera may soon not escape a ticket, if a new speed enforcement system due to go on trial is eventually implemented.
              
              The "average speed enforcement system", according to tender documents the police put up on the Government electronic procurement portal on Dec 19, will measure vehicle speeds over a distance to nab speeding motorists. 
              
              This means that errant motorists cannot slow down just before or speed up right after speed cameras to evade the law, as they do now with the "point-based static speed enforcement system". 
              
              The new system will be tested out along the Pan-Island Expressway and Changi Coast Road for at least a month, according to the tender documents. 
              
              Changi Coast Road, in particular, is a well-known black spot. In May last year, a cyclist was killed after being hit by a lorry, which only came to a halt about 200m away, according to reports.
              
              According to the tender documents, the police noted that other jurisdictions have in recent years started implementing speed enforcement systems that measure the average speed of vehicles over a predefined distance.
              
              For example, several Australian states have implemented these since 2001. In New South Wales, there are 25 point-to-point speed cameras installed along the various highways specifically targeting heavy vehicles.
              
              "(The Singapore Police Force) intends to conduct a trial to evaluate the suitability of such systems for implementation in Singapore," the tender documents said. 
              
              The average speed enforcement system works by recording the time a vehicle takes to travel between two points to calculate its average speed.
              
              Speed detectors placed at the start and end points - to be determined in consultation with the Land Transport Authority - will record the timestamp and vehicle licence plates. Speed limits here range from 40kmh on smaller roads to 90kmh on expressways.
              
              In the last three years, the number of speeding violations here has surged. Between January and November last year, the Traffic Police booked nearly 225,000 motorists for speeding - a daily average of 673 offences. In 2011, the figure for the whole year was 225,500, or 617 daily, compared to 205,000 cases in 2010.
              
              Over the years, the police have deployed speed cameras at more locations. In 2008, there were speed cameras along 38 roads. This has risen to 53 roads now.
              
              Red-light camera system to go digital?
              by Woo Sian Boon
              In a separate tender issued last month, the Traffic Police also called for the implementation of a "Digital Traffic Red Light System".
              
              The new system must be able to capture and store digital images of motorists who beat red lights. These will then be sent to a backend computer system to be used as evidence, according to tender documents.
              
              Currently, the red-light camera systems here still use film.
              
              Just last week, a video clip of a motorcyclist hitting a woman pedestrian after beating a red light along Woodlands Avenue 6 went viral online. The footage was captured on the in-car camera of a motorist.
              
              Last year, there were 16,442 red-light violations between January and November. And in the previous year, there were 17,490 such cases, a shade higher than the 17,180 in 2010. WOO SIAN BOON
