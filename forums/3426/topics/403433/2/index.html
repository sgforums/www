              Well im seperated, no kids, no house, no life.....</p>
              <p>My GF tell me to earn money rather than see me at home shake

              survive with this amount if have family.</p>
              <p>So i decide to chiong when i can to at least buy 3/4 rm flat, or

              <p>Xiong is ok for me, being a relief is also xiong cos holding 2

              <p>i read here that sun, mon, tue, thur after 12mn is like ghost
              town, so i guess the money is before midnite, which as a hirer i
              can choose the time to drive.</p>
              <p>Truthfully. if TD can earn decent income, no office politics, no
              Mgr to carry balls, than i am ok with my career as TD.</p>

              <p>trust me, normal TD dun earn so much...average $2.5k only cause there are some cost such as medisave contribution. Remember TD earnings fluctuate during different season, final exam time sure die ..................</p>
              <p>If I have the choice, I will go back to advertising line in the operation side. But then....sigh long story...............</p>

              <p>Most were on one of the blokes who set up a new IT , supposedly doing very well. many questions were thrown to him and he was basking under the attention.</p>

              <p>Very sad but this is true in our society.</p>
              <p>I heard a true story where a Comfort TD went to a furniture store to shop after work. When the saleman approach and saw the company logo on his shirt pocket, he walks away without serving him.</p>
              <p>He was furious and left for home. After changing to civilian clothing, he went to that store again. He was served but I don't know whether it's the same saleman.</p>
              <p>That's why like I've said before, even prostitute is one class higher than TD. Sigh.</p>
