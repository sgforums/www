I straight lock doors no pick, then drove off. I will go take keys again if I am to hit another wall in my life. Consider I'm taking a long break. But those that love cars I recommend skoda. Brilliant handling, superb engine, excellent build quality and free maintenance on a conti car. Last batch, disappearing soon. I am sure most know by now, it's an Audi A4.

The thing with Merc, they tend to 'soften' many things on their base model versions. overly assisted steering numbs the feedback. Which is why Merc had successfully marketed their cars to old folks over the years, while their flagship sports cars excel in racing, the road versions often lag behing BMW and Audi.</p></div>

              <p>But sometimes even how good the car, it depends on the driver.</p>
              <p>My current crown is terok, alignment out and must be careful about bends and bumps, yet I can drive it and adjust to it's eccentricities.</p>
              <p>In fact I am much better at older vehicles, in my other jobs before taxi driving, my bosses sometimes ask me to drive the older cars, because I know how to handle them and make them last otr longer until the scrap period approaches.</p>
              <p>Plus drive old cars, no pressure, small dents here and there will be ignored, if you drive a brand new one, little bit kena, got a lot of answering. </p>
              <p>I think why Mercs and other better models aren't used here has to do with pricing. In Europe you see very good cars doubling as taxis. Here because of COE, PARF, ARF, ERP +++, many taxi drivers will baulk at paying higher rentals for these cars.</p>
              <p>That's why we have gone Korean now by and large, I won't be surprised if we go Chinese in the near future, once the Chinese car industry produces better cars.</p>

              <p>But sometimes even how good the car, it depends on the
              driver.</p>
              <p>My current crown is terok, alignment out and must be careful
              about bends and bumps, yet I can drive it and adjust to it's
              eccentricities.</p>
              <p>In fact I am much better at older vehicles, in my other jobs
              before taxi driving, my bosses sometimes ask me to drive the older
              cars, because I know how to handle them and make them last otr
              longer until the scrap period approaches.</p>
              <p>Plus drive old cars, no pressure, small dents here and there
              will be ignored, if you drive a brand new one, little bit kena, got
              a lot of answering. </p>
              <p>I think why Mercs and other better models aren't used here has
              to do with pricing. In Europe you see very good cars doubling as
              taxis. Here because of COE, PARF, ARF, ERP +++, many taxi drivers
              will baulk at paying higher rentals for these cars.</p>
              <p>That's why we have gone Korean now by and large, I won't be
              surprised if we go Chinese in the near future, once the Chinese car
              industry produces better cars.</p>

              <p>I am enthusiastic about driving more than the make of the car.</p>
              <p>Whenever I ferry my Pax, it gives me pleasure to know that they are doing things as if they are in a waiting lounge.</p>
              <p>Meaning that their Riding Experience is very smooth.</p>
              <p>Along the same idea as JoeRaj, if you give me a car that is not too 'teruk', I believe I will control it until you get a smooth ride.</p>
              <p>There is something I dont understand about some drivers.</p>
              <p>- why they like to use the brakes excessively. Move, brakes, move, brakes,... and there is no vehicle in front blocking.</p>

              <p>Bro care to share about the skoda rental and benefits from
              Premier? Got contract? Deposit? How's the condition of the car and

              <p>Condition damn good. Continental car temper. Usual headlights fail frequent and other irritating stuffs (but hey maintenence they bao remember?). Those used to Japanese reliability may not take it. But never broke down on me before. I go servicing chit chat with other Skoda TD, many hard core hirer die die dun let go one. Brakes wear fast due to excessive weight of car. Consumption is fantastic based on the car's power (V engine more balance than in-line) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsTqGa2gd0E</p>
              <p>last time crown i pump $50-60 for 300km. Skoda $40-50. Very obvious much lower than crown. Rental $105, deposit $1000. But we all know a bit more challenging to make $$ than blue/yellow cab.</p>

              <p>agree. Drivers that brake excessively either have poor judgement or poor attitude.</p>

              <p>Ya thinking of. Cos very tulan they dun want to change new Mercs for me. I dun mind paying $30 more to drive new car. But since cannot then I might as well downgrade to a cheaper ride. Anyway since I started working I damn slack. So thinking of lowering my overheads. Heeeheee</p>
