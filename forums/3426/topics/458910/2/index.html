              <p>Traffic wardens become punching bags as abuse on the rise
                       Singapore | Updated today at 12:34 PM

              Mr Pannirselvam Muthusamy has had hot noodles thrown in his face and he has been punched in the ribs. He gets sworn at almost every day. This is the life of the enforcement officer for parking and traffic offences, because his job is to issue summonses to motorists who flout parking and other traffic rules.
                      Though only six months in the job, Mr Pannirselvam is already involved in three ongoing police cases of abuse by motorists. His plight is shared by many others doing the same job.
                      Certis Cisco, Mr Pannirselvam's employer, told The Sunday Times that the number of cases where members of the public have abused traffic wardens physically or verbally has been creeping up. This is aside from almost routine encounters, when motorists get angry when issued a summons.
                      Traffic wardens said that some drivers would crush the summons, or turn on their vehicles' windscreen wipers to get rid of it, or hurl it back at the officers.</p>

              <p>Tell Muthu and Selvam to change to drive Taxis, then you can get wine bottle knock on the head, whack by other car, beaten up by drunken ang mo or paxs, shouted and scolded by local aunties or cheapo paxs..summon from warden even going for a pee, I mean every job has it own downside, it you want to take it, so be it, take it at face value, nobody like summon, not even a rich person.</p>

              <p>NTA is a product of all the 7 Taxis companies and authorities creation, within the taxis communities, they get a senior joker to be the chairperson with those followers uncles as treasurer or some committees.</p>
              <p>And since it is a product of the govt and taxis companies, whose interest do you think they will be more focus?</p>
              <p>Choose the below 2 correct answer,</p>
              <p>A)You, the taxi driver</p>
              <p>B)the taxis companies or</p>
              <p>C)the govt.</p>
              <p> I believe you should be able to take your picks correctly.</p>
              <p>The taxis companies and govt wanted to set a complaining dept for TD, and also to provide some welfare benefits to encourage membership, so inorder to save their HR cost, dept cost and wage cost, they form the NTA, which each member have to pay $9 per month. Now in any taxis company, you can find a customer/pax complaint dept, or so called customer service dept, for TD, they leave it to NTA.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, having an Association, govt also know that at least there is a point of focus, and that TD being a member will be less rebellious and listen to the association, the psychological part is term as " a sense of belonging".</p>

              <p>Bro, I think we problem in this industry...this problem comes from high rental cost which makes us speed, be selective in ending destination and also dun wan to wait for late customer.</p>
              <p>And this problem translate into passenger frustration.</p>
              <p>Coz we cannot earn enough after cover the rental and petrol if we go all destination, wait for late customer all the time and drive slow.</p>
              <p>ultimately we need to survive.</p>
              <p>If the exisitng rental is reduced by 50%, there would not be all this problem.</p>
