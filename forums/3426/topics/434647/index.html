              i just only started out, now driving super relief for only a few days.
              lucky from very early, my hirer ask we install car video cam.
              
              tonight, when i was exiting from the zoo road onto mandai, i was behind a big suv.
              suddenly that suv reverse back and hit my front. 
              
              that suv driver is arab and his suv is rented. he claim he could not even see my car behind! then he wanted to drive away but i blocked him. we waited very long for police to come. but the funny thing is police refuse to do anything because they say its TP matter! when my 3 passengers wanted to offer to make statement on the spot that they witness its the suv fault it reverse, the police even highlighted to them repeatedly that its totally not necessary to make  any statement or even give any particulars, the police keep telling them its within their right not to do so so its all up to them and they are free to go anytime! that suv driver even want to chat up my 3 passengers! what is this?!
              
              when the suv driver car rent company people come, they themselves also want to turn the story into hit and run..but its me! but that suv driver continue to admit his fault, because i think he saw the car video cam when he came back to my window. but his rent car company people told him its perfectly ok to drive off, just ignore me, they will settle with my company.
              
              luckily i went back early just to check the car video cam it did really record what happend, so now i can breathe. so i very strongly suggest, anyone whos driving or like me starting to drive, please go and install a car video cam immediately or asap. it can really save your backside when you encounter idiots.

              most people will never listen to advice, but these same people will take time to read about bad news, no matter how small.

              <p>This accident happen because you are very near to the SUV.</p>
              <p>If you have kept a safe stopping distance, you will have ample time to warn the SUV.</p>
              <p>A safe stopping distance would be that you are able to see the rear tyres of the car in front of you.</p>
              <p>I see many drivers like to stop very near to the car in front and I believed that you have stop very near to the SUV.</p>
              <p>So what if you have the camera?</p>
              <p>So what if you are right?</p>
              <p>At the end, you trouble yourself with all these unnecessary inconvenience.</p>
              <p>All these accidents are avoidable if you have practise defensive driving skills.</p>

              @mercabs, thank for taking my advice
              
              @poolman, you're the man, yes great idea!
              
              @loor, thanks for the concern i feel it. that driver claim he was reversing because he went the wrong way. he also claim he didnt even see anything at his back at the point hes started  reversing so he step hard to accelerate immediately after changing gear, theres no time to respond to brake even i was safe distance away..but the video showed clearly exactly what i put in my report, but the way his car rent company people behaved that night, it seems they have other ideas. after seeing the video my company people confirm that driver didnt even check rear view and put 100% claim on the other side in the official papers and told me from their experience this case is one of the more rock solid ones they came across. the question is how hard the other side is going to make it for themselves only..

              <p>Certainly, having a cam in car is good, especially in our daily driving job, but more importantly, try not get involve in an accident, for me, as defensively trained, any vehicle that I see got a reverse light on in front of me, my HONK will be press all the way, my gear will be in reverse, focus and alert is important, if tire, rest awhile. Even if you are right, once kenna accident, you got no mood to drive, your day will be lousy, big hit, go into long repairs, small dented hit will have to wait, and all this time, you will be driving with a dented front or side, which gives an impression that you are accident bound drivers, everyone also want to go out driving safe and sound in a nice vehicle.</p>

              thanks, to be able to say until so steady, i dream you must be perfect driving record.
              
              i too must be lucky i just started super relief just driving for a try, not in a hurry like you sound stress to earn a living back for your family. my hirer said my company informed him they are discounting the down time and same time compensation for loss of income. the technical side already confirm to him any parts with marks and even minor problem will be replaced along the thorough servicing following, not the usual general servicing. but now after you double confirm, i feel relieve i indeed gotten a really experienced hirer that is like you, not only can think of everything but also follow through nicely. i am looking forward to seeing the car again in its new condition afterwards,even though i know its still not really my car at the end of the day :(

              <p>So because you have the video you will be okay right? Don't have to pay? Or is it still under dispute?</p>
              <p>By law, the person who is reversing is at fault in most cases....and definitely in this one too from your description. Safety distance or not, it is the responsibility of the person reversing to make sure it is safe to do so.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks so much loor. yesterday go down make report the officer on the spot already confirm base on the video yes on our papers very clear 100% not at fault, dont have to come out anything and still can get compenstae . my hirer just today double confirm again with another officer and the technical chief that is overseeing the insurance survey and whole thorough servicing. they say must be god bless to have video just a couple days earlier, but like i said before, as for the other side papers, the officer yeserday did mention the last remaining question is how hard the other side is going to make it for themselves only..(after seeing the video)</div>

              the car is back! thanks all and specially to bowah
              
              you are spot on accurate! but my hirer didnt even instruct the technical staff where to re-do, its like the technical head already told them what to do thoroughly..now its like brand new out of factory shiny! i was shocked, no dents, no marks, no sign of anything, completely mint, i suspect they either remodel then respray a lot or replace with a lot new parts. i cannot tell which because the color and shading very universal, almost everything equally shiny and new looking. test drive a bit, i think they even did something with the engine, retune it sounds so much quieter and the gear more responive. my hirer say the fuel efficiency also improve, the number of KMs go up a bit more but dare not confirm exactly how much now too early. i am still very sruprise they do such a good job, maybe like my hirer says they do very thorough servicing job when they find out sure 100% not at fault can claim, he wish everytime servicing also like this! even the staff doing the accident reporting and claims smiling all the time..wa really very lucky got that video cam. anyone interest not :p
