              <p>Thanks for starting this thread, I was about to comment on the COE. WHY ARE PEOPLE SO RICH? $56+k for the entitlement to buy a car, and this value will turn to zero in 10 years.So desperate to drive? Or just simply too much money to burn?</p>
              <p>I know that there are limited space in Singapore roads due to the 5million population, so driving will become a luxury. But is eveyone really earning so much? My pay no enuf...very jealous of the rich. Must buy more ToTo tickets today!</p>

              <p>Taxi company uses the high COE as a excuse to tag their rental rate higher, as long the take up rate is there, it will continue.</p>
              <p>THe Supply + Demand = Price theory</p>
              <p>i will not sign up for new car (taxi) at $11x per day rental, it only highlight to the management the acceptance level and possibilities of increasing the older car rental.</p>
              <p>eg.</p>
              <p>When the take up rate is good at $11x per day and TD are getting use to this amount, those $8X rental seems too cheap and a raise to a slightly below $100 can become acceptable and "reasonable". So down the line, all TD will be effected.</p>
              <p>So the best is boycott the $11x rental rate, let the management know that this amount is far from acceptance level.</p>
              <p>Anyway, TD cost are way too high presently. At $11x per day + Petrol, one got to drive solid 7 to 8 hours a day to cover cost if lucky, how many more hours can we drive for our living thereafter, everyday basis.</p>

              <p>we need to be able to visualise the common tactic use, do not fall into the traps.</p>
              <p>Capitalist will, by default, maximize the revenue from the peasant level. At the advantage position they are standing, they will plan, control or even decieve to meet their goal. That is why a Goverment intervention is importance to neturalize such situation.</p>

              <p>there are, forever have plan to increase our rental. This is

              <p>Capitalist will, by default, maximize the revenue from the
              peasant level. At the advantage position they are standing, they
              will plan, control or even decieve to meet their goal. That is why

              <p>But in Singapore................................... it's
              political issue, i should stop.</p>
              <p>Boycott those $11x rental, tell your friends, relative and

              <p>Thanks for starting this thread, I was about to comment on the
              COE. WHY ARE PEOPLE SO RICH? $56+k for the entitlement to buy a
              car, and this value will turn to zero in 10 years.So desperate to
              drive? Or just simply too much money to burn?</p>
              <p>I know that there are limited space in Singapore roads due to
              the 5million population, so driving will become a luxury. But is
              eveyone really earning so much? My pay no enuf...very jealous of
              the rich. Must buy more ToTo tickets today!</p>

              <p>My opinion is that the COE for this year is pretty limited . Per exercise i think theres only like 200 in one cat up for grabs compared to 2000 beginning of last year.</p>
              <p>So with limited COEs , prices skyrocket . Its not that difficult to find 200 rich bastards who will buy audis , mercs , bmws at current prices.</p>
              <p>Look at those SKC , SKD plate cars and u will notice they are mostly conti makes . Cars in the range of $250,000 onwards, what is coe to this pple?</p>

              <p>They know that Taxi Driver are not unify, acting indivisually. </p>
              <p>They pressure a bit the front with the people behind, the people infront will sign up thinking like what you mention, then when the people infront signed, those people behind will think that it is a right choice, and sign up too.</p>
              <p>Tell her straight, loudly to ensure all can hear (louder then her, you know her voice rather loud), "Siow ah, if your husband driving a Taxi at $115 rental, you will divorce him", "i wait for the Wish with $665 incentive". </p>
              <p>We just need to do our part, behind will follow.</p>

              <p>The future luxury goods in singapore are only for the rich and famous, the rest can take MRT, Buses and Cabs. That is what our govt wanted. To see more Mercs, BM, Bently, Ferrari, lambor than just subaru, honda or toyota</p>
