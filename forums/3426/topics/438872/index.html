              <p>Hello Taxi Uncles</p>
              <p>Just want to check something with you guys... I drove past a traffic junction when the light was about to turn red. I am not sure whether I beat the traffic light. But the thing is there is supposedly no red light camera for that junction...</p>
              <p>However, when I drove further up, I saw a red light camera flashing (Twice). This red light camera is for the traffic junction ahead of the traffic junction that I just crossed.</p>
              <p>Could it be possible that this camera captured my car's image? Or it is not possible since each traffic light camera is dedicated for each junction? If the camera captures the image, it should capture both front and rear plate right? But I havent even crossed the camera. Do you all think I got caught? Or it just happens tat the camera captured another car's image?</p>
              <p>Thanks for answering.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Hoto,from your description,it is not very clear.If you add in that at which road &amp; traffic junction,it would be better for the "senior investigator" in this forum to help you with the case.I know how you feel,as i been through this before.Every night go home first thing open letter box to check if TP letter come or go LTA website to check if "kanna" summon.People do make mistakes,and some mistake is costly and some escaped with it.So the best is to always &amp; remind yourself to pratice defensive driving to do our part on the road to ensure safety for yoursef and other public road user.Good luck!</div>

Jialat, I proceed a bit further to the right at a traffic light junction waiting for the right arrow to show. I dont know whether I gonna caught or not as this two traffic light was so near. And when I drove past the traffic light and stop it at the next traffic light , at that point, there was no flashing light at all.</p>

              <p>As long as there is no flashing of light, no camera taken, uncle me kenna 2 times in my driving, one at jurong west ave 1 turning into ave 42, one at lornie going into adam flyover toward farrer. 12 points + $200, no suspension, even for 24 months, you hit 24 points, you still can drive, but cannot make another mistake, the points are concurrent, meaning today u get 12 points, if will start from now till oct 2013 and if you get  another12 points on april 2012, it will go into april 2014, and within this overlapping from april 2012 to oct 2013, if you exceed the dermit points, then you go into suspension.</p>
              <p>The flashing light is very bright, you will sure notice it, when u first cross the whitle line into the yellow box and the traffic light is amber, you are safe, no camera will take it, but if you cross the first white line and the traffic light is red, it will will flash.</p>
              <p>For TS case, as the light is going to turn red, most probably, no picture is taken. FYI, some traffic camera are not maintained and might be spoil, nevertheless, it main purpose is to stop people from beating the red light, without it, more accidents may have happen.</p>
              <p>If you go to orchard road, you notice those light on the shopping centre flashing, the one at the junction of claymore and orchard got me fooled, I dashed across during amber light and a flash was there, I stopped, get down, then notice that the flash is from the shopping centres, knn...becareful better.</p>

              <p>if you cannot see the red light, that mean you are following too close (tailgating). if got evidence, they will charge you for another offence committed. i think this one you are at fault.</p>

              <p><br>That is a 11 footer container driving at a top speed of a container, naturally i was going to turn into PIE toward Changi, I will keep to the left and follow it at least 2 cars space, it was after a heavy downpour, I will not go near the container because of the splashing of dirty water into my windscreen, it crossed the traffic junction, i followed behind, thot is was green, the motorbike on my right also cross, but he was faster, about half way, the camera snapped, Zapp! zapp! twice.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that was sometime ago, after I had paid my fine, the officer (two crap, equivalent to a colonel) that I appealed, asked me to go into his office, this time, he was more nice and friendlier than the initial part, he told me, Uncle, to convince you, i let you see the photos, he bought up the photos from his drawer, hardcopy, look like a 12 megapixel type, very clear, the container rear tail was visible, the motorbike is gone, I was there, smiling somemore with pax to changi airport, first photo on car and people inside, second photo show the nos plate very clearly, it is split 0.0001s shutter speed, i think so. I asked the so called assist supt, why you need to take my photo and my pax face, he said, alots of people like to use other people licence like their wife or friend to deviate their demerit points from them, this is a serious offence, money is not a problem to most rich people here, it is the points that they are worried. Any one using another person licence in a traffic offence to offset demerit points will be jail and fine seriously. In the end, he said, Uncle, I understand you make a living on TD, but do be careful, the laws is blindfolded.</p>
