              <p>Bro poolman,</p>
              <p>No worry lah, my knowledge of Singapore roads quite ok wan, of course not those small roads lah, if those roads dun know still can see road directory or follow gps.</p>
              <p>In the course of my life, I stayed in 6 different locations, namely Katong, Toa Payoh, Bt Merah, AMK, Bt Panjang n now CCK, my 7 siblings n my wife 7 siblings and all my relatives stay all over the island n I m driving all these years, so Singapore roads basically no problem to me wan.</p>

              <p>Nice talking to u, wow!! I m truly n greatly impressed with your kind selfless humble sharing n intellect.</p>
              <p>I really look forward to the next gathering to get to know all 'bros-in-arms" here. hahaha  I like the sayings "Birds of the same feather, flock together", taking care of each other, got $$$, earn together, unity is strength.</p>
              <p>Paisei...paisei... it is my in-born character lah... kancheong.. worrisome...anxious type, hope can be a good cabby with all the guidance n help from all lau chiow here, I need to earn as much as I can to clear my bank loans, no choice lor.</p>
              <p>Now trying to learn as much as I can from browsing thru from last page backwards (thus why I knew about all thos BBOs n gatherings)  towards the 1st pg, reading from past to present, now still at pg 38 plus always read 1st page to keep myself updated about current postings.</p>

              <p>I am not too sure if some soon-to-be TDs is suitable to hold a walkie when they are new on the road.</p>
              <p>There are so many postings here and there from kancheong newbie TDs who read so much about LV in this forum that they want to jump right in from the moment they start driving.</p>
              <p>I mean when you are new plus the fact that there are so many distractions on the road, the walkie will be more of a hindrance than assistance.</p>
              <p>Imho, I hope newbies would go out and explore your new surroundings.</p>
              <p>Make changes as your day goes and get a rhythm of your driving patterns.</p>
              <p>Btw, I read that some newbies drive to service or clear their debts.</p>
              <p>Do you know you will be burden with additional debt even before you drive with a walkie?</p>
              <p>LV membership $30/month (which is 1 of the most expensive membership fee in town) plus max $12/month call charge</p>
              <p>Grid basic plan $28/month min subscription</p>
              <p>So it is at least $70 excl gst additional debt per month.</p>
              <p>But make sure you don't talk too much on the group otherwise you could be paying something close to $100/month.</p>

              <p>Thank for the info, this is something I need. That is why I need to find out it is feasible to join as a LV member. I am driving night shift and I need to find out if there is call, let say between 1am to 4am so that I will need not to roam around to hunt for pax. Be it AP to the 4's kang or ah wood. so long I have pax in my cab.</p>
              <p>Although I only been a cabby for 3 nights, it is never easy. And comparing with my friend who also just started driving as OMO. I felt so fortunate that I listen to the Bros here to start with a relief. When I have more time to rest and off days but our earning is about the same.</p>

              <p>Bro, why so negative? To be fair there are other benefits for newbie holding a talkie, like listening to airport info, traffic conditions, Pick N Go locations, etc (although I am not sure how much of these info was shared in LV talkie group).</p>

              <p>I have to agree with Mercab to a certain extend, newbies are suppose to get use to OTR driving skill before they can embark on knowledge and further their experiences. The skill to drive as a TD is different from driving private car, you hv to be quick and nimble and yet cannot disturb other like cutting into their lane or jump Q so on. You did to know where are the Taxis stands at the CBD, the buildings, the airport timing, the planes shutter landing time, the zombies and non zombies period and so on. But these are all knowledges, as you go it turn to wisdom and experiences, not skill, skill is how you drive and control your vehicle, how to step and stop or move gracefully and most important, how to avoid collision.</p>

              <p>Bro, LV talkie is not like our talkie group.</p>
              <p>Infos share is so limited. It will not be as precise as what we hear on our set.</p>
              <p>Futhermore, if you hog the airtime, you get #@*&amp;% by the members.</p>
              <p>On quiet time, the talkie is as good as dead (no sound).</p>
              <p>So do your math, just for some infos and pay at least $58/month excl call charges &amp; gst.</p>
              <p>If you drive CDG during day, I believe you will get more calls from CDG than LV.</p>

              <p>2nd not so lucky. Bang into a Lexus $1500 settle</p>
              <p>I had offered him my talkie to him for infos. He told me he is worried that he may be distracted so decline my offer.</p>

              <p>Thank for the info, this is something I need. That is why I need
              to find out it is feasible to join as a LV member. I am driving
              night shift and I need to find out if there is call, let say
              between 1am to 4am so that I will need not to roam around to hunt
              for pax. Be it AP to the 4's kang or ah wood. so long I have pax in
              my cab.</p>
              <p>Although I only been a cabby for 3 nights, it is never easy. And
              comparing with my friend who also just started driving as OMO. I
              felt so fortunate that I listen to the Bros here to start with a
              relief. When I have more time to rest and off days but our earning
              is about the same.</p>
