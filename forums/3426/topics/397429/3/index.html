              <p>I don't think it's a good idea to use "webs.com". Look at the
                          top of the main page. You are putting LV in direct competition with
                          others providing virtually the same kind of business. Every time
                          people goes to that page, they will see one of the maxicab/limo
                          service advertisement. You are indirectly saying to the pax "Thank
                          you for visiting us but please also take a look at our competitor's
                          offer."</p>
              <p>A company web site with competitor's advertisement is a big
                          NO-NO.</p>
              <p>Even if want to use the "webs.com", still no need to transfer
                          domain to "webs.com" one. Just change some settings with DNS at
                          name.com will do.</p>
              <p>Ownership of domain name is one thing, Domain pointing to any
                          web site is another thing. They are seperate. Example, LV own the
                          domain name, LV can decide to point the "lakeviewtaxis.com" to
                          ABC.COM or XYZ.COM or any other appropriate web site.</p>

              <p>Yes I know, actually wanted to try the free web (with the advert) to see the response before I chop the domain, but you fast hand fast leg leh, chop first.</p>
              <p>There are actually 2 option, one is to transfer, the other one I think is like what you say to mess with the DNS ( not my cup of tea). Please help read thru the following :</p>

              <p>Hope there is no misunderstanding between you &amp; me.</p>
              <p>It started when Pool said LV's boss wanted to have a web site for LV. So I volunteer to help. What I assumed is that LV's needs is very simple, just a simple one to provide info online. And I also told Pool that mine will be a very SIMPLE one, just able to serve the purpose will do.</p>
              <p>I didn't know you are also involved, otherwise I would have liased with you to see what we can put up.</p>
              <p>My intention is to finish up to what LV's boss is satisfied then I will å·¥æˆ�èº«é€€ã€‚Admin &amp; ownership will be transfer to LV's boss or Pool.</p>
              <p>My reason is very simple. LV being a for-profit company must bear the cost for their website, it's their advertising tool. They cannot expect me to help them all the way which I also don't have the resources to do so.</p>
              <p>As to the free website issue, I am also using free website with advertisements. But I go around this so that no ads appear on LV's web site. I would recommend that if LV's boss is happy with the results, they would have to upgrade to a paid web hosting plan which will cost a few $ a month.</p>
              <p>Hope this clarify doubts. Cheers.</p>

              <p>I use TRIPOD.COM. I actually wanted to create one under LV's user ID. But it seems that at www.tripod.com, it's not possible to create new user account from anyone outside US. I think this could be the result after Tripod changed ownership last year. Part of their services was sold to another company called Multimania. My account with them was created a few years back.</p>
              <p>What I do is I register a domain name and point that domain name to sgtaxisvc.tripod.com/cgi-bin/lvmain.pl, that's all.</p>
              <p>PS. (Lycos Tripod - Multimania at<cite> www.multimania.co.uk). They offered free account with advertisement but not the feature that I wanted to use.<br></cite></p>

              <p>Insg, pls review the following :</p>
              <p>For Domain Transfer options:</p>
              <p>1) Transfer fee is US$12.95 once off</p>
              <p>2) You have to fulfil the 60 days criteria</p>
              <p>3) If transfer, have to rebuilt all the content again.</p>
              <p>4) No need to take up any premium package, but will have ads on it.</p>
              <p>For DNS Hosting :</p>
              <p>1) Have to choose a premium package , US$4.16, US$8.33 and US$20.83 per month. i have advise pool to ask boss to choose the cheapest package, pool got a gmail address for lakeview</p>
              <p>2) Don't know have to wait for 60 days to host, you can try once boss gave green light to see if its work.</p>
              <p>Hope this will clear any doubts regarding hosting and domain transfer</p>
