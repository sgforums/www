              All taxi companies except Prime had raised their taxi fares by 1st week of 2012.

              with the new fare increase, some Sporeans MAY THINK tat TDs can earn more n therefore more wil surely join the trade.......
              
              n many more may have no choice n drive taxi temporary b4 they can find a job.......... dun forget, abt 200,000 Sporeans aged 30 above had a taxi vocational licences........ even my friends who had nice high paying jobs n stay in condos have standby their licences jus in case they lose their jobs.................
              
              dun u all feel tat nowadays, u all can see more women TDs on the roads........ some of them r only in their early 30s n pretty somemore..........
              
              looking at some of the lousy behaviours of TDs on the roads, i strongly believed tat they r super reliefs or new chaps who jus wan 2 earn as much as they can, they dun care abt traffic rules or cutting other taxis queue etc etc............

He keep saying sorry sorry, then I farked him again, even if you want the pax, you must also leave a lane for me to move out, now his i30 is occupying both lane, knn..even the pax also agreed with me, took my cab.</p>

              <p><br>As BCL said, there will be cowboys and mickey mouses, if got Minnie mouse, better.</p>
              <p>If the young do not enter this industry, foreigner will come in, most of you are taxi driver since young, how do the old people of that time think, same, but yesterday young are today oldies, and the new wave of young ones coming, be it relief or hirer, like it or not, we should be blessed that this trade still can attract true blue Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Taxi fares adjustment or changes is the right phrase to use instead of saying taxi fares rises, as I explained before, for the past 4 years since the last adjustment, TDs have no increase in their income base on a average day hard work, but peoples working are having annual increment, variable payout bonuses and promotion, so, I hope that TDs, just like me, when asked upon by pax on fares increases, either you keep quiet or tell them it is fares adjustment so as to reflect the real market worthy of a TD and at the same time, to align the timing, places and condition of paxs and taxis frequency in a more management way. We had been short changed from the past 3 years, out of 28000 TDs, I bet that if you are the sole breadwinner of 4 as a TDs, you cannot even make a family tour to NZ, not to mention buying a condo after driving for 10 to 15years. For some, daily intake is already not enough. So, brothers and sisters, do not be overly whelmed by the changes in fares, it is just to make us able to breathe above the water for a while. If you look at last quarter singapore inflation 5.7%, you can imagine what 2012 will be like. formerly, inflation is only 1 to 1.5%.</p>
              <p>Young ones can never mix up with older ones, in TD, older ones is also TD, not some GM or become MD, what the young does and act, it is entirely different, same goes to the corporate world. Anything that renew or changes attract new blood, then it start to subside into norm after about few months to a year, after 2 years, you see those got stuck drive on, those lucky ones who can find a better jobs, throw keys and moved out, the situation will come into a straight line graph, when the 3rd year arrive, it is more or less standardised, people still throw keys, and the Q for newer cab get shorter and shorter, rental become higher and higher, and by the 4th year, some may not tarhan anymore, and the Q get even shorter, then finally, announce fares adjustment again. It cyclical, for TD is the same, only the fleet get newer and newer with higher rental, and the same old cut Q, cut lane, pax complain this and that will be the same old stories day in and day out. By middle of next years, nobody will give a fark about these changes</p>

              <p>Taxi is a dumping ground for retrenched ppl and those who cannot find work. Nobody really in their right mind would wanna aspire to be a taxi driver.</p>
              <p>So if such case happens who suffer? The group that relies solely on this trade, those with mouths to feed.</p>
              <p>Someone thinks he is doing the industry a favour by bringin in more ppl to drive. He havent kena yet , when all of city is flooded with taxis and someone ah wood ah kang lan lan also have to go.</p>

              <p>I saw a few 30 something ladies driving Cumfuck white mercedes. There are also a few aunties driving Chryslers. There are also a few Fatimahs and aunties driving Maxicabs. There are quite a few Aishahs, Fatimahs and aunties driving Transcab, Crown and Sonata. Most of them are just regular aunties lah. Not MILF standard to me, but a few of them are decent looking. Some also got walkie and are in LV, Royal and other taxi groups. Ang Mo cabby so far zero lah. Must be very jialat if an Ang Mo came to Singapore as an expat and ended up driving cabs.</p>
