              <p>since there is number of accident happen recently, let me share a story for some who have never encounter for or the newbie</p>
              <p>just less than a week ago, a citycab and a silvercab(i30) had a miror collidsion at gateway building.</p>
              <p>citycab was just about to move off and the i30 was going to stop in front of it</p>
              <p>the i30 while having  the both the right door and side marguard scatch and the citycab got it left marguard scatch and front bumper some damage.  </p>
              <p>both driver don't think it is their fault and were deciding to make their own claim thru the taxi company insurance</p>
              <p>I think old bird here will know it is likely a 50-50 case even if reported</p>
              <p>When my friend (citycab sonata) call me about it , i later decide to ask him the number plate for the i30 and realise also my friend, so i call them up to hold on first before reporting as both party stand to loose $1070 if it is 50-50 case,( base on my knowledge it is highly so)</p>
              <p>get both party meet up at kaki bukit auto bay and check out the repair cost, it work out only just about $600 and can be done before 5.30pm ( send in at about 1pm)</p>
              <p>i don't know what word to use about the moral of the story, i can only say both save to pay that $2140 in total to benefit the TC or the insurance compamy</p>
              <p>Just telling any TD out there , accident , don't panic, don't heat up, stay cool, things can be settle if party can give and take, not sure what to do, call out to the old bird or kaki who can help, calling your TC first may not help at all since only thing they ask is to make report first, remember making report liao things cannot U-turn</p>
              <p>SO, in anyway , drive safe be happy</p>
