              <p>Another rule which I believe in is...</p>
              <p>You can debate aggressively, bring out your points of arguments,</p>
              <p>But,.. you should not go personal.</p>
              <p>Example,</p>
              <p>We can discuss, 'not all CDG cabbies are bad', 'why they are behaving as such'</p>
              <p>but should avoid, 'your England kana sai', 'your mother suck my @!*&amp;', 'all of you are pigs'.</p>

He reply and told me he had the similar experience and on one help him till 1 kind soul came and tell him exactly what he told me.</p>

              <p>fellas, i think the crux of the matter is TS is very frustrated cos he always lose when lut-ting with sonatas.</p>
              <p>As a sonata-er, my motto is "quick but safe, if cannot make it, dun". So i appeal to all fellow sonata-ers. Pls!!,  give way when you see fellow tds whose wheels are slower or whose hand/legs are not so agile.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I feel the same way. Why? Because many SG drivers have poor attitude on the road. Why Sonata? Because higher chance that the taxi that piss you off is a Sonata, mainly because they are the higest % taxi. Ever hear people kp bout taxi driver damn inconsiderate? Same thing. Out 0f 10 cars, people will remember a taxi that cut into your lane. No one is going to say One corolla, one Stream, 2 vious are damn bad drivers. Dun get so personal with the comment. If you are not a bad attitude driver, just move on. Say sonata nia so sensitive. Liddat nia want pick quarrel.</p></div>

              <p>again and again ,i have to bear with the donkey driving of

              cut his lane,he overtook me,and swerve dangerous into my lane. I
              took his number plate down, call comfort to complaint,email comfort
              and email lta too. So from today onward,i do this to sonata
              driver,even if they smoke,in their cab,i will take down the picture
              and send to comfort and lta, yes?sonata driver only</p>

              <p>Of course it's your right to complain especially after something like this. You wanna 'go to war' (cant think of better word) with all blue sonata, also your right. You wanna take photo of smokers (btw I also smoke and drive blue weekends, white weekdays) also your wish.</p>
              <p>Even you tio me, also never mind, I know how to explain and I'm not concerned by videos or photos from non-enforcement officers.</p>
              <p>But what i want to say is, is it really worth it? Blue sonatas are the most, you're bound to encounter many more of bad ones from them than any other company. But the reverse also true, you should also likely find more good ones from them than other company, because of their sheer numbers.</p>

              <p>I also have seen bad blue ones, and sometimes I admit I also have done mistake and make others angry.</p>
              <p>However I have never tried to muscle in on pax from other taxis, be it blue, yellow, red, green etc. If the pax is nearer to you, it's yours. If you're in front of me it's yours. But cannot be like drive for 600m and 1km, after I overtake you then spot a pax ahead, that I must give way. You choose to drive slowly or stay in lane 2, cannot expect me to wait for you to slowly slowly come and overtake. You want, exercise your right, I won't stop you.</p>
              <p>Just last Sunday along Sims Ave at a pedestrian crossing, a blue Sonata stopped in left most lane. In lane 2 was a private car, lane 3, was a Merc cab. Ahead, just 10-20m were 3 pax, this was after midnight.</p>
              <p>You what happened? While waiting for the light to turn green, the Mercs suddenly inched forward and before it could change completely, cut across 3 lanes to pick the pax! Is this fair? Is the blue wrong? Isn't those pax meant for him?</p>
              <p>So you see, this can happen to you and also to blue sonata drivers. If 1 sonata driver irritate or do you wrong, then complain against him or shame him, but don't bunch all together.</p>
              <p>If you do, then maybe I think you will always be angry on the road, everytime you see blue you get heated up, waiting to spot their mistakes and driving become more stress for you.</p>
              <p>Just my view, the choice is rightfully yours.</p>
