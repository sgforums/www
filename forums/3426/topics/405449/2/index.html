              <p>The  'darker' you are in your nature, the more negative is your energy, the more likely you are in attracting entities which you fear most. You can display all the symbols or objects possible, or carry/wear all of them, but seriously, they serve very little use. It's the person who attracts them, that is the key factor. Real-life is not the same as movies, which is pure made-belief.</p>
              <p>If you really wish to avoid problems with non-physical entities that you fear, try to develop and improve your soul nature first. Believe it or not, it's your choice. :)</p>
              <p>But anyway, ghosts on their own can be found anywhere, anytime of the day; it's only whether you can see/feel them or not. It's better to help them move on to the Light, not fear them.</p>

              <p>i always see people praying to a thai monk statue. i always wonder who he is. is that the one ? have picture to show or not.</p>
              <p>sometime last year. newspaper reported a man who lost his wife and a baby during an accident on a  trip to malaysia. he said he and his wife supposed to wear amulets given by a monk who predicted something would go wrong during the trip and asked them no matter how must wear the amulets. after his wife and baby were dead, he found his wife's amulets in their wardrobe's drawer, meaning his wife and the babay did not wear them. the newspaper reported him because he went to visit his wife's and baby's grave everyday without fail continuously for years.</p>

              or place any "Toa Peh Kong" mini-statue, "Fu" or lucky
              charm or any blessed objects inside my taxi. My taxi is
              completely empty other than a box of tissue paper and air

              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Let me relate a few incidents
              -</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">(1) I picked up 1 male
              Chinese pax after midnite at AMK hub unofficial taxi stand near
              S11. His destination is a semi-detached house at Yio Chu Kang.
              As we r abt to reach his house, he told me "Uncle, there's sometin
              I must tel u b4 I alight. If not, I wil feel very uncomfortable."
              He told me tat b4 he boarded my cab at AMK hub, he can see a small
              n very young Chinese girl with long hair sitting at the back of my
              taxi. I can remember very clearly tat b4 tat pax boarded my taxi,
              he was smoking n he lok at my taxi in a strange manner. As I was
              the 1st in queue, he boarded my taxi n sat beside me in the front.
              After he alighted at his house, I also smoke with him n he sweared
              tat he did not lie to me after I asked him several times not to
              joke with me. He said tat he have "yin-yang" eyes n he can see
              ghosts very often.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">(2) I picked a male Chinese pax
              ard 3pm at Jln Besar n he was sitting at the rear. Also jus as he
              was abt to reach his destination at CBD area, he told me all of a
              sudden! "Uncle, jus now I feel tat there's sometin inside yr taxi."
              He begun 2 explained to me tat even though he cannot see it, but he
              can "feel it". He then told alot of temple n medium stuffs which I
              tin r true.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">(3) Another 2 times, my
              Malay paxs on 2 different trips told me tat sometin is nt rite
              abt my taxi n it's gives them a eerie feelin.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I tin there's no reasons or
              benefits 4 my paxs 2 lie 2 me. Also there's no way they can gang up
              n tell me lies. Any bros here can recommend any blessed objects tat
              I can put inside my taxi 2 ward off ghosts or bad luck? Also I
              believed <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">many other bros have
              ghosty encounters too.</span></strong> U like 2 share?</span></p>

              <p>Play the Great compassionate mantra. The little girl may be your last lives friend or relative. Nothing to be scared. Ghost are actually very helpless. If encounter one, don't let fear come to you, take it as per normal. When a person ran into a ghost, many view it as unlucky/very suey. But actually its another way round, you have a chance to help it cross over. If done the right way, positive karma you create. </p>
