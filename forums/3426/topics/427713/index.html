              <p>Rental higher could be a reason. Most are old birds, I saw a few times kenna book at expressway. They also quite difficult to get relief, rental too high for relief, but diesel consumption is surpisingly low for mercedes, this German engine really make very well, fine and smooth, good fuel nozzle, no diesel leak. Their Rpm very constant and smooth, unlike jap and korean, sometime press only, diesel $0.10cent gone, sometime ok, that is why sometime you notice your wish or sonata can pick up so fast, sometime cannot.</p>
              <p>But you right, they like to drive fast and cut in here and there, afterall, they are consider Limo, a class higher maybe, some lan si lan yong type, some are good, same same lah</p>

              <p>If you have driven one, you'll understand why we like to drive fast.</p>
              <p>Good brakes &amp; handling makes it easy to zoom around.</p>
              <p>But on a wet road, not safe to drive fast as the tyres are of no good quality.</p>
              <p>And no stunt when pax on board especially when they pay limo fare.</p>

              <p>If you take in the low fuel consumption, overall overhead is about the same as sonata.</p>

              yesterday got one Merc, suddenly cut from 3rd lane in front of me to 1st lane, from far right to left in less than half second, my heart almost jump out..i think i dont even have time stamp brake! 
              
              but when that driver slow in front of one person standing outside the busstop, that person didnt take or raise hand! the person just ignore the Merc then the Merc driver accelrate off again, zoom left zoom right in front..i think one private car next to me put big light flash that Merc
              
              last few days ago i also see more than 1 or 2 Mercs parking in some funny corners stop there also dont know waiting for what. theres even one empty Merc rush cut in front of me then drive slow slow in front when i sending passenger turn into some industrial area. but that Merc driver suddenly pick up speed and then slow to stop to the side, then when i past by then i see hes picking up one worker indian who look quite poor
              
              how their busines now

              <p><br> Because most merc ah pek has very small bladder and the seats (sitting position) even compress it further ???
              Hahaha, you read too much into this lah bro.</p>
              <p>But then again, how come you have so many bad encounters with merc drivers ah? You'd better watch your back, seems like they are targeting you ;-p</p>
              <p>I think these kinds of stunts you mentioned, any other colour cabs also have lah. There are good and bad drivers in any groups.</p>
