              <p>Been during for 3 weeks liao and life is a breeze so far. Enjoyed every moment of it so far. Most pax has been very kind and understand and directed me to their destination if I am not to familar with it, even Ang Moh, whom I find real impressive with their knowledge of the road - until today, I finally met my devil.</p>
              <p>Had 3 advanced bookings all lined up</p>
              <p>5.30 Rasa Sentosa to Airport</p>
              <p>6.50 Maplewoods to SIA Training Centre</p>
              <p>8.00 Toa Payoh to Airport.</p>
              <p>The second one comes with special instructions to be punctual.</p>
              <p>I finished the 1st one at 6.00 and as I am early, too a slow drive there and reach there at 6.20. As I am required to wait at the basement and worried that reception for my MDT would be bad, I called this Ang Moh lady pax's mobile and told here that I had arrived. But she said that she could only be down at 6.50. (sounds fair right?)</p>
              <p>At about 6.48, was already feeling "high tide" so I ask someone there if there is a toilet around and was told that there is one. As I noticed I got only 2 mins more and if I go to toilet and she came down and dun see me, all my effort to be early would be gone down to waste, so I "loooooon".</p>
              <p>I expect her to be on time as she might be rushing for meeting, that's why need me to be punctual, so I give her my respect and stay put. Which the clock struck 6.50am, no sign of her. Waited till 6.55, still no sign and the MDT's "NO SHOW" appeared.</p>
              <p>I pressed the "NO SHOW" sign but still stay and wait and 3 mins later she came down, no apology.</p>
              <p>Moving off, I ask her if I take the PIE and she reply YES. Then I ask her if she like me to take the Anak entrance or U-turn to Sixth Avenue, which from my map, seems shorter. She told be not to U-turn and I told her that route seems longer but she replied that she have been using it for two years.</p>
              <p>Then I ask her which exit should I take on reaching there and if it's ok for me to use the Simei exit. She said "My God, u mean u dunno the way? It's not fair. Why dun u call your company and ask them for direction"</p>
              <p>I mention that using my way, I can send her to her destination but if she got other prefer route, she can direct me accordingly and she remarked that she is not going to the Simei route but say she doesn't know which other exit. She said I can go all other ways except the Simei exit. I told her that I only know that exit but if she prefer others, I need her to direct me. She say u don't turn to Simei, yo u go straight.</p>
              <p>When we reach the Bedok exit, she said "Mr Driver, where u leading me? do u know the way? I reply that I am waiting for her instruction and we still haven't even reach Simei yet.</p>
              <p>Then she said she need to rush to work and want to call my company NOW.</p>
              <p>That really pissed me off and for the first time, I tell her off.</p>
              <p>I told her that the route I know will lead me there but if she got other alternative, I am prepared to follow. I told her that I am only trying to help send here there on time and she is not prepared to help.</p>
              <p>I told her that I am only trying to earn a living and she dun have to make things so nasty. I respect your time and you ask ppl to be punctual and yet you are late. You are driving for 2 years and you should know that every minute, the PIE's traffice condition changes.</p>
              <p>I told her that because she is late, I got to cancel my 8.00 appointment and because I respect her, I cannot use my phone to call and cancel while driviing. I ask her to think of that poor lady at Toa Payoh and all these because of her.</p>
              <p>I also tell her that because I respect her time, I rather not go to toilet and be there on the dot cos she need me to be there.</p>
              <p>I ask her how would she react if I am the one who is late for just 1 min.</p>
              <p>Finally when we reach the Simei exit, she ask me to go straight and give some instruction to trun right, turn left and in less than a minute, we are there.</p>
              <p>I told her if she can be like other ppl who just give such simple instruction and not scold and threaten to call office, we could have solved such a simple problem. She knows and had her preferred route but yet she want to make things difficult for us.</p>
              <p>The worst thing is, all this while, she said that she had recorded everything I said and ask if I would to add on.</p>
              <p>Upon reaching, she ask if I know how to handle the Nets machine (sarcastic right?) as she wants to pay by  NETS.</p>
              <p>But I still settle everything nicely for her and help her carry her precious luggage down for her (must be important stuff as she said she dun want to put in the booth but want it with her) So I ask if it's fragile and put it lightly on the floor.</p>
              <p>Then she offer her hand for me to shake and said let's forget the whole thing.</p>
              <p>Haha, sigh!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Bingjames i teach u something. Next time MDT no need to press so many advance bookings. Bid one and only one at any time. Never have 2 or more. Dun bid for tomorrow or day after or even 5-10 hrs later. Advance booking with 30mins - 1hr ETA can take. The rest ignore. Reach there early u got all the time to service customer. I will only reveal so much here. How i mess with the MDT after i on the spot is trade secret. But customer service is important. Must learn how to tickle their g-spot because later they will be paying maxed out fares, cumfark wont earn a cent of levy, pax must walk off happy n i must use their desired route.</p></div>

              <p>If I have not look at the street directory, how I know about the Simei Route?</p>
              <p>I also notice the cluster of expressway next to it and think maybe there might be a way to get there through it or it might just be a dead end to it.</p>
              <p>But I also expect that there might be other ways to it, that's why I ask her if there is, to show me.</p>
              <p>The main point in this post is not of me taking the wrong route or long route.</p>
              <p>As the proverb goes, there are many ways to skin a cat and I dun think I can know all of them or need to know all the 1000 and one ways of reaching SIA Training Centre to be called a Qualified Taxi Driver.</p>
              <p>Most if not all pax has got their prefer route, most of them for personal reasons, whatever it is but if they choose to keep quiet and expect the TD to know which way they want, in the end is just wasting their own time and upsettiing themselves.</p>
              <p>For this case, it's just a simple direction, why need to be so mean right? It's not that she doesn't know. That need to go to the extend of calling office and so on.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the same "short cut"  or "long detour" that both she and Mercab is talking about might not be 100% all the time, subject to traffice conditions at that time. After she alighted, I go through the same route that I intended to go through, looking for petrol kiosk for reason u know what, the traffice for that route is quite clear.</p>
              <p>Or maybe you guys believe dunno route deserved to be fuck, I got nothing to say.</p>
              <p>The fact is that I not 100% dunno route still take call, I know the way to get there, although it might not be the best but I still respect her and ask her if she got other options. Am I wrong to do that?</p>
              <p>My duty for that period is just to get her there on time but if she want me to do it her way, doesn't she need to show me?</p>

              why I ask her if there is, to show me.</p>
              <p>The main point in this post is not of me taking the wrong route
              or long route.</p>
              <p>As the proverb goes, there are many ways to skin a cat and I dun
              think I can know all of them or need to know all the 1000 and one
              ways of reaching SIA Training Centre to be called a Qualified Taxi
              Driver.</p>
              <p>Most if not all pax has got their prefer route, most of them for
              personal reasons, whatever it is but if they choose to keep quiet
              and expect the TD to know which way they want, in the end is just
              wasting their own time and upsettiing themselves.</p>
              <p>For this case, it's just a simple direction, why need to be so
              mean right? It's not that she doesn't know. That need to go to the
              extend of calling office and so on.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the same "short cut"  or "long detour" that both
              she and Mercab is talking about might not be 100% all the time,
              subject to traffice conditions at that time. After she alighted, I
              go through the same route that I intended to go through, looking
              for petrol kiosk for reason u know what, the traffice for that
              route is quite clear.</p>
              <p>Or maybe you guys believe dunno route deserved to be fuck, I got
              nothing to say.</p>
              <p>The fact is that I not 100% dunno route still take call, I know
              the way to get there, although it might not be the best but I still
              respect her and ask her if she got other options. Am I wrong to do
              that?</p>
              <p>My duty for that period is just to get her there on time but if
              she want me to do it her way, doesn't she need to show me?</p>

              <p>Bingjames i teach u something. Next time MDT no need to press so
              many advance bookings. Bid one and only one at any time. Never have
              2 or more. Dun bid for tomorrow or day after or even 5-10 hrs
              later. Advance booking with 30mins - 1hr ETA can take. The rest
              ignore. Reach there early u got all the time to service customer. I
              will only reveal so much here. How i mess with the MDT after i on
              the spot is trade secret. But customer service is important. Must
              learn how to tickle their g-spot because later they will be paying
              maxed out fares, cumfark wont earn a cent of levy, pax must walk

              <p>For me in this case:</p>
              <p>1)  I will never call/sms the pax from my hp, unless I really want this fare. Once you call, you are obliged to pick them up (to a certain extent). Moreover many pax will delay because they have your number as opposed to the auto reply which they cant call back.</p>
              <p>2) If I am early I will only activate the call button around the 10 min mark, not earlier. No show 5 mins is 5 mins. 4 mins late I may already have left, unless I want this fare (midnight or ulu place with no good prospects). I only wait longer in special circumstances.</p>
              <p>3) I never take 2 or 3 advance jobs in consecutive hours unless midnight, and never in peak period hours, because effectively ties my time up. Unless the 2 jobs not far from each other, eg; Job 1, Jurong to Airport at 6 am, Job 2 Pasir Ris to Shenton Way at 7am. After dropping pax 1, I can go for breakfast before Job 2, but definitely I won't do it if I ahd 30 min of peak period to kill after dropping pax 1. But this is up to individual.</p>
              <p>4) We all were new once and like wise we wanted to please customers and offer suggestions of routes we think is better or maybe we could be nervous because we new and don't want to offend or inconvenience pax, so we ask where to turn etc. But morning office advance jobs is standard, they take it everyday, so I will just ask how you normally go. Then the pax must advise accordingly, which route and exits to take.</p>
              <p>If the pax, very saart or yaya, then no need to talk so much, I just take the shortest route unless they advise otherwise. If kena jam, too bad, as long as pax paying for the jam, I don't care. If their route also jam one, then I just follow, no need to advise.</p>

              My newbie comment--
              
              Advance booking can take for the 1st trip of the day providing that location is near ur place + depending whether it's a worthy trip (long distance). 
              
              Subsequent advance should be near the last drop off point so as to minimize the peak hr waiting time. If don't, better ply the street. 
              
              Peak hr is best on concentrating on pax maximization for that period.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yes correct. Advance booking for next day morning is fine if u do not expect your regulars to book u. Sometimes u bid n got the job then later regular book u. Then u pass your regular to trusted friends. Now I seldom bid early morning jobs regardless OBK or not. I prefer to sleep until song song then slowly climb inside cab n decide how to salvage my OBK day. Usually bookings will come later one. Nothing to panic. End of day will have some profit one. Once u r experienced as an OMO drIver, nothing to worry about. Early morning no MDT or personal booking but somehow somewhere durians will fall later in the day.</p></div>

              <p>That's a sound policy.</p>
              <p>But also taxi driving is a personal thing, you are on your own and adopt whatever style that you like.</p>
              <p>This forum got many TDs with a lot of experience, especially in dealing with sticky situations and how to adapt to this trade so as to maximise your income and life and not burn yourself out.</p>
              <p>The suggestions they give is for anyone to consider and see whether suitable for their needs. If suitable follow, if not suitable don't, either way ok.</p>
              <p>But TD must learn not to be bitter or angry every day, I remember in the 90s when I fetch 1 abang whose taxi break down. That time I new, so I ask abang, today your cab break down, I see you very happy one, why ah? No money to earn today, you still smiling and happy. His answer struck a chord: Ai yah, everyday is different. sometimes got good sometimes got bad. When you take the good, you also got to accept the bad sometimes, cannot 1 way traffic all the time, life is not like that.</p>
