              <p>Within the omo and the relief spectrum, lies 2 equal dimension, if you keep encourage cabby, new or old to be relief, then OMO will be decreasing, and without OMO, how can there be relief.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we let the market decide and move by itself, if someone is driving OMO, tell him to get a relief, if you tell him to throw key and become relief, less one omo on the road, and also less chance for me to be relief..super relief.</p>

              we make a honest living with ourselves rather than cheating
              others or stealing others? If no, I did it all myself honestly,

              I see this as a OMO vs 1 shift thread (not night vs day shift or hirer vs relief). Think most pros n cons aldry said by forum members just summarise:
                      
              Pros/cons of OMO:-
              To TDs Pros â€“ 
                      1)	Good for younger drivers with the energy. Can try out diff hours. Practise diff styles, Learn pro/cons of day/night, which suitable for ownself.
                      2)	Good for short term, to clear debts more leeway/hours to chiong. Less time lost for chnge shift/pumpâ€¦arguments with relief (esp problematic ones)
                      3)	More control over veh. n yr own fate (If relief kn accident no veh to drive). Can use veh for own when needed. Freedom as to when to chiong or when to eat snake. Can adjust timing when day business good and night biz bad or vice versa (depend on seasonal pattern).
                      4)	Less veh problems due to lesser mileageâ€¦ more drivers faster wear and tear.
