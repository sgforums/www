              <p>Ya when I am a small kid. Rem is $1 to use the boot. Fare that time is only $1.20 jump $0.10 so imagine the use of boot charge is almost equal to starting fare. But dunno is legal one or not. Cos we seldom take cab. But if need to take also carry ours stuff unless big items. Lol</p>

                  <p>Once, my mother fell and broke her wrist and a taxi driver just
                  happened to finish his lunch and I approached him and express our
                  wish to take his cab to take my mother to the hospital. He refused
                  though he saw my mother was in pain. He remained in his taxi and
                  dilly dally for another 15 minutes and then he drove past us
                  quickly while I was still frantically calling the various taxi
                  companies.</p>
                  </div>
                  
                  <p><br> Hello good son, your mother hurt until like that yoy also want to save money from abulance instead of choosing taxi to ferry here to hospital. You dont know hospital can call you pay the bills another day. You can also otang no to pay. In Emergency of pain and life treatening illness, ambulance is free.
                  I got anyone at home with severe pain and need medical at once I will always call the professional to deal with the situations. What if really suay until no taxi around, you never knows. Please be reason abit, to things, taxi drivers are doing their livehood too, only minority are bad.</p>

              <p><br>Our graciousness is lacking, and I do not blame locals but rather the education and the society cultured by our govt, it come to a point that most locals expect non paid services as they become more influential in the society, and because most being influential, had lost their initial identity and expect the society to serve them</p>
              <p>Unlike the likes of influential Jap, european or american, when they became well educated with good job and wealthy, they still maintain their own nature identity of graciousiness, respect other professional and take services as a help rather than a must.</p>
