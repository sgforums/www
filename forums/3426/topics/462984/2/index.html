              Dear TS,
              
              There are all kinds of Paxs and Cab Drivers in SGP. In a recent survey by a notable agency, SGP  Taxi drivers are ranked 2nd most friendly in the world, Public Transport ranked 5th best. However, in the same survey in terms of friendliness/graciousness among the general public, SGP fared badly. I leave you to reflect on that in light of many  reports of drivers getting assaulted for no reason, paxs running away from paying fares.. etc.
              
              As to the 2 incidents mentioned by you, the driver who refused to take paxs may have an advance job later and taking a break in the meantime. Have you asked him for the reason? If there's no reason, he is really a bad driver, and U shud have taken a foto of his taxi without the change-shift/on call sign and complain to LTA. Such drivers give others a bad name. If after investigation, yr allegations are proven true, the driver can be fined $300 and license suspended for 6 mths!

              As for helping with luggages (I repeat helping, its to assist the paxs not do it alone), it is indeed not compulsory for cab drivers. It is just a matter of poor service. I refer to the famous case of Quan Yi Fong, wherein this was stated clearly in court. The majority of drivers do help and some even go the extra mile.  If U ask nicely I do not see why the driver wouldn't help unless he has a medical condition. It is often when paxs are rude and take things for granted that drivers tend to show they have basic rights too.
              
              Again if the driver have no reason to refuse yr request, you can complain to the company of the poor service. If the driver have a good record, the company may not take action. If he has previous complains the company may take action to preserve it good image. This is similar to other trades in the service industry.
              
              Let me also share with U my own experience on helping with luggages. Once I fetched 2 able bodied paxs in their 30s (guy and a girl) from Airport. When arrived at their destination, it was raining lightly and there's not shelter at the carpark. While the pax  slowly put change in the wallet, I rushed out to unload the luggages. While I was struggling (I'm 49), I realised to my surprise they had run-off to the shelter leaving me in the rain. I then stopped and went back inside the cab until they return to help.. After completion there's no thanks or even acknowledgement.
              
              I can write U long stories cos I'm quite free.. I'm sure other drivers hv unpleasant stories but may not hv the time to tell U...
