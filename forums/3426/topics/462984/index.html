We have a large luggage and a medium luggage with a stroller. Carrying my 2 year old who is asleep, I already struggling... My husband, carrying the 4 year old boy who weighs 17kg and asleep too, had to unload the 2 luggages himself while the taxi driver sat there in his seat, waiting for us to finish with our struggle and to close his boot and his door! Extremely inconsiderate! He did not help us because we can't put sleeping child on floor to get our luggage! He just watch till we finish struggling! Sigh... Was thinking that was extremely selfish and conscienceless of the indian taxi driver to just sit and watch...</p></div>

              <p>Once, my mother fell and broke her wrist and a taxi driver just happened to finish his lunch and I approached him and express our wish to take his cab to take my mother to the hospital. He refused though he saw my mother was in pain. He remained in his taxi and dilly dally for another 15 minutes and then he drove past us quickly while I was still frantically calling the various taxi companies.</p>

You expect him to carry your dead weight luggages out of the taxi? what if he get a heart attack whilst trying to "wrestle " with your luggage?

              <p>Took a taxi from airport after trip. We are a family with 2 very

              unload the 2 luggages himself while the taxi driver sat there in
              his seat, waiting for us to finish with our struggle and to close
              his boot and his door! Extremely inconsiderate! He did not help us
              because we can't put sleeping child on floor to get our luggage! He
              just watch till we finish struggling! Sigh... Was thinking that was

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>You can't call the Taxi uncle inconsiderate. Just so you know, I have a lower back injury from last time fall many years back. Till today, I cannot carry heavy items or weight. So if I dun help you, am I inconsiderate or selfish? If I injure my back again JUST by helping you unload your luggage, will you compensate me for my injury, lost of income or even feed my family? Think about it before you come here and anyhow shoot. BTW, there is no law or regulation that taxi drivers have to carry your stuff for you, BE IT LOADING OR UNLOADING.</p>
