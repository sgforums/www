              <p>Another True Story ( this one i heard from toyota distributor people that i know) when i drove 1.8 Wish.</p>
              <p>The earlier batch of 1.8 Wish. There is this Wish service by Defu and you know what happen to the gearbox?  Gearbox jamm and overheat.</p>
              <p>What happen?   The mechanic change the gear oil but replace with engine oil. </p>
              <p>Transcab argue for warranty but Distributor cannnot warranty it.  Finally out of good will they go "on dutch" payment.</p>

              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>M Jeremy here to bring some justice and to reveal the shiite and
              “cunt”ning of Transcab.</p>
              <p>My Wish 2.0 suffered loss of aircon coldness at about 3.45pm on
              7 July at Sengkang. sensing sometime was wrong, decided to head
              home to Jurong West. realised engine was losing power and all the
              indicator lights, on. engine, water. before dying on me at the Red
              light junction before stop line at Jurong West Ave 2 and Jalan Boon
              Lay.</p>
              <p>I called for towtruck and came at 4.15 as was nearby.</p>
              <p>On 8 July 8.30am, a sweet voice called said needed to overhaul
              engine. I said ok. I asked how long it would take, either tomorrow
              or the same evening. For me, as long as they do good honest job. I
              dont mind,</p>
              <p>I received a call at 7.30pm from the <span>PRC</span> clerk and said ready for collection. When I reached, I asked how
              long was the downtime. they said no downtime given,</p>
              <p>I asked why?</p>
              <p>He said, Oh your radiator no water, thats why need to overhaul
              engine, Rang Ni You Xin Li Jun Bei, Jasmine will send me a invoice
              to pay!!</p>
              <p><span>WTF</span>!!!</p>
              <p>I check my water daily and top accordingly.</p>
              <p><span>MY ROV</span> servicing was on 29 June 2012 and I
              went to <span>STA</span> for inspection. Passed!!</p>
              <p>I couldnt sleep the whole night and sought Poolmans advice. Not
              to <span>PAY</span>!!!! gonna cost a bomb and all.</p>
              <p>I woke cup and called Miss <span>M L</span> , those
              transcabbies will know who , she said will check.</p>
              <p>At 2pm she called, said need to pay $354 for the repair. I asked
              for a description and breakdown she cant give me and needed to
              check and now 8,00pm I am still waiting for the freaking call.</p>
              <p>Guess what, guys, I will get a copy of the blackand white and
              also statement of account and post it here for you all to see.</p>
              <p>And guess what Freaking Jasmine is shitting in her panties now
              as a <span>MDT</span> message at 2.45pm</p>
              <p>Dear Members, If you introduce your friends to take up 2nd hand
              Wish , you will be awarded a $500 introductory fee!!!</p>
              <p>hahahah<br> good luck scums..</p>
              <p>I am off today after registering with <span>CDG</span> Limo.. good riddance to Transcab. Anyway, will play them back at
              their own game!!!</p>
              <p>Treat us like fools eh?</p>
              <p>My uncle who runs his mechanic business for 40 yrs, opened my
              bonnet and checked. There doesnt seem to be any overhaul an
              overhaul will take minimum 3 to 5 says. say for a new tension belt
              and engine mounting all seems as usual.</p>
              <p>Unless they charge me $354 from labour of transferring another
              wish engine to my chassis?</p>
              <p>Guys , you got to believe me, I have been <span>OMO</span> for 3 mths since April 2012 and 2nd time towed.
              moreover, I have been superrelief with these scums since 2011.</p>
              <p>So.. you guys know.</p>
              <p>Pray hard your $665 is untouched before the 10th. cos they are
              desperate!!!</p>

              <p>I don't understand why you must head home when your aircon is down ?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, you are in SengKang which is near to Defu Lane (transcab workshop)</p>
              <p>Don't tell me you don't know there's downtime when your cab aircon is not working ?</p>
              <p>I'm really puzzle why you must head home from sengkang all the way to Jurong West ?</p>
