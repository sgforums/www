              Me a nightmare Cabby for my Pax...
              
              
              lst - miss booking time becoz I overslept
              
              2nd - No fuel in the tank - running across the island with a lighted empty fuel sign (from south to eas(1st trip) and continue from east to north (2nd trip)
              
              3rd - lst trip pax got not enough cash only $12 in coins - then wan to pay half cash and half CC.  I said I dunno how to do so yet.  Pax then okay to pay all with CC and then quite happily give me the $12 as tips!  Afterwhich I thank him profusely and exchanged contacts with him and told him to visited Sin again and to contact me again!
              
              (Come to think of it now, the tips may be a genuine appreciation of service or NOT?
              
              I was holding all the coins very tightly in my left palm in a fist manner - while trying to twist my cashless terminal for the correct function button with my right hand - tat may hv sent a signal to pax tat he will not see his money again...
              
              becoz I was still holding tightly while waiting for approval from CC, I also made a gesture of not returning any of those coins to him as I directed the left hand towards the centre console container...jus in case the coins drop thru the car seats) 
              
              3rd - Take Pax (2nd trip) and all his belongings to pump fuel at Shell station.
              
              4th - Then realize I hv only $7; not enough money to pay for full tank fuel ($89).
              
              5th - Pax paid for fuel on my behalf
              
              6th - Secure from Pax Advance Bookin go CIA tomolo afternoon and keep the change.
              
              
              My this morning events:
              
              Me Overslept for Advance Booking (6.30am);
              
              Woke up or rather jump out of bed at 6.03am;
              
              Rush out of house at 6.05am
              
              Drive gangnam style &amp; forget to breath heading to pick up point
              
               (BB to Scotts Road);
              
              6.15am Job canx - Pax took passing by cab
              
              Heng Ahr no suspension....but but but....
              
              Yeah Yeah ... Job Canx.. me relax a bit and start breathing
              
              
               .......ALL OF A SUDDEN I felt dis-oriented...
              
              Becoz I do not have anymore mission / destination to zoom in after feeling the rushing high ....
              
              So what to do next along Stevens Road that time on Sat morning?
              
              Precisely at that moment ting 1 advance job 730am to CIA...Me got it confirm!
              
              Yeah Yeah ... happy me again with a new Focus point to head to.... plus plenty of time to make it for this booking - sure swee swee de!

              Dear Fatty_cab again
              
              I see you have become my victim of confusion le.
              LOL.....
              
              Let me help to un confuse you....juz try to look at it as a one off event for my posting this morning.....
              
              You see, I actually do not even have a single dollar when driving taxi on the road THIS MORNING......do you know why?
              
              Correct!!! Remember I jump out of the house and was rushing.....
              
              you may ask then where the $7 come from ??? that is the 2nd event to be cont'd...
              
              For this trip(advance booking limo cab) I actually expect my pax to gv me $50 and let me keep the change!!!
              
              BTW, just to soothe your disbelief... I actually transfer the change to an Aussie pax the next day becoz he paid his fare in equivalent of US$... this my hirer was shocked too... I gave him the US$ to change to Sin for me and he oso shake his head and said HAIZ SISTA! U AHR???
              
              lol...haha...jkjk.....

              here is what i can say,  her stories are all true
              
              she has every kind of luck which you and i will envy
              
              anythings that we normal tds does which will invite complains will end up the other way round
              
              e.g, this not happen to her once ,  airport Q got pax going nearby short trip, end of the trips, after pax pay up the meter fare, she still can manage to get another $10 from pax.
              reasons she gave pax you will be surprise. and best part is pax gave willingly
              
              sign, why these things never happen on me?

              No bad... We r cool rite?  Lol
              
              My idol for TD are my tdvl trainers fm sta and smrt...special mention Mr Tony n Mr Mark who are also current TDs.
              
              They train us idiots and newbies from all walks of life and varied age groups day in n day out....then with such conviction they guide us when we pass and help us grab a cab to begin driving otr with their constant reminders n follow up.
              
              Jus imagine the conviction they harbour to be great TD despite the negativity of this career bears.
              
              Yes luck for TDs in my humble opinion is veri veri important....it is never Wat we know such as all the correct routes n landmarks or best working hours or hot spots...
              
              Must be heng heng to get the generous and understand pax during queue when my turn comes n also meet  friendly decent pax along the streets sweeping....
              
              May Best wishes and lady luck be with all TDs!!!!
