              <p>True, I believe if you want to party, be responsible. However, I
              would like to add that if authority is to implement the rule of
              compensation, it should be equal across the board, if not pax may
              choose my crown to vomit <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif">.</p>
              <p>The compensation should be at the extreme, $150 is good. If you
              said $20 to $50, some rich pax may choose taxi to vomit, as long as
              they paid, they are not wrong, end up we lan lan have to clean it
              up and cannot scold them, because they paid and followed the
              laws, we hv to be careful in this areas.</p>
              <p>Laws works both way, you can get compensated by laws, pax can go
              around and said, now inside taxi, can vomit, just paid $50 can
              already,...hurray</p>

              <p>Thats the way bro. Vomit in your car and want to run away. Next time this bf make gf pregnant sure run away too. Can run away from vomit means will run away from all problems. Must chase them.</p>
              <p>Agreed its not palang toh but extracting $50 from pax for vomit cases is also not easy. $50 to compensate lost of income for 1hr. Sounds alot? Please think again drinkers. What if the smell remains?</p>
