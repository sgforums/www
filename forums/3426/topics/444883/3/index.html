              <p>Problem with Comfort, when got something to benefit or take care of driver welfare (but doesn't earn them a slice of the pie, or costs them financially), you'll never hear of it officially. It's like a well kept secret that only for the benefit for those who are in the know, or others who have the time to conduct their investigations/enquiries through official channels and 'red tape' for 'black and white'.</p>
              <p>This kind of thing, you will hear people say, even from some of their instructors and staff, but written confirmation is hard to find. No big write up in their homepage, newsletter or notice board. But they will be quick to confirm if they Press asks about policy.</p>
              <p>Even if it exists, it's done in such a way that will cost the driver time and effort, maybe further loss of income. In reality, it almost always ends up in a lose-lose situation for the driver, but who cares right? Comfort is big transport provider, drivers are just tiny pegs, who are easily replaced. Follow our structure and rules, in short, take it or leave it - That's the Comfort way.</p>
