              Prime Taxi - have fallen short in their services for radiophone booking.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>This is based on the
               latest quality of service (QoS) standards by the Land Transport 
              Authority (LTA), covering areas such as answer rate, cater rate and the 
              time taken to answer incoming calls and confirm taxi, as well as the 
              time  passengers waited for the taxis to arrive.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Between October and November 2011, SMRT Taxis failed in the call answer rate.<br><br>Smart
               Cab and Prime Taxi failed in the cater rate, waiting time for despatch 
              centre to confirm the taxi from the time the call is answered, and 
              passenger waiting time for the taxi.<br><br>In response to queries from 
              Channel NewsAsia, SMRT Taxis' acting deputy director of Customer 
              Relations, Eunice Lui, said the taxi operator did not meet its call 
              answer rate during the two months because of "capacity issues" with its 
              phone lines. <br><br>She said SMRT Taxis has raised the problem with the telco.<br><br>She added that they're working to resolve the problem. <br><br>SMRT
               Taxis is also working on more automated booking channels for customers 
              to book its taxis with ease and to improve standards.<br><br>Smart Cab and Prime Taxi were not available for comment.<br><br>The other categories of the QoS standards are safety and taxi drivers' conduct.<br><br>In safety, TransCab, SMRT Taxis, Smart Cab and Prime Taxi failed for accident rate.<br><br>As for taxi drivers' conduct, Prime Taxi failed in the offence rate of its taxi drivers.<br><br>Transport
               Minister Lui Tuck Yew said in parliament on Tuesday that his ministry 
              will look closely at the service quality of taxis and see what needs to 
              be improved.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>

              <p>If want to improve, please improve those taxi companies' toilet for cabby, treat cabby as their important customer, lower rental base on adhoc basis and finally lower fuel and gas charges for taxis.</p>
              <p>Improve the taxis companies, not the cabby please.</p>
              <p>Toilet protray a good image for the company, good people like to work for company with good, clean and hygience toilet.</p>
              <p>Take cabby as customer of Taxi companies, and with that, instil taxi companies that customer is first and mostly right. This will help cabbies to respect their passengers and serve them well with good services. It is a domino affect, top good, below good, top no good, below lagi no good.</p>
              <p>Lower rental of cab will help to ease cabby from struggling to pay rental and end up with lot of stress and accident rates, some even get heart attack or stroke. If govt and taxi companies really want cabbies to have a better balance of life between family and work, you need to release their burden, and the best is to reduce rental. If you do that, even clotted blood vein can be become clear for most of us.</p>
              <p>Lowering of fuel charges like tax will reinforce cabby burden in their day to day plying the road, with more rest, less anger, less frustration and more happy on the road, once cabby are happy, they serve well.</p>

              </p><p>whenever the paliament looking into Taxi issue...... nothing good will come out from them except good reason to make us PAY MORE.</p>
              <p>Blame all the Taxi company, punish them, fine them....etc. When the company running cost increase due to it, Taxi company will recover it from the Driver.</p>
              <p>Usually, the blame will somehow divert to us Taxi Driver, from the goverment, from the media and then from the public. So, no one will shown any sympathetic over our increase in cost. Always, it is so successful that we Taxi Driver even feel we deserve it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About Booking</p>
              <p>There is obviously a flaw in the booking system. It seem that we have a "state of the art" booking system, but......</p>
              <p>1) Despatching  of Job - to the nearest Taxi base on Radius of location. What a lazy programming job done here, properly that the best the so called foreign talent can do. My GPS brought 4 years ago,  can do calculation on distance and est timing base on the actually route. It just shown how lazy our booking programme is written, and worst is, it is still using and non of our "Talent" notice the incompetent of this Lazy Programming.</p>
              <p>2) Advance Job Booking - Again, it is despatch to the nearest Taxi. Who the hell want such booking, for a 30 minutes and more waiting with merely that $8 extra? Maybe there is, but still the minority. So, the system can only serve the minority, how successful can it be?</p>
              <p>3) No Show - This area had been seriously abuse by commuter. Commuter are not made to show their commitment, that discourage Taxi Driver to take up their booking and affect those who are genuine.</p>
              <p>4) Booking Fees - For $2.30, it only worth 3 mins of my time, For $3.30, it only worth 5 mins of my time. What are the chances i will accept a booking, esp. when there are good connection around.</p>
              <p>Overall, the Taxi Booking system do not serve us well enough. When the business operator are not interested, keep pushing for higher demand are resulting in more unhappiness to the general public.  </p>
