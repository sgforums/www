              <p>Actually, the carbon tax affects mostly large engine captivity petrol cars. The Govt also will be reducing road tax From $1.25 per cc to $0.40 per cc. Taxi rebate for low emission taxi will go up to $30,000. So I think there is a balance. The one that will 100% benefit is the taxi company, will they pass the savings on the rebate to lower rentals??? I think in future there will be more diesel cars on the road, not sure how it will affect prices of diesel then. Here is an extract from LTA on carbon tax:</p>

              <p>Then for big cc cars is like LPPL, and lower CC car will gain from it,..I do not know what they are trying to imply, ask people to buy smaller cars??</p>
              <p>I find this working toward the benefit of taxis companies, which most of them are Government Link compaines, from Cdg to smrt and even Union gas TC linking to powersupply.</p>
              <p>Whatever happen, why govt is not promoting green enviroment, the like of CNG and hybrid should be given great discount on Road Tax, but somehow, our govt cannot let go of the fuel business which is very lucrative to them in term of taxes and refinery production.</p>
              <p>I alway believe social economy is an ecology and the end product be it taxes increase here and decrease there, would ultimately, hurt the consumers.</p>
