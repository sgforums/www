              <p>In today's world, many people only concern about the objective and outcome of result. Tactics? I find that the young generation service consumers don't really care. Many of them when engaged with a service provider, they want the process to be simplified, and free/ease their mind from the details. Not everyone is interested in road names and route. That's why sometimes when we ask them which route they prefer, the response will be: "You taxi driver you dunno meh?"</p>
              <p>Learning the route without GPS will definitely makes my brain work harder and absorb more within a shorter period of time. However, I choose to enjoy the technology available and not going through the hardcore/ascetic way of learning.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, GPS can also be use as a physical evidence to prove that you will honestly ensure that the best possible route will be travelled when the driver and pax both don't know the way, especially when tourist is on board.</p>
              <p>The time before handphone was invented, people can remember many phone/pager number in their mind, how about now? I have oftenly see people using calculator for simple calculation. Time change, so does people of different generation.</p>

              <p>Company cannot purely employ FT, but the ratio was 1 SG against 4 FT. Those in the middle management and below, in a lot of times, have to bite the teeth from bosses telling them that they can be easily replaced by FT at a lower rate. Some stay on as many places they go for interview either prefer FT or getting a SG at lower salary/ jr post,  so that they can employ more cheap FT workers. This trend caught my attention since 1999, but it wasn't so disturbing like now, as I was a young warrior in the working society. </p>
              <p>Are SG workers really holding their job well just because they 're simply employed or are they forcing themselves to work everyday until they find another way out? </p>

              <p>I'm very sure those degree holders will tune in to your frequency when you're their boss/superior. When I was holding a middle manangement position, many of my jr managers are either degree/dip holders. At that period of time, my formal school education level was only 'sex 2'. I earned my dip through  2 yrs part-time somewhile ago. I have met many 'humble' degree holders who are able to communicate with ah beng like me. </p>

              until i see car also want to vomit. I have heard some omo drive
              more than 600km in a day, really don't know how they did it. Most
              probably sweeping non-stop and seldom queque.</p>
              <p>If hirer is night shift, day shift should perform task meant for
              day time slots. I don't think anyone should expect another shift

              <p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"></span>As mentioned above, it's reffering to <span style="color: #ff0000;">me,</span> myself as an individual.  There're lot's of day shift drivers who makes the same amount of $$$ if not more, as compare to night shift drivers.</p>
              <p>Usually after weekend/ holiday, night entertainment locations will have less pax and long queque of taxi after 12am. There are night shift workers and those who have to work very late to clear the backlog before/after weekend. Some become sick after too much of F&amp;B entertainment over the weekend/holiday until have to go A&amp;E for MC, and etc. I'm lucky enough to discover some locations and timing under my list for sweeping after 12 am.</p>
              <p>Just like last night, everywhere I sweep in town also green lantern until I found one location either pick and go/ queque not more than 15 mins all the way from 10pm till 2am. I have lost count of the number of trips I made from there last night. </p>

People are getting active on the streets again. The stamina I have build during the time when I was an OMO, enable me to fully utilize my 12 hrs night shift now for maximising income.</p>
              <p>For the past weeks, quality FT was missing from those ORQ, Shenton way, Jurong Island, Tuas, and  etc. Advance call was rarely seen or taken up quickly like the speed of lightning during that period, for both morning and evening session. I believe those taxi drivers who specialize in those areas started to venture into other areas, including my favourite places, and it got me nervous. Now think back, no FT also chiak lak.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Aiyo, in this world there are 2 types of genius, one born with it, one built to be, if you look at some students, some did badly in primary school, then suddenly sex 2 that time, did very well and all the way to honor degree and so on, some start primary one only, all way nos 1, bo horse run. This is what chinese said, kai jiao.</p>
              <p>So, some of us only by 40 or 60yo then kai jiao, some forever never kai jiao and still gambling and flirting like a kids.</p>
              <p>I have to admit that most of us including me, are not genius from the start, but thru the years of experiences and knowning, some of us, like you, might have become a genius, genius in a way of living, way of talking, way of settling problem, and also many others.</p>
              <p>However, genius are also the culprit of one failure if one do overly exceed one pride and ego in it. There is still a need to work hard.</p>
              <p>So, for simplicity, again I can put it into 4 catergories</p>
              <p>1. Genius + working hard = very successful in life</p>
              <p>2. Genius + not working hard = lead a normal and sometime frustrating life</p>
              <p>3. Not Genius but work hard = Normal in life ( like me), gong gong blur blur also good</p>
              <p>4. Not Genius and yet not working hard = God bless you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To identify if you are a genius or not, as long as you can keng here and there, you are a genius, it is only a matter of whether you can keng correctly, legally and luckily enough or not. I alway keng here and there, but end up also OBK...knn</p>

              <p>By hook or by crook, you still have to surrender IC lah, I know where you are coming from...you might be a genius, but I am a genie in a bottle..you want to tell those who promote TD to please do not pacify the glory of taxis driving, but rather tell the truth of how stressful and hard work taxis driver is, that is good.</p>
              <p>But the extend of protraying it, had at times, went far beyong a decent description of a honest TD doing a honest living. It might end up for people who are at the lower rung of the society coming into taxis driving or those still driving to think otherwise, and that can be a demotivation factor.</p>
              <p>It is ok to have you own opinon, but give a thot for others who are still driving and making a living out of it,...i know driving taxis is a fark up job, but I will not go and tell a TD that his job is a fark type one...that should be the graceful way we face our comarade at work.</p>
