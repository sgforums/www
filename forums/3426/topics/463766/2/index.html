              <p>Ya lah....how much can you earn outside? And outside job where
              can everyday see money? Think of it this way. If you work outside
              earning $3000 nett but if you have a car then you will be left with
              only less then $2000 after paying the installment and maintainence
              and fuel. But if you drive taxi can nett $3000 or more. Then with
              the taxi as your personal transport your are actually grossing
              almost $5000. Unless you earn $5000 outside then I suggest you
              quite driving taxi.</p>

              <p>Be careful of over reliance on GPS. Road speed on GPS might not be accurate, so you better learn this by heart. All roads 60kmh, some 70kmh. Expressway 90lmh most places except some 80kmh esp near camera zones.</p>
              <p>Nicoll Highway is 70kmh and very dangerous for overhead TP, the same for KJE (90), PIE (near Toa Payoh, Bedok and Tampines, usually 80). CTE and SLE usually dont have but TPE near Sengkang or Jln kayu.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's no big deal. I have a degree but lost my job at 48 years old. Foreign talents are replacing us even in executive jobs. I've passed my taxi licence in August last year but fortunately I found something which I can do at home that pays me the same as an average taxi driver. However, this year there are changes to my home based job. I will try for another 3 months and if things don't work out I will have to make use of my taxi licence.</div>

              <p>My brother, if you look at the Q for cdg taxis alone, the statistic will tell you that recent changes disfavour taxi driver more or the public at large.</p>
              <p>Wages are depressed by foreign entry into our employment market, aren't TD better off than bus drivers who hold 4 to 4a driving licence, aren't TD better than some crane drivers or delivery drivers?</p>
              <p>Inflation affect everyone, and as it compound thru the years, things become more and more expensive, but then people still can afford to buy a $130 aussie wine at CQ which cost only $20 at NTUC fairprice, but share cab to go home is a tell sign of lavishing spending or spending on tomorrow earn money.</p>
              <p>To the bosses and govt, the working class including TD must be alway make hungry, with a hungry mind, they will plough the field for foods, and that is how things work in a capitalist society or in another word a money society.</p>

              </p><p>In today's world, many people only concern about the objective and outcome of result. Tactics? I find that the young generation service consumers don't really care. Many of them when engaged with a service provider, they want the process to be simplified, and free/ease their mind from the details. Not everyone is interested in road names and route. That's why sometimes when we ask them which route they prefer, the response will be: "You taxi driver you dunno meh?"</p>
              <p>Learning the route without GPS will definitely makes my brain work harder and absorb more within a shorter period of time. However, I choose to enjoy the technology available and not going through the hardcore/ascetic way of learning.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, GPS can also be use as a physical evidence to prove that you will honestly ensure that the best possible route will be travelled when the driver and pax both don't know the way, especially when tourist is on board.</p>
              <p>The time before handphone was invented, people can remember many phone/pager number in their mind, how about now? I have oftenly see people using calculator for simple calculation. Time change, so does people of different generation.</p>

              my 2 cents worth:
              The percentage of degree holders is very high in Korea/Taiwan..many grads end up with jobs tat don need degree or high paper qualification..there was a detailed report in ST abt situation in these 2 countries..The Korean President even tell its ppl no need to chase papers so much..start out earlier to work to avoid dissapointmt after all the $ effort spent. There straight A students fm top unis may not able to get any job in big co. like samsung..depend on X Factor. My son told me alot grads in korea cudnt find suitable jobs n turned to gaming or esports they call it. alot top proffessional gamers come fm korea.
              Sg is going same way..more unis n more parents afford to send kids overseas study..
               
              .
              I feel the young shud continue to chase the highest education they can attain.
              The skills and knowledge aquired in the process can be used in yr daily life n watever job. .biz u do..n if the job you end up with do not need the cert/degree. .shud not consider it wasted

              <p>You can be ITE graduates, diploma or degree holder, but if you fall thru the crack of the society or that you simply do not enjoy the world of corporate politics and struggling, TD can be an option, it is not merely to escape this and that, one chooses what one like, even if you give me a GM position with a 10k per month income, but the work is so stressful with so much arrowing, I prefer TD.</p>
