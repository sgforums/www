              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"> Hi everyone! Sorry for being away for awhile. Signed up as a hirer with cdg, kenah a 2 1/2 yr taxi, but condition worst than some 5 yrs old taxi i had driven b4.</p>
              <p>Started as an omo, tried all different hours and patterns until totally burned out. Tried to find a day relief, however those day reliefs I found are not suitable, some can only drive 5 days/wk, some don't want to go servicing, some want pick and send. End up me drive day shift and got a night relief who drive 7days/wk. </p>
              <p>Day shift is really not for me. Now SotongKing became BBQ Sotong. Face black black, so are my arms and hands. Morning many many pax go Jurong, Tuas, and ORQ area, either bad jam or have to empty cab back all the way to HDB areas. No CDB surcharge, peak hour too short, sigh..... really disadvantage for me, as I'm not the fast hand fast leg type.</p>

Yes I know, I'm dam lousy! I hate to go offices, factories, and sending people to work, most of them look so gloomy. Recently I returned the taxi to cdg and becomes a night relief again, I feel so relaxed and driving taxi becomes enjoyable again, another thing is.... my nett income increased back to normal.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">   </p>

              <p>I missed the happenning of x'mas eve, as I was still driving day shift, really eat grass. Luckily I returned the taxi on 28th December, still on time to participate in the night driving for New Year Eve, which was a very enjoyable work day, the first time I feel like a star as a taxi driver. From far away, peoples already start waving for my attention. Collections wasn't as good as I expected, however I really enjoy the excitment of being part of the event in providing services to the public. The first time that I really feel valued as a transport service provider.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              </p><p>After 6 mths OTR as a  taxi driver.... I'm now more tolerant to people horn, middle finger and highbeam me. However, there's one thing which keeps annoying me. Whenever pax see a young taxi driver like me, most of them buckle up their seat belt when board, even at the back seat. Hai yah, sometimes I told myself, good also lah, anyway it's required by the law.</p>
              <p>Pax keeps asking me why so young become a taxi driver, is 39 yrs old really too young? So ang mo even thought that I'm in my 20's, don't know to be happy or angry.</p>
              <p>On new year's eve, around 12am I saw many taxi quequeing at Orchard area taxi stand waiting for durian to drop, so decided to charge in to the northbridge rd area, once turned in to north boat quay road, wow, huat ah!!!! Too bad, I change shift at 5am, last pax at 4am, after that rush back to pump diesel and wash car, how I wish can handover at 8am. </p>
              <p>On the New year day and yesterday, I believe many foreigner still not back from holiday. Usually advance call will be flooded in the drivers' portal for morning and evening time slots, but these 2 days very few are available, once I try to bid for it, it's already taken up by a faster finger.</p>
              <p>Today is my real off day after months of driving, song song till Jurong. No need to throw rental or cover cost for resting, really peace of mind. Went to watch "Taxi Taxi", but dissapointed with the script and story arrangement. I was expecting them to highlight more on the life of a TD. At the end of the show, I was asking myself what did I went through for the past hour. I spent a blank hour sitting in a big dark room staring on the screeen feeling like an idiot.    </p>

              <p>If hirer is night shift, day shift should perform task meant for day time slots. I don't think anyone should expect another shift driver to distrupt his/her sleeping order. </p>

              <p>Some OMO morning tan chiak  lot's of Bt Timah - ORQ advance call, and evening the other way round as they want to stay around CBD, but these 2 pick up/end point are the places I hate most. That goes to Tuas and Juroung Island too.</p>
              <p>Actually, at one period of time, settling down on shift from 6pm - 9am works well for me, as I can sleep 2 hrs in between those quite hrs. Howerver things get messy when I start to send my wife for work everyday at 9.30am. Most times have to empty cab all the way back to CCK to pick her up then send her to Bugis and empty cab back to CCK to end shift. Total time spent about 1 1/2 hr.</p>
              <p>The main reason why I gave up OMO is due to unable to get a good quality sleep whe home. Morning around 9am, my wife's alarm clock will ring, and more noise of her activity follows, night she'll be watching TV and using computer from 11pm - 2/3am. How to sleep well?</p>
              <p>Secondly, the taxi was giving me lot's of problems, send in workshop thrice within the first 2 weeks.</p>
              <p>I might consider to be a Hirer/OMO again in future, only if I can ensure that I would be able to get good quality rest after end shift, and the taxi that I sign up must be a totally new taxi. The new i40 looks good and safe fuel by 35% as compare to Sonata, still considering myself for the waiting list.</p>

              <p>When I first started to drive taxi 6 mths back, I just wanted to look see look see while searching for employment. Guess what, I didn't go for any job interview or look into jobs classified section at all. It's fine for me now being a TD, but sometimes I'm just worried that I'm going to carry on my life this way till I become really too old for employment.</p>

              <p>Being OMO also got it's own benefits and enjoyment. In my whole life till now, I have never been able to afford a car before. Having a car all to myself parking near my house is consider a new luxury lifestyle experience for me and my family members. We was really enjoying the conveniency of the 'fabricated' car ownership for a period of time, especially my son.</p>
              <p>If I'm able to organize my work and rest hours more orderly in future, and get a totally new taxi, I might be an OMO again in the future. </p>

If you work outside earning $3000 nett but if you have a car then you will be left with only less then $2000 after paying the installment and maintainence and fuel. But if you drive taxi can nett $3000 or more. Then with the taxi as your personal transport your are actually grossing almost $5000.

              <p>After 6 mths OTR as a  taxi driver.... I'm now more
              tolerant to people horn, middle finger and highbeam me. However,
              there's one thing which keeps annoying me. Whenever pax see a young
              taxi driver like me, most of them buckle up their seat belt when
              board, even at the back seat. Hai yah, sometimes I told myself,
              good also lah, anyway it's required by the law.</p>
              <p>Pax keeps asking me why so young become a taxi driver, is 39 yrs
              old really too young? So ang mo even thought that I'm in my 20's,
              don't know to be happy or angry.</p>
              <p>On new year's eve, around 12am I saw many taxi quequeing at
              Orchard area taxi stand waiting for durian to drop, so decided to
              charge in to the northbridge rd area, once turned in to north boat
              quay road, wow, huat ah!!!! Too bad, I change shift at 5am, last
              pax at 4am, after that rush back to pump diesel and wash car, how I
              wish can handover at 8am. </p>
              <p>On the New year day and yesterday, I believe many foreigner
              still not back from holiday. Usually advance call will be flooded
              in the drivers' portal for morning and evening time slots, but
              these 2 days very few are available, once I try to bid for it, it's
              already taken up by a faster finger.</p>
              <p>Today is my real off day after months of driving, song song till
              Jurong. No need to throw rental or cover cost for resting, really
              peace of mind. Went to watch "Taxi Taxi", but dissapointed with the
              script and story arrangement. I was expecting them to highlight
              more on the life of a TD. At the end of the show, I was asking
              myself what did I went through for the past hour. I spent a blank
              hour sitting in a big dark room staring on the screeen feeling like
              an idiot.    </p>
