              <p>To address the exploitation by taxis companies, you cannot work alone, moreoever, you need to be farking factual clear in your statement with facts and figure (proof) to counter act on all these companies.</p>
              <p>By the way, not only taxis companies are exploiting their Cabbies, all organisation in Singapore are exploiting their workers and executives, if not, how to survive. There lies a skill in management on how to upturn the downturn, and the only way for Taxi company to upturn their poor performances is to reduce cost and increase profit? So how to increase profit, for them, it is from hirers, nothing else. If that motherfarker can upturn the downturn, then he or she gets all the credit and life goes on, by and large, whatever methods to do it, they will do it.</p>
              <p>Just stop for while to think, why TC being good in the past had suddenly turn for the worst? why? CNG up?</p>
              <p>Of course you need to have a force to repel these exploitation, and to do that, is not going to be a one man pool man show, he can keep going on and expose this and that of the bad of certain Taxi company, but you think they give a damn on what he is doing, to them, he is just an empty vessel.</p>
              <p>The gay group in singapore had recently done a peaceful and licenced show of pink dot at hong lim, first year, only few hundred turn up, govt bo chap, last year, about 10 thousands join hand to show the pink light, govt noted but still bo chap, this year 50,000++ turn up and show the pink dot, govt now chap alot and see thru the laws serious that govern gay group or that why is there an increase of gayish in singapore?</p>

              <p>I donot  call TC move as desparate move, from a management perspectives, it is a marketing skill that they are pay to show, having 7 companies fighting each other for hirers or reliefs can only benefit us, as TD.</p>
              <p>What Pool man should do, if he dare to venture further, is to create a unity of TD, another platform from NTA, like SIA, they got pilot union, staff union, ground crew union, SATs union and so on, but our TD only got one union, the rule is simple, Union can be set up with only 7 people, register yourself with the relevant court and tell NTUC that you want to be an affliate of them, they will provide you all the help with professional industrial officer and even legal advices.</p>
              <p>From then on, you recruit members, giving them the social benefit under NTUC, as you go along, you address member problem, and publicitly, you can condemn a company and be put on the spot light in the front page, and not long, you become the President of SPTU, Singapore Pool Taxis Union.</p>

              <p>i have seen the letter and the story myself.</p>
              <p>since i deal with motor insurance plus claim case. i would stand on ah pool side</p>
              <p>his is just a normal case happen to private car owner which not a very serious matter at all</p>
              <p>the $5000 was too much unless TC want to show the insurance letter/document asking for such amount which i doubt.</p>
              <p>so fr only i met poolman 3 times only , 2 time at makan session but just some chating, 1 time is where i saw the letter myself when i got things to pass himself. so i am not here to carry anyone balls just expressing my view.</p>
              <h4>poolman case is that he still need to pay but not $5k</h4>

              <p>Despite hearing a lot of complaints on her,  I used to respect this "lady" a lot as i see how she can handle the running of the company and so many TD. When i was hit by someone from behind and move forward to touch another car, i kenna 2140 also lan lan.  But the most recent case is really too much !</p>
              <p>I change from Wish to Chevorlet. She told me will be 31 Mar.  I said ok.  On 20 Mar, she called me said you can return today before 5 pm and collect new Taxi tmr. From chatting with other, I knew there were some ppl withdraw from the list and i was put into the list.  But i miss calculated I will be short of One day (before 6 month) to return on 20 Mar and they forfiet my $300. I told her this is not fair as I did not throw key and it was a last minute changes.  I have to lose out the Wish incentive for that month, Chevorlet incentive for 3 weeks but i got no complaint becos i wanted the change. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">This $300 also want to eat.  </span> </p>
              <p>I now respect a Prostitude better than her. Do you really need to "earn" this type of money from us who is running daily on the road for hours hours.  The Boss might be driving a Porsche, HE might think his is successful. BUT to make this sort of money to be rich, he can only be happy in his own world. Other people will see him with no character.</p>

              <p><br>i suspect you did not lose your case, just take change to makan the money.</p>
              <p>base on your case , worst to worst the fault is divided by various party, cannot be 100%. so far such case claim i handle never 100% n. even if the front car report you hit him first before the rear car hit you also cannot be 100% at fault on you,</p>
