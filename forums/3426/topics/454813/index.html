              <p><em>SINGAPORE: A man has been sentenced to eight months' jail for breaking the middle finger of a taxi driver. <br><br>45-year-old S. Gopikrishnan, who works as a credit collection officer, pleaded guilty to one count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to 58-year-old Pang Weng Fong on 3 May 2011.<br><br>Gopikrishnan, who has also been ordered to pay S$120 in compensation to Pang, is appealing against his conviction. <br><br>The incident took place near the Bartley Road exit of Kaki Bukit Flyover.<br><br>Gopikrishnan cut across Pang's path. A female passenger was in the taxi at that point.<br><br>Pang sounded his horn and Gopikrishnan pointed his middle finger at Pang in response.<br><br>Both drivers then parked their cars at the roadside.<br><br>Pang tried to take a picture of Gopikrishnan.<br><br>Gopikrishnan swore at Pang and threatened to punch him if he did not hand over the camera.<br><br>During the spat, Gopikrishnan pulled Pang's hand and twisted his middle finger in the process.<br><br>The prosecutor described Gopikrishnan as "aggressive" and highlighted that considerable force had been used. <br><br>He called for a jail term of up to nine months and added that a deterrent sentence had to be imposed to deter "such loutish behaviour."<br><br>In his mitigation, Gopikrishnan's lawyer said that his client was a first offender and suffered from a medical condition.<br><br>Noting this, the judge spared Gopikrishnan from caning.<br><br>But the judge added that the incident was initiated by him and it was "clear" that a jail term was warranted. <br><br>Gopikrishnan also had his bail increased from S$5,000 to S$10,000.<br><br>For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, he could have been jailed up to ten years, and fined or caned.</em></p>

              <p>See can start a business to help end suffering for a low fee. Might take off. Old folks with no money will take it(payment via cpf nomination), terminal illness patients will take it, those lost $$ at casino will take it(but they won;t pay you). We just set up the place and arrange for a glorious end it there. Might barely get away with it legally.</p>

              <p>copied from yayoo link: In Singapore, it's a sorry state to be old.<br>1. No a chance when we're young to collect anything; the money are all spent on necessities for living - transportation, utilities bill, children education, car loan and above the big ticket item of a housing loan, maybe still paying the mortage when you're old. No money to spent on collecting fashion items and letting fashion to catchup with you the 2nd time around.<br>2. The lines on my face started to appear when I'm in the fourties; they're all worry lines not wrinkle lines. Worry about how to survive to pay all the bills.<br>3. You may be wiser but try applying for a job after you're retrenched. You don't even get a reply!<br>4. You'll have more stress. Every morning when you wake up, you're not worrying about death but how to survive for the rest of the day. How to have money to buy what you need. At the same time when you look at the sum of CPF money still locked up in the CPF board, it makes you worry more as whether you will ever see it. Afterall those are your hard earned money accummulate through blood, sweet and tears. You'll feel even more stressful when you fall sick that you wish you are dead when you see the medical bills.<br>5. Yes, we do have discount for seniors on Tuesday, but they are so little from NUTC Fairprice that it is not even enough to cover your bus or train fare. Still you try your best to get at any savings. You even have to try to remember prices at the various store to see which give you the better deals. Maybe that's the way to make your brain stay active, &amp; some excercise with your legs.<br>6. How to be cheeky. All our peers are in the same boat. What's there to joke about!<br>7. How to be confident? The government thinks you're a burden to the country even though you have toiled in the past to contribute to the growth of the nations. Our CPF contributions were lower and all these so-called re-employment schemes are out to limit your pay rise and prospects for further advancement. Do you think you can stay back in the same company under such schemes; your juniors will start to get back at you.</p>
