              <p>Tiger, Cebu and Firefly is at Budget.<br>Thai Tiger Airways flights not confirmed.<br><br><br>Their fleet plans not up.<br>But from what I've heard in the grapevine, the flights to Thailand from SIN would be operated by Tiger. This info is still subject to change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So we won't really see Thai Tiger as a new carrier into SIN soon, but Tiger(SIN) would be operating the flights.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lion Air flies the B739ER to SIN, and though the parking space at BT is supposedly able to take the A320 family an B737 family, I think the winglet and wingspan/tailspan is bigger than the space allocated for one booth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AirAsia is not at BT because BT simply cannot accommodate them(their fleet, and multiple requirements of gate space). AirAsia is considered the saviour of T1, because without them there, T1 would be very deserted.</p>

              <p>Yes and no. Landing fee charge would always be the same. It would most likely be ground servicing which would cost more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AirAsia and Jetstar have launched a partnership(regardless how ineffective it would be) for fleet expansion and the like. It is almost akin to a soft-merger of ideology. That is why you see AirAsia and Jetstar at T1. Jetstar(3K) is at T1 to provide feeder traffic to their Jetstar Australia(JQ) and Qantas. With the Jetstar and AirAsia agreement, there is alll the more a reason for AirAsia to stay at T1.</p>

              <p>Tks! Fryderyk.</p>
              <p>For me as a day shift TD, I usually choose T1 becos T1 has got lesser Q line within the taxi zone. one look from main road will know roughly how many taxis are there.</p>
              <p>I dun quite like T2 becos of the 3 long stretches of Q line. double q somtimes. The polution also quite bad inside.</p>
              <p>T3? no prob. I like the curry puff from the canteen!</p>
              <p>Budget? tried once! never go in there unless need to pee and ta-pau copi O.</p>

              <p>Hmm, really pick and go situation after 8 pm to 2 am?  I thought queue is always long at airport. </p>
              <p>I used to like Terminal 2, but I had a bad experience last week, think is on Monday.  I reached T2 slightly before midnight, T1 queue was very long, stretching to the junction to T3, so I go to T2.  I think it shows that there are 3 flights arriving at T2 (cannot really remember).  The queue was slow, and after queuing for 1 plus hour, it practically stop moving.  I started to see taxi started to leave the queue and the queue move is practically based on TD leaving queue, not base on TD getting pax.  Till about 2 am, I was not far from the queue, but it really not moving, then finally someone told me that there is no more flights.  I go inside the airport to look at the flight information and indeed, next arriving flight is at 6 am at T2!  So, I finally decided to leave airport. </p>
              <p>I had the impression there is always arriving flights every hour but that experience prove me wrong!  Now I roughly browse through the arrival flight details from (http://www.changiairport.com/flight-info/flight-status/passenger-arrivals) before leaving home.  Good luck all!</p>

              <p>T2 is by far the quietest terminal for inbound arrivals after midnight.<br>Three flights on a Monday morning, two from SQ, and one from Shenzhen Airlines.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img576/6677/picture1ed.png" alt=""></p>
              <p>The situation at T2 is worsened as arrivals can be at T2 or T3, and the cycle so happens that most of the morning departures occur from T3, which otherwise would inbound for T2. So planes park over at T3 overnight, instead of at T2 and having to tow them across the bridge for their morning departure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The two SQ flights, one from BKK and the other from Shanghai PDG, have tremendous amount of connecting pax. Only a few would come out to the taxi stand, while the rest stay in the transit area or head over to the T3 transit area for sleep for their onward connections which would mostly be the first flight out in the early morning(mostly to Australia for the BKK and PDG pax, and Europe for the BKK pax).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shenzhen Airlines uses a 737 to SIN, and carries only at most 150 pax per flight, and thus the lack of traffic.</p>

              <p>Large planes and many arrivals/departures does not really mean a lot of people coming out of the transit area. A lot of these people transit to onward destinations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you all notice by now, the 5p.m to 7p.m arrivals and departure madness by the airlines in T1 is a façade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Qantas - British Airways - Qantas - Jetstar - Qantas - Qantas - British Airways - KLM - Air France - Qantas - Finnair(soon to be) combo yields "a lot of pax". But almost none of them "come out".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still think the best would be if you all target the AirAsia arrivals @ T1. Not many people connect to other flights on AirAsia or other carriers in SIN, they usually do that in their hubs of KUL, BKK and CGK Jakarta. The traffic is almost always point-to-point in SIN, and not a hub operation. To a certain extent, Jetstar also.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ho sey ah, that one very few connecting pax. Almost 270 pax one flight come out, but at 1a.m plus. Tried and tested. This flight usually delay a bit out of ICN. Almost always pull into T3, only once out of like 30 times in T2. I frequent flier on this particular route, that is why I know that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SQ11 arrival from Tokyo Narita NRT | Los Angeles LAX another super one. They use the 744, but this one a bit more connecting pax, especially the Jiponese ones who connect at T3 for the earliest morning flight out to SYD, MEL and PER. But on the whole still ripe for picking.</p>
