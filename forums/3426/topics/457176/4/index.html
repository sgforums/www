              <p>For discussion sake may I ask when u say cashless, does it apply to taxi payment or in general? </p>
              <p>The word future is so abstract, wat is yr timeframe? 1 yr, 3 yrs or 10 yrs? The idea of cashless has been ard for ages but why is cash still being circulated? </p>
              <p>AS a TD I'm not too concerned with wat the future holds, I would rather think abt now. When the future finally arrives then we talk abt future, which by then will be now. </p>

              Magoo!!</span><span>"</span></p>
              <p>For discussion sake may I ask when u say cashless, does it apply
              to taxi payment or in general? </p>
              <p>The word future is so abstract, wat is yr timeframe? 1 yr, 3 yrs
              or 10 yrs? The idea of cashless has been ard for ages but why is
              cash still being circulated? </p>
              <p>AS a TD I'm not too concerned with wat the future holds, I would
              rather think abt now. When the future finally arrives then we talk
              abt future, which by then will be now. </p>

              <p>Yr policing instinct makes you an ideal candidate for a moderator here. If not yr yr gross limitation, I would recommend you for this top job.</p>
              <p>I already said u not in the same league here, u dun believe. Whatever people post here, you would just vaguely understand the subject but just grab at it and start barking, most often that not, u barking at the wrong tree.</p>
              <p>As a moderator, you will actually be doing more harm than good.</p>
              <p>When he meant by cashless here is people using card instead of cash. </p>
              <p>To put in plain simple "at your level" English, example, got of 100 trips, maybe 10 people is paying by CARD while the other 90 pay CASH. What he mean is in the near future, more and more people is paying by CARD.</p>
              <p>If you cannot or is unwilling to accept CARD, that means out of 10 pax, u cannot do 1 business. Let's say if in the future the number of people paying by CARD increase to 50, that means u will have only a 50-50 chance of doing the business while those who can take card can take 100%</p>
              <p>By asking why is cash being circulated, I take it that u understand the term cashless to be no more cash is being used in the society.</p>
              <p>We dun have to reach that stage. Just 50% of people paying by CARD is enough to push those people not accepting CARD into the corner. Remember, you only have a 50-50 chance of taking that pax.</p>

              <p>Why do u ppl say CDG is the real benefit from the recent fare
                      increase?</p>
              <p>All the full fare increase goes to driver right? </p>
              <p>what CDG take back?</p>
              <p>In fact, the company "suffer" from the decrease in calls during
                      that period.</p>
              <p>After the increase, comes the decrease in diesel, not once but
                      three times right?</p>
              <p>All this while, does the rental increase? NO right? So where
                      does the benefits comes from?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, this 65m is already profit long long ago, the increase
                      got nothing to do with it. In fact, the increases might have eaten
                      part of the profit which might be more.</p>
              <p>I think one should know that the big part of the revenue came
                      from the call centre.</p>
              <p>In fact, the least profit came from leasing out the taxi to
                      hirers with reliefs. These people really whack the cab 24 hours non
                      stop which results in higher servicing cost.</p>
              <p>Maybe the most lucrative sources comes from those hirers OMG
                      with less than 100 km clock a day. As long as money(rental) comes
                      in swee swee everyday, who is making noise? This is the part that
                      LTA got to step in to handle, sooner or later.</p>
              <p>So in conclusion, does the increase really makes CDG richer or
                      otherwise?</p>

              <p>Going into credit and cards is also a cost to the bank, it still need to maintain and issue free annual fees cards, I will take it as an option for businesses, given the open options of paying, you get your pax without even the need to maintain the line, the gps, the equipment and the IT applications which also need to be maintain.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is up to individual different angles of perspectives, the end cost is still the customers. From the perspectives of the Taxi companies, of course, given all taxis get rented out and income become stagnated, the option for extra income will be deem as productivity.</p>
              <p>From the Taxi driver point of view, it allow us to handle  global customers within that terminal alone and that translate into better business.</p>
              <p>From the customer view, it give them the convienences and easier accountability thru their bank account.</p>
              <p>And from the banks view of point, it is business as usual</p>

              <p>What league are you talking abt uncle? Premier league or S league? Personally I prefer La Liga :) are you living in India whereby caste system still exist? Making sweeping statements and antangonizing others will naturally attract responses. It is you who is clouded by anger that barks aimlessly without understanding and mostly rebut with twisted points I must say.</p>
              <p>I am not a moderator and thanks for thinking I'm one but that's wat a forum is abt, discuss and exchange views be it pleasant or not. </p>
              <p>Pls do not explain to me wat cashless means as its a waste of bandwidth. Again you wanna degrade a discussion by explaining things at "my level and plain English". I must admit my command of English is no where near many pple here but still able to grasp most words. Problem starts when pple starts stringing words into sentences which sounds like barking or hissing like a rattlesnake which makes me ponder and hence I need to clarify via questions. </p>
              <p>You talk abt future trends, the future sounds very distant to me. If one day more and more pay by cashless, I'm sure many cabbies will accept it. Wat we should be concern is now and TDs in general are an adaptive lot. dun use future to bulldoze your argument for it sounds like leaders/bosses promising things that never materialize. </p>
              <p>Thank you for agreeing that we have not reach the stage whereby payment hasn't reach a saturation pt till cabbies can't ignore cashless payment. Till that day comes my man, we will adapt n accept but for now cash is still king. </p>
              <p>P.s. I wholeheartedly agree with rbs for not supporting cashless if there's nothing for us. </p>

              <p>I agreed with you on the following:</p>
              <p>Taxi Driver is Taxi Companies' customer</p>
              <p>Passenger is NOT Taxi Companies' customer but Taxi Driver's customers.</p>
              <p>Btw, u have yet to answer Red5xx question on whether you are TD but at this moment let's take it that you are.</p>
              <p>As u said "Customer is always right" right? Do u qualify your customers?</p>
              <p>Answer is both a YES and NO right?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">what are the qualification that TD use?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Too far - dun fetch</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">More than one person - dun fetch. (from someone here who taught me that 4 persons means 4 destinations)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Racial issue : for fear of racial discrimination, I will not touch on the "don't" but ang mo sure is a "must fetch" right? cos most of the time, short trip. and most of the time, got tips right?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Outside CBD dun fetch - no extra $3</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">No booking - dun fetch - no extra $3.30</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">best if got booking and CBD charges right?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Wheel chair pax - dun fetch, even tho they still pay the same fare right? but to u too troublesome.</span></p>
              <p>any one here who want to declare that he is not guilty of any of the above, I ask him dun talk cock.</p>
              <p>If you are a TD has got the "right" to choose your customers, why Taxi companies cannot leh?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Drivers who want to rent car to earn money but cannot pay rent on time?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Driver who dun take care of their car?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Drivers who overcharge pax?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Drivers who doesn't share the companies culture or image.</span></p>
              <p>Does Taxi companies has the right to choose not to have these customers? Answer is also a YES and a NO.</p>
              <p>The key issue is "Supply and demand"</p>
              <p>I know of LV members who die die refuse to help fetch hotel's staff home, just because of no call charge - $3. But once after midnight, the whole mindset change. These jobs are being grab like no body's business. Reason? after midnight amount of people taking cab decrease liao la.</p>
              <p>Look at the queue of pax at MBFC and Suntec City's four towers. From 5pm to 9pm, pax are literally begging for cab but even if they book, also cannot get one, while just outside, u can see green light taxi circling around waiting for calls for obvious reasons. But once past 10pm, the whole senario change right? Long queues of taxi can be seen at the same location as amount of pax decreases.</p>
              <p>Same here for Taxi companies - if companies got no takers, regulations is obviously more relax and TD can be seen in round neck Tee and even slippers. Even if pax complain, heard the the complain hotline in some companies is always engaged.</p>
              <p>So it's just the case of "supply and demand" right?</p>
              <p>CDG can afford to pick and choose their customers cos they got plenty outside waiting for them, same reason as at 3am, plenty of pax at Clark Quay for me to pick and choose. If u still thinking of customers is always right at this juncture, pick up someone who wants to go Woodlands now la.</p>

              <p>Customer is always right. Why they say this? Because the cutomer
              pays for it.</p>
              <p>For Taxi Company like CDG, who is the customer? Taxi Driver or
              Passenger?</p>
              <p>Answer is Taxi Driver.</p>
              <p>For Taxi Driver, who is the customer?</p>
              <p>Answer is Taxi Passenger.</p>
              <p>I am trying my best to break things down so you can
              understand.</p>
              <p>Now who is the millionare? Taxi Driver or Taxi Company?</p>
              <p>You argued that Taxi Company never increase fares for so many
              years.</p>
              <p>Who controls fare increases? Taxi Drivers or Taxi Companies?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Who is the millionare after all the increases?</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>People who really bother to read this thread should knows that my starting point is to say that the recent increase has got minimum impact on CDG's profit of $65m.</p>
              <p>In simpler terms, that mean even NO INCREASE, CDG already make that $65m liao.</p>
              <p>If u are talking on the actual effect of the increase, my opinion is that it actually bring down the figure instead of up, while means without the increase, the actual figure might be even $70m or more.</p>
              <p>After the increase, a significant decrease in calls is noted. Lesser people on road taking taxi too. Levy for current calls also decrease. Although advance calls goes up to $8, quantity of calls plunges. Can I ask where the increase in company's revenue came from?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So my point is "the recent price increase dun make the company richer" they already are there even without the increase.</span></p>
              <p>Another point of arguement is after the increase, more people joining in. More people joining in also must have taxi more them to drive. I got my cab BEFORE the price increase and the waiting time is already 3 months. This point is more valid for companies with lots of cab park in their premise but not CDG.</p>
              <p>But if you said more people joining in as relief, I can buy that point. But this point only benefit hirers who should find it easier to find relief and can even pick and choose, like me, heeheehee.</p>
              <p>The ony thing the company benefit is maybe with more relief drivers, the cab gets to be whack for longer hours which result in higher diesel sales but dun forget, it will also bring the cost of maintenance up due to more wear and tear.</p>

              <p>Bear in mind, my point of argument on that ADMIN FEE don't just
              appy to TD, it does influence the general public of Singaporean
              mindset.....</p>
              <p>Some time back, someone wrote in to ST forum on this, guess
              what's CDG reply?......<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cashless is just an alternative mode of
              payment, Customers do have the option to pay cash in order to avoid
              the 10% admin charges.......</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Than back on our yard, CDG make it compulsory to accept
              CASHLESS......throwing the PROBLEM for us to handle,
              FAIR?......</span></p>
              <p>Currently, people who don't mind paying card are those knn
              spending their Ah Gong money type.....ie company corporate card,
              PERSONAL CARD? Try telling my wife to do so.........</p>
              <p>SO, over the past few years, CDG farking aggressive on their
              CABCHARGE business......in time to come, HOPEFULLY it's became
              another powerful tool for them to have an edge over the
              market........</p>
              <p>During my Limousine Driving.......hourly disposal can amount to
              thousand of dollars, when pax want to pay by card, will tell them
              about the admin fee......they will ask, is it belong to your
              earning?......No! Than they rather pay me in CASH or
              CHEQUE.....YOUR HARDWORK SHOULDN'T BE SHARE BY SOMEBODY WHO DID
              NOTHING.......</p>

              <p>I really dunno how u see this to be a problem, no matter how I tried to put myself in your position.</p>
              <p>The charge is to the pax, not hidden but clearly stated. The pax got the choice to use or not to use it.</p>
              <p>But what problem are you talking about about u accepting cashless? U mean the few seconds it cost u to process the transaction?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">.YOUR HARDWORK SHOULDN'T BE SHARE BY SOMEBODY WHO DID NOTHING.......</span></span></p>
              <p>and what hard work are you talking about? The fees for the hard work in fetching your pax is in the taxi fare right? Your so called hard work is processing the cashless transaction? Are u saying you also want a cut of that in order to be fair?</p>
              <p>I got pax who wants to know who takes the $8 advance booking fees. If it's me, they say it's fair, if it all goes to the company, they say it's not. But when they know $1 goes to the company, they think it make sense cos without the company and the cost of maintaining the system, I would not even get to earn the taxi fare, not to mention the $1.</p>
              <p>But about a cut in the admin fee? i dunno. What's yr take Guys?</p>
