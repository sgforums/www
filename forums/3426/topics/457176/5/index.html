              <p>But what problem are you talking about about u accepting
              cashless? U mean the few seconds it cost u to process the

              <p>and what hard work are you talking about? The fees for the hard
              work in fetching your pax is in the taxi fare right? Your so called
              hard work is processing the cashless transaction? Are u saying you
              also want a cut of that in order to be fair?</p>
              <p>I got pax who wants to know who takes the $8 advance booking
              fees. If it's me, they say it's fair, if it all goes to the
              company, they say it's not. But when they know $1 goes to the
              company, they think it make sense cos without the company and the
              cost of maintaining the system, I would not even get to earn the
              taxi fare, not to mention the $1.</p>
              <p>But about a cut in the admin fee? i dunno. What's yr take

              <p>Of course, lah, you dun owe anyone a living and vice versa, no one owe you a living, you go in sign and hired a cab with your eyes open, they can show you pages of rules regulation and conditions, and like purchasing house, you just sign and sign, get the cab you wanted and start to ply the road for a living.</p>
              <p>Whatever provided inside your cab are tools for your usage, you want or do not want to use is up to you, but you hv to oblige the daily rental fees, be it in advance or credit.</p>
              <p>And FYI, they do not need a valid reason to terminate your contract, why do they need it, vehicle and license of business belong to them, not you. But becasue of ethnic and maybe publicity sake, good governance and management, they are more reasonable in that sense.</p>
              <p>You can check the employement, leasing and hiring laws, there is no obligation that employers or leasers to employ or rent it to you. A company can ask a worker to go anytime, it is the perogatives of the employers or the company.</p>

              <p>I think u got  both mixed up.</p>
              <p>what has calls got to do with cashless.</p>
              <p>Ya, taking calls is yr option. They need your support. But to say they are at your mercy, i dunno. I look at the way advance calls come in. I thought I was fast in taking it, split seconds, but they are all gone in a flash. Obvious, not many people think like you.</p>
              <p>As for me, i not so excited to take calls nowadays, too much red tapes. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for accepting cashless, I dun think as a CDG driver, u even have that option. At yr mercy? you are joking right? If customer complain, be prepared anytime to find a new company. Check out if not accepting cashless goes against company regulation which can leads to termination?</p>

              <p>I think a more accurate figure should come from the TD himself.</p>
              <p>end of the day, just count how many pax he got to reject or been rejected by them because he cannot or dun want to accept cashless.</p>
              <p>remember, every one he did, it means a loss business opportunity which he got to get another to replace right? Hope the figure is not too high.</p>

              <p><span>u want a cut of that 10%? u wait long long ok! If

              <p>I just love it when pple starts making such comments
                  kakakakakakakaka. I've learn from numerous lessons to "never say
                  never". If that day ever comes pls dun hide behind your keyboard
                  ya. </p>
              <p>When one operates in a non-cashless manner they are prepared for
                  rejections, dun need you to worry for them. </p>
              <p>again you say future...... By then <span style="color: #ff0000;">I might not be ard or not
                  driving taxi..</span> Let's be more pragmatic and talk abt now. Mark your
                  words? I sincerely hope you know the difference between being
                  confident and arrogant. Remember Sun Tze's said arrogance is the
                  demise of many generals. </p>
              <p>I still reject cashless for your info.</p>

              <p>u obviously never learn to say "never say never accept cashless".</p>
              <p>Ya you are right! this day will come. When cashless seems inevitable and u got to be left behind, quiting is an expected option as a facing saving one.</p>

              <p><br>What i face usually are paxs asking can pay by nets or credit card. and i told pax i dont have such facilities, most still pay by cash or i suggest to drive them to the nearest atm nearby their location.</p>
              <p>I realise one thing, most paxs that usually pay by cashless only onboard than realise  and ask if can pay by cashless or those realise wallet not enuf cash and ask to pay cashless, so i usually also drive them to atm or their home to collect cash. These are the 2 scenario i encounter the most</p>
              <p>Outright reject usually pretty rare or i would say non for me so far during peak hours where demand for taxis are high. Even if got rejection the next pax in the Q i also can take</p>
              <p>In fact i face most of my rejections after midnight, thats why i say it only crucial for me after midnight. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end its how i handle such cashless paxs to convince them to take my cab.</p>
