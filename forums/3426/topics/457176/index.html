              CDG 3 mths net profit is $65m.
              After fare hike it attracted more &amp; more new drivers(taking new taxis) so much so that these bew drivers are having hard time to look for relief.
              
              They are all mislead that driving taxi earns even more money w fare hike.
              
              But now too late for them to learn the lesson,retutn taxi befoe 1 yr penalty is $3k.

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: ComfortDelGro has posted a second quarter net profit of $65.0 million, up 8.5 per cent year-on-year. <br><br>Revenue rose 5 per cent to $884.9 million.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The world's second largest land transport company says its taxi business accounted for the bulk of the increase in sales.</span></strong></span><br><br>For
               the half year ended June 30, 2012, net profit grew 7.7 per cent to 
              $118.5 million, while revenue increased by 5.7 per cent to $1.74 
              billion.<br><br>That brought earnings per share for the first half to 5.66 cents.<br><br>ComfortDelGro's
               Chief Executive Officer, Mr Kua Hong Pak, said: "We continued to grow 
              our revenue and profit in the quarter despite the impact of cost 
              pressures, particularly in the Singapore bus and rail businesses. We 
              will continue to work hard at growing our topline while staying vigilant
               on costs." <br><br>Currently, overseas ventures account for 40.8 per 
              cent of group revenue. ComfortDelGro says it aims to derive 70 per cent 
              of its total revenue from overseas in the medium term. <br><br>Notably, 
              overseas profit contribution accounted for 95.1 per cent of group bus 
              operating profit. Overseas bus operating profit increased $1.2 million 
              in the second quarter.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">That has helped to mitigate, but not fully
               offset the operating loss from its bus business in Singapore. The core 
              scheduled bus business under SBS Transit in Singapore suffered an 
              operating loss of $4.8 million in the second quarter on higher staff and
               depreciation costs. </span></span></strong><br><br>The company expects revenue from Singapore 
              bus and rail to increase from growth in rider-ship. It added that "in 
              general pressures on costs will continue to be felt."<br><br>It declared an interim dividend of 2.9 cents a share, up from 2.7 cents this time last year.</span></span></p>

              <p>Why do u ppl say CDG is the real benefit from the recent fare increase?</p>
              <p>All the full fare increase goes to driver right? </p>
              <p>what CDG take back?</p>
              <p>In fact, the company "suffer" from the decrease in calls during that period.</p>
              <p>After the increase, comes the decrease in diesel, not once but three times right?</p>
              <p>All this while, does the rental increase? NO right? So where does the benefits comes from?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, this 65m is already profit long long ago, the increase got nothing to do with it. In fact, the increases might have eaten part of the profit which might be more.</p>
              <p>I think one should know that the big part of the revenue came from the call centre.</p>
              <p>In fact, the least profit came from leasing out the taxi to hirers with reliefs. These people really whack the cab 24 hours non stop which results in higher servicing cost.</p>
              <p>Maybe the most lucrative sources comes from those hirers OMG with less than 100 km clock a day. As long as money(rental) comes in swee swee everyday, who is making noise? This is the part that LTA got to step in to handle, sooner or later.</p>
              <p>So in conclusion, does the increase really makes CDG richer or otherwise?</p>

              The coy earn the $0.02 from each jump. Forget about GST? They can claim back from
              GST@IRAS. That will definately work out a lot of $xxxxxxxxx. Not only your rentals, diseals, workshop, commercail decals and your accident excess. So on their FY2011, so many profits. BONUS BONUS.

              <p>like it or not, every company, CEO have to project an increment in the revenue every year and work towards it.</p>
              <p>If the CEO is unable to meet up with the quota, he/she is unfit to hold the position. Moreover, they have all the connection, from the government to the media to support.</p>
              <p>Every CEO will want to outshine himself, they will usually do better then the projected quota.</p>
              <p>This goes the same with our country, government bodies and minister, as our country is running like a company.</p>
              <p>As years goes by, these revenue is getting bigger and bigger. It is sky high figure that beyond our imagination. But those smarties will usually make it look small, increment of 5%.</p>
              <p>We can only pray hard and live thru their mercy, praying hard for them not to be too greedy, pushing it to a substantial  increment  (like MBT) . Living thru their mercy to increase but still left some meat for us.</p>

              <p>CDG got to declare their profit, is because they are public company, not of that emotional feeling.</p>
