              <p>I feel you have loads of angst in your reply to me, may I humbly
                  suggest you cool down n not be overly agitated by my comments. I'm

              <p>I will  not allow myself to be associate with AH like u.</p>
              <p>I used to hold u in high esteem. with 3968 posting, just the figure alone should speak some weight of yr credential here. But I am dead wrong.</p>
              <p>People here, especially the newbie read your post and will make judgement and even decisions maybe involving their bread and butter - their next career path, based on your comments.</p>
              <p>Your words here DO carry weights. even with yr anti government, anti PAP or watever fuck.</p>
              <p>You can  gather a large group of supporters and sympathers here based on your view. People here trusted u - until that day u tell me that u "kan cheng hu".</p>
              <p>U actually tell people here that u :kan cheng hu" because u are bored and got nothing to do. Just doing it to past time.</p>
              <p>U are even worst than those crab opposition who just oppose for the sake of opposing. U opposed because u are bored and got nothing to do.</p>
              <p>How can people here trust u for those rubbish u talking about, dunno when u serious or when u bored? Out of the 3968 post, how many is serious and how many is shit and how many just out of boredom? U tell us now.</p>
              <p>U now want to talk about me in a cocoon? Actually whether u think it's me in cocoon or in reality u the one in the cocoon, it doesn't matters to me. U earn your money and I earn mine. as long as both side happy ok liao.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #333333;">You really have a warp way of twisting things to your argument, lol. I leave it to the community to be the judge if I'm what you describe in my posts. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(that's the best thing u said so far - but the greatest mistake)</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You're really funny, If I'm deemed as being unable to carry a decent debate then wat abt you? I see you barking at other forumites with vicious remarks or vulgarities when you dun like wat you read. Is this wat you mean by having a decent debate? Pls dun say you stoop low to my level for I believe you're not remotely worthy of even saying that.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I have by far given you enough respect by not hurling vulgarities (<span style="color: #ff0000;">u dun even need to use them u already offend ppl) </span>but it seems you dun deserve any. Refrain from using the word gentlemen for you're not worthy of it. I'm eagerly waiting for your better, come on.... Give me your best shot :) <span style="color: #ff0000;">(my best shot? with yr calibre, u dun even noticed it coming. )</span></p>

              <p>Since u call me uncle, I will not be too petty over u.</p>
              <p>really make no sense, from the way u reply, we obviously in different league.</p>
              <p>Never mind u higher or lower, anyway, no prize for either right? So u wanna say Uncle no cow sense, also can, lack of depth in character also can, so long as u happy can liao.</p>
              <p>As I say, u continue to count your money while I continue to update my bank book. OK?</p>
