              <p>As a patron, you are paying that much, and what services you really get in Singapore?? I do not blame the waiter, or the waitress, because that 10% svc charges goes to the boss bank account, it is up to the boss to keep or give out, but most never give back to the staff, they are just paid the basic salary.</p>
              <p>Therefore, when people said singapore servicing people like TD, restuarant or hotel staffs are not good in servicing as compare to other countries, because singapore servicing peoples do not get tipped for their service.</p>

              <p> 10% service charge is earn by restaurant itself either paying by cash or credit.</p>
              <p>For cab companies only pay merchant fee of 3% than wat happen to the other 7%</p>
              <p>There is always a reason for certain aggressive marketing. After all the one footing the bills for such ads are not the cabs companies.</p>

              <p>But then as long as we get what we are paid for, how they market their wares is up to the consumer (pax) to decide his opportunity cost. Some people use credit cards on all things, because it safe them the accounting, when the bills come, they have a clear picture of what they spent and which one to claim from their companies, and some cards like Diner and Amex are corporate cards, if no use, it a waste to them.</p>
              <p>Like if I go oversea work, the contracted company is sure to issue me an Amex, anything use out of it, can only claim if that particular merchandise was proven they do not accept Amex, if not anything out of own pocket, cannot be claim.</p>
              <p>In personal terms, there is also deal whereby if the person spend above certain amount, he gets rewards or free trip to somewhere, all this marketing induce peoples to use CC, they would had calculated the sum, not that pple who use it do not know that there will be charges.</p>
              <p>Yes, that is what I said, 10% svc charges goes to the boss of the restuarant, so, are you going to expect people who serve you to serve well? what if that 10% is given to the svc peoples, do think our singapore service standard will improve??</p>
              <p>There are lots of behind the scene banking works that only want profit, from venturing with Taxi company to other organisation, both will seek a gain gain situation from the consumers, and as consumers, they may bought the bank shares, sell at booming period like now, or take dividends, so they got the spending power to pay the fees which indirectly plough back into their pocket later.</p>
              <p>Economy is an ecology at works, if one fail to function, it needs bankers, economist and financial peoples to examine it and make sure it start to rotate, and on the way, some gain more, some gain less, but as long as all are in a win win situation, cash or cashless is not a matter, for TD, the matter is between OBK or Huat</p>

              <p>There are lots of NGO and profit organisation bought CDG shares, with a dividend of 2.7%, last year was around 2.5 % why put inside bank and earn that pathetic low interest. As public listed, many singaporeans also had bought cdg shares, even the ministers are buying it, it not only support but also gain from it.</p>
              <p>And to some, what they gain from it in comparing to paying Taxis fare with CC is nothing. And also for that matter, they most likely will take Cdg</p>

                              <p>But then as long as we get what we are paid for, how they market
              their wares is up to the consumer (pax) to decide his opportunity
              cost. Some people use credit cards on all things, because it safe
              them the accounting, when the bills come, they have a clear picture
              of what they spent and which one to claim from their companies, and
              some cards like Diner and Amex are corporate cards, if no use, it a
              waste to them.</p>
              <p>Like if I go oversea work, the contracted company is sure to
              issue me an Amex, anything use out of it, can only claim if that
              particular merchandise was proven they do not accept Amex, if not
              anything out of own pocket, cannot be claim.</p>
              <p>In personal terms, there is also deal whereby if the person
              spend above certain amount, he gets rewards or free trip to
              somewhere, all this marketing induce peoples to use CC, they would
              had calculated the sum, not that pple who use it do not know that
              there will be charges.</p>
              <p>Yes, that is what I said, 10% svc charges goes to the boss of
              the restuarant, so, are you going to expect people who serve you to
              serve well? what if that 10% is given to the svc peoples, do think
              our singapore service standard will improve??</p>
              <p>There are lots of behind the scene banking works that only want
              profit, from venturing with Taxi company to other organisation,
              both will seek a gain gain situation from the consumers, and as
              consumers, they may bought the bank shares, sell at booming period
              like now, or take dividends, so they got the spending power to pay
              the fees which indirectly plough back into their pocket later.</p>
              <p>Economy is an ecology at works, if one fail to function, it
              needs bankers, economist and financial peoples to examine it and
              make sure it start to rotate, and on the way, some gain more, some
              gain less, but as long as all are in a win win situation, cash or
              cashless is not a matter, for TD, the matter is between OBK or
              Huat</p>
