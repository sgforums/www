              <p>Dun understand why some people here got such mentality.</p>
              <p>U earn money ok, other people earn money cannot.</p>
              <p>Taxi company is not charity. They are set up to earn money too.</p>
              <p>As long as they play their part in giving u a taxi, giving u service, protecting your needs, what's wrong with them earning their keep?</p>
              <p>Companies like LV are also money making. Lots of members I know take calls every day like no body's business but just ask the chief here, how many bother to pay their dues on time. Take calls everybody want, pay call charges all disappear.</p>
              <p>On the 10% admin charges for credit cards, who get to keep the 10%? Taxi company or credit card companies?</p>
              <p>anyway, the pax got the choice to use it or not to use it. They are fully aware of the charges and must have weigh their pros and cons. They will have their own reasons to use it too.</p>
              <p>U want them to accept cards but dun charge the 10%?</p>
              <p>U want take calls but dun want pay call charges?</p>
              <p>put yourself in the company's position, u want it that way?</p>
              <p>Every night, those LV's customers has been "begging" members to send their staff home, at no call charges. This members are dependant on them for their bread and butter, without their support, they eat grass. But just without call charge, everybody "siam". No body want to take.</p>
              <p>Most people use double standard to judge people. Just for a waival of call charges, u guys all siam, but u expect other people to waive everything for u. Got such thing in life?</p>

              <p>Cashless.....is a good tool, no doubt, but definitely not esscential for taxi driving at this point of time.....</p>
              <p>Few years back, Comfort nearly lost its ground in their call center....</p>
              <p>At that time, cashless facility almost ready and perfect.....</p>
              <p>Whenever we had cashless transaction, Comfort will reimburse us extra for accepting card.....</p>
              <p>THAN, came the killer fare hike, small company are caught off hand....Comfort decided to merge with Citycab, tag on to their MDT system, boosting the state of the art equipment, the fare hike was crazy of 35% and 0.20 meter jump, meter fare easily came to 30-40pts......</p>
              <p>THAN, CDG boast their CASHLESS facility.....nnb, suddenly a sunk ship back on shore.....</p>
              <p>Many pax had avoided other company's cab.....I believe many long enough drivers had encounter that kind of situation.......</p>
              <p>All this, don't came out of nowhere, the precision strike by some scholars turn the tide for CDG.......</p>
              <p>Even to that extend of tying down NETs company......</p>
              <p>YES, during those time, driving CDG is much easier, BUT NOW.......</p>
              <p>CDG knew that, game is going to OVER, almost every company are ready in cashless facility one way or another..... </p>
              <p>SO, you ask me, Si mi Si compulsory? Ask them go fly kite.....</p>
              <p>Anyway, this purely my own comment, do not take it do seriously, at the end of the day, we are all adults, we know WHAT'S going on in the market......</p>

              <p>I can't help it but feel upset with yr thought on this. You think by accepting cashless you have an edge, granted..but that doesn't mean those not accepting it lag behind. Many TDs are surviving with cashless just fine. </p>
              <p>I find yr views myopic n self-centered to the extend offensive, at times. You may comment on how you feel n hear what others have to say. Bear in mind this is a taxi forum for taxi drivers to air their views. Let's agree to disagree when in forums n not bulldoze yr idea upon others.</p>

              <p>  Happybird95: Glad to know u like to punctuate yr sentences with fucks and have a feel of how others interpret when they read yr posts.
              Sad to say neither am I impress nor unimpressed with wat you wrote, suggesting you turning to a lawyer is just a punt.
              Yes, everyone is entitled to their opinions but......... Your insistence on several posts suggest those not accepting cashless seemed doomed or not moving with times sounds like bulldozing IMHO.. There are numerous reasons behind why it is not a popular mode of payment for cabbies.
              I feel you have loads of angst in your reply to me, may I humbly suggest you cool down n not be overly agitated by my comments. I'm not disturb by your name calling either but if you wish I can reply in much harsher tones.
              Cheers ;p :<img style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ-rQ3Ya1-gOZCaBxPKttvfrtQwATBRlYABCl45fV4MNQ9Qpka3ecWGVhlm" alt="" width="284" height="91"></p>
