            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Got this email form a friend.</p>
              <p>I think this is interesting and like to share it here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I needed to go to Pudong Airport, so I hurriedly concluded a meeting and I was looking for a taxi in front of the Meiluo building.  A taxi driver saw me and very professionally came in a straight line and stopped right in front of me. </p>
              <p>Thus followed the story that astonished me greatly as if I had attended a lively MBA course.  In order to faithfully preserve the intent of the taxi driver, I have tried to reproduce his original words according to my memory.</p>
              <p>"Where do you want to go?  Good, the airport.  At Xujiahui, I loved to get business in front of the Meiluo building.  Over here, I only work two places: Meiluo building and Junyao building.  Did you know?  Before I picked you up, I circled around Meiluo building twice before I saw you!  People who come out of office building are definitely not going to some place nearby ..."</p>
              <p>"Oh?  You have a method !"  I agreed.</p>
              <p>"A taxi driver must also have scientific methods," he said.</p>
              <p>I was surprised and I got curious: "What scientific methods?"</p>
              <p>"I have to know statistics.  I have made detailed calculations.  Let me tell you.  I operate the car 17 hours a day, and my hourly cost is 34.5 RMB ..."</p>
              <p>"How did you arrive at that?" I asked</p>
              <p>"You calculate.  I have to pay 380 RMB to the company each day for the car. The gas is about 210 RMB.  I work 17 hours per day.  On an hourly basis, the fixed cost is the 22 RMB that I give to the taxi company and an average of 12.5 RMB per hour in gasoline expenses.  Isn't that 34.5 RMB?"  I was a bit surprised.  I have taken taxis for ten years, but this is the first time that a taxi driver has calculated the costs this way.  Previously, the taxi drivers all tell me that the cost per kilometer was 0.3 RMB in addition to the total company fee.</p>
              <p>"Costs should not be calculated on a per-kilometer basis.  It should be calculated on an hourly basis.  You see, each meter has a 'review' function through which you can see the details of the day.  I have done a data analysis.  The average time gap between customers is seven minutes.  If I started counting the costs when someone gets in, it is 10 RMB for about 10 minutes.  That means each 10 RMB customer takes 17 minutes of time, which costs 9.8 RMB (4.5 x 17 / 60).  This is not making money!  If we say that customers who want to go to Pudong, Hangzhou or Qingpu are like meals, then a 10 RMB customer is not even a bite of food.  You can only say that this is just a sprinkle of MSG."</p>
              <p>Great!  This driver did not sound like a taxi driver.  He seemed more like an accountant.  "So what you do then?"  I was even more interested and I continued my questioning.  It looked like I was going to learn something new on the way to the airport.</p>
              <p>"You must not let the customer lead you all over the place.  You decide what you want to do based upon the location, time and customer."  I was very surprised, but this sounded significant.  "Someone said that the taxi driving is a profession that depends on luck.  I don't think so.  You have to stand in the position of the customer and consider things from the customer's perspective."  This sounded very professional, and very much like many business management teachers who say "put yourself in others' shoes."</p>
              <p>"Let me give you an example.  You are at the entrance to a hospital.  There is someone holding some medicine and there is someone else holding a wash basin.  Which person will you pick up?"  I thought about it and I said that I didn't know.</p>
              <p>"You take the one with the wash basin. If you have a minor complaint that you want to be examined and to get some medicine, you don't usually go to a faraway hospital. Anyone who is carrying a wash basin has just been discharged from the hospital. When people enter the hospital, some of them die. Today, someone on the second floor dies.  Tomorrow, someone on the third floor dies. Those who make it out of the hospital usually have a feeling of having been given a second life and they recognize the meaning of life again -- health is the most important thing. So on that day, that person told me, "Go ... go to Qingpu."  He did not even blink. Would you say that he wanted to take a taxi to People's Plaza to transfer to the Qingpu line subway?  Absolutely not!"</p>
              <p>I began to admire him.</p>
              <p>"Let me give you another example.  That day at People's Plaza, three people were waving at me.  One was a young woman who had just finished shopping and was holding some small bags.  Another was a young couple who were out for a stroll.  The third one was a man who wore a silk shirt and a down jacket and holding a notebook computer bag.  I spent three seconds looking at each person and I stopped in front of the man without hesitation.  When the man got in, he said: ' Yannan Elevated Highway .   South North Elevated Highway ...'  Before even finishing, he could not help but ask, 'Why did you stop in front of me without hesitating?  There were two people in front.  They wanted to get on as well.  I was too embarrassed to fight with them.'  I replied, 'It is around noon and just a dozen or so minutes before one o'clock.  That young woman must have slipped out at noon to buy something and I guess that her company must be nearby.  That couple are tourists because they are not<br> holding anything and they are not going to travel far. You are going out on business.  You are holding a notebook computer bag, so I can tell that this is business.  If you are going out at this time, I guess that it would not be too close.'  The man said, 'You are right.  I'm going to Baoshan.'"</p>
              <p>"Are those people wearing pajamas in front of supermarkets or subway stations going to travel far?  Are they going to the airport?  The airport is not going to let them enter."</p>
              <p>That makes sense!  I was liking this more and more.</p>
              <p>"Many drivers complain that business is tough and the price of gas has gone up. They are trying to pin the cause down on other people. If you keep pinning the cause on other people, you will never get any better.  You must look at yourself to see where the problem is." This sounds very familiar. It seems like "If you cannot change the world, then you should change yourself" or perhaps a pirated copy of Steven Covey's "Circles of Influence and Concern."  "One time, on Nandan Road , someone flagged me down and wanted to go to Tianlin. Later on, someone else flagged me down on Nandan Road and he also wanted to go to Tianlin.  So I asked, 'How come all you people who come out on Nandan Road want to go to Tianlin?'  He said, 'There is a public bus depot at Nandan Road .  We all take the public bus from Pudong to there, and then we take the taxi to Tianlin.  So I understood. For example, you look at the road that we just passed. There are no offices, no hotels, nothing. Just a public bus station. Those people who flag down taxis there are mostly people who just got off the public bus, and they look for the shortest road for a taxi.  People who flag down taxis here will usually ride not more than 15 RMB."</p>
              <p>"Therefore, I say that the attitude determines everything!"  I have heard dozens of company CEO's say that, but this was the first time that I heard a taxi driver say that.</p>
              <p>"We need to use scientific methods and statistics to conduct business.</p>
              <p>Those people who wait at the subway exits every day for business will never make money. How are you going to provide for your wife and kids at 500 RMB a month? This is murder? This is slowly murdering your whole family. You must arm yourself with knowledge. You have to learn knowledge to become a smart person. A smart person learns knowledge in order to become a very smart person. A very smart person learns knowledge in order to become a genius."</p>
              <p>"One time, a person wanted a taxi in order to get to the train station.  I asked him how he wanted to go.  He told me how to get there.  I said that was slow. I said to get on the elevated highway and go this other way.  He said that it was a longer way. I said, 'No problem. You have experience because you go that way frequently. It costs you 50 RMB. If you go my way, I will turn off the meter when it reaches 50 RMB. You can just pay me 50 RMB. Anything more is mine. If you go your way, it will take 50 minutes. If I go my way, it will take 25 minutes.' So in the end, we went my way.</p>
              <p>We traveled an additional four kilometers but 25 minutes quicker. I accepted only 50 RMB. The customer was very delighted for saving about 10 RMB. This extra four kilometers cost me just over 1 RMB in gas. So I have swapped 1 RMB for 25 extra minutes of my time. As I just said, my hourly cost is 34.5 RMB. It was quite worthwhile for me!"</p>
              <p>"In a public taxi company, an ordinary driver takes three to four thousand RMB home per month. The good driver can get around five thousand. The top driver can get seven thousand RMB.  Out of the 20,000 drivers, there are about two to three who can make more than 8,000 RMB a month. I am one of those two or three. Furthermore, it is very stable without too much fluctuation."</p>
              <p>Great!  By this point, I admired this taxi driver more and more.</p>
              <p>"I often say that I am a happy driver. Some people say, 'That's because you earn a lot of money. Of course, you must be happy.' I tell them, 'You are wrong. This is because I have a happy and active mind, and that is why I make a lot of money.'"</p>
              <p>What a wonderful way to put it!</p>
              <p>"You have to appreciate the beauty that your work brings.  Stuck in a traffic jam at People's Plaza, many drivers complain, 'Oh, there's a traffic jam again! What rotten luck!' You must not be like that. You should try to experience the beauty of the city.  There are many pretty girls passing by. There are many tall modern buildings; although you cannot afford them, you can still enjoy them with an appreciative look.  While driving to the airport, you can look at the greenery on both sides.  In the winter, it is white.  How beautiful!  Look at the meter -- it is more than 100 RMB.  That is even more beautiful!  Each job has its own beauty.  We need to learn how to experience that beauty in our work."<br>"Ten years ago, I was a general instructor at Johnson's.  Eight years ago, I had been the department manager for three different departments.  I quit because there was no point in making three or five thousand a month. I decided to become a taxi driver. I want to be a happy driver.  Ha ha ha ..."<br> <br>When we arrived at the airport, I gave him my business card and said, "Are you interested in coming this Friday to my office and explain to the Microsoft workers about how you operate your taxi? You can treat it as if your meter is running at 60 kilometers per hour. I will pay you for the time that you talk to us. Give me a call."<br> <br>Then I began to write down his lively MBA lecture on the airplane.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Got this email form a friend.</p>
              <p>I think this is interesting and like to share it here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I needed to go to Pudong Airport, so I hurriedly concluded a
              meeting and I was looking for a taxi in front of the Meiluo
              building.  A taxi driver saw me and very professionally came
              in a straight line and stopped right in front of me. </p>
              <p>Thus followed the story that astonished me greatly as if I had
              attended a lively MBA course.  In order to faithfully preserve
              the intent of the taxi driver, I have tried to reproduce his
              original words according to my memory.</p>
              <p>"Where do you want to go?  Good, the airport.  At
              Xujiahui, I loved to get business in front of the Meiluo
              building.  Over here, I only work two places: Meiluo building
              and Junyao building.  Did you know?  Before I picked you
              up, I circled around Meiluo building twice before I saw you! 
              People who come out of office building are definitely not going to
              some place nearby ..."</p>
              <p>"Oh?  You have a method !"  I agreed.</p>
              <p>"A taxi driver must also have scientific methods," he said.</p>
              <p>I was surprised and I got curious: "What scientific
              methods?"</p>
              <p>"I have to know statistics.  I have made detailed
              calculations.  Let me tell you.  I operate the car 17
              hours a day, and my hourly cost is 34.5 RMB ..."</p>
              <p>"How did you arrive at that?" I asked</p>
              <p>"You calculate.  I have to pay 380 RMB to the company each
              day for the car. The gas is about 210 RMB.  I work 17 hours
              per day.  On an hourly basis, the fixed cost is the 22 RMB
              that I give to the taxi company and an average of 12.5 RMB per hour
              in gasoline expenses.  Isn't that 34.5 RMB?"  I was a bit
              surprised.  I have taken taxis for ten years, but this is the
              first time that a taxi driver has calculated the costs this
              way.  Previously, the taxi drivers all tell me that the cost
              per kilometer was 0.3 RMB in addition to the total company fee.</p>
              <p>"Costs should not be calculated on a per-kilometer basis. 
              It should be calculated on an hourly basis.  You see, each
              meter has a 'review' function through which you can see the details
              of the day.  I have done a data analysis.  The average
              time gap between customers is seven minutes.  If I started
              counting the costs when someone gets in, it is 10 RMB for about 10
              minutes.  That means each 10 RMB customer takes 17 minutes of
              time, which costs 9.8 RMB (4.5 x 17 / 60).  This is not making
              money!  If we say that customers who want to go to Pudong,
              Hangzhou or Qingpu are like meals, then a 10 RMB customer is not
              even a bite of food.  You can only say that this is just a
              sprinkle of MSG."</p>
              <p>Great!  This driver did not sound like a taxi driver. 
              He seemed more like an accountant.  "So what you do
              then?"  I was even more interested and I continued my
              questioning.  It looked like I was going to learn something
              new on the way to the airport.</p>
              <p>"You must not let the customer lead you all over the
              place.  You decide what you want to do based upon the
              location, time and customer."  I was very surprised, but this
              sounded significant.  "Someone said that the taxi driving is a
              profession that depends on luck.  I don't think so.  You
              have to stand in the position of the customer and consider things
              from the customer's perspective."  This sounded very
              professional, and very much like many business management teachers
              who say "put yourself in others' shoes."</p>
              <p>"Let me give you an example.  You are at the entrance to a
              hospital.  There is someone holding some medicine and there is
              someone else holding a wash basin.  Which person will you pick
              up?"  I thought about it and I said that I didn't know.</p>
              <p>"You take the one with the wash basin. If you have a minor
              complaint that you want to be examined and to get some medicine,
              you don't usually go to a faraway hospital. Anyone who is carrying
              a wash basin has just been discharged from the hospital. When
              people enter the hospital, some of them die. Today, someone on the
              second floor dies.  Tomorrow, someone on the third floor dies.
              Those who make it out of the hospital usually have a feeling of
              having been given a second life and they recognize the meaning of
              life again -- health is the most important thing. So on that day,
              that person told me, "Go ... go to Qingpu."  He did not even
              blink. Would you say that he wanted to take a taxi to People's
              Plaza to transfer to the Qingpu line subway?  Absolutely
              not!"</p>
              <p>I began to admire him.</p>
              <p>"Let me give you another example.  That day at People's
              Plaza, three people were waving at me.  One was a young woman
              who had just finished shopping and was holding some small
              bags.  Another was a young couple who were out for a
              stroll.  The third one was a man who wore a silk shirt and a
              down jacket and holding a notebook computer bag.  I spent
              three seconds looking at each person and I stopped in front of the
              man without hesitation.  When the man got in, he said: '
              Yannan Elevated Highway .   South North Elevated Highway
              ...'  Before even finishing, he could not help but ask, 'Why
              did you stop in front of me without hesitating?  There were
              two people in front.  They wanted to get on as well.  I
              was too embarrassed to fight with them.'  I replied, 'It is
              around noon and just a dozen or so minutes before one
              o'clock.  That young woman must have slipped out at noon to
              buy something and I guess that her company must be nearby. 
              That couple are tourists because they are not<br>  holding anything and they are not going to travel far. You
              are going out on business.  You are holding a notebook
              computer bag, so I can tell that this is business.  If you are
              going out at this time, I guess that it would not be too
              close.'  The man said, 'You are right.  I'm going to
              Baoshan.'"</p>
              <p>"Are those people wearing pajamas in front of supermarkets or
              subway stations going to travel far?  Are they going to the
              airport?  The airport is not going to let them enter."</p>
              <p>That makes sense!  I was liking this more and more.</p>
              <p>"Many drivers complain that business is tough and the price of
              gas has gone up. They are trying to pin the cause down on other
              people. If you keep pinning the cause on other people, you will
              never get any better.  You must look at yourself to see where
              the problem is." This sounds very familiar. It seems like "If you
              cannot change the world, then you should change yourself" or
              perhaps a pirated copy of Steven Covey's "Circles of Influence and
              Concern."  "One time, on Nandan Road , someone flagged me down
              and wanted to go to Tianlin. Later on, someone else flagged me down
              on Nandan Road and he also wanted to go to Tianlin.  So I
              asked, 'How come all you people who come out on Nandan Road want to
              go to Tianlin?'  He said, 'There is a public bus depot at
              Nandan Road .  We all take the public bus from Pudong to
              there, and then we take the taxi to Tianlin.  So I understood.
              For example, you look at the road that we just passed. There are no
              offices, no hotels, nothing. Just a public bus station. Those
              people who flag down taxis there are mostly people who just got off
              the public bus, and they look for the shortest road for a
              taxi.  People who flag down taxis here will usually ride not
              more than 15 RMB."</p>
              <p>"Therefore, I say that the attitude determines
              everything!"  I have heard dozens of company CEO's say that,
              but this was the first time that I heard a taxi driver say
              that.</p>
              <p>"We need to use scientific methods and statistics to conduct
              business.</p>
              <p>Those people who wait at the subway exits every day for business
              will never make money. How are you going to provide for your wife
              and kids at 500 RMB a month? This is murder? This is slowly
              murdering your whole family. You must arm yourself with knowledge.
              You have to learn knowledge to become a smart person. A smart
              person learns knowledge in order to become a very smart person. A
              very smart person learns knowledge in order to become a
              genius."</p>
              <p>"One time, a person wanted a taxi in order to get to the train
              station.  I asked him how he wanted to go.  He told me
              how to get there.  I said that was slow. I said to get on the
              elevated highway and go this other way.  He said that it was a
              longer way. I said, 'No problem. You have experience because you go
              that way frequently. It costs you 50 RMB. If you go my way, I will
              turn off the meter when it reaches 50 RMB. You can just pay me 50
              RMB. Anything more is mine. If you go your way, it will take 50
              minutes. If I go my way, it will take 25 minutes.' So in the end,
              we went my way.</p>
              <p>We traveled an additional four kilometers but 25 minutes
              quicker. I accepted only 50 RMB. The customer was very delighted
              for saving about 10 RMB. This extra four kilometers cost me just
              over 1 RMB in gas. So I have swapped 1 RMB for 25 extra minutes of
              my time. As I just said, my hourly cost is 34.5 RMB. It was quite
              worthwhile for me!"</p>
              <p>"In a public taxi company, an ordinary driver takes three to
              four thousand RMB home per month. The good driver can get around
              five thousand. The top driver can get seven thousand RMB.  Out
              of the 20,000 drivers, there are about two to three who can make
              more than 8,000 RMB a month. I am one of those two or three.
              Furthermore, it is very stable without too much fluctuation."</p>
              <p>Great!  By this point, I admired this taxi driver more and
              more.</p>
              <p>"I often say that I am a happy driver. Some people say, 'That's
              because you earn a lot of money. Of course, you must be happy.' I
              tell them, 'You are wrong. This is because I have a happy and
              active mind, and that is why I make a lot of money.'"</p>
              <p>What a wonderful way to put it!</p>
              <p>"You have to appreciate the beauty that your work brings. 
              Stuck in a traffic jam at People's Plaza, many drivers complain,
              'Oh, there's a traffic jam again! What rotten luck!' You must not
              be like that. You should try to experience the beauty of the
              city.  There are many pretty girls passing by. There are many
              tall modern buildings; although you cannot afford them, you can
              still enjoy them with an appreciative look.  While driving to
              the airport, you can look at the greenery on both sides.  In
              the winter, it is white.  How beautiful!  Look at the
              meter -- it is more than 100 RMB.  That is even more
              beautiful!  Each job has its own beauty.  We need to
              learn how to experience that beauty in our work."<br> "Ten years ago, I was a general instructor at Johnson's. 
              Eight years ago, I had been the department manager for three
              different departments.  I quit because there was no point in
              making three or five thousand a month. I decided to become a taxi
              driver. I want to be a happy driver.  Ha ha ha ..."<br>  <br> When we arrived at the airport, I gave him my business card and
              said, "Are you interested in coming this Friday to my office and
              explain to the Microsoft workers about how you operate your taxi?
              You can treat it as if your meter is running at 60 kilometers per
              hour. I will pay you for the time that you talk to us. Give me a
              call."<br>  <br> Then I began to write down his lively MBA lecture on the
              airplane.</p>
              <p>“It is your attitude, not your aptitude, which determines your
              altitude in life.”</p>
