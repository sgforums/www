              <p>Shall we put this "sticky" as appreciation to the Good and spilt our agony to show to those baddies pax?</p>
              <p>One fine Evening around 9 pm, I picked up 2 old frailed ladies from Jurong East Street 13- one with walking sticks and hardly get onto my cabs with aid from another lady.</p>
              <p>Destination to Clementi Ave 2 and i asked them which route they prefered. Via Boon Lay way - Commonwealth Ave West or AYE. They told me told use whatever route i prefer and AYE is fine to them.</p>
              <p>Along the short journey we have a hearty hokkien chat. They were very concern about me and safety and keep on reminding me not to go to Ulu remote area and be careful as driving taxis is hapzardous jobs.  I thank them for their concern.  Upon alighting the trip was $6 and 2 old aunties want to give me $2 tips.  I refused and return them as their concern and understanding is more than enough for me.  Moreover $2 is a big tips and almost 30% of the total fares and i believe they are living on their savings or from children.</p>
              <p>This 2 ladies shows a big difference to those who party or shop or talked big businesses on the handyphone and yet bulked taxi drivers incompetence or thinking we taxi driver take them for a big route for 20 cents more trip.</p>
              <p>The 2 old aunties keep on pushing me to accept the $2 but ultimately i still managed to pushed it back to their cold hand.</p>
              <p>May God bless them for understanding our Haphzardous Job as Taxi Driver.</p>

              <p>UGLY pax.</p>
              <p>One good question, What are taxi for?</p>
              <p>Knn many kind of paxs in SG, take for granted...Cheap transportation. Just on-call, when you arrive no way you can reject them.</p>
              <p>What happen got a job offered at duchess ave, upon arrival ang mo with a mountain bike waiting at the condo lobby. So the pax told I need to go along with this bike to bukit timah hill. So sonata got to uploaded this bike behind my rear boot. sir... too big cannot, why? not. So finally the bike is loaded and the bike together we go. Than a sudden downpour  visibilty very poor wipers also no use, suddenly at sixth avenue juction the front vehicle jammed brake, me followed. Than what happen? the bicycle pushed forward the bicycle handle hit onto my plastic left signal casing, than there is a crack and a small hole.  Who will be paying for this damage? Ang mo said no he not paying for the damage, half half also cannot. Lan lan just accept this is fate. Taxi is the cheapest transportation in SG.</p>
