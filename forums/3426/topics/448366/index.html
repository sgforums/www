              Based on the feedback from some of my friend driving Limo and Taxi, this is what I understand. 
              
              
              Limo driver survived on the lead from Hotel, Tour Agency, Taxi Companies, Private Network and their Royal customers  whereas Taxi driver survive on sweeping the road and oncall.
              
              Limo driver do not care so much of peak hour and CBD whereas TAxi driver depend very much on peak hour and CBD to survive.
              
              Limo driver seldom sweep the road unlike taxi driver.
              
              Anymore to add?

              <p>English as dominant language in a non ang moh land has put you in a disadvantaged position, my friend.</p>
              <p>We chinese and other groups have suffered under this discriminatory policy imposed by a tiny english speaking elite. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p>The great majority of people on this island are not english speakers. English is an alien language to us. But we are forced to use it because of the english speaking peranakan elite. </p>
              <p>In those british colonial days only a small privileged elite loyal to british interests had the chance to learn english. They were mostly drawn from the eurasian, local colonials and peranakan community in Singapore.</p>

              <p>What makes Singapore different? The majority of Singapore's population is ethnically Chinese, but Singapore is largely free of corruption, has sound institutions and the rule of law dominates. It's nothing like China.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The answer lies in a historical division in Singapore's Chinese community between the babas and the sinkeh.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The sinkeh, comprising the majority of the city-state's population, were the recent immigrants from China, or whose parents were born in China. They spoke Chinese, lived like Chinese and considered themselves overseas Chinese. In Indonesia, such Chinese were called the totok.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were Chinese more in name than practice.</span></span></strong> They were the descendants of the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). <strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired.</span></span></strong> The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</p>
              <p>The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another university in China. <strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population, it was the babas who dominated public decision-making.

              <p>English as dominant language in Singapore is a wrong policy. It is not a correct policy.</p>
              <p>It gives unfair advantage to a tiny elite and put the great majority of non english speakers at a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>For example, Limpehkahlikong2011 has suffered under this discriminatory policy. He couldn't be limo driver since his ang moh bo ho. He couldn't raise his income because of this unfair policy.</p>
              <p>This policy is incorrect and must be rectified.</p>

              group. At that time, we did not know who would be the successor to
              Lee. We finally made the decision to pick Goh Chok Tong. He agreed
              on condition that I agreed to be his number two. So I was the
              second DPM; he was the first DPM. In 1988, Lee asked Goh to take
              over, but he was not ready. He said: two more years. So two years
              later, he took the job.</span></span></p>

              There was quite a bit of adverse reaction to what he said. But he

              <p>What makes Singapore different? The majority of Singapore's
              population is ethnically Chinese, but Singapore is largely free of
              corruption, has sound institutions and the rule of law dominates.
              It's nothing like China.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
              answer lies in a historical division in Singapore's Chinese
              community between the babas and the
              sinkeh.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The sinkeh, comprising the majority of the city-state's
              population, were the recent immigrants from China, or whose parents
              were born in China. They spoke Chinese, lived like Chinese and
              considered themselves overseas Chinese. In Indonesia, such Chinese
              were called the totok.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
              babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were
              Chinese more in name than
              practice.</span></span></strong> They were the descendants of
              the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian
              province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore
              and Malacca). <strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They
              assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British,
              whom they especially admired.</span></span></strong> The babas
              developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally
              sprinkled with Hokkien.</p>
              <p>The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse
              owners.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
              babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians;
              they attended the local English-language schools run in the
              tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and
              Cambridge.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in
              Nanking or another university in China. <strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's
              population, it was the babas who dominated public decision-making.
              In effect, a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that
              minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England than
              China.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>It was the babas who were the framers of Singapore's rules and
              institutions. Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had
              baba backgrounds.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee
              Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is
              the most obvious example.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of
              a baba: at home, <strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">he
              spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents.
              "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life,"
              Lee said of his childhood.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>For Lee, Chineseness was an acquired skill and later a political
              necessity. He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on
              China, <strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">but as
              a baba who looked to England.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to
              London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry
              Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge.</p>
              <p>His father had given him and two of his brothers English, as
              well as Chinese, names.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Did Lee
              run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways? No. He ran
              it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would have
              aspired.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>That other great framer of Singapore's institutions, Goh Keng
              Swee, who rose to become finance minister and deputy prime
              minister, is the epitome of the baba elite. Goh was born in 1918 in
              Malacca, the epicentre of baba culture, into a baba family. His
              parents were English-oriented Chinese Methodists.</p>
              <p>The baba influence is now more subtle, but still there.</p>
              <p><strong style="font: inherit;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore's current prime minister Lee Hsien
              Loong has the strongest baba pedigree of any of the country's
              leaders.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>English as dominant language in Singapore is a wrong policy. It
              is not a correct policy.</p>
              <p>It gives unfair advantage to a tiny elite and put the great
              majority of non english speakers at a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>For example, Limpehkahlikong2011 has suffered under
              this discriminatory policy. He couldn't be limo driver since
              his ang moh bo ho. He couldn't raise his income because of this
              unfair policy.</p>
              <p>This policy is incorrect and must be rectified.</p>

              <p>Just feel sad for Limpehkahlikong2011, he ang moh bo ho so cannot be limo driver, that's all. I think that is a completely wrong policy.</p>

              <p>I consider that to be a wrong policy. I don't consider that to be a correct policy. Taxi driver I don't think there is such a policy. But limo driver there is such a policy.</p>
              <p>That is wrong.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Some people see limo drivers as "elite", maybe one reason is because limo driver excludes those ang moh bo ho. That is why they are seen as "elite".</p>
              <p>It causes a divide among the drivers. One group ang moh bo ho. Another group ang moh ho. It that a right policy or wrong policy? </p>
              <p>I think using english as dominant language in Singapore causes an artificial divide.</p>
              <p>I think that is wrong.</p>
