              <p>Hi all bros, just wanna share some things happened to my friend.</p>
              <p>Last weekend, my friend had an advance booking at lor 1 toa payoh. Before he reached, he call up the pax, Anna, that he will be there in 3mins. Upon reaching the guard house, he saw 1 comfort sonata came out hired. He proceed to the block. He quickly call anna.</p>
              <p>He: Ms Anna where are you? I'm at lobby now/</p>
              <p>Anna: I'm already inside the cab. Oh no did i board the wrong cab????</p>
              <p>Anna to Comfort cabby: Uncle, can u u-turn back to the condo?</p>
              <p>Cabby: No, i already on the way on PIE.</p>
              <p>Anna: But infront lor 6 can turn back. </p>
              <p>Cabby: No cannot. Now on the way.</p>
              <p>My friend very angry n requested to speak to Cabby.</p>
              <p>He: Why u nvr asked her name b4 picking?</p>
              <p>Cabby: She said 'on-call' ma so i pick lor,</p>
              <p>After some arguement, my friend requested to pick COmfort pax. And Cabby give details to my friend. So he went to pick up comfort pax, Babe.</p>
              <p>He: Hi Miss, are u Babe?</p>
              <p>Babe: (surprised and shocked that how my friend know): Yes and I tot i booked a comfort cab???</p>
              <p>He: Comfort mistaken pick up my pax to airport. So I come pick u.</p>
              <p>Babe:How can he do that!!!!!!!!!(Very angry)</p>
              <p>Babe immediately called up comfort and scolded them. And this is the third time that she kena this type of service. She vowed to quit calling comfort.</p>
              <p>My questions to bros, If u r Comfort cabby, will u u-turn and returned pax to my friend? Will u ask comfort for details of his pax? And why comfort dun want to u-turn?it puzzled me.</p>
              <p>If u r my friend, will u do the same thing? </p>
              <p>What's ur take?</p>

              <p>Bro not only this. I was queuing at T2 along the outside where u can view the 2nd door. I slowly moved in and was about to turn in, 1 comfort cut all the way and wanna park there and pretend to go toilet. He think i dunno he want to chute stunt and cut the long queue. Of course, I dun let him passed. While in the covered car park, I saw him already queuing about 12 cars behind me. I also know can chute this pattern, but if everyone like tat, who want to queue? He not the only la i guess. So many of them, pretend go toilet. Sicko.</p>

              <p>Blue and yellow no need give chance one la. Whenever I on the left and notice them empty on my right, I sure step the lane line in a way like occupying 1.25 lanes. If not I will ram accelerator to make sure they smell smoke lol. Of course not all blue and yellow like that la but can say 80% la. </p>
              <p>Red crowns I sure give chance let them overtake by driving super slow cos many times behind them, paxes rejected them and took my taxi. Blue and yellow no chance, I am ready for a race. </p>
