              <p>Then i photocopy those map page by page , invest a bit .</p>
              <p>Then i cut all maps , and joined pages by pages together ....</p>
              <p>From there , i marked out the main access ways like Pioneer Road , AYE and PIE Tuas Road</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>GPS systems are usually shunned because of two reasons one being that they are not frequently updated as Singapore streets are, whenever you buy a system it usually comes with one year free upgrade of maps after which you to pay and no one likes to pay. Keeping that in mind Garmin is the best bid if you're looking for free updates for the rest of the navigation system's life. You have to be acquainted with computers and how to install programs and copy paste onto a SD card you'll be all set to go for map updates for Garmin systems ( free ones) can be found on myaseanfreemaps forum you can Google it. As a taxi driver as I soon will be ( just passed my TVDL test) my choice would be something which can update me on the route situation meaning if I'm taking certain route and there's a traffic jam it should let me know so I can reroute and save my time and as well as passengers for that the only system with possible free updates is Galactio with traffic updates I think it's around $375 or so available from different vendors you can check Galactio website by googling for the name. Again live traffic updates is a subscription-based service so when you buy your equipment it comes with one or two years subscription paid service for life traffic after which you to pay. The choice is yours have fun</p></div>

              <p>Frankly, I hv to agree with Pool, at time, pax who are want you to be fast, and you still keying GPS for location, i think they will rolltheir eye up and think, Oh, my god, another GPs cabby.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is still smart phone will do, it can also take picture, places that is new to you, you take picture of it, then go home and remember it,  as newbie, first learn to ply on your own turf, if you are tampines, try around that side that you are familiar, that include tampines, hougang, pasir ris, airport, bedok, Eunos and so on, slowly expand to outside, again as Pool said, if you do not know, please ASK, put your mouth into good use, ask politely. </p>
              <p>Twice I had met pax jump cab, one in tuas, the other near botanic garden, and I asked pax why they drop off from the other cab and immediately wave for my cab coming behind, still fumming, pax said that cabby do not know the road and yet keep quiet and bring me all over the places, hell!</p>
              <p>Maybe initially use GPS is ok, but do not over rely on it, because you can become an addict to it, so one day without the GPS, you are paralysed, as dumb as pax. I agreed with Pool that those old bird had long throw their GPS away.  It is more for private car, some executives just do not know the roads well. Singapore has one of the most cramped and intricated road per sq km, not easy.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I mean no disrespect to the seniors on this forum,GPS navigator is just a tool to be used to serve your customers better, as highlighted above example of a driver do not know the route and go round and round , if he had a GPS navigator he won't lose his fare, after all we are all plying the road to earn a living, the best example of GPS navigator usage would be something like when the calculator got introduced, all the old accountants laughed at people using calculator saying using this machine does not make one accountant. My seniors in the trade have learned the routes the hard way, my experience of using GPS navigation on Singapore roads is that it is a great help and eventually when you go to places day in day out they get hammered inside your head and you do not need the navigation system except for those hard to remember never been places. It never hurts to have another additional tool to help someone make a living.</p></div>

              <p>As i said, if you got a smart phone, why need a GPS, it encompass a map, you can search, locate, get the direction within second, aren't we spending unneccessary on GPS when you hv a Smartphone or tab? Unless you do not hv a smartphone, then by all mean, use the GPS, we are not saying it is no good, we are saying it is best to learn by the brain as time goes by, day in and day out, people said magazine road, minden road, Prince of Wales road, you know immediately, clarify again with pax then set your road, tell pax your mean of getting there and ask if they feel comfortable or have other alternatives,  in this way, we let pax feel confident of our profession, yet we are more relax and less stress instead of keep looking at GPS and turn left 50m, you start to be wary...and so on.</p>
              <p>Just like cook, an indian cook who cooked for 10 years, you want fish head curry, he immediately cook it, if he start to go and see the mannual or the tutorial tube on the step by step on how to cook it, I think you also wonder if he is a good cook.</p>

Because from the map I know which part of the block, or building is located along the road.

              <p>Agree with bowah &amp; hammer, smart phone is more than sufficient. sometimes kena...</p>
              <p>'uncle 182 Bukit Timah Road'</p>
              <p>"got building name?"</p>
              <p>'don't know leh'</p>
              <p>wtf, Bukit Timah Road so long where is 182, which side? towards town or towards west?</p>
              <p>This type of destination, just use smart phone to check location and whack. Street directory will not show this detail. I use NavFone (free on Android phones) just do a search, see where it is and whack. Cos we just need to know near where, not how to go. The original gps built by God is the best model, updated every second. Cos at 182 Bukit Timah Rd, you will learn of Makepeace Rd &amp; Hooper Rd. If you did not already know them. Many others especially shophouses which cannot see the unit number, smartphone navigation app comes in very useful.</p>
