              <p>Sorry uncle Poolman, this is NOT typical Singaporean budget. I would say yours is more like upper mid class budget.</p>
              <p>Insurance nearly $500, not everyone can afford to buy so much insurance lah. And actually most do not need so much insurance cover.</p>
              <p>Maid $500+, typical singaporean household can afford maid? Don't think so.</p>
              <p>SP service $250, sadly this is typical sg household budget. But actually can save more lah and at same time conserve energy. My typical bill about $180.</p>
              <p>Starhub cable $50. Again cable is something nice to have, but not every household need one.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>$1500 per week?   EASILY ???</p>
              <p>Please introduce this guy to us so he can give us some pointers how to earn this figure.  Or if cannot meet us, please tell him that he is wasting his time as a taxi driver. He can better use his bullshitting skill in other proffesion (ie, insurance agent, durian seller, etc).</p>
              <p>Granted, mathematically it is possible to earn $1500/wk, if he work super "hard" (or in uncle Poolman's words "work until no life"). If he drives 18hrs a day, 7 days a week. Work-eat-work-sleep-shit-work again, etc etc.</p>
              <p>If he prepares to do so, he needs to:</p>
              <p>a. buy a lot of insurance (meaning, not high amount, but many different types of insurance to cover his big ass), and pray hard.</p>
              <p>b. set aside a lot of money in case need some organ transplant later.</p>
              <p>c. no need to set aside a lot for retirement, coz he will not need it anyway.</p>
              <p>d. also no need to spend so much on family, coz we doubt such person have a family anyway.</p>
              <p>e.  ............ so on and so forth,   you get the drift........</p>
              <p>ps, Sorry if anyone have someone close to them in the proffesions mentioned above. I did not mean to offend them, just trying to make my point accross here.</p>
              <p>pps, Nearly type property agent, lucky I didn't. If not that tampines distant-uncle of mine will come looking for me with his parang.  :)</p>
