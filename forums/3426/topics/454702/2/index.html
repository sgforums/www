              <p>Seems really like the saying "different folk, different stroke"</p>
              <p>past few weeks, i used to do 100% advance calls every day.</p>
              <p>can do as many as 10 a day, all lined up back to back even before the start work.</p>
              <p>Did thought of what Poolman said about the waiting so the last few days do 100% LV calls.</p>
              <p>Gosh, what a difference. Earning is so pathetic. With CDG calls, I can break even, rental and diesel within 3 hours. Today after more than 6 hours still haven't reached 3 digit.</p>
              <p>Taking CDG calls is just whoever finger's fastest. U got to know the technique. There are so many to choose from. But it's100% safe.</p>
              <p>unlike taking other calls, so dangerous, especially the "open calls". all like hungry ghost after each other's throat. Ever took a "try call" up the coconut tree area and got to drive in the middle of the road, knowing that 75X will want to overtake me anytime, driving at 80 on this very narrow road. It's rather thrill in the begining but after a while, u ask yourself, is it worth that $3.30?</p>

              <p>I think u are right. I use to take jobs one after another. Quite good earning.</p>
              <p>but now I rarely take current calls from CDG, unless I looking for long distance jobs. Anyway, my MD is always at "B".</p>
              <p>My Mode of Operation is mainly advance calls, with some sweeping, (interview first) in between. Seems to make my early half shift fully packed.</p>
              <p>I not so hardworking as a hirer now as compared to my short span as a relief when I used to work 12 hours solid. Now max only 7 to 8 hrs go home liao. So that short span of time, got not much time to waste waiting under coconut tree.</p>

              <p>Seems really like the saying "different folk, different stroke"</p>
              <p>past few weeks, i used to do 100% advance calls every day.</p>
              <p>can do as many as 10 a day, all lined up back to back even before the start work.</p>
              <p>Did thought of what Poolman said about the waiting so the last few days do 100% LV calls.</p>
              <p>Gosh, what a difference. Earning is so pathetic. With CDG calls, I can break even, rental and diesel within 3 hours. Today after more than 6 hours still haven't reached 3 digit.</p>
              <p>Taking CDG calls is just whoever finger's fastest. U got to know the technique. There are so many to choose from. But it's100% safe.</p>
              <p>unlike taking other calls, so dangerous, especially the "open calls". all like hungry ghost after each other's throat. Ever took a "try call" up the coconut tree area and got to drive in the middle of the road, knowing that 75X will want to overtake me anytime, driving at 80 on this very narrow road. It's rather thrill in the begining but after a while, u ask yourself, is it worth that $3.30?</p>

              <p>No la uncle, LV calls cannot 100% la...will die cock stand...</p>
              <p>For me is mix and match...even when plying the routes i try to match possible LV calls and route together...just so that even if i cant get any possible calls from LV i can still sweep.Which ever come first.</p>
              <p>Understanding the timing of when the calls coming in is also very useful when plying your routes.</p>
              <p>As for advance, me never try 10 advance back to back, but i know just one advance at the start is good enough to screw your whole plan. Why?</p>
              <p>Last mth took a 0645h advance from St Regis to airport. End up pax only got into cab at 0730H!</p>
              <p>Lucky i got mood that day. Lucky was my last job before i head home. Lucky concierge ask me on meter after waiting 15mins and FORECASTING my black face coming. If not i will say 'BAGS ALL DOWN!!'</p>
              <p>Imagine i start day shift like Ah Khoon and kenna this <strong>ST REGIS BULLSHIT</strong> and also with 10 back to back advance booking....die la...</p>
              <p>How i know will die?....Cos one course mate like doing this adv booking also...what ever taiko advance at iPAD he also sup....as long as got $8 also sup...dont care sup already than say....until one day lim kopi together than found out he kenna suspend from advance booking for 3mths...cos cock up his adv booking.</p>
              <p>Me no from cdg so i no know suspend 3mths is dunno how serious. But for CDG to give 3mths i think quite serious la...maybe one of his pax miss the flight??</p>

              <p>The suspension by Comfort serve as a warning to TD. It won't lead to termination. Most time a phone call to Catherine or Simon can easily taken out the suspension.</p>
              <p>Of course if you been suspended too many time, will be totally barred from taking advance booking and it apply to current booking also.</p>
