              <p>I did not say we must fake a statement .</p>
              <p>We know this driver is in deep trouble .</p>

              <p>Wrong is you fake a statement to help the driver to escape punishments in the name of the law .</p>
              <p>Right is u report what u saw , the truth .</p>
              <p>Whether or not this driver will be charge ? That is not important .</p>
              <p>As for the thread starter , he do not know what to do ?</p>
              <p>As what i had explained to him , u saw the accident , at that point , u are in a position to witness that the traffic lights going into Alexandra is green , cos u are RED when turning into Zion Road .</p>
              <p>And many of the drivers agree that , this stretch the traffic light timing works that way .</p>
              <p>This is what i meant by "help" .</p>
              <p>Help to tell the truth !</p>
              <p>Whether or not this driver could be charged severely , that has got nothing to do with thread-starter , or anyone else .</p>

              <p>Bro, Traffic laws do not look at it this way. Once you hit

              <p>Precisely.  And also, depending on the point that your car come into contact with the pedestrian , it can be <strong>totally</strong> the driver's fault even if the pedestrian is jaywalking.</p>
              <p>Folks, always practise defensive driving.  Don't just think that because that pedestrian is jaywalking, it is automatically his fault.  I seems to recall a case where is Merc (or BMW) lady driver hit an ang mo at a traffic junction with the traffic light in the driver's favour..  But, based on the point of contact, it was held that she is at fault and hence, liability.  Worst still, the ang mo estate sued for damages (including potential loss of income) and end up, the lady driver had to was car to earn money to pay for the damages.  The case was about 2-3 years back.</p>

              <p>I was at the junction of Havelock rd waiting to turn into Zion rd at around 1050pm yesterday when I heard a loud screeching of tires...</p>
              <p>Next moment saw a Trans cab toyota crown ran smack into a chinese guy who was crossing the road. I was unsure whether he was jay walking... all I know my cab was stationary waiting to turn.</p>
              <p>I was horrified and stunned... with 2 paxes in my cab I moved further and parked by the side... Tried to call 995 but line was engaged... I moved off after that feeling very shaken... hands still trembling... don't think the guy survived.</p>
              <p>Went home after that... too shaken to drive.</p>
              <p>So do I need to come out to be a witness? I didn't notice the part where the guy was crossing the road.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, if the person killed is your loved one, what will you thk of the driver? was he at fault? was he supposed to drive carefully? any defensive driving? can it be avoided? so many puzzle?</p>

              <p>If you think he went by a route that cost you more than $10, you can settle it amicably by asking for a discount, if he really dont know his way well, most likely he will charge u lesser.</p>

              <p><br>True, as bro pool said, eye witness can help, but if eye witness are of the same trade, that is another TD, it is hard to make a submission into the court base on nepotism or favoritism, the judgel will prefer a person that is not in the same trade to be witness, however, that will only reduce the sentences, still the driver have to take the punishment, no way to escape. And on the emotion side, if you kill someone on the road, it is very hard to touch the wheel again, you feel so down unless your heart is make of iron.</p>

              <p>Precisely.  And also, depending on the point that your car come into contact with the pedestrian , it can be <strong>totally</strong> the driver's fault even if the pedestrian is jaywalking.</p>
              <p>Folks, always practise defensive driving.  Don't just think that because that pedestrian is jaywalking, it is automatically his fault.  I seems to recall a case where is Merc (or BMW) lady driver hit an ang mo at a traffic junction with the traffic light in the driver's favour..  But, based on the point of contact, it was held that she is at fault and hence, liability.  Worst still, the ang mo estate sued for damages (including potential loss of income) and end up, the lady driver had to was car to earn money to pay for the damages.  The case was about 2-3 years back.</p>

              <p>Believe me, the prosecutor can even ask you what time you sleep yesterday, all the way on havelock road, did you fall asleep? I will said, it is a 80/20 rules, 80% the driver will get punished, the miracle belongs to the 20%</p>
