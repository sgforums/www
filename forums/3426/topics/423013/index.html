              <p>Hi bros... Need your advice.</p>
              <p>I was at the junction of Havelock rd waiting to turn into Zion rd at around 1050pm yesterday when I heard a loud screeching of tires...</p>
              <p>Next moment saw a Trans cab toyota crown ran smack into a chinese guy who was crossing the road. I was unsure whether he was jay walking... all I know my cab was stationary waiting to turn.</p>
              <p>I was horrified and stunned... with 2 paxes in my cab I moved further and parked by the side... Tried to call 995 but line was engaged... I moved off after that feeling very shaken... hands still trembling... don't think the guy survived.</p>
              <p>Went home after that... too shaken to drive.</p>
              <p>So do I need to come out to be a witness? I didn't notice the part where the guy was crossing the road.</p>
              <p>Thanks and be safe...</p>

              <p>1. Die also dont block traffic, must move corpse away. Still need medical personnel to pronounce death before body can be moved away. Therefore, justify the need to call 995.</p>
              <p>2. Must ask to pay the PAX too. If not, later the PAX testify worse. Maybe lose cab license and jail.</p>
              <p>3. Must take down vehicle number, age, and whatever auspicious number.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>would be even better if you had installed a car video cam. no need to say so much, just give the footage to tp. will prove the crown driver's guilt or innocence. i'm inclined to agree with pool, the crown's going straight towards alexandra. means the guy is jay-walking. not too sure if the crown driver won't get penalised even if the light is in his favour. can get nailed for speeding or failure to keep a proper lookout. not as bad as beating red light and killing somebody though, most likely get jail time for it if that's the case. i always standby a spare sd car for my vid-cam. in case anything useful as evidence, just replace the one in the cam with the spare. nearest i ever came to using it (touch wood) traffic light at west coast road / clementi west st.1 junction, green light in my favour, suddenly 1 lady talking on hp just dashed across the road (looked like indonesian maid to me). dashed as in suddenly ran out. lucky for me no pax so just slow cruising at ~40kmh. jammed brakes in time. i wish they would treasure their lives and not talk on hp when crossing roads. didn't feel as shaken as i would have if i did not have the camera. very helpful &amp; reassuring gadget, just like an army. have it ready, but hope that you never have to use it.</p></div>

              <p>Bro, Traffic laws do not look at it this way. Once you hit a person, no matter you right or wrong, you are guilty, and if that person died, more worst. They will sure to measure the tire mark, if no brake mark show, God bless the taxi driver, he sure get charged deep deep. He can forget about driving again.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Bro Pool,</p>
              <p>I hope u take this as a discussion and a learning curve. In the eyes of the laws, those who never drive actually stand a better situation in traffic accident, the police will alway act as the prosecutor for the pedestrian, personally, I had knocked down a person before, he was on a bicycle, near Jurong West going into Safti, yes the light was green, i was travelling at 70km/hr, and he just go across, I was a van delivery driver then. There is also my buddy sitting beside me and another delivery men at the back who are willing to be my witness. But at the traffic police in ubi, they are not allow into admission, merely a statement. When the police lawyer, prosecutor cross examin you, the questions he asked can make you real mad, all questions are leading question and abusing you.</p>
              <p>Are you sure it is a green light?, it is a red light, it is sunny or going to rain?, witness said you travel at 100km/hr, yr brake tyre mark is only 10 metre and very dark meaning you are travelling very fast with a sudden brake, the time is 4.30pm and you knock off at 5.00pm, so you are rushing?. As a experience driver, tell me, What is the speed you should go while moving toward a traffic light junction? 50, 30 or 70? Your vehicle is at 4th gear when police arrive, why is it at the highest gear? the accident happen at 4.30pm and your last call in yr h/p was 4.25pm, are you using your hp while driving? If you are travelling from ang mo kio industrial park down to tuas, it takes at least 20minutes, so are you using hp and driving?</p>
              <p>So, it is not so easy, and especially if the pedestrian died, the police have to make a good report to answer the public, the relatives, friends and parents.</p>
              <p>For my case, the pedestrian was injured, doctor said he may get abit handicap on his left leg, I was fined, banned for a year. After 2 years, I retake my licence, go take taxi courses, but when apply for relief or hirer, comfort rejected me, so I went into those daily rental one, but recently then I am able to get as a relief from 2 companies who are willing to accept me.</p>

              <p>I do agree with Bro pool that fellow colleague statement helps, but still there will be punishment and sentences, especially if the pedestrian is dead, there is no way to say he is wrong or drop the case, the police have to answer to the public, if the police said it is ok, you can go free, then the public will think taxi can just knock anyone down. That is how public with no driving licence see things.</p>
              <p>I understand the perspective of TD, as a TD myself, i hate some foreigners anyhow crossing the road too, but we are cover in metal, they are in flesh, the most you get is a dent on the bumper, and they are gone, a life gone. And I agree with Kengleong, it is very scary, you go into depression and stress thinking over it again n again.</p>
              <p>Hitting another vehicle can be settle quite easily, the most insurance cover, but hitting a person is not so easy, u get a terrible feeling.</p>
