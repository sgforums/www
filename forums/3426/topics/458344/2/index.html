              <p>Brother, I know your frustration, it is the same as some typical singaporean retail shop service people, you ask something, they just point there, you hv to go and find yourself, then when you want the sizes, they tell you no more your sizes, it is like not wanting to sell to you.</p>
              <p>But let us look into different perspectives before we arrive to any concrete comments, here we are referring to a typical Singaporean. Paid wise, pathetic, tips for service, none, supervisors/mgers could be a FT who dotted their own peoples, employers on the other hand, keep saying locals are more expensive and depressed the wages by comparing it with foreigner.</p>
              <p>Some employers take in local just for the sake of quotas requirement to get foreigner, like in ration of 1:3 , you need a singapore, but they never really care for that particular singaporean. Some worst, use their family members name as employees to get foreigners, so you can see how desparate are employers in cutting wage costs.</p>
              <p>Then again, in the social aspect, we are burdened with cost of living, pay and pay coupled with long and irregular hours of working. Ultimately, this would lead to a dumb dumb personality, not only in servicing but also in private life.</p>
              <p>In another word, most singaporean are already dumb with the society and when they start to comment on cost of living and govt policies, they might be labelled as Xenophobia. Now, who create a country full of xenophobia.</p>
              <p>Let us return back to TD, TDs mainly consist of 2 types,</p>
              <p>1st are those who had started as young as the allowable age of 30yo, this group are not much expose to the economy but more on local issue, therefore, tends to lack of exposure to the market trends and norm, their behavor would be more lively and happy, as not knowing and lack of exposure can be blessing for them. For that matter, ignorance is a bliss.</p>
              <p>2nd are those who somehow cracks thru the society and landed themselves as TDs, these group actually do not have the intention of being a TDs, but somehow, somewhere, they came in and got stuck with it, some being exposed to the corporate world and market, are more able to express themselve better and communicate well, well, some, who are from odd jobs, tends to lack of communication and servicing skills and thereby remain quiet.</p>

              <p>TS is talking about the basic communication manner one should have.</p>
              <p>The moment we step out and work, there are communication involve, Taxi driver do not need to be like those top speaker, like a salesman, talk to convince.</p>
              <p>Some basic manner of communicate must be observe. Simple reply and acknowledgment of the message recieved, it isn't that complicated or difficult afterall.</p>

              <p>The best policy is, if one unable to perform his basic, STOP working.</p>
              <p>Choose to remain silent at ALL communication, will only invite more problem, added to the problem that one is trying to solve from working (earning money).</p>
              <p>Customer will not hesitate to show his superiority, especially when irritated. These Service provider will eventually spend more time and effort (no money) to deal with his consequences.</p>
              <p>Instead of working to solve his problem, he is working to invite more problem added....... unwise.</p>

              <p>There is term call brain stuck, especially in jobs like surgeons, mechanics, drivers and some precision and engineering jobs, at some point in time, one can get overly concentrate on the task at hand that he forget about human existence, like a surgeon on the operation table, he will not listen who is talking nor to anyone, a mechanics at work on the engine, you say good morning, he just keep working, you say "I buy coffee for you, i place it near the cabinet, he still work on and remain quiet.</p>
              <p>These type of people are very serious with their work and the brain runs on one drive only. So, perhap that TD is concentrating on his roads, he might had a poor knowledge of the road, or that he had make a mistake early and get farked, or that he is tired, need full concentration and forget about the pax existence but just the destination, he somehow become a part of the taxis mechanism, a robot.</p>

              <p>I think TS intention is to give a gentle advise on simple communication.</p>
              <p>"Acknowlegement"..</p>
              <p>No need to talk much just need to acknowledge with a simple NOD or "OK" in order to response to the passenger.</p>

              <p>We all know what TS wanted, but we just want to tell TS that at some point in time, you just met one quiet and peace TD, you can alway ask for acknowledgeble from him</p>
              <p>I for a few times, goes blank out of tireness and other problems, so when pax, especially in those connection one just board, Hello, morning Uncle, Simon Road, go by Still road!!...thank you. My mind just go blank as I am still arranging my collection, then I start to think where the fuck is simon road...which turn first..then Ahhhh....thru eunos link into tampines road straight into simon place just beside kovan resident, and drove off without any acknowledgeable, so even a person so talkative and friendly like me can sometimes goes blank due to concentration, a much quiet person in characters would complete ignore any greeting.</p>
              <p>So the pax would said back...woei! Hello Uncle, you know where to go or not?, then I wake up and said "Oh...sorry lah, good morning to you, I was brain jam for a while this whole morning, I know where, dun worry, just relax, Uncle drive... you see ok" Now, do you think a ah beng warehouse worker who just started as TDs know how to greet people?? of course as time goes by, he may get F here and there, then maybe he start to learn that you need to greet and respect others who greeted you.</p>
              <p>Then as I said again, many a times, most TD would agree, we greeted paxs nicely, but never get anything from them, Morning Sir, you look good, how is your day so far,....pax just said " Geyland lor 4" just drive on handphone to play game or sms. But of course as service provider we do not bother so much.</p>
              <p>The society of singapore is not as gracious as you thought, people who travel often would know that people greet each other on the public is as normal as eating breakfast, but then, our society breed a very individualistic culture, a servant and alway bowing to boss culture that lack so much graciousness.</p>
