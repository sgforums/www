              <p>Is it just me or do Taxi Drivers have the mentality that it's not their car so they drive as fast as they can and refuse to let other drivers into their lane even though it's almost the end of the exit. (For example, and of course not all taxi drivers are like that. Just 90% of the ones I've seen on the road <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png">)</p>

IMHO, it is the driver, not the car as quickpick and komade has said. My personal experience is that many Merc drivers don't signal (many, not all), But I have had my fair share of fire engine drivers who feel that signalling will cause increased fuel consumption. See, don't just look and you'll find that Sonatas and Wishes have about the same numbers of drivers with the mentality TS mentioned. Open your eyes, remove the bias from your mind and SEE the truth.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To TS, I dispute your figure of 90%. Probably, you keep seeing the same drivers. Most taxi drivers will go out of their way to avoid any incident. It just gets in the way of making money. I will say 90% of TDs will give way whether you signal or not. We just don't want to get involve in any accidents. Not with $2K+ at risk, that's almost what we make in a whole month. Just not worth that moment of ego. I would say that you were unfortunate to encounter the 10% who have to make money in a hurry (to pay debts, etc.)</p></div>

              <p>if u are driving a motorboat on a narrow river and a sampan is in front impeding you, wat's the 1st thought that'll come to yr mind? overtake right? and as ts mentioned, wat is the driver doing in the wrong lane almost at the end of the exit? if cabbies or others, have the right of way, must give way to sotongs in the wrong lane? if in the wrong lane wait a bit lah, signal doesn't mean hv the right to cut in.</p>
              <p>if u know how to do it safely, nobody can deny u the right to cut in! ever wondered why, whenever in heavy traffic conditions, vehicles on lane 1 of expressways near major exits and interchanges can come to a complete stop whereas vehicle on other lanes can continue to move?</p>
              <p>cabbies spent 10-12 hrs on the road every day and time available n traffic conditions play a big part in productivity, we dun hv the luxury to give way here n there when we hv the right of way! how to earn more or hv more time to rest? </p>
              <p>most of us sonata drivers are fast cos the car is torquey and quck. but we are also safe drivers, just that we are more assertive than others on the road!</p>
