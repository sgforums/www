              <p><br> Are you comparing with the same number of taxis on the
              road for blue and yellow ? If both blue and yellow have 5k taxis
              each , do you still think the award still goes to the blue. Of
              course with more blue taxi on the road, its a higher chance for
              them to make mistake. Please compare by percentage.</p>
              <p>But if you compare a company with 3k taxis on the road vs
              10k blue taxis , the frequency for the company with 3k taxis
              appearing more frequently in newspaper with complaint then
              this is consider more shocking.</p>

              <p>i think all this is a matter of perspectives. if i'm on left lane n wanna do relaxed driving, i wun mind if someone who wants to go faster overtakes me. after all, doesn't mean i'm in front n on left lane, everybody must follow behind and the whole road is mine, right? if he tries and i dun feel like defending, let him pass.</p>
              <p>the fact that they try n then back off means they are not reckless. u know like just asking, maybe not politely: "can i go 1st since u r in no hurry?" different people do things at different speed n all of us hv to share the use of the same road.</p>
              <p>but if there is a pax in front and he wanna do a century sprint, he's too reckless to be a TD. he has better wake up before he kills someone or hisself!! </p>

              I still think this is Singaporean's mentality. Like they already know in front got tree pruning, got space on lane 2 dun want to filter in, must wait until reach the cones then they force cut their way into lane 2. Think most of you have encounter this before.
              
              That's why accidents happen, cos lane 2 guy doesn't want to give way, also Singaporean's mentality.

              <p>i think all this is a matter of perspectives. if i'm on left
              lane n wanna do relaxed driving, i wun mind if someone who wants to
              go faster overtakes me. after all, doesn't mean i'm in front n on
              left lane, everybody must follow behind and the whole road is mine,
              right? if he tries and i dun feel like defending, let him pass.</p>
              <p>the fact that they try n then back off means they are not
              reckless. u know like just asking, maybe not politely: "can i go
              1st since u r in no hurry?" different people do things at different
              speed n all of us hv to share the use of the same road.</p>
              <p>but if there is a pax in front and he wanna do a century sprint,
              he's too reckless to be a TD. he has better wake up before he kills
              someone or hisself!! </p>

              <p>sometimes us cabbies hv no choice, halfway up the bridge n suddenly pax esp our foreign guests shoot u with questions. or "pls, pls slow down, let me take some shots!"</p>
              <p>but it is really an awesome sight...even ppl from advanced countries think so, esp MBS.</p>
              <p>yes the lanes are narrow and also meandering alot. tat's why speed limit only 70 kmph. i suppose it will be better once MCE is ready and sheares bridge gets converted into an arterial road.</p>
              <p>then 1 or 2 lanes can be used for photo taking, u know, must hv shots "in front of merlion" n "on the sheares bridge".</p>
