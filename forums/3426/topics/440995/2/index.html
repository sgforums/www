              <p>You guys got a hardon for Sonata issit? Sometimes I'm a bit sick
              of the Sonata bashing / Wish praising in this forum. I wonder would
              it be the other way round if the moderator and most members were
              driving Sonatas instead of Wishes. As usual, all the fire engine
              drivers are the best, smartest, most experienced, most courteous,
              etc..etc..NONE of the sonatas in my group drive the way you all
              described. I guess you could say we're not the hungry
              type. <em>ä¸€ç«¹</em><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; font-size: small;">ç¯™æ‰“ä¸€</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; font-size: small;">èˆ¹äºº. </span>I
              guess there are very few Sonata forumers here. IMHO, it is the
              driver, not the car as quickpick and komade has said. My personal
              experience is that many Merc drivers don't signal (many, not all),
              But I have had my fair share of fire engine drivers who feel that
              signalling will cause increased fuel consumption. See, don't just
              look and you'll find that Sonatas and Wishes have about the same
              numbers of drivers with the mentality TS mentioned. Open your eyes,
              remove the bias from your mind and SEE the truth.</p>

              <p>isn't it obvious this is the anti blue/yellow forum? sometimes almost like speaker's corner? MOST here (n pls read carefully, i say most. if u think u r not then u r not!) i believe ever kena yellow or red cards before. tat's why very frustrating for them, u know subconciously hates the company n that tends to rub off on the company's drivers as well, somemore car not as quick.</p>
              <p>i suppose jealously breeds contempt.true? if wanna debate which company is best, next decade liao also cannot finish but facts r facts and reality is juz waiting for u to face it. there is even this line: "we r happy to be cabbies"!?!?</p>
              <p>to all "reluctant" cabbies here n elsewhere, let's make the most of our situation. we should share n care instead of going at each other's throat. vent yr frustration, fine, but not at each other!</p>

              <p><br>Are you comparing with the same number of taxis on the road for blue and yellow ? If both blue and yellow have 5k taxis each , do you still think the award still goes to the blue. Of course with more blue taxi on the road, its a higher chance for them to make mistake. Please compare by percentage.</p>
              <p>But if you compare a company with 3k taxis on the road vs 10k blue taxis , the frequency for the company with 3k taxis appearing more frequently in newspaper with complaint then this is consider more shocking.</p>
