              <p>Thesedays Private Cars do more than just block other cars (Taxis?), they actively provoke them, maybe to tease for fun or create an opportunity for accident, either way they treat the road and moving cars like a game. A Game of Ego.</p>
              <p>A call came in about 2 traffic lights away from pickup point, need to filter right from left soon (to turn right) as the 2nd traffic light is nearer and shorter.</p>
              <p>check right side, theres a black private car but further back, should be sufficient time to change lane, so gave signal and start tilt car inwards..SUDDENLY, the black private car accelerate so fast until its window to window..i thought maybe i misjudged so i straightened and then slowed down to let it pass.</p>
              <p>but that black car DIDNT accelerate or drive faster. in fact it ALSO slowed down to match my new speed, again window to window..i was like ??</p>
              <p>so i was ok, fine, maybe that driver didnt notice i was signalling to go right earlier until now, so now the driver's letting me to go ahead, i then accelerated again thinking go in front since its slowing down. AGAIN that driver accelerated forward to match window for window..!?</p>
              <p>I feel something is not right, when i look out of my driver seat window at that black car (still on the right), i notice the driver had suddenly switched on its internal cabin light and he was a early thirties fellow in casual, look like those yappies executives. he has a strange half smile smirk on his face and sort of pretended to look down, looking for something somewhere around his handbrake or seat side compartment..BUT as we came neared to the 1st traffic light, HE STOPPED 4 VEHICLE SPACES FROM THE 1ST CAR ON HIS LANE!? i repeat again, he stopped 4 empty vehicle spaces from him to the 1st vehicle (stopped at the traffic light line) on his lane. (his cabin light still on, he still looking downwards, not holding 
              steering wheel)</p>
              <p>As I was slowing down in my lane, theres a bus ahead (also around 3-4 empty vehicle spaces ahead me), and I knew the next traffic light was quite near, so I sped up abit to filter into that 4 vehicle spaces in front of that car. I thought the driver meant for me to go in there..but You guess what that driver did next !!</p>
              <p>While still looking down, he must have suddenly stepped down on the accelerator to forward his car to close down the 4 empty vehicle spaces!!</p>
              <p>Because I moved faster first, I managed to get my vehicle into his lane by the time we both got near to the traffic light. But he still continued to prod forward, so my vehicle got sort of pinched between my lane front bus on the left and that black car on the right. Finally that fellow stopped. But this is not the end!</p>
              <p>Becos I was tilted rightwards, he now switch on high beam! I was next expecting he would flash or horn, but he didnt. When the traffic light turned green to go, I had to do a hard swing leftwards to straighten the vehicle, but if I had overstepped on the accelerator then my vehicle might jutt out into the 3rd right lane where there are also vehicles moving off.</p>
              <p>Later on as I picked up the passenger, I thought back and I realised, that black private car driver was intentionally playing with me at along, from the moment I gave signal to go right til he deliberately set a trap by stopping 4 empty vehicle spaces away from the first vehicle parked the traffic light line. he anticipated I had to filter in there (think he also knew the next traffic light is coming up) so he could pinch me sideways. I dont see any reason for him to suddenly turn on his internal cabin light when we are window to window.. he did it with a half smile and pretending to touch his side compartment, all without looking at me, to tell me:</p>
              <p>HE IS THE KING OF THE ROAD.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, we dont signal so we can filter lane. If we want to signal, then filter first and then signal in the middle of lane change. Otherwise problems can arise from these fucking drivers.</p>
              <p>Remember, just loon and loon. We are here to collect as much fares as we can. We are not here to pick a fight with anybody.</p>
              <p>I am a Toyota Crown driver. Red light junction turn green, I am always first ahead, even with porsche beside me. Of course down the road I lose to them. Up to a certain level, driving fast depends more on skill than the car model.</p>

              <p>i dont hate crowns but in general if a faster car comes behind , pls siam . i do tat all the time. my normal speed is 110 to 120. if you're going  more than that , i will gladly shift for you to pass even if u are china car or german car or taxi.</p>
              <p>f1taxidriver, u dont believe just observe on the expressways , theres bound to have one crown hogging lane 1 &amp; taking his own farking sweet time and a Q of cars behind him.</p>
              <p>even at 100 , u should make it a habit to look at ur rear mirrors for faster cars.</p>

              <p>to be fair,i've came across a fair share of private cars giving way to me when i signal my intention. Most of them will wait patiently behind me when i pick up a fare along the road,i never fail to wave a "thank you" after moving off</p>
              <p>in all aspect,there'll be blacksheeps...be it taxis or private vehicles</p>

              <p>there are good sbs drivers that give way to me for filtering or exit.</p>
              <p>most of the bad drivers have bad attitude and the selfish always "me" type mentality.</p>
              <p>some are panicky ah pek, auntie, chio bu, youngster who horn, flash discrimately.</p>
              <p>some are cocky and thought they are king of the road sporty, hatch back, loud exhaust noise but no speed type.</p>
              <p>truck drivers are another lot you have to watch out..</p>
              <p>of course i also met many of our TD drivers of which good soul type and bad apples type regardless of car models and company.</p>
