              this new hirer and the company technical do not seem to see eye to eye.
              the technical will try to avoid completely servicing every problem of the car, always say no big problem what or no parts, can delay even more than a few weeks to months the hirer tell me. but when something goes wrong zhun zhun during my shift, the hirer will insist i myself report to technical directly, then the technical say have parts, but i am responsible for the problem so i must pay then they will do. so at first less than hundred i thought ok, but second time very soon another thing spoil, then the hirer insist i myself report in to them again but i worry if i report they will insist its my problem again i pay, how to handle this type situation. i have friends who tell me certain technical want to cut costs so they only service when necessary until no choice or whoever they can  arrow to pay, and my hirer knows their style better than i new so i feel like he always like to push to me as much as possible. these things happen 3rd time already in very short time

              <p>If base on my experience , TS not driving SMRT taxis , cos SMRT will never have problems with spare parts for sure . Anyway SMRT , i heard they entertain downtime anytime .</p>
              <p>I felt Comfort even lesser chance , cos Comfort they die die will get thing done , never play Taichi Master .</p>
              <p>It could be Smart , but who the hack would want to partner a Smart hirer as relief ?</p>
              <p>I think Premier is out of contention , anyway Premier hirer also hard to find .</p>
              <p>So last culprit could be TransCab , i personally encounter they always shortage of spart parts knn , before i resigned a few months back .</p>
              <p>Then always pay here pay there , money talk .</p>
              <p>Then TransCab many TaiChi China mechanics .</p>
              <p>My blind guess is TransCab .</p>
              <p>Not biased , just being sharp .</p>

              <p>Could be another story, we have not hear from the hirer or the service people, let us be more professional here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, now you know why it take 5 months to sentence the SCDF chief.</p>
              <p>Hirer may stand that relief damaged all those external superficial part, the rear light bracket, the side mirror, the wipers..so he have to take responsibility for it, already told him to change it himself, I already bear with him for so long because I can hardly get a relief around my area</p>
              <p>Technical service peoples might said, we only service the engines and safety aspect of the vehicle like steering wheel , brakes, but when we saw the real light bracket broken, we asked the hirer if want to pay for it, he said let his relief settle it, he is the one who broke it.</p>

              i think better not say too much details it may be obvious maybe my hirer family or freidns may find out
              
              when i first started driving for this, i find many things spoiling or near spoiling but when i feedback to hirer he like say not big not important, or already feedback to technical. then he say technical keep telling him, either they already change new parts need time to be better, if can drive then drive o. or they say really no parts need long time or dunno when, they like hint to him, if dunno want to drive then dun drive return car la, but i think my hirer scare this.
              
              what some of you say may make sense, i feel this company everyone like to change their story to side themselve so they dun have to take account because they very costs control, so end up who drive who report then they quickly aim who is fault. now everytime i drive i also pray dun something happen or spoil in my shift, if i feel something not ok, i will just stop and drive back. but last 3 times things really spoil just when i halfway back, then i call hirer, but hirer say he sleeping or not free orr he dun know, give me other phone number, insist i must report or if can settle myself before his shift, but next time come back tell me company tell him i pay
