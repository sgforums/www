              <p>The motorcycle guy have some bruise so I sent him to the hospital. We then exchange particulars. As my friend advised me to bring the car to the workshop I immediately did so. To my horror I was advised to privately settle with the guy.As I did not want to they reluctantly take my statement. As my car have only a minor dent the guy at the counter say my wish did not required repair. To my horror my wish have a deep cut and another at the lower part when I later came out of the office. My understanding is they cause more damage so they can claim the full amount.As a wish driver do not go to tan lim motor if only minor accident</p>

              <p>it sounds a bit ridiculous ..... u mean Union TransCab create more damages to the little dent ?</p>
              <p>I don't believe they can do that .... what if their action was taken on photos ?</p>
              <p>Furthermore , what if the motorcycle pillion took all the pictures of your dent at that point of accident ?</p>
              <p>And when insurance company of TransCab submit those claims , the motor bike insurance don't want to pay , cos according to the pictures taken by the pillion , at that point of accident , those damages was not justify .</p>
              <p>Then again , TransCab in trouble .</p>
              <p>Trans cannot suka suka one .</p>

              <p>So all in all ....who's fault ?</p>
              <p>If your fault , it will caused you a bomb to repair that minor dent .</p>
              <p>If that bike's fault , let them deal with it .</p>
              <p>Sounds to me , if solely your fault , or 50/50 , the workshop will advise repair outside .... dun waste such money , expensive to be done by taxi coy .</p>
              <p>If pillion's fault , i don't understand why they hesistate ?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It is their formality to take photo when the car come in for repair. It was just their luck that they wack and I came out of the office to have a smoke. I did not actually see them wack but saw the person running to the workshop and the big boss shouting at him just for show. But I immediately saw the new damage. The next day they want me to sign for the repair and I refuse to sign on the dotted line.Tan lim have sent me a letter to say I was at fault for the accident and have to pay 1605 dollars.To me the motor repair about 500 the motor guy mc about 500 so they wack can collect 600.Transcab very funny I try to find the insurance company they say they have 3 insurance campany I was directed to liberty liberty say no they do not insured all taxi directed to first capital and merry go round. I am not going to pay a single cent until I see the repair bill from the lawyer.</p></div>

              <p>accidents?</p>
              <p>there was one time a taxi-driver said they drive like maniacs because "if they get into accident, the company settle.. whereas the car owner loses use of his car for at least a week.. the most he lose money for one day"</p>
              <p>now that the workshops also so scary, makes me wonder about what's going on in the cab community...</p>
              <p>btw.. the other day, i almost got hit by a cab (again).. i was trying to filter out from the left lane of the PIE as i just entered it.. i looked, signaled, looked again.. middle lane clear.. so i filter in when without signalling, i bet without even seeing me, a blue Comfort Cab cut from the right lane, in front or me, causing me to swerve to get out of his way, into the left lane...</p>
              <p>i wonder why is it most of the time the near-accidents almost always involve a taxi recklessly changing lanes or muscling through without regard to others.. then i thought about what that taxi-driver said... it is scary..</p>
              <p>do you guys have the same philosophy as that guy?</p>

              <p>Ya lor ... i was asking Kim Chye whether he took the pictures on the spot , at the time of the event .... ?</p>
              <p>If he did , no way Tan Lim can whack Kim Chye tat way .</p>
              <p>So it's Kim Chye's fault for that accident ?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My opinion , generally what cabby will do if base on Kim Chye's case .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pay that accident access $1000 , tat's all , legally his fault for that accident .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Then for his own vehicle , do it at cabby's own workshop . Definitely not Tan Lim .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kim Chye also at that point , should have ask Tan Lim the estimate repair cost .</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Usually expensive . </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wrong decision made .</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My hirer got hit on our left side mirror , that lorry driver compensate $20 .</p>
              <p>In the end , i sent my hirer to Alexandra Village to get every repair , cost $300 nett .</p>
              <p>Imagine u sent this minor repair to TransCab's workshop ?</p>
