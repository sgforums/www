              <p>The MDT shown.</p>
              <p>Started 6.27am ...</p>
              <p>Interval 6.24pm ..... $273 collection .</p>
              <p> this cabby driving dayshift so what about the CBD... ERP gantries charges how many time did he go in and out, how can that be $273 total  collection as teolk said he did once or maybe some more a few times, (my best run was a few days ago, did $259 from 0600-1715hrs)   how can that be and  possible...for those 26 days everydays as mentioned, that why? this I must correct you this, is a mistake or maybe you are unaware of the mistake.</p>
              <p>this doesn't consent me anyway...just see something and say something when things are out of hand as mentioned,( contradict) ordinary citizen just doing his part in this community...mah.</p>

              <p>for omo to do $300 everyday is possible but very very tiring</p>
              <p>0600hrs to 1700hrs do $180 (i think tis amt is reasonable unless that cabby idle) &amp; from 1700 to 2200 another $120</p>
              <p>this is very possible esp night part,if can't get even $120 from 1700 to 2200 can go bang wall liao.exp driver can get at least $100 from 5-8pm</p>
              <p>if anyone can maintain this for 30 days I will really salute him! this guy that pool mentioned is really a fighter. To earn $5k plus he deserve it! but his health &amp; family relationship i worried for him</p>
              <p>I tried b4 hit $300 everyday for almost 2wks as an omo,one word only: "No life"</p>

              <p>A) start at 11.14pm end at 11.28pm total km 4.3 fare $7.00.</p>
              <p>we just need only 0.14 minutes...collection $7.00.  (strike 4D small)</p>
              <p>example...$53 half shift rental from 5am to 5pm...12 hours divided $53 an hour $4.42. so for 0.14 minutes what will be the rental?</p>
              <p>example...$0.88 a liter of diesel for a km, so for 4.3 km what will be the cost of fuel burned?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The above mentioned terrific transcab driver is actually my very good friend. From the time he took the cab on 30th sep 2009 , he has been doing 300+ on average every day. Bad days also will have 270 (very few occasions) at least , otherwise his monthly target would be very hard to hit.</p>
              <p>His tactics are quite simple , if from 6 am to 4 pm , he cannot meet his target of 200 , he will continue driving all the way till 10 pm.</p>
              <p>For example , 6 pm to 4 pm his collection is $160 . As all nite drivers will know, it is easy for him to hit another 140 from 4 pm to 10 pm ... am i right? hence  he is able to collect 300+ every day . why? simply because his hours are fucking long . nothing much to do with skills and experience . Its all about sheer stamina , energy and will power. Btw he is 46 yrs old. solid right ? ahhaha</p>
              <p>he is the only one hirer who can tell me that he does not need a relief as it would interfere with his timing and rhythm hahaha.</p>
