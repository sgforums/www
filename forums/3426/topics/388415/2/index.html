              <p>The question for those, retired, unemployed, retrenched, and those nothing to do, look ing  for job...not too  worry, liao. this shoe just to good to believe , with the right size and the right room for them, even those graduated  without a job still waiting, yet to find one....no need liao your starting pay is more than three K no need  go   to  the field..like your fellow comrades..taxi driving is so easy, as mentioned...just like what alvin buying marine fishes keeping in his marine tank...haha.issit.</p>

              <p>Most taxi drivers can say in the coffeeshop and anywhere like the washingbay or where places which they gather 2 to 3... 4 to 5. Most of the subjects that brought up... especiall collection and the good result on their outing,     all  are blowing as they like...... like trumpet and saxophone, are this not blowing instruments. only the bastanders their ears...probelm on listening whether that is the right note they are blowing according to the tempo.</p>
              <p>If like as today peak hours raining, everywhere traffic jam accidents, most major highways are in trouble... cars cars everywhere, so for those two and the half hours, how many long and short journeys can you do. So even a super driver as mention, show me for this two and the half hours, what will be your collection. We are dayshift drivers, what the condition and how super you are (got dragon got tiger in hokkien)...all are arranged but your luck's of the day, like last tuesday... me picked one pax  in the morining as started at 7.00am at buangkok green one lady pax, heading to tuas ave 8, long super long peak hours, can this say that i am experience, she is just waiting there only my luck and coincident at the right time on this way toward her, i picked her.Just in Time should say, if my luck not favour me another cab infront of me may picked her and go...right. So from here to KPE&gt;ECP&gt;AYE...total trip $41.20  comfort cabcharge customer. but you know this trip take me nearly an hours to do...traffic jam near Normanton accident.</p>
              <p>Than after completed at Tuas Ave 8 what will you do...our friend said strategy, experience, knowledge, hardwork , persistent , and consistency. Aiya bullshit, just simply wait for your luck is you are with comfort n city, Calls..if not the nearest to old jurong road than to Jurong West housing estates, or Jurong point , Pioneer MRT, Joo Koon MRT, so this are basic dayshift driver are doing if you are in that area. What super Taxi driver... me also can hit that kind of target but not everyday are like today. I think he also do as like me...if he is at that destination after completed his job at tuas...8am ...  ya. this are potential hotspot, or may he may like Boon Lay...further i don't think so only one and the half hour left on peak hours slot.</p>
              <p>Seeing is Believeing...but that can never be the only one example, for those 26 days if evreyday $200. there will be plenty for peoples queing the taxi office everyday, this is SG ....if that is so good  peoples will   sleep at in the Q at night, chop chop for a space.... as peoples are doing, like those peoples queing for property, warehouse sales, and even hello kitty those incident. hehe. More than $5000 a month why? are you still waiting for.</p>

              <p><br>CarBikeBus , rental was never an issue for most of us , i dunno who's those drivers who want to ask for lower rental , how low they want ? i dunno .</p>
              <p>But i just know , just $1 off from current rental , is $20,00o lost of revenue for CDG taxis daily .</p>
              <p>I don't think those Yao Gui CDG wanna throw those un-neccessary profits away .</p>
              <p>They rather give back to their shareholders than the cabbies .</p>
