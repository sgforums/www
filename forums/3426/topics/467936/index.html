              <p><strong>Recent accidents involving taxis have raised concerns over how safety-conscious taxi drivers are.</strong></p>
              <p>But cab operators said that they have been going the extra mile to 
              improve safety among their drivers, even though it is not required by 
              the authorities.</p>
              <p>On March 19, there was a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> three-way accident involving three cab</span>s at 
              the junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8. No one was 
              hurt.</p>
              <p>Prior to that, a <span style="color: #ff0000;">taxi went out of control on the Pan-Island 
              Expressway </span>on Jan 19, resulting in the death of a woman and injuries to 
              three people.</p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) told My Paper last Thursday that 
              there are no requirements for taxi companies to send their cabbies for 
              extra driving classes, following an accident.</p>
              <p>But Singapore's biggest taxi operator, ComfortDelGro, said that it <span style="color: #ff0000;"> sends cabbies for a defensive-driving course</span> if they are found to be at 
              fault or partially at fault in two accidents within a year.</p>
              <p>The full-day course, comprising theory and practical tests, is held at ComfortDelGro Driving Centre.</p>
              <p>SMRT's vice-president of corporate communications, Mr Kalai 
              Natarajan, said its taxi drivers are counselled and sent for an internal
               safe-driving course if they are involved in accidents.</p>
              <p>"If there were to be a subsequent accident within the same year, we 
              (will) issue a warning and will require hirers to attend the 
              defensive-driving course conducted by the Singapore Safety Driving 
              Centre, at their cost," he added.</p>
              <p>The course consists of a theory lesson on driving safely and an 
              assessment of their driving. Feedback from the assessment will be given 
              to SMRT and the firm will decide whether the cabbies are fit to drive 
              its cabs.</p>
              <p>Mr Ang Hin Kee, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee 
              for Transport, said that taxi companies send their drivers for the extra
               driving classes because they value road safety and the safety of their 
              customers.</p>
              <p>There are also measures to ensure older cabbies are still able to drive safely.</p>
              <p>For taxi drivers who want to extend their vocational licences beyond 
              the age of 70, the LTA requires them to take an assessment comprising a 
              medical examination, an occupational-therapist evaluation and an on-road
               driving test.</p>
              <p>But not all taxi operators need their cabbies who have been involved in accidents to go for extra driving lessons.</p>
              <p>For instance, Prime Taxi does not have such a practice. Instead, it 
              handles cabbies who get into accidents on a case-by-case basis.</p>
              <p>Still, some driving instructors believe taxi drivers are more accident-prone than many other road users.</p>
              <p>Private driving instructor Frankie Yue said that taxi drivers "are in
               more of a rush than most other road users", because they work on a 
              time-based schedule.</p>
              <p>"I've noticed certain bad road habits that are more prevalent among 
              taxi drivers, such as running yellow lights and not checking their 
              mirrors while making a turn," he said.</p>
              <p>Another private driving instructor, who wanted to be known only as Mr
               Lim, agreed, adding that "taxi drivers tend to speed more and cut 
              (into) other people's lanes very dangerously".</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Mr Ang, who is also the adviser to the National Taxi 
              Association, said that "everyone plays a part in road safety" and that 
              we "cannot pinpoint it (on) one road user".</p>
