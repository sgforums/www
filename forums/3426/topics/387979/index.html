              <p>One evening Peak Hour i picked up a korean couple from Raffles City to a condo near shangrila. End of trip, knn the korean husband F""ck and shit words about the fares of the extras. I explain and knn like we owe them a living. He don't understand the CBD surcharge and peak hour..</p>
              <p>KNNCCB, i don't bother anymore to explain..WTF this people complained our systems but they don't realize their fucking taxi fares in Seoul is also F@@king expensive and some of them really can charge you a one trip fare without meter like in KL.  Wake up FT!!! don't complain our system and think we SG must be cheapo.</p>

              <p>Yesterday evening around 10:00 pm i picked up one angmoh at street near Ascott bldg in Finlayson. </p>
              <p>Club Street - okay.. in my mind it is damn near but maybe he don't want to walk as it is quite a distance. Moreover he is fresh of cologne spray.</p>
              <p>Okay immediate drive up the ramp and turn left into Club Street...into one of the club.</p>
              <p>KNNCCB - you know what he said?  What's the $3 extra? I said CBD (city surcharge)...</p>
              <p>He said - you know the street here is so quiet and there is still CBD surcharge... I told him this is CBD SURCHARGE and you knows it.....Somemore he knows Club St and he knows Ang Siang Hill...</p>
              <p>He starts to mumble "fxx" and sht words that really piss me off.... I don't bother to explain further as this type of people again think if they cannot fit into our systems then they should make noise officially.  His fxxkin accents i knew which country he is from and his fxxking country is not better but 100% worst then us.  TIPS here TIPS there with all the unwritten rules even if the service is lousy you got to TIPS......</p>
              <p>Wake up FT angmoh...!!!!</p>

              <p>likeyou,,, you have to realize how the CBD surcharge , location surcharge derive...and why peak hour surcharge come about...</p>
              <p>think about it and sieve thru past 10 years news archive.... No taxi at clark q, long pax waiting at airport.....etc.....</p>
              <p>WHY???? taxi driver also human mah....need to change shift and have proper meal at meal time,,,,why bother to RUSH all the way back to downtown in empty cab? Waste Fuel and time....which equals money lost...and energy...</p>
              <p>Why midnight surcharge?  Taxi driver also human lah....Graveyard shift...</p>
              <p>Why morning and evening peak hour surcharge?  This is to encourgage more taxi drivers to come out on the road for more supply....to match demand.</p>
              <p>Peak hour better rest if no "perks" or better change shift to have proper family life....Don't you think so?  Because Peak hour - traffic snarl,,,very slow,,,Actually sometime cannot make as much as non-peak hour even with Peak hour surcharge....</p>
              <p>So Peak Hour Surcharge is nothing lah....</p>
              <p>CBD , location surcharge , airport surcharge, RWS surcharge.....- sounds complicated right?   Yah lor, have to live with it....as don't forget we have also ERP &amp; COE &amp; PARF value ----Alll this is also fccsking complicated right?  Everyone still pay for it!!! ha..ha.ha..</p>

              <p>Teolk, many more angry scenarios including asking paxes to get down my taxis for various reasons.  Many times fuck taxi driver in front of me to get out of the Q for cutting Q at the airport and make sure he get out of the Q. Will share with you guys when i have the time to write.</p>
