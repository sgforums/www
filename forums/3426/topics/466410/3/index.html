              where got no use?
              
              i did not print them, their executive ?
              
              no use, you already mentioned many telling members not to report their collection
              
              over here  in the forum and many don't listen.( i strongly agree on this)
              
              Now you see all taxi coy increasing the rental because of all this collection date
              
              which was reported over this forum
              
              so they realise, tds are doing very well ma, so all start adjusting rental upwards
              
              ( even though some taxi balance coe are still cheap which is transfer to new taxi)
              
              got use does not always mean good use, sometime bad use also
              
              you go and think about it,

              <p>As a individual TD , i seriously dont really give a fark about taxi cos &amp; their policies , al behaving like big big bullies , rental sama sama . All play different roles to pluck TDs .</p>
              <p>CDG pluck TD by poking &amp; siding pax</p>
              <p>Transcab &amp; SMRT pluck TD with accident excess &amp; substandard booking system and equipment.</p>
              <p>So got any use? members being held together is not by discussin taxi policies , it is by arranging where the next kopi outing or bbq chalet will be la. Kopi outings are the place where TDs are more willing to share the real stuff about taxi driving &amp; how to beat the system.</p>
              <p>Sometimes the lesser u all talk , the more TDs will suffer lesser.</p>
