              <p>Day before yesterday I met a real graduate driver.</p>
              <p>Took a cab, driver Indian but the way he talk I thought maybe FT. Then listen some more, got AngMoh accent (English like you hear Prem players talk, even my sister now living there also sounds a bit like it, the way they use certain words to explain things).</p>
              <p>So I ask him you 'new citizen' is it? He said no, born here, raised here but when to live in England for degree. Now he wants get another or upgrade the degree, so took up taxi driving part-time to pay for his fees.</p>
              <p>This is lah is the real graduate, not the funny ones who come talk cock. Because real undergraduates will take an extra job like taxi driving to pay for their fees. </p>
              <p>He also never talk big, knows it's tough to drive cab, but will give it a go, to help him in his studies.</p>
              <p>So all the graduates, please lah, Tdriving not for you to come and try to earn xxxx amount. You want to drive to tide you over, keep you going until a better offers comes up, then fair enough, like this guy.</p>

              <p>Totally agree with your final statements. Expecting a 5 figure monthly income driving taxi is setting the bar way too high. </p>
              <p>During course instructor said one of his friend drove 15-16hrs a day, 7 days a week for full 31days to get $10k before rental and fuel, and that's on a good month.</p>
              <p>So to reach $15k i think meter cannot stop one, every next pax continue the previous pax fare... LoL</p>

              <p>But that is also a mistake some people make in taking their degrees in foreign unis.</p>
              <p>UK unis are ranking based they have maybe like 120 unis. So just because you get a degree doesnt mean it's very good, if for example your degree from uni No 90 or something like that. Also depend which course you took, you took mass comm, forget about it la, unless the BBC offer you a job, that degree boh pakai. A mechanic can earn more than you.</p>
              <p>So what some do is pursue another degree to back that up or do their Masters etc. I think this guy was taking his Masters, or getting a specific degree for a specific job he has in mind. Maybe you want to become an economist, so your degree in social studies has some value but not attractive enough to potential employers, who prefer an econs degree.</p>
              <p>As for our Govt, EDB, all TCSS. They will offer you something really crap, which you probably wont take. Then they say you choosy. My friend had to wait 2 years after his degree to land a job he liked at SPH. </p>
              <p>Unless you super smart or part of the elite, the EDB, will tell you to go fly a kite.</p>

              <p>Day before yesterday I met a real graduate driver.</p>
              <p>Took a cab, driver Indian but the way he talk I thought maybe
              FT. Then listen some more, got AngMoh accent (English like you hear
              Prem players talk, even my sister now living there also sounds a
              bit like it, the way they use certain words to explain things).</p>
              <p>So I ask him you 'new citizen' is it? He said no, born here,
              raised here but when to live in England for degree. Now he wants
              get another or upgrade the degree, so took up taxi driving
              part-time to pay for his fees.</p>
              <p>This is lah is the real graduate, not the funny ones who come
              talk cock. Because real undergraduates will take an extra job like
              taxi driving to pay for their fees. </p>
              <p>He also never talk big, knows it's tough to drive cab, but will
              give it a go, to help him in his studies.</p>
              <p>So all the graduates, please lah, Tdriving not for you to come
              and try to earn xxxx amount. You want to drive to tide you over,
              keep you going until a better offers comes up, then fair enough,
              like this guy.</p>

If not, they will be stucked "inside" this miserable industry.... <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Personally, my ex-colleague from the bank was retrenched back in 1997 (Asian Crisis).. drove taxis for closed to 2 years before rejoined back to the industry at a lower paid job.. but was retrenched the second time when Bank mergers (<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">OCBC-</span></strong>Keppel-Tat Lee, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">DBS</span></strong>-POSB, <strong><span style="color: #008080;">UOB</span></strong>-OUB) occurred in 2002.  He went back to TD... until now.... <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
