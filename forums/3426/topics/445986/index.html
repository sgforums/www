              <p>U always see such sight on the road at night!</p>
              <p>Two days ago, saw with my own eyes, a Transcab Wish overturn at the junction on Fort Rd/Tanjong Rhu Road.</p>
              <p>How a car can overturn on such a small road, u guys should know best, speed plus cornering right?</p>
              <p>I just used this incident to tell me pax.</p>
              <p>Knn, crazy, from Bt Panjang wanna go Cineleisure, say she is late already, need to reach in 10 mins.</p>
              <p>Someone here asked me not to hug my pax, let them go as fast as possible, advise me 100km not enough, ask me go 120-130.</p>
              <p>It's this reason that such things happen la, just to earn yr few dollars, I must put my life and family at stake, u think it's worth it?</p>
              <p>I tried once 2 days ago, was at AP, got to be at Pender Rd for advance job, only got 10 mins to reach the destination, really rush all the way at 130, desperate, anxious. On second thought, is it really worth it.</p>
              <p>For me, I got close to 5 advance, back to back, and if one late, all delay and I want to challenge myself to complete all without hickcup, but I think back, really "xiao"</p>
              <p>Just think, that car overturn on CNY's eve, think of his family. Be taxi driver need to be like that meh?</p>
              <p>Every night u can see, taxi zooom here, zooom there, really like Formula 1. Look at all the accidents at night, almost all got taxi involved, if not, both also taxi or just taxi alone.</p>

              <p>wanna share something with u guys.</p>
              <p>That day, I pick up a pax going to Tanjong Rhu Rd.</p>
              <p>I know that place, been there a few times liao, so I know turn left is Tanjong Rhu, right is Meyer Rd.</p>
              <p>But I dunno what the fuck makes me think I must be heading for Tanjong Katong, keep looking out for it until I missed the Fort Rd turn and my pax say "hey u supposed to turn at Fort Rd right?" Only then I realised my mistake.</p>
              <p>Next alternative is just to turn at Mountbatten and heads toward Fort Rd and the moment I reach Tanjong Rhu, saw it with my own eyes, the Transcab already overturned but not too long ago.</p>
              <p>Was wondering if I had make the correct turn at Fort Rd exit at that time, I would have witness it on the spot or even involved in it. Is it some divine forces leading me away from it?</p>
              <p>I also dunno. I guess the pax also might be thinking that way.</p>

              <p>I dun think the transcab need to go at 120 on a small road to overturn.</p>
              <p>Even for expressways, 120 is already 20% off the speed limit and u are committing an offence and endangering your life as well as other ppls life and properties for that meagre $xxx?</p>
              <p>Driving and enjoy 130 at own time, own target is different from rushing for an appointment right?</p>
              <p>Of course with night driving, sleepyness and lack of alertness are enough reasons for one to slow down and not speed right?</p>

              <p>When new, one tends to be more kiasu.</p>
              <p>My thinking and yours, at your level is different.</p>
              <p>My main worry when I come out for the day's work is where to get pax. So a bird in hand is worth 2 in bush right? I haven't reach the level to pick and choose, haven't know how to interview. Anyone come in I also happy right? Didn't realised that if 4 ppl come in, chances of 4 different location is very high.</p>
              <p>So all advance booking come in just grab lor. For me now, it's more of whether I an get that job or not cos nowadays, if u stop and think for a fraction of a second, the job is gone.</p>
              <p>But slowly, over the weeks, I do have my own criteria in sieving jobs and this get more stringent as I learn. My ideal Advance job is from Jurong to Airport on midnight charges.</p>
              <p>Taking 5 or more jobs is just to challenge myself la, feel glad that I can actually got all of them and feel even greater that I can complete them all without hiccup, but that'a all la, want me do that everyday, no thrill liao.</p>
              <p>I know veteran here are not into Advance, CDG, or whatever and if new ppl here dun follow their advise, we are deem stubborn.</p>
              <p>Just let at learn and get burn and we will know, U guys not like that when we start right? So as we learn and wings get harder...... then we know.</p>
              <p>For now, I already learn something:</p>
              <p>when taking advances, look out for names, English, Japanese name can take, the rest all taiko, kanna go long trip.</p>
              <p>Got this XXX name which I won't reveal for fear of being branded racist, from Sentosa to JW. Got this job cos give me a chance to go Jurong and hopeful got chance to get calls from Tuas or around the area so that I can learn and get to my next level.</p>
              <p>Knn, ended up 4 xxx workers and dam fucking noisy, talking all the way and going to 4 different places. and dam fucking smelly too. Just bear with them and finally the suffering is over but all mood is gone. Got to wind down all the windows for some fresh air. Next day, found so many sands all over the car.</p>
              <p>So next time, Sentosa to Jurong - never- over my dead body.</p>
              <p>And now, while sweeping, my eyes is learning to filter out one particular race liao. Stingyto the max and usually go more than one place, pay money expect u to round up or up to the cents, no need to mention tips. Every single one the same pattern.</p>
              <p>All these learn from experience right?</p>

              Short and simple. All kind of drivers here Do Not Know How To Drive.
              In near future, Worst. Why? More Turbo Charged or TwinTurbo cars in Songapore roads. The drivers now really don't know the fundamental technic of driving on the road. Impatient is the main culprit, they can't slow down and check to make a turn at the pedestrian traffic junctions at time, plus less TP on the road to manage traffic flow and issue summons on Inconsiderate Driving Offences. That why I always make myself remain calm while driving and dun let Electric gadget or phone calls interrupt our driving. But still see a lot a lot of road idiots cannot afford a Blue Tooth ear piece while driving. Even those rich man's toy drivers also using phone on their right hand while drive with their left. This country's law is getting bullshit now. 
              I say if you are not a carefully driver, my advice is drive an old vehicle. If my financial allows, I will retires driving all kinds of vehicles on Singapore roads. Really sick of people who dun really drive properly. I encountered numerous incidents that drivers nearly caused great harm on other road users due to the stupidity act. This include TD new or old hand.
