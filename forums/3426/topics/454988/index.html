              <p>No need to worry. Police don't just arrest you and throw you into jail rightaway, or CNB in this case. They gotta get to the root of the matter, as a TD it's very plausible that the items does not belong to the TD, if supposing you're stopped with it in the back. </p>
              <p>And if you had found it and kept it front, very easy if you dont have time to go to police straightaway, call your company inform them of the find and ask them to keep a record of the call. later when free hand over to police.</p>
              <p>If you innocent no need to worry, worst case ask for polygraph test, you will definitely pass if you have nothing to hide.</p>

              <p>Like some ppl still believe that no matter what just because got serial numbers in ballot papers, the Govt can trace how you voted and punish you for it, be it rejecting your requests later on in life.</p>
              <p>This drug trafficking or for that any criminal matter, doesn't mean you will be jailed or hanged once your caught. There has to a proper investigation, a proper recodring of statements, witness accounts if any. This is not China or North korea where you get arrested this week and hanged next after being found guilty.</p>
              <p>Of course you find drugs it's a serious matter, but it's still the CNB or police job and then later in court, the prosecution's job to prove it. </p>
              <p>Whether 1 kilo or 1 gram is immaterial if it's not yours and you came upon by chance, so long as did your due diligence. You never check after pax leave doesn't mean you're answerable to a charge. But if notice and picked it up and found it, then you have to do some due diligence and report it to your company firstly or the police. A 999 call will suffice, you no need to go, the Police will come to you or the operator will ask you if the suspect is still in the area, can you recognise who left it etc, if not, she will ask you to hand over to the police. Once you call 999 it is recorded, cannot run away from it. The call will be saved if it's subject to a criminal matter, if not I think after 6 months or a year the tape is re-run etc.</p>
              <p>So don't jump the gun and start imagining wild things andlisten to rumour. </p>
              <p>But say, you really bo chap, find it, you never call just relax maybe later want to handover and then suay suay kena road block and found with it. Of course you're liekly to be arrested but the matter will be investigated and your statement recorded, the police will have to verify your story and check your movements. You got no drug record, your urine negative, lie detector pass, you still think you will be charged?</p>
              <p>So think before imagining. </p>
              <p>There have been cases where CNb tail a suspect and he enters a cab, later they stop the cab arrest the suspect, of course the driver is detained (not arrested) while the CNB check to see whether involved or not with the suspect. You don't have the suspect's number on your phone, your trip details show you all over singapore ferrying passengers, you will released as was the case in 3 cases I know of.</p>

              <p>My friend arrested a trafficker at Karachi Restaurant along Changi Road once. Actually he never arrest for trafficking, was patrolling saw a Malay guy behaving suspiciously, went in and stop him. </p>
              <p>Later screen him, he was wanted for some other case, so arrested and brought back to police station. Later in the station my friend felt he forgot something, oh ya the guy had a bag on the table. He drove back there, found the bag, the restaurant boss was shaken say never touch the bag. My friend checked the bag, and found drugs totalling 200gm. The guy was also arrested therafter for trafficking.</p>
              <p>After analysis (only the pure drug is counted, roughly what drug on sale has only 7-12% purity) they pure heroin found to weigh 27gm.</p>
              <p>He got a good lawyer who convinced the High court judge the guy was a heavy addict and the drug solely for his own use, the judge accepted his story and sentenced him to 27 years not death.</p>
              <p>I also got my own story, but don't want to share, here, I arrested a couple, the guy got the death penalty while his girlfriend got 3 years.</p>
              <p>The moral here, is death penalty cases is not suka suka one, it's very thorough and must have a high degree of proof.</p>
