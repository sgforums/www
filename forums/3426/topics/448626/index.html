              often chinese evening newspapers reported this or that TD suddendly passed away while sleeping, or died while inside the taxi.
              
              Deadth  was due to fatigue(overworked)16hrsx30 dys = 480 hrs as compared to other workers put in around 200hrs a mth.
              
              Must they drive that many hrs a day to cover rentals,fuel &amp; just to bring home 3k home?
              
              Maybe the LTA need to look into this,sth is v v wrong in the chain,need to be corrected .

              <p>base on the demand now , one hour $30 consistently very good liao .</p>
              <p>Like mine day relief .... for me , he quite consistent , started 5.30am , end 2pm sometimes early , collection $160-$180 range including ERP .</p>
              <p>Average income u also can figure out .</p>
              <p>Taking him as an example , if he collected $160 , that's for say 7 hours job , meaning that's what an OMO needed to cover for rental and fuel , without considering wages .</p>
              <p>7 hours .</p>

              <p>Why Pool never goes into OMO ?</p>
              <p>Why Pool play lots of badminton ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I had problems with my gastric in my 9 months of OMO , can drive until tell paxes wait a while , stop at highway road shoulder and vomit out those acids . After vomitting , giddy , hungry no appetite to eat , very sad . In the end , thanks to NUH , gave me Zimor , cured my gastric reverse problems , from that time onwards , no way i am going back to that kind of life .</p>
              <p>I realized body can get stiffer and stiffer after driving long hours , so playing badminton can loosen those stiff shoulders and back . No turning back since .</p>
              <p>I loves eating fish cos it has got no fats at all ! And after doing my annual body checkups , family doctor told me my good chlor not enough , bad chlor too much , solution ? Eat more fish and chicken .</p>
              <p>Here you go , no pork for me , i live like a muslim , pork were never the main dish in my family , one of the worst food human can eat . That's pork .</p>
              <p>I love pig's legs , but has to cut down , and cut down alot .</p>

              <p>He was a OMO all the while .</p>
              <p>From SMRT , TransCab then CDG .</p>
              <p>Now he did not OMO at all , no need to if u get your strategies right .</p>
              <p>To work around 7-8 hours , could actually match or earn more than be a OMO .</p>
              <p>Now he has got a few reliefs .</p>
              <p>Last heard he has got funny timings to his reliefs , nevermind .</p>
              <p>Key is ..... he is happy to have more time with his kids .</p>
              <p>And that is life .</p>

              <p>If you are in the category like LV82 , ct2220 , striveon ........... u can be an OMO .</p>
              <p>cos i believe , one must or can afford to OMO , as in earn lesser nvrmind , there's a job for me afterall , it's what we need .</p>
              <p>If you're burden by debt , daily or monthly commitments as high as MT Everest , OMO is never a long term solution . It can only kill you .</p>

              <p>I think it's more of the concept by some OMO drivers that need to be corrected.</p>
              <p>In partnership, you got 12 hours to drive, so mathematically speaking, OMO will have 12 x 2 - 24 hours to drive.</p>
              <p>The concept in now that OMO allows the TD to drive as many hours as he want or can, in the process, earning to the max. But how much and how long he can sustain is another question.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, OMO also allow the TD to choose the best time slot to work or rest, example, working on all the peak hours and choose the off-peak to rest. He can also choose daytime to work and rest at night (more normal routine right).</p>
              <p>Whatever is it, the max the TD need to earn for OMO is to recover the other half of the rental or he can choose to earn lesser. As for me, OMO or not, I work max 12 hours.</p>
              <p>But most OMO seems to overdo it, not only earning back the rental but also want more, maybe to maximum the profit and that's where the problem comes in.</p>
              <p>On some of the days, like weekends, doing that might be feasible but on quieter days, better use it to take a break as the saying goes, "a rest to for the longer journey ahead".</p>
              <p>To me, 16 hours a day is fine, as long as you remember to take a break, do some form of exercise, remember to eat your veges and fruits (really a must), and of course, your sleep.</p>

              <p>Average income u also can figure out .</p>
              <p>Taking him as an example , if he collected $160 , that's for say 7 hours job , meaning that's what an OMO needed to cover for rental and fuel , without considering wages .</p>
              <p>7 hours .</p>

              <p>Yesterday, super short. Start at 6, sekali 10 pm, kena CBd on call pax, going just 300 meters from my home. Plus I took 1 5 am advance job.</p>
              <p>Reach destination, my body still fresh, but my mind give in to temptation. Minimum targets would be met with morning job, so ok go back, watch  TV surf the net, sleep at midnight, get up at 4, go for job, come back sleep again.</p>
              <p>Wake up today feeling fresh and happy.</p>
              <p>OMO can do like that? My former neighbour OMO, died aged 42. Definitely cause would be related to hardcore driving in some way or the other.</p>
              <p>For me, I already weak, no need to make it worse, by struggling or being greedy.</p>

              <p>my official working hours are 5am to 3pm (9hrs) Mon to fri</p>
              <p>my relief drives 3pm to next morning 5am</p>
              <p>he pays me $65 &amp; my rental is $35</p>
              <p>once I hit my target ($xyz) I siew chai liao</p>
              <p>normally by 2-3pm I am home already.</p>
              <p>sat &amp; sunday I am off. got another set of reliefs driving</p>
              <p>so total I work only +-45hrs per week</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my income i can say i am very happy,most importantly I have lots of quality time with my family.</p>
