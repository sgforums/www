              <p>Hi all,</p>

              <p>My first time posting here. You all look like a friendly brotherhood:)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just got my LTA approval and medical result. Now registered with SMRT for their online course, because after checking on the phone with SMRT and Comfort it seems that SMRT course is the quickest way to get a licence (of course every durian seller say theirs is the best lah) but not sure whther this is true. Could anyone confirm whether SMRT or comfort better?</p>
              <p>Second question is on the cab hiring, do the other companies (other than comfort and SMRT) take in new driver?</p>
              <p>Third question, if I want to drive auto car, what is the choice we have? (So far I understand Comfort Sonata and Transcab Wish are auto, correct?)   The reason I asked this third question is because I am intending (or rather forced) to drive full time, even as newbie, so auto car would be a top priority. Yes, I lost lot of $$$ in my failed business and have big financial commitment.  I read a lot of advice not to start full time, but as a relief first, however I am afraid I don't have this luxury.</p>

              <p>Ken say hi to Ken,</p>
              <p>1) I'm not sure smrt is the fastest but i do know that smrt has a very high "1st time passing" rate. Pay attention during the excursion as the lta guy will give lots of tips. It doesn't really matters comfort or smrt,unless u wanna sign up as a hirer &amp; get the course fee refund (u must get a manual taxi from comfort to enjoy the refund)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Yes u can be a hirer/relief for any company as long as u have a valid tvl. But some co. prefer exp driver to drive their limo cab</p>
              <p>3) Diesel auto: Sonata &amp; azera (comfort), Magentis &amp; skoda (silvercab)</p>
              <p>Cng auto: Wish(transcab &amp; silvercab) Kia caren(Smart)</p>
              <p>&amp; of course those axio,fielder &amp; wish from prime</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the moment the best deal is still transcab wish (for omo)</p>
              <p>Cheers! hope these info helps</p>

              <p>Pool is right. Relief is really relief man. Taking won't lose to OMO.  Some of them here OMO for various reasons.</p>

              <p>Good morning Chief Pool!</p>
              <p>Great advise from the Chief :)   I read a lot of your postings on the forum and sort of expected you to reply that OMO taking is same as relief.  Yes, I believe all of you here that maybe for seasoned driver relief drive at night makes same money as OMO, to share my thoughts on this:</p>
              <p>1. Maybe OMO can earn a little bit more for newbie? Even $20 more per day is $600/mth right?   </p>
              <p>2. I thought by doing solo I might have some "time" to learn more on the routes/ streets. To share more on this, I was thinking of driving around 6am-11am and 4pm-11pm everyday, (thanks for the great tips from this forum). The "extra" time, for example 11am-12noon, I can have leisure to make my way home driving through places I don't know to learn.</p>
              <p>When I am more confident and have learnt the tricks (for example where to get more passengers at a specific hour, or such), then I would slowly take a relief driver for daytime (5am to 4pm??)</p>
              <p>Actually I'm not sure whether this is good idea myself, but I was planning to do this.  Please let me know if this is not good idea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, is it easy to find people looking for relief to drive night shift? From this forum it seems that all relief drivers here are driving at night (like chief ALN). I stay at AMK 6, near YCK MRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Teo &amp; RotaryEngine,</p>
              <p>Would you share benefits of driving OMO?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Just update on my progress, just got a slot for 19Jan orientation. Actually there is one this Thu (and the precise reason I chose SMRT is because I want to start this week rather than next week - comfort orientation is on 19th). Well, no choice since this Thu need to attend family gathering.  BO Pian loh!</p>

              <p>Hi WizQ,</p>
              <p>benefits of omoing:</p>
              <p>1) no hassle of rushing to handover car OTOT knock off,start work.this is esp true for cabbies with kids &amp; need to use car to send &amp; fetch from school</p>
              <p>2) don't have to wash &amp; refuel end of the shift.just shut engine &amp; go home koon (very good for cng taxi)</p>
              <p>3) if u have something on in the day &amp; can't drive,you still have night time to cover back</p>
              <p>4) if u are really the hardworking type,driving more than 14hrs daily,income not bad.But can you maintain it EVERYDAY? including Sunday &amp; PH? if u chiong for 6days in a row,let me tell u Sunday will be very very sian the moment you start engine,trust me...No cbd surcharge,no 35% sigh....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u really must omo,can consider find a relief to drive</p>
              <p>- Sat/Sun/PH 0600 to 1800</p>
              <p>as a omo,you will not be driving during this hrs.might as well let someone share some of the rental</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>I was a damn motivated driver from Day 1 ..... Now still is !</p>

              <p>This timing fundamentally , works .</p>
