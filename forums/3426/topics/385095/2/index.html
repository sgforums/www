Ok, now I know if I want to join, I should join TransCab for maximum benefit.<br><br>By the way, do TransCab offers "Course fee &amp; application fee refund" like Comfort? I tried looking at <a href="http://www.transcabservices.com.sg/">TransCab's website</a>, but there's only information for passengers. I think it's not been updated for a while now, as it states "All our vehicles are Toyota Crown (LXS 12)". I remember you've mentioned something in the old post about Comfort giving $500 referrer and $300 incentive or something like that. Is Transcab giving something similar? Is there anything else that I should be aware of as a total "geen bird" besides the above? <br><br><br>Tio Call Liao,<br><br>Thanks for the additional information. I've not really decided if I want to be a Hirer or Relief, but thanks for sharing your views about this. I'll keep in mind that for Hirer it's better to go for TransCab and for Relief, Comfort.</p></div>

              <p><br>Most important on the decision , are u going to be a OMO or just another hirer , and plans to have a relief ?</p>
              <p>If u plan to have a relief , go for comfort , cos Loyang can top-up diesel liao .</p>
              <p>Walan , now take course also must sign contract ?</p>
              <p>Then i dun wan join them lo .</p>
              <p>Sign course contract ? Take Sonata contract ? Handphone contract ?</p>
              <p>Up to you .</p>
              <p>For me , many pay course by our own pocket money .</p>
              <p>No contract , no other obligation , just pass and find our taxi companies .</p>
              <p>Pay the course with your own money first , pass liao , then decide which company .</p>
              <p>Then if joining Comfort , since signing up Sonata got 1 year contract , then take the subsidised course fee back .</p>
              <p>Right ???</p>

              <p>I'm thinking of driving day only. So, looking at being a hirer and look for a relief. Unless I can get to be a day Relief which is very unlikely right?</p>
              <p>I've tried calling TransCab for past few days wanting to ask about their Express Course, if there's any. Unfortunately, I always can't get through. It keeps redirecting to a non existent extension then ask me to try again. :(</p>
              <p>Ya, I also thought of taking the course with my own money then later claim from the company I join. But that will be the normal course, not express, will take longer.</p>
              <p>Prime, 5-yr-contract? Thanks, but not for me. Seriously, I dunno if taxi driving is my cup of tea. I "walk-head-no-road", jobless for six months le, partly I think is my age also - almost 40. I'm tired of siting at home and draining my savings, so have to do something to bring in some income. I think you are right, it doesn't make sense for me to sign any contract since I'm not sure. I better take the course with my own money, drive as relief first. If this life suits me, I'll then consider making it my career.</p>
              <p>Poolman, thanks for the valuable advise. Without your advice, I think I'll still be troubled about the many restrictions tied to the various contracts. Hopefully I'll be able to drive day as a relief when I obtain my VL. So now, my next step is to approach the Taxi Academy.</p>

              <p>Pat , take your time to take the course , next fastest way is to go online , quite fast .</p>
              <p>When u passed , then slowly looked for a hirer near your house , drive day .</p>
              <p>With the current taxi population , it's not that difficult to find a day shift .</p>
              <p>Especially next year , many OMOs will need to find a partnership .</p>
              <p>I think with another 1000 TransCab Wish on the road next year ... easier .</p>
              <p>When TransCab has got 100 new drivers , other companies will need to cover the hole .</p>
              <p>That is where u come in .</p>
              <p>Let me tell you this , many cabby , who took taxi as a stepping stone , will leave for Marina Sands Resort to work .</p>
              <p>And Sentosa to work inside the Resort .</p>
              <p>Again , that is when u come into the taxi biz .</p>
              <p>People go , people come ,Economy rolls on !!!</p>

              <p>before i started during year 2000 , i also worry here worry there .</p>
              <p>That time where got Sgforums got kaki advise you ?</p>
              <p>All is about gamble .</p>
              <p>I asked myself : " What is your advantage ? What is your disdvantage ?"</p>
              <p>I got myself a piece of blank paper , draw a vertical between the paper , and start writing downs those good and bad of choosing a new job .</p>
              <p>hey .... more good than bad .</p>
              <p>That was just fundamental , the tough one is when u are on the road .</p>
              <p>Indeed for a start , quite tough .</p>
              <p>Dunno which lobangs ?</p>
              <p>But one thing works for me : Hardworking !!</p>
              <p>Just go Orchard , anywhere in Singapore , if empty , just charge into Orchard !!</p>
              <p>From there , learn the tricks .</p>
              <p>Then apply another day .</p>
              <p>Everyday is learning , nothing but learning .</p>
              <p>And beside learning , is to be more vigilent , observant .... and analyse more .</p>
              <p>Find out where got more tourists , more locals , what's the speed of different taxi stand at different time slot ...... where is midnight best Q ?</p>
              <p>People kept saying airport airport , why airport ?</p>
              <p>Why not Night Safari or ZOO ?</p>
              <p>All need to know why .</p>
              <p>Then ur job will be much easier .</p>

              <p>Why did Merc Cabbies can earn a living ? MAke good living ?</p>

              <p>Discover about the ideas of how to drive a cab and earn a decent living .</p>
              <p>Those who failed as a cabby , it's those people who are isolated , all about themself .</p>
              <p>When u wanna to be like that , u must be ready to fail .</p>
              <p>I seldom see drivers like that succeed .</p>

              Hey guys,
              
              I went down to Comfort Eunos Kioks just now to apply for the TVL. Saw a post dated last year and from the online application form, that a recent passport size photo is required upon registration. Went around this morning to look for a place to get my photo done. Who knows, the lady at the kiosk says no need. If LTA approve then will get during the course. So now, have to wait 1 month or so for the letter of approval to be sent to me.
              
              At the kiosk, about 5 or 6 old cabbies were chatting very loudly. Cursing and swearing about Silver cabs and "Ang Cha". I was wondering if I will be seated at that seat 10-15 years from now, doing what they are doing. It's quite a scary thought frankly.
              
              Hopefully, I'll be able to join you guys for kopi in 3 months time.

              <p>nowadays people really very hardworking &amp; smart. already start to do research even b4 take tvl,u will sure succeed Pat with all these preparation &amp; advise from Pool.</p>
              <p>I felt taxi driving is very much like playing chess.every move counts,1 wrong move will change the entire game.there must be a stategy &amp; reason for every move u make.</p>
              <p>some cabby treat it like a game of chess</p>
