              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>Sorry for not checking back earlier. Don't know why I stopped receiving emails notifying me of updates for the thread. So I thought no one added anything and stopped checking, since I don't have ready internet access.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I just received the letter from LTA this evening. I'll go SATA tomorrow morning for the medical checkup, and intend to go straight down to Singapore TAXI Academy to register for the Express Class after that. If everything goes well, I hope to be on the road some time in March or April.</p>
              <p>By the way, I received 2 flyers with the letter. One from Singapore TAXI Academy and the other from Comfort. It seems STA course fee is cheaper than Comfort, don't know why.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>STA Express (3-4 weeks) $250 + $8 (textbook) = $258</li>
              <li>STA Normal (5-6 weeks) $250 + $8 (textbook) = $258</li>
              <li>Comfort Express (15 sessions) $260 (incl. textbook)</li>
              <li>Comfort Part-time (30 sessions) $275.50 (incl. textbook)</li>
              <li>Comfort On-line $267.50 (No textbook)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I'm not sure if STA Express is the same as Comfort Express. If so, 15 sessions will only be 2.5 weeks. Well, I guess have to call up tomorrow and ask before deciding which one to go for. I initially thought of going for Comfort on-line, but no textbook means if i sway sway fail, got nothing to refer to. Any advices?</p>

              <p>Agree with mxing with the right kakis.</p>
              <p>By seeing all the postings here, it's already motivate me to sign up as taxi driver. I am very confident I can drive up to 12 hours daily. This one I'm very sure.</p>
              <p>My only concern is that I dont have pax for me. For a night shift, I can cheong and cheong before midnight. Is it fairly easy to have good connections from 4pm to midnight everywhere ?</p>
              <p>But after midnight, even I guai guai Q up at some of the hotspot, I guess with the waiting time, I can only make a few trips before I return the car to the hirer. Dont think can make alot from the few trips.</p>
              <p>Basically, the only worries are getting pax fast enough to earn my daily target with the 11-12 hour shift.</p>

              <p>I went SATA for the medical check up yesterday, but the report can only be collected after 2 working days. So, I'll have to go back on Monday to collect the report before I can go register for the course.</p>
              <p>Called STA this afternoon to enquire about the Express course. I was told that the next available date starts on 22nd February. Wow, that will be more than 1 month from now. I also asked them about the difference between their course and the one offered by Comfort. The guy on the other end says he doesn't know anything about the course offered by Comfort. So, I called Comfort and ask them. It turns out the course "offered" by Comfort, is exactly the same one conducted by STA. In short, Comfort does not conduct any Express course at all. I guess the $2 difference is the "handling" fee then.</p>

              <p>Hmm, say wait 2 weeks for orientation, then still have around 3 weeks left to study if aiming for the 28 Feb excursion.</p>
              <p>Ok, will check on Monday after collecting my medical report, to see if orientation date is around 2 weeks from now, and if 28 Feb excursion is still available. If have, I'll go for online. If not, then I'll go for STA express course.</p>
