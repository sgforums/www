              <p>Yesterday, I going to the coffee shop to have some drinks with friend and chit chat. On the way, while I was reaching the coffee shop, I had passed a loading bay and there I saw a 40+ cabby coming out and locking his cab. The thing is that the engine and the head lights was still running. I was curious and since I am going to be a cab driver I cannot help but continue to observe his actions.<br><br>He went on to order his food at a zhe char store, sat down and started to read the news paper. The taxi was running the whole time while he ate and rested at least for 1 hour.</p>
              <p>The loading bay and the coffee shop was not very far away, his taxi was well within his view but he wasn't looking at it the whole time he was resting. From the distance, we could smell the diesel burning.</p>
              <p>Why did he need to keep the engine and the air-conditioning running? It was a cool night yesterday night. It was a blue comfort sonata and the sign was busy.</p>
              <p>It keep me up the whole night thinking about it. It is actually very distrubing and so I decide to bring it up on the forum. So many questions: Would the engine not be able to start if he had turned it off? Would the taxi company know if he had switched off the engine like "Ohh... this guy is supposed to be working but he stop the engine..."</p>
              <p>???</p>
