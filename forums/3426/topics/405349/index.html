              <p>Saw from Yahoo news 2day, PM Lee personally said tat. I tin gd news for taxi drivers but bad news for many S'poreans who stil cannot find jobs. Those <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">new foreigners sure nids 2 tk cabs cos they r new 2 S'pore.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Out of the 100K, I tin sure many r professionals n mayb some allocated 4 construction workers etc etc. I like 2 tk those Filipino pax cos they r usually polite n respectful 2 taxi drivers. Some maids also quite pretty n friendly......as I'm single, I got extra fun on some Sundays......hahaha......</p>
              <p>But I do not welcome those like tat Swiss who broke S'pore law......even though his art works on tat MRT train is quite nice.......(4 me personally)....... So sure got good n bad........wat's yr views?</p>

              <p>My feel is more bad than good. For those professionals, they would need middle class housing including HDB flats for rental. This would jack up housing costs. For the construction workers, more domitories needed. Who knows where these would be sited. Next to your block? It's a wake up call to local workers as bosses need to pay CPF for you whereas FW no need CPF.</p>
              <p>As for TDs, maybe more fares only for professional FTs as they can afford. But knowing them, usually they would stay very near their work place. So TDs would expect more shuttle service.</p>

              <p>Manufacturing and services is the industries that is booming, and services include transport services, the govt readjusted its GDP to 13% by end of the year, that is a near 10% increase from year to year, and it is consider as over heating. Bearing that Singaporeans are getting older and older, we are also not service orientated people, meaning we like to be serve and not to serve other. This influx of foreigner will be base in electronic firms, hotels, restaurants, tourism, places of interests, shops, pubs, banks, financial insitute, hospitals etc etc. It will not be in construction or marine or oil rigs.</p>
              <p>The strategy is to get in qualified people rather than workers, peoples who can serve, speak english (buses and waiter) and at least certain degree of education. Most likely, the people coming in will be Philipinos. And electronics will be Malaysians. Singapore govt is not going to encourage companies to bring in foreign workers, that is why govt had begin increasing low skill workers levies by a few hundreds more.</p>
              <p>The main reason is to cool down the economy, especially the wages, which is climbing out of proportion due to head hunting. One of the top job now are in hotel management and financial management. Got a relative who works at Raffles hotel as a manager with 6k was head hunted by RWS for $12,000/mth and later head hunter again by MBS for $17,000 per mth with perks add up to $20,000 per mth. That is an worrying part for govt, with such increases, all wages will increase due to shortage, and when economy falls, which will fall, the reverse and impact of such high wages is going to hurt singapore and its people, that is retrenchment or for senior management, out of job. And when you are paid $20k per mth, you loan and buy condo, cars and enjoy life, but when you are out of job??? Thus, the influx of foreign staff coming here is to cool down the wages and also help companies able to get staffs at a reasonable cost. The key word is substainability.</p>
              <p>Having said all, knn, that relative now talk with air and very proud, what to do, me taxi driver. But who give a damn</p>

              <p>U r right. But dun worry, juz my wild thots!</p>
              <p>CDG may not keen but someone may. Its just a matter how this 'code-sharing scheme' can benefit them... 30% share?</p>
              <p>H81 is juz a 'kai-fang' hotel or a place for a quickie for many singaporeans. But its name is famous all over the world as one of the best budget hotel in SG...likewise to Fragrance now. I was surprised to know that the ave occupation rates for foreigners/tourist is almost abt 50%.</p>
              <p>Many taxi drivers in other countries are made of immigrants due to long hour of driving.  I believed its feasible to. Since some singaporeans dun like to serve people. Let these FTs serve us lor..(forgot to add: All FTs drivers must be graduate)</p>
              <p>Aiya... just some crazy thots only. Any business proven successful by others, surely it can be done. As long we dun start something that others dun. Can make $$$ sure can do! Got Ah Kun kaya sure come coffee &amp; toast. Got Bread talk... here come bread pit. Got Sweet talk, now we see Koi &amp; each-a-cup!</p>
              <p>Got budget hotel, budget airline... here come low cost budget taxi la!</p>
