              <p>Ok im sorry for delay but sincere thanks to this forum and seniors like poolman experience that i was able to put things into practise and react in the best way possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was night at new bridge road taxi. Couple get in and wife say tampiness. Then i ask which is your prefered road or which way you wish to go. Husband reply " CTE TPE Tampiness" . I again repeatdly reconfirmed so i go by CTE TPE Tampiness ok? Husband reply " AH" as in "yes".</p>
              <p>I was thinking why couple wanna go the long way (maybe somewhere wanna pickup things at punggol??) but heck lor cause previous pax just scold me for not listening to pax way and follow my gps. </p>
              <p>When TPE turn to Tampiness ave 7, Husband suddenly kesiao and start hurling abusive word...ccb ..knn ..boh lampa...taxi cheater..( i was shell shock for a minute with sudden fark words come up..my temp boils up in an instant) </p>
              <p>I told the cb pax "Sir i follow your way mah...yu say tpe i go tpe...u did not say PIE" Then wife say "Are you sure arnot husband say TPE?" i say yes else why i ask him again twice. They were even saying in chinese" ceh ke taxi drive sing de ren" meaning im new when they just boarded after seeing me looking at gps)</p>
              <p>Anyway back to story..cb guy keep farking non stop like chicken backside mouth. I let him talk untill he stop then i ask him "so how now? " Then cb pax i dont care " i dont want to pay knn ccb ..boh lampa" (his choise of words seem to be the same pattern each time he open his mouth)  Then he say the golden words im hoping for" i want to bring you to police and let they catch you...yu cb act blur cheater" </p>
              <p> ok so i ask him sorry im new but where is the nearest police stn. Pax shouted ccb knn boh lampa go straight turn left street 11 or something..Wife then keep saying something like dont create a big fuss and she will settle teh fare. Husband disagree and say if yu pay i hit him in front of yu. Hearing those words...i immediately start taking out my bangles and watch and stretch myself to be in ready position for sudden hti from the back. Wife then say husband was wrong and not the taxi driver cause he follow what husband was saying...but halfway along tampiness ave 2 ...husband suddenly say stop. It was at the tampiness ave 2 coffeshop. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wife then say something like dont call his frens. My chinese not so good but the word "gina" does strike soemthing in my head from my teenage day. I beleive he intend to call his gina but wife shouted at him crying ...stop it stop it...husband did not get off and say "ccb ..knn boh lampa ..faster go police stn" . </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reach police stn "i ask him get out first as i want to park my car but he say again ..ccb ..knn boh lampa( dont noe why but i got a feeling seems like he is retard for saying abusive words in same pattern) . i get out and walk straight to his face come lets go. I think he could be shock cause i was not swayed nor show signs of being scared. i went in and i raise my voice " this pax dont want to pay and fark me all the way with intends to beat me" Pax straight away come to my face ...Hoii dont lie ..i no say i dont want to pay arr.. but the farking words no longer presence..the big sized man with big build voice also tone down and talking like normal ppl do. Police immediately ask him...Sir you smell of strong liquoir ...did yu went for drink session.." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then it all connects..."Fark i so sueh thsi guy could be drunk hence the fierce attitude but at police stn become timid like mouse"  he keep talking and i go outside cause feeling so sueh wasted trip without money. Suddenly the police guy ask me for receipt and i feel better as i noe they had talk him down and ask him to complain against my company transcab. i gave him receipt of 30 bucks and cb pax ask why so expensive...i say i dont stop meter one cause yu want to go police stn. Got my money and fark off...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after 2 more passengers hit above average target ...drving along Yio chu kang to CTE...feel something presence ..turn behind dont have..then further down the road some funny sound come out..tekan pedal in panick state without looking back and staright away to coffeshop and home..i think something is wrong today...haiz when no luck all sueh sure happen.</p>

              <p>Feel that Tzarh is plain unlucky to meet such pax</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just sharing something ...</p>
              <p>1. Yesterday pax wanna go siglap but along PIE before sims immediately change to Tampines St 84, when i started to keep left wanted to take KPE, then Pax say use bedok reservoir, did i filter out ? of course not ! but tell them that KPE also can reach, then pax say up to you ... sometimes open mouth and communicate can resolve things</p>
              <p>2. Pax wanna go china square, mumble something like clemenceau, upper circular, south bridge road then say south bridge road upper circular ...... when reach then i think should be she  wanted to said clemenceau, merchant, south bridge road, upper pickering, but i  went by clemenceau, havelock, upper pickering, nothing happen when reach destination ... maybe i'm just plain lucky ?</p>
              <p>Felt that when reach destination, if your way is shorter or faster, even if you did not follow pax preferred route, they will not make a fuss ...</p>

              <p><br> I think you are the kid in this forum. If you were in the same situation think you wood just keep quite give the pax a free ride then cry like a pussy..</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with sending pax to police to settle dispute, especially is pax threaten not to pay or physical harm.
                                  
                                  I'm guessing you dont have TDVL, since you said y take a drunkard when u know it's a risk. During course we are taught never to reject a pax once they boarded, unless they say they don't have money or due to religious beliefs (ie, dogs). Pax can complain to LTA if we  do that.

              <p>Bro, Tzarh already said since the pax insisted on going police station so he did not stop meter till police settle so maybe thats why $30. Since time also wasted going to police station, depending on situtation i might also keep meter running.</p>
              <p>But i think best is next time reconfirm. Even though pax say go CTE TPE, some just don't have sense of direction. For me once near PIE exit on CTE i would ask pax again, "you want me go TPE or exit to PIE?" i always reconfirm every turn that i know can turn to get to a destination, just in case cos sometimes they don't have sense of direction or maybe just forget or maybe have prefered way</p>

                          We have to take chances and pray that the journey turns out fine. The hardest is not stopping the vehicle during the journey.. It is how to get the drunk off the vehicle...... 
                          
                          When it is our words against the pax words, best to have a third party as witness. At least it will be fair for both sides...

              <p>Thats the problem your not a TD, last time i not TD i also think how hard can it be. saying is easy, but when you are a TD it's totally different. Reject pax get complains, reject too many pax no income. Most drive taxi cos they don't want the stress of other jobs, so when we get such pax, why stress ourself out. Just bring to police.</p>
              <p>Yes time is money, policeman time is also money, but like u said only so little of such case refered to police if you compare the number of taxi on the roads.</p>

              <p>say 20 of such case per/day = 0.005% . professional hazard?  </p>
              <p>dun drive a taxi if u think this is too much for u <img title="Laughing" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p>It's only on weekends at night u get such cases, i don't think reach 20 of such case per weekend. Most of the time the police also idle, you should see how happy when i called my NPC because of a cat stuck in a car.</p>
              <p>3 police car came down, one car 2 policeman so total 6 guys. My neighbours all thought i did something really bad until 3 cars come down, but actually me and the cops rescuing a cat.</p>
              <p>I took my TDVL not cause i wanted to drive taxi full time at first. But then halfway thru the course i got my retrenchment letter.</p>
              <p>Eventhough driving taxi is not for everyone, those who want to understand more should just take TVDL, it's a good backup also.</p>
              <p>Normally if u ask other cab drivers u will only hear the good stories, you'll be amaze no matter how high u study, how good your general knowledge, sometimes when u have passenger u have to be humble.</p>
              <p>U put "On Call" sign cos u got a call booking, pax still flag you never stop they give middle finger. Don't know how many middle finger i get since i start driving these 3 months. Most of the pax we get speak to us with a tone of voice like we are some type of scum. Especially FTs, pinoy, india and some ang mohs. But mostly ang mohs ok lah. Pinoy and Indian think we taxi driver like cab drivers in their country so they show no respect. Younger generation Singaporean also show no respect.</p>
              <p>Only one lady surgeon, a guy at Fuji Xerox that happen to handle same government project as me previously and a banker talk to me in a normal tone so far. Rest all talk to us as if we are their slaves. Oh yah got one guy call me uncle then the GF scold him say, " eh he not that old!" then the guy, "eh sorry bro!" LoL</p>

              I do not send any drunk pax to police station yet.. Count myself lucky as i managed to handle several encounters before things turned beyond contorl... I will think calling for police should be the last resort. But when one TD feels that his life is being threaten, play safe, ask for help from police. Let police to handle. They are trained to do so.....

              <p>Thats the problem your not a TD, last time i not TD i also think how hard can it be. saying is easy, but when you are a TD it's totally different. Reject pax get complains, reject too many pax no income. Most drive taxi cos they don't want the stress of other jobs, so when we get such pax, why stress ourself out. Just bring to police.</p>
              <p>Yes time is money, policeman time is also money, but like u said only so little of such case refered to police if you compare the number of taxi on the roads. It's only on weekends at night u get such cases. Most of the time the police also idle, you should see how happy when i called my NPC because of a cat stuck in a car.</p>

              <p>Even when pax say "Go any way or fastest way or shortest way" i will still ask if they want me turn here or there. Even those PRC or Jap don't understand english i still show hand sign to confirm turn correct way or not, only one pax i never ask anything cos he mute and deaf, he use handphone type the name of the place show me.</p>
              <p>Go any way - usually don't know the way from where they board. But once they see familiar road then they will say go by where.</p>
              <p>Fastest way - Usually tired or hungry or stressed want to get there as fast as possible.</p>
              <p>Shortest Way - Budget, cheapest meter fare possible.</p>

              <p>Its not can't handle. it's we not suppose to handle it. In the course, which is usually conducted by officers in LTA that handle complain against TD, we are advise such situation refer police, if call company "helpline" they will also advise refer police Pax don't want pay what else can u say. Especially when pax is drunk, they will get more violent if u try reason. Not all drunk pax are like that lah. In my case most fall asleep. Hehe.. no cab is a boring cab, no "stickers" to read, no music, depending on my mood that day sometimes i don't talk much also. So my cab peaceful place to sleep.</p>
              <p>I carry a few drunkard before, got one curse and swear but not at me so ok lah. If just curse and swear at me also ok, but if threaten not to pay. Thats a different thing </p>
