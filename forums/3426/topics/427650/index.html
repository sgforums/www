              then that guy turn towards me, face like not very happy and then board like purposely slowly, not the usual passenger board. i thought he look like Chinese so i ask him in Chinese. from the start he sound like he wanted to pick fight when ask him which way to go. i told him i am new then he say every td also tell him the same story they are new! he try to insult me ask me how and where i graduate, he until now no license also better than me, go which road better still need to ask meh? then when i ask him again politely which way he prefer, he turn and ask me why dont you suggest la i want to hear you say out. so i suggested, but then he still not happy like as if i cannot think only want to cheat him. then i told him politely usually the way i suggested to him is most customer will themselves suggest or accept my suggestion.  then he say loud ok lah go your way, i want to see you go your way! but when we come near to route i suggest to take, he change again say follow his way, dont go my way! then all the way he sit behind make all sorts of noises and insults. i keep quiet and drive carefully, but he say wah sit my car drive need to buy insurance.
              
              when we finally near his place, i ask him again politely which way, left or right side, becos left side is private condo, right side is carpark to older hdb. he then mumble not clear so i check with him again, but he even more unhappy thinking i am trying to be funny, then he ask very aggresive i am PRC or Malaysia?? at that time i really worry he sound like he going to hit or kick me from behind. when i say i not sure what he asking, he get even more irritated and insist i must reply him before he pay. then i smile say i am really new, he challenge say then he can just jump out and go away without paying, what can i do
              
              i just keep smile becos i really dont know what to do, then he slowly take wallet and count, but again count longer than other usual passenger, then pay me and then i return him change. then he still dont want to get out he dont even  reach for door handle, he sit back ask again why i dont dare tell him i PRC or Malaysia, and then add some more insult ( i cannot remember but i know words not nice). and finally just before he alighted, he suddenly turn his body again ask angrily did i give him back his 50cents change!?! i say yes yes i put it in your hand just, he say you sure!? you sure!? then he laughed loudly and say something like you ah! you ah!! i cannot tahan you ah! then he got off..i quickly make uturn in carpark and drive away, but thats my last passnger i take

              <p><br>Bros, some caucasian also dun like PRC, so they just want to check on it. And frankly, some of our locals also dun like PRC, the younger with fairer skin drivers are alway taken as PRC, so it could be a compliment to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i turn a corner and theres a Chinese looking (not China looking)
              man walking up to the front, long sleeve but dont know why shirt
              tuck out, at his side those poly nylon type bag slingbag. looks
              like 30somethings-early40s executive who had a drink after work but
              not very rich, hair not comb well. he flag at one cab already
              stopped in front of me but that cab start drive away, i think
              strange becos i thought i see that cab is empty</p>
              <p>then that guy turn towards me, face like not very happy and then
              board like purposely slowly, not the usual passenger board. i
              thought he look like Chinese so i ask him in Chinese. from the
              start he sound like he wanted to pick fight when ask him which way
              to go. i told him i am new then he say every td also tell him the
              same story they are new! he try to insult me ask me how and where i
              graduate, he until now no license also better than me, go which
              road better still need to ask meh? then when i ask him again
              politely which way he prefer, he turn and ask me why dont you
              suggest la i want to hear you say out. so i suggested, but then he
              still not happy like as if i cannot think only want to cheat him.
              then i told him politely usually the way i suggested to him is most
              customer will themselves suggest or accept my suggestion. then he
              say loud ok lah go your way, i want to see you go your way! but
              when we come near to route i suggest to take, he change again say
              follow his way, dont go my way! then all the way he sit behind make
              all sorts of noises and insults. i keep quiet and drive carefully,
              but he say wah sit my car drive need to buy insurance.</p>
              <p>when we finally near his place, i ask him again politely which
              way, left or right side, becos left side is private condo, right
              side is carpark to older hdb. he then mumble not clear so i check
              with him again, but he even more unhappy thinking i am trying to be
              funny, then he ask very aggresive i am <span>PRC</span> or
              Malaysia?? at that time i really worry he sound like he going to
              hit or kick me from behind. when i say i not sure what he asking,
              he get even more irritated and insist i must reply him before he
              pay. then i smile say i am really new, he challenge say then he can
              just jump out and go away without paying, what can i do</p>
              <p>i just keep smile becos i really dont know what to do, then he
              slowly take wallet and count, but again count longer than other
              usual passenger, then pay me and then i return him change. then he
              still dont want to get out he dont even reach for door handle, he
              sit back ask again why i dont dare tell him i <span>PRC</span> or Malaysia, and then add some more insult ( i cannot
              remember but i know words not nice). and finally just before he
              alighted, he suddenly turn his body again ask angrily did i give
              him back his 50cents change<img src="/forums/3426/topics/" alt=""> i say yes yes i
              put it in your hand just, he say you sure!? you sure!? then he
              laughed loudly and say something like you ah! you ah!! i cannot
              tahan you ah! then he got off..i quickly make uturn in carpark and
              drive away, but thats my last passnger i take</p>

              <p>Sometimes towards drunks , u need to be a bit fierce then they will keep quiet.</p>
              <p>Lastly , its good that u encounter all these in a short span of time then u know what kinda pax to avoid picking next time when you are more experienced.</p>
