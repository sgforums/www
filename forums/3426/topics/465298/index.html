              <p>buslane.</p>
              <p>50% of the passengers flag our taxis from the buslane, many of them do it in the busstop.</p>
              <p>And I feel so sad for those tourists, flagging frantically when an empty cab pass by, but non refuse to stop for them in the buslane. These tourists had no idea what is going on, i pity them and understand their fustration against taxi drivers.</p>
              <p>Our govt didn't educate these tourists. But I hate locals too, knowing that we cannot stop at buslane, they are always there flagging for taxis, some at yellowbox, some at the broken white line near the end of the zebra crossing. Getting us taxi into dilemma.</p>

              <p>For Taxi to use BUS lane ?........ Bus lane are there to protect "their" investment, they cannot afford bus wasted too much time on traffic jam, it will affect their daily collection.</p>

              <p>I disagree. Just look at how some Tds behave. Like to hog the the roads, suka suka stop, cut here and there.</p>
              <p>Bus lane only for certain hours, besides if before 8pm would go in CBD empty?</p>
              <p>If we allow taxis to do, it will just a few idiots to ruin the whole thing and make us in a worse light than already with other road users, unless some like being stomped.</p>
              <p>So let things be, you wanna pick, you take the risk, get caught, blame yourself.</p>
              <p>We can't solve the taxi problems for all pax, foreign tourists or locals who can't get a cab when they want it. Besides who helps us when we got no pax and drive up and down empty?</p>
              <p>It works both ways.</p>
              <p>Paxs are not all dumb, they know what to do but act blur or try to get out of things cheaply.</p>

              <p>Ya lah I am the one lah....but the stupid bus driver trigger the event first. As usual I turn out to the main road of course must stop a while then can proceed right? And I am there for a full 1-2 mins before the bus approach me because traffic is heavy so I cannot proceed. Not as though I purposely turn out to block him when I see him coming. When I doing the turn the bus is no where to be seen. Then when the bus came the driver started flashing anf honking at me to get out of the way. Like that correct meh? He dun even give me chance to filter out.</p>

              <p>CBD why must go taxi stand, go to those office lobby also can liao, raining can interview some more...outside, if close one eyes, raining day, actually anywhere also can lah, bus driver also understand pax got no where to go, raining day, LTA motorbikers all go smoking and drink teh terik liao.</p>
              <p>Just think for a while, if bus lanes allow taxis to go in, all those action walk fast but board taxi slow office peoples will halt all taxis, and along the lanes, the bus would have to stop here and there, but carry 33 pax, taxi just one pax, and incrementally, 4 taxis and 4 buses on the lane will mean 4 to 8 paxs on taxis, by abt 120++ paxs on bus waiting for one ah niang low cut lau chio bu to slowly board a cab.</p>
              <p>Bus lanes is nothing new, it had been around for years, more important is our rental fares and the 6.9million peoples coming, if taking from a taxi perspectives, what is your view? for me, can huat big time</p>

              <p>fm a taxi perspectives during morning peak hr.. take current booking only mean obk big time.. i take 1 call at yishun ar abt 7 30 am, 8 min later still cannot reach.. pax cancell.. 2 min later, same pax current booking again.. 3 min cancell again..like this, i wasted 20 min.. all thank to bus lane n useless policy..</p>
              <p>those who benefit fm bus lane will say bus lane good.. that y many support pap..</p>
              <p>when the same ppl take taxi n goes the same route, they will start to curse n swear at the empty bus lane.. they pay taxi fare, to save time or for comfort travelling.. yet the time difference may be as short as 5 min nia..</p>
              <p>bus lane is a good idea, but not implemented for the right reason.. motorbike also cannot use bus lane, do they block buses? how i wish those who ride biciyle slowly ride in front of every bus during morning peak hr.. then we can c that law can suddenly be adjusted or created in a short time, when needed.. </p>
              <p>those who can siam, will siam.. those who got to endure the jam, conjestion will just need to rem 1 thing only.. all thank to pap..</p>
