              <p><br>Yes, eating is important, if you take in rubbish, obviously, what churn out will be rubbish that is harmful to your body, that is very clear.</p>
              <p>But I would like to touch on one mental issue, your brain, even if you eat the right foods, do the right exercise, but if your mental is depressive, alway get angry, or alway unhappy, emotionally alway like to take on others with jealousy and envying, you can also be leading a unhealthy lifestyle even if you jog and eat the right food everyday.</p>
              <p>That is why both physical, oral and mental health is crucial for one to stay healthy, calm and happy</p>

              <p>The danger is actually when there is no problem, those who had some sign of problem will usually seek medical help and try to stay ok, those who with no problem one, are usually like what you wrote, but end up lying in my van without a single warning.</p>
              <p>Therefore, healthy or not, you once a while have to do a check up, and one of the most important check up is not about seeing doctor and do examine here and there, it is you, you, yourself knows your body well, but many choose to deny it, just like Ah Nan, choose to ignore it, no problem lah, I am ok..then booomm!

              tumour in my stomach during a emergency scope when I threw up blood
              in June 2012 .....</p>
              <p>I was leading a very very unhealthy lifestyle, everyday deep
              fried food, kambing soup, fast food, soft drinks ... not even a bit
              of vegetables n fruits in my diet at all ..... My weight was
              128kg... BMI was 42.52...., everyday drink hard liqour and smoke 10
              sticks a day and i was only 29 years old....</p>
              <p>Was already suffering high blood pressure, diabetes, lipids
              problems, gout n fatty liver and poor semen count. Was already on
              12 tablets everyday</p>
              <p>So the professor told me ....1. its either I die immed 2. kena
              stroke and let my family suffer or 3. go for surgery to remove the
              tumour in my stomach and start to lead a healthy lifestyle after
              the surgery....</p>
              <p>So I LL and choose the 3rd choice which is to surgically remove
              half of my stomach and let the professor treat all the
              abovementioned chronic illness via surgery...</p>
              <p>So currently, is 7 months post op..... I weigh about 68kg
              now.... all the blood pressure, diabetes, lipids problem, gout n
              fatty liver are gone .....my semen analysis is good.... I make sure
              I jog 3km everyday without fail, 1-2 hours squash on tuesday (which
              is my off day) and 10km cycling on a weekend..... i no need to be
              on any medications anymore now.....</p>
              <p>I learnt the HARD Way..... I make a U -turn from the HADES.....
              imagine during the 9 hours surgery.... my heart stopped beating for
              3 times .... every time the professor gotta use the "Iron" to
              resuse me back.... Lucky my willpower to continue living is super
              super strong because I need to support my aged parents.</p>
              <p>I TREASURE my new life now..... if I dare to say I totally
              stopped the junk food and smoking ...I am lying to you.... once in
              a blue moon, I still go n binge a bit of it.... So when you start
              to know that your health is giving you the red light or even amber
              light, you should wake up your idea n start leading a healthier
              lifestyle before you end up like AH GUAN.</p>
              <p>Best wishes to you on ur "new" lifestyle.... Cheers!</p>

              Joining TD will probably reduce some yrs of our lives...how to add back? Found some ways on internet ...cut n paste for info..:
              
              Eat power foods
              Adds 4 years or more
              
              A daily handful of dark chocolate and almonds, plus fruits, vegetables, garlic, fish, and even a glass of wine can increase a womanâ€™s life by 4.8 yrs, 6.6 for men, according to research in the British Medical Journal. The foods are rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and other nutrients that can lower your heart disease risk by 76 percent. The age gains also come from consuming less fat and fewer calories as you eat more fruit, veggies, and whole grains, the WHI found.
              
              Quit smoking
              Adds 2 to 8 years
              
              The younger you are when you quit, the better. Period.
              
              Lose the flab
              Adds 3 to 4 years
              
              Shed those extra pounds. Recent National Cancer Institute research shows that being overweight can increase the risk of death by 20 to 40 percent. Other research links being obese to high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. The reasons are unclear, but obesity can shave 3 to 4 years off your life
              
              Get frisky
              Adds 3 to 8 years (seriously!)
              
              Having sex two to three times a week can boost your longevity by halving your risk for heart disease and stroke. The trick: Intercourse burns about 200 caloriesâ€”the same as running for 30 minutes. And it may lower your blood pressure (which offers a 2- to 3-year gain), help you sleep better, boost your immunity, and release heart-protective hormones.

              Get moving
              Adds 2 to 4 years
              
              Dutch and Australian researchers found that people who do moderate- to high-intensity cardiovascular exerciseâ€”like running for 30 minutes, 5 days a weekâ€”can live 2 to 4 years longer and live 1 to 3 more years free of heart disease. Running seems to strengthen your heart, as well as other muscles, and lower cholesterol.

              fried food, kambing soup, fast food, soft drinks ... not even a bit
              of vegetables n fruits in my diet at all ..... My weight was
              128kg... BMI was 42.52...., everyday drink hard liqour and smoke 10
              sticks a day and i was only 29 years old....</p>
              <p>Was already suffering high blood pressure, diabetes, lipids
              problems, gout n fatty liver and poor semen count. Was already on
              12 tablets everyday</p>
              <p>So the professor told me ....1. its either I die immed 2. kena
              stroke and let my family suffer or 3. go for surgery to remove the
              tumour in my stomach and start to lead a healthy lifestyle after
              the surgery....</p>
              <p>So I LL and choose the 3rd choice which is to surgically remove
              half of my stomach and let the professor treat all the
              abovementioned chronic illness via surgery...</p>
              <p>So currently, is 7 months post op..... I weigh about 68kg
              now.... all the blood pressure, diabetes, lipids problem, gout n
              fatty liver are gone .....my semen analysis is good.... I make sure
              I jog 3km everyday without fail, 1-2 hours squash on tuesday (which
              is my off day) and 10km cycling on a weekend..... i no need to be
              on any medications anymore now.....</p>
              <p>I learnt the HARD Way..... I make a U -turn from the HADES.....
              imagine during the 9 hours surgery.... my heart stopped beating for
              3 times .... every time the professor gotta use the "Iron" to
              resuse me back.... Lucky my willpower to continue living is super
              super strong because I need to support my aged parents.</p>
              <p>I TREASURE my new life now..... if I dare to say I totally
              stopped the junk food and smoking ...I am lying to you.... once in
              a blue moon, I still go n binge a bit of it.... So when you start
              to know that your health is giving you the red light or even amber
              light, you should wake up your idea n start leading a healthier
              lifestyle before you end up like AH GUAN.</p>
              <p>Best wishes to you on ur "new" lifestyle.... Cheers!</p>
