              <p><br>Hi, you will be having a hard time driving OMO base on your above mentioned arrangement. I mean the need to send / fetch baby, wife during morning or evening.</p>
              <p>You should know driving OMO, the most profitable time are the two peak-hour periods. Yet u need to use the taxi for personal usage during that period. Imagine the down-time incurred. Imagine the need to drive empty to the pick up location?? Not easy to find Pax connection that suits your destination.</p>
              <p>How many hours you intend to drive per day? How much earning you desire per day? You must also include the hours that you use for the ferrying. Not easy i guess.</p>
              <p>I am driving OMO too. For me peak hours is WAR time for me. Die Die meter must be ON. dun care go where (of course less places like LCK, Gedong, Tuas south (in the morning)).</p>

              depend on our saving and also if lucky, can touch toto or big 4D,
              alot of our TDs do not know how to manage money, I am not saying
              they do not know how to save, but just not financially sound, so
              end up most either get cheat by shares, which is a rich markets, or
              by women and other con men on the street selling pyramid stuff.</p>

              <p>Toh Tuck pump ok mah. Empty tank can fill at least 18-19KG. Got once I kanna 22KG. Pump pressure also depends on the number of vehicle pumping. Usually when there is less vehicle pumping can pump more. Also cool weather can pump more because the gas is condense and you get a higher density for the same amount of CNG pumped inside your tank. That's what I notice.</p>
