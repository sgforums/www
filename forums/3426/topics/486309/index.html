              <p>TAXIS are doing their disappearing act again and, this time, it is just before peak hour charges kick in at Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>A Straits Times check at about 4.45pm on a recent Sunday found more 
              than 80 people in the Terminal 1 queue, and hardly a cab in sight. But 
              at 5pm, when the airport surcharge increases from $3 to $5 - as is the 
              case from Friday to Sunday, taxis appeared, and the queue cleared in 
              under half an hour.</p>
              <p>On other days, cabbies collect an extra 25 per cent of the metered fare during peak hours from 6am to 9.30am, and after 6pm.</p>
              <p>Travellers said they have noticed that queues can start growing 15 to
               20 minutes before the extra charges kick in and, in some cases, the 
              wait for a cab can exceed 30 minutes.</p>
              <p>The problem has become worse with growing passenger and visitor numbers, observers said.</p>
              <p>Changi Airport Group spokesman Robin Goh explained: "The long queue 
              for taxis observed on Sunday (when The Straits Times was there) was due 
              to the combined effects of a peak in weekend flight arrivals at T1, as 
              well as the crunch in taxi supply generally observed islandwide between 
              3pm and 5pm, when taxi drivers change shift."</p>
              <p>Airport ground staff have also noticed that some taxis intending to 
              pick up passengers just before the start of the surcharge period may 
              slow down.</p>
              <p>Customers have long complained that taxis vanish just before peak 
              hour, but this is believed to be the first time the problem has surfaced
               at the airport.</p>
              <p>In 2012, the Land Transport Authority announced a slew of initiatives
               to be introduced gradually, including setting standards for taxi 
              companies for the number of cabs that must ply the roads during peak 
              hours, and the minimum mileage that drivers should clock up every day. 
              Standards were also set for the run-up to peak hours.</p>
              <p>But the cab shortage just before surcharges kick in has persisted islandwide.</p>
              <p>For its part, the airport is taking extra measures.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Goh: "We have deployed auxiliary police officers to patrol 
              the roadways along Airport Boulevard, as well the taxi holding areas 
              across all three terminals, to ensure that taxi drivers do not wait out 
              in the taxi holding area."</p>
              <p>Not all taxi drivers feel the need to comply.</p>
              <p>Said cabby T.L. Wong, 53: "I don't see why it is so wrong for taxi 
              drivers to wait for the surcharge so we can earn more. It is just a few 
              dollars extra for the passengers anyway."</p>
              <p>Despite the crunch, Indonesian housewife Nadia Wijaya, 62, who visits
               Singapore a few times a year, felt that Changi was still an efficient 
              airport. "If you think this is crowded, you should come visit Jakarta," 
              she said.</p>
