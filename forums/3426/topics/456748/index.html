              <p>Your friend already sent back the vehicle a number of times for repair. It even broke down so bad that it had to be towed. What did the main technician say on the first tow?</p>
              <p>Now when it broke down again, looks like main technician was online waiting for vehicle to breakdown to give excuses.</p>
              <p>Vehicle was already sent in earlier for servicing and it broke down within a few days. Yes, if there are warning lights, driver must pay heed. But if warning lights appear within a few days of servicing, what sort of servicing is the main technician doing???</p>

              <p>Reliefdriver4u, Taxi drivers are already paying 2 to 3 times the rental rate for vehicles, as compared to what other rental companies are charging for similar vehicles.</p>
              <p>When you rent a normal vehicle and it breaks down, you get a replacement and not an argument from some technician.</p>
              <p>Taxis pay more for rental because they are more fully utilised. If it breaks down, taxi drivers deserve a replacement vehicle and not accusations from some senior technician who can also threaten the taxi driver about filing feedback to management.</p>
              <p>TS. State  the name of the Taxi Company and Senior Technician here.</p>

              <p>Already lots of Sonotas' caught fire. Who is the senior technician? How many times were these sonotas' in workshop? How old are they? What is the mileage on these Sonatas' on fire?</p>

              <p>We also need the name of the Main Technician because he is the one writing the report. By the looks of it, Main Technicians, like to write reports on Taxi Drivers failing to observe warning lights.</p>
              <p>In the first place, if main technicians are doing their job, warning lights should never appear!</p>

              <p>We also need the name of the Main Technician because he is the one writing the report. By the looks of it, Main Technicians, like to write reports on Taxi Drivers failing to observe warning lights.</p>
              <p>In the first place, if main technicians are doing their job, warning lights should never appear!</p>
              <p>Please state the names of the Main Technicians! who are a threat to taxi Drivers.</p>

              <p>IMHO taxi coys that tender out servicing contracts are doing themselves n TDs a great disservice.

              <p>Correct me if I am wrong. But I believe all!! taxi companies tender 
              out servicing jobs to private workshops. So all taxi companies are 
              already doing a disservice to Taxi Drivers by charging 3 x rental and 
              saving on maintenance by tendering out maintenance to the cheapest 
              bidder.</p>
              <p>Problem for the taxi driver starts when the cheapest 
              bidder cuts corners on maintenance even further by many ways! of which 
              some are revealed above by you.</p>
              <p>Main Problems faced by the taxi 
              driver are frequent breakdown even after regular servicing. If I am 
              driving a regular car and it just came out of the workshop, I will go 
              back to the workshop if there are still problems with it. Last thing I 
              want is an argument with a Main or Senior Technician with regards to 
              calling a Tow Truck.</p>
              <p>Calling a Tow Truck costs money. If the car belongs to you, you call tow truck, you pay.</p>
              <p>If
               you driving a TAXI and call a tow truck if the vehicle breaks down like
               as the TS described, you can still be charged towing service if the 
              Main Technician can write a good report.</p>
              <p>Bottomline is this. Taxi 
              drivers are paying their dues. 3 times the rental of same cars. But taxi
               drivers get only one third the service.</p>
              <p>Agree with you at the 
              end that LTA and whatever should look into this matter before there are 
              lots os sonotas on fire or taxi drivvers jumping off with their 
              passengers.</p>
