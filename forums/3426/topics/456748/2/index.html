              <p><br> National taxi association, I believe some trancab drivers would had
              joined them as member, their membership now stand at
              abt 13.500  nearly half of TD in singapore, it is the
              union of the Singapore Taxis. And I believe one of their objectives
              is to ensure that their member are not exploited with unjust and
              unscrupulous manner from their taxis companies.</p>
              <p>But Like I said, they are not doing their job</p>

              <p>You should know by now that all these unions and associations have good names and some even charge fees, but nothing done when there is a problem. In some cases, better results can be achieved by writing in forum for advise. So far no updates from TS. hmmmm.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>union or association is no use. when join them they will say got beneift. but when problem, they will say is company policy drivers already sign agree cannot do anything unless driver own hire lawyer own fight. but they will still send letter ask you pay membership because member is member, own case is own case, separate thing.</p>
              <p>about the car after that last time, workship say is repaired, but now the car is back in the workship just again.</p>
              <p>but now even new problems..the account depart call up chase rent, say must pay up even if car under servicing, no in use. they say company policy is driver must still pay full first, then their side workshop will auto update their record to put downtime back.</p>
              <p>the car now in in out out workshop so many times in last 2 weeks, maybe drive only a few days? the driver already paid those few days drive, but the account still asking for full 2 weeks rent, say their system no show receive workship downtown update, so law by law is owe rent is driver own problem, not company or workshop problem. driver have no right ask company system update, its their job they will do own time own target no need driver question. driver job is to pay rent, drive or no drive up to driver, not blame the company or workshop the car spoil or servicing long. so if no pay the full 2 weeks rent even car under servicing, they may terminate driver and deduct from deposit totally including penalties.</p>
              <p>and if driver complain keep spoil cannot drive, then its should be driver own intiative to change car earlier better to continue driving to pay rent. not company problem. and not their problem is they only have more higher expensive models more rent. if driver not want to choose, that is also out of company control. as long rent is still pay to today.</p>

              <p>got people say, maybe this company trying to get drivers to pay first for bad taxi under servicing not in use, so they can pay their car loan to bank.</p>
              <p>if driver not happy, they will then push more expensive rent models, if not penalty deposit.</p>
              <p>but then after that, downtime got return or no return, is between company and driver, is big question mark. 2 weeks never update downtime, they already say their system says is driver no pay rent problem, not company or workshop problem. like that continue how?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Pay rent while car in workshop? Sound like Transcab cos they will only credit in your downtime after car is out for 2-3 days. CDG very efficient. Once my car down 2 days. 1st day down time is credit into my account the following days. Cos they count the downtime on a daily basis till 2359H and if car is not out on the second day money will be in your account on the second day. This system good. If not if cars in for 3-4 days where got so much money to pay rental?</p></div>
