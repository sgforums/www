              <p>I joined Union leh, not bad lah, they give my  3 childrens back to school vouchers $125 per child, also $30 NTUC u stretch voucher, my second child also get $200 scholarship award from them. And also, the linkcard got link points, can change to buy thing at NTUC fairprice, then they also got rebate of 5% at fairprice. Many courses to take, but then I have to pay $9 per month, that will be $108 per year, quite a burden.</p>
              <p>As for advises, they got industrial officers who can advise you on how to manage your career and when to take courses and even tell you where are the jobs available, i think that is no bad instead of going to job agencies. Then they also got family days, dinner and dance lah, outing days etc etc,..i attended some of them with my family, got goodies bags and also free entry to some of the Singapore attraction. Actually, think about it, not back lah, take it as a club for taxi driver more than a union</p>

              <p>That is because there is no mrt station nearby. The same goes to zoo and night safari etc ... If there is a mrt station they will purposely implement surcharge to scare off pax and at least some will end up taking public transport.</p>

              <p><br>You are welcome, but there are criteria that you have to meet, like household income must be $1800 and below or per capital is $500 and below, then you qualify to take, per capital meaning total income - nos of people in the house, for example, you can earn $3000, but your house got old parents and childrens total 6, so 3000 divide by 6, you get $500 and you still qualify.</p>
              <p>I think it is good, actually the union is another avenue for taxis driver to voice their grievences, I see some TD who got suspended or sack by company unreasonably, they went to the unions and the unions help them to argue and some get back the job with some warranty. And also Union member enjoy free SLF life insurance, SLF meaning Singapore Labour Foundation. I used to visit the Union HQ at Marina One, they got a career link for people looking for jobs, a big office with few counters for those who wish to take part time courses, book chalet at Pasir Ris with free ticket entry for 4 to theme park and wild wild wet or get discount ticket for singapore flyers and cathay cinema movie tickets, the Taxis Union also got many drivers there chit chatting with each other, a good networking place, just that for smoking, you have to go out of the building. For those who play golf, they also got orchid country club membership to issue to Union members, never thought taxi driver also play golf...something very wrong</p>
