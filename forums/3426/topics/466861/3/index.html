              <p>Yes, colleague is never a friend, that one many mistaken it. Because till the day your colleague backstab you, you said, how come friend brother brother, he can like that, then I would said, please do not take colleagueship as fren, it is of no choice that one have to become colleague due to same trade.</p>
              <p>Real friends are one you met outside of your job, it might be old colleague now become friend or that some one you meet in geyland. hhehehe</p>
              <p>For partnership to works, there must be a share common interest, but most people, in their nature inhabitant, are self interest, and that is why relief and hirer can hardly get together unless that common interest, be it characters or altitude, is in line</p>

              That is very true for my caseâ€¦no selling to meâ€¦ in fact I am the one to find him in CCK to talk about LV n other matter at tat time (but didn't knock his door lah ...hahaha) 
              
              Though joined only a while, I can see wat he told me about LV is realisticâ€¦n I do feel motivated by the leadership/guidance from Chief Pool as well as by other LV members. For tat I am grateful.

              Buyers beware mah...(caveat emptor?)...LV may be good for some...useless for others...anyway at current rates, its not a big investment...if find it doesnt fulfil yr own needs...just stop lor...don lose all tat much.
