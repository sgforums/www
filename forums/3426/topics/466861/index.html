              <p>To all TD wannabes,</p>
              <p>Dun come in and ask from all the lao gui. They can only advise based on their experience and <strong>personal preference</strong>. Some might even want to "force" their opinion on you. Just read these posts with a pinch of salt and decide for yourself.</p>
              <p>If you have decided to be hirer or OMO for whatever reasons you may have, just press on. By the time your contract ends, you will be in a better position to decide whether your choice is right.</p>
              <p>In td, <strong>BEST</strong> is <span style="color: #ff0000;">rent low</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">fuel low</span>, <span style="color: #993366;">income high</span> and not forgetting <span style="color: #ff6600;">short hours</span>. But I do agree to start as a relief and learn on the job is still the best choice.</p>
              <p>Good luck to all newbies.</p>

              <p>From my experience since oct 2012 till now.</p>
              <p>Im a super relief driving on friday/saturday night.</p>
              <p>Why go relief/super relief when you just start?</p>
              <p>because you only pay 1/2 of the rental, shorter hours on the road (12hours).</p>
              <p>Meantime you can learn the routes and the traffic.</p>
              <p>I tried being a OMO for 2days.i gave up.my 1/2 shift earning is more than a OMO calculate in hours.</p>
              <p>Let me give you an example of ali &amp; baba</p>
              <p>Ali is a OMO.</p>
              <p>He pay $120 daily for rental, diesel 450km ($50) total operation cost $170</p>
              <p>Hourly income for a TD is $20/h with the crazy traffic.(could be worst)</p>
              <p>1st 7-8hours with short break to cover rental, another 2-3hours to cover diesel, another 4-5hours for salary of $60-80.
              Total hours put in 15hours.</p>
              <p>Â baba is a relief driver.</p>
              <p>He pay $60 daily for rental, diesel 350km ($40) total operation cost $100</p>
              Same hourly income of $20 /h with the crazy traffic.
              1st 3-4hours cover rental, 2-3hours cover diesel, 4-5hour for salary.
              Total hours put in 12hours.

              For TD is drive more earn more but how long can you drive? No need to rest? 
              Road is dangerous with the current amount cars on the road, drivers dunno pass from which driving school. Sufficient rest is need for TD to stay safe on the road.passengers safety come 1st.

              Omo and relief is like a sports in olympics.
              
              Some love driving long hours marathon.
              
              Some love short bursts.
              
              Some love ping pong.
              
              I think its more like having the discipline and punctual sleeping habits, to enjoy the advantages as a relief.
              
              Omo pay more not to earn more, but for convenience.
              Anytime sleep also can, at least when wake up can drive enough hours for the day to cover cost and make a livong.

              <p>Like Eurocab ...... i know his problems he faced , so i just gotta sympathised him .</p>
              <p>Well if he doesn't have that sort of problems he facing now , i still felt being relief , having a reliefÂ is better .</p>
              <p>Like hokkien wei say ....... wu hua meh ? OMO rental , driving like relief's timing ?</p>
              <p>Meaning Eurocab paying $107 against mine $55 rental , while we drive almost the same hours ? Wu hua meh ? Well he started work earlier than me , a few hours ahead of me , to cover the first half expenditure n overheads .</p>
              <p>Not forgetting he definitely use more fuel than me .</p>
              <p>Meaning what ?</p>
              <p>Eurocab paid more rental then me , paid more fuel than me , wake up earlier than me , drive more mileage than me ......... same pay , maybe earn little bit more .</p>
              <p>Lastly , as what we always said , taxi can earn how much nia ?????</p>
              <p>OMO to earn $7k ? Dream on lah .....</p>
              <p>I can lah , got a little bit of experience ...... maybe hoot kao bo suah ,Â  chiong kao si suah , 16 hours daily , cannot wait for coconut drop , cannot on talkie , cannot CBD , see just sweep , maybe $5k yes ....... but i'll die 7-8 years younger perhaps . Face turned haggart , wife disown me , children find new father etc hahahahah , badminton shoes rot , soccer became square i also dunno , just need more time to rest and chiong again the next day .</p>
              <p>It's thatÂ what iÂ want in life , for that little money ?</p>
              <p>No lah fuck ...... I have perspective in life , and that money is never on top . Enjoying life while we are young , dun regret it laterÂ before we die .</p>
              <p>Enjoy is enjoyÂ , work still need to work just work as per normal , why work so hard ?</p>
              <p>Work smart ...........</p>

              Since you mentioned about eurocab, let me just add on. 
              
              For him maybe Omo is of no choice, but at least he listen to advise from senior.
              
              Recently, I was happy to hear from him. 
              
              Now he has driven a slightly shorter hour on the road but maintain the same collect
              
              Comparing from the first month who chiong around.
              
              Getting and listen to the right advise is important
              
              Don't react like a fool to have a negative mind and not even want to learn will be
              
              Suffer only .

                  Bro, but your first post is like telling ppl not to share give advice leh...
                  
                  This omo vs 1 shift discussion hv been discussed many times in other threads liao , but I don think members will tired of it ...lol
                  
                  There are pros n con lor ... but I don think anybody can dispute 1 shift (whether day or night) Tds will hv more time to themselves for other activities..n omo tds can earn more with the required discipline in the shorter term. Long run type drive until 60s ,, 70s ? dom think so... I always feel age is an important factor in the choice...those young with energy... no harm trying omo...if find siong later switch to 1-shift will be easy... but start relief .. than later when older do omo ? more siong... Then those above 45 yrs old difficult lah...
                  
                  I still hvnt seen those die-hard pro-omo like RBS and (I think Hammmer) posts yet ... hahaha . (Oops saw bro RBS posts liao)

Unless you can afford to earn only $50 a day and throw rental on Sat/Sun then OMO is better. Because can have the disposal of the taxi.
