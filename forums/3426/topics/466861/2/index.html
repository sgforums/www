              despite many thread being start by newbie to td to be
              
              members over here will never stop sharing their experience and giving out
              
              advise even many time we ask newbie to look at the old thread
              
              right or wrong choice, in the end it is up to the driver
              
              because every individual has different needs demand and different back ground
              
              example, if someone who has work in transportation driving a vehicle long hours
              
              before becoming a taxi driver maybe his/her can  endure longer driving hours and took
              
              up omo
              
              but if a new driver who use to work in office, than it could be relief is better
              
              right or wrong only they will know cause individual situation can change
              
              just like we old bird, may prefer to take up one shift driving, why?
              
              because maybe due to experience in driving, better collection in shorter hour
              
              or getting more idle like hiding under coconut tree etc
              
              so, if anyone ask for advise, give if you want but not false info

              times in other threads liao , but I don think members will tired of
              it ...lol There are pros n con lor ... but I don think anybody can
              dispute 1 shift (whether day or night) Tds will hv more time to
              themselves for other activities..n omo tds can earn more with the
              required discipline in the shorter term. Long run type drive until
              60s ,, 70s ? dom think so... I always feel age is an important
              factor in the choice...those young with energy... no harm trying
              omo...if find siong later switch to 1-shift will be easy... but
              start relief .. than later when older do omo ? more siong... Then
              those above 45 yrs old difficult lah... I still hvnt seen those
              die-hard pro-omo like RBS and (I think Hammmer) posts yet ...

              <p>without somebody become hirer where got relief.of cos omo has it's benefits.can drive slowly,evening peak we can pow ka liao,bookings also can take without worrying about time factor,we can rest for one hour before starting the next session.no need to worry about car not clean properly,as long as maintain reasonably clean,no dispute about pump petrol not enough,no arguements about late handovers,also can put our personal belongings in the taxi,if we want more money we can just work longer hours or else if the day ur fedup,just close shop and go home.then again must be discipline,when tired even paxs say going a/p,just say changing shift.</p>

              <p>But my strength is always in town , night clubs , office towers night spots etc ..... they will sit around with me , those seniors .</p>
              <p>We sit and share ...... discuss about which taxi stand is solid one , discuss attire to distinguish the potential of certain calibre of people , study body languages to judge customers .......... to see locals or foreigners , to judge nationality of people just by listening of the accents ......</p>
              <p>This type can impart ? </p>
              <p>No ........ u have to experience it yourself .</p>

              <p>That's the maximum timing a relief driver is taking, should you go beyond 12 hours everyday to be OMO?</p>
