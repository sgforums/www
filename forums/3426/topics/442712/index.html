              <p>In Lake View , we are a team .</p>
              <p>We have got so many calls at times , we can afford to let others nearer to location to attend to the job . We just need to bid for other jobs .</p>
              <p>Each one of us , practise a certain high level of tolerance .</p>
              <p>Of course there is trouble makers , again , there is where those "chiefs" come in to settle dispute .</p>
              <p>Of course there is dispute on air .</p>
              <p>I treat that as entertainment on air .</p>
              <p>Small issues lar normally ....</p>
              <p>We are there for the money , not to make enemies .</p>

              <p>I do not know how u classify "durians" jobs ... my standard very high one ! Hahahaha</p>
              <p>Of course there is lousy jobs vs good jobs .</p>
              <p>Good jobs everyone also want .</p>
              <p>Lousy jobs who also dun want .</p>
              <p>But again , Lake View has got so many drivers with good attitude , that they willing to sort out those bookings who repeatedly no takers !</p>
              <p>And customers appreciated us .</p>
              <p>I would say ..... majority if our jobs are quality jobs .</p>
              <p>U want Ap , very good chances hotel got AP jobs .</p>
              <p>U want avoid jams , plenty to chose from .</p>

              <p>The only problems during evening rush period , if u want to go specifically places like Woodlands , Yishun , Jurong , Sembawang , Sengkang , Punggol ..... very hard to come by , i am serious !</p>
              <p>We don't have many outskirts customers , all grapped by CDG taxis hahahahah , CTE will show you that !</p>
              <p>But funny enough , we have abundance of calls to East side .</p>
              <p>Pasir Ris , Loyang , Tampines , Bedok ..... but no takers .</p>
              <p>Our furthest job , most drivers would welcome , is Balestier !</p>

              <p>Of course we will have chances to go out of town or deliver roti type of jobs , like once eg Marina Mandarin or Conrad <span style="text-decoration: underline;">call 10 taxis in one shot</span> ........ all without destinations .</p>
              <p>Like Company D n D , or wedding dinner type of functions .</p>

              <p>Lake View very active during peak hours , both morning peak and evening peak .</p>
              <p>After peak like after 11am , we have got jobs , one problem , got jobs no people want to take , even if they are 5 mins away .</p>
              <p>I dunno why ?</p>
              <p>Maybe large amount of NO SHOW discourage them to grap it .</p>
              <p>We only entertain our main core of customers , our regulars .</p>
              <p>Also due to large amount of taxis on the road that discourage them to take it .</p>
              <p>But again , Lake View most powerful is from 5pm onwards , esp 8pm on !</p>
              <p>Of course , sometimes we also in a low , cannot be so good , tio bo members ?</p>

              <p>i can tell plenty of stories about Lake View non stop .</p>
              <p>In Lake View , the drivers are very important .</p>
              <p>U join Lake View , also need to do simple marketing , and get customers to call us . Throw name cards , it's free !</p>
              <p>Marketing is not only Lake View's problem .</p>
              <p>It's the drivers that make it possible , not just Lake View .</p>
              <p>In short , we give ten of thousand of name cards each year .</p>
              <p>Those pass our numbers by mouth one , we haven't account for it .</p>
              <p>Credit to those members who did marvellous marketing .</p>

              <p>This one huh... No need wait for company DnD.  Last night just kenna one at a particular club.. The moment I saw 4 beauties (NOT!) board my cab, I shake my head liao.  The top head hor, not the head below.  As expected... "Uncle, 4 locations." and followed by "Is it fine with you?"</p>
              <p>I heard already really don't know to laugh or cry... The timing is the sort that after finished with the bread delivery job, just nice before 12 am one.</p>
              <p>This is just the second case in the night for bread delivey.</p>
              <p>The first case is a happy ending for me.</p>
              <p>It's not a bread delivery job, but a bread pickup job.</p>
              <p>The male pax told me destination is as being paged out by the controller, but to pick up his wife from another location that involve a slight detour.  Ask me fine or not, I told him I would like to say "Not fine, but I will still do it".</p>
              <p>Along the way, we talked about why it's not fine with me for multiple locations which may only involved an extra 10 minutes.  He listen to me patiently to my explanations and at the end of the trip, offered me a top up amount equivalent to 1/3 of his fare.  I'm happy, not because of the amount of the top up, but because he bothered to ask me about the extra pick up point and also listened to me patiently.  And he's not even an A.M.K. to begin with. :-)</p>

              <p>This, I agree.  So many jobs, why worry about one that maybe another member is better placed to serve the customer.  Especially, recently, it's been raining cats and dogs.  A lot of things go behind the scene.  For me, there are times where there are only 2 bidders for the job (me and another member).  Sometime we will contact each other and check location.  If he is at a near location, I just give up and let him go.  Sometimes he will give up and let me go.  You don't need all the customers to yourself.  Just that 20 - 25 paxes per day will do.</p>
