              <p>London’s iconic black cabs remain the best in the world while Auckland misses out on top ten</p>
              <p>Auckland, 24 August 2011:</p>
              <p>London taxis have been voted the best in the world for the fourth 
              year running, while Auckland taxis failed to rank among the world’s 
              best, according to the annual taxi report compiled by Hotels.com, the world’s leading hotel booking website.</p>
              <p>London’s black cabs won nearly a third (28%) of the vote in a survey 
              which asked almost 5,000* travellers from 23 countries around the world 
              for their views on various aspects of travelling by taxi. London was 
              placed first in five out of the seven categories including safety, 
              friendliness, cleanliness, quality of driving and knowledge of the area.</p>
              <p>Despite also being named the most expensive (with 20% of the vote), 
              London’s taxis beat off competition from New York (favourite amongst 9% 
              of travellers) and Hong Kong and Tokyo (equal third with 7% of the 
              vote). Singapore completed the global top five receiving 6% of the vote,
               displacing the German city of Berlin and capital of Thailand, Bangkok 
              from last year’s top five.</p>

              <p>Singapore</p>
              <p>6%</p>
              <p>Katherine Birch, Head of Marketing, Hotels.com Australia and New 
              Zealand, says: “Taxi drivers are often the first people a traveller will
               meet on entering a country and their experience can set the tone of 
              their holiday. After four years at number one, London taxi drivers are 
              clearly leading the way, providing travellers with a reliable and safe 
              experience.”</p>
              <p>Other findings include: From the airport The research found that 
              taxis are still by far the most popular method of travel from airport to
               hotel, 54% of travellers choose a taxi over getting the train (16%), 
              boarding a bus (16%) or walking (2%).</p>
              <p>Lost &amp; found Travellers around the globe reported a number of 
              interesting items they’ve lost in taxis around the world. One Korean 
              traveller reported losing a dried cuttle fish, a Norwegian unfortunately
               lost his/her wedding ring and an Italian even reported losing her bra! 
              With Brits reported losing a number of items ranging from a hamster to a
               flute.</p>
              <p>Tips Argentinians are the worst tippers, 34% confessing to never 
              tipping their taxi drivers. Hong Kong residents are the most generous, 
              with almost half (48%) choosing to tip 20% of the fare or more. Brits 
              were most likely to round up to the next round number (33%) or tip 10% 
              (50%).</p>
              <p>Safety All 23 countries put safety as the most important thing when 
              taking a taxi ride, apart from Italians who deemed ‘cleanliness’ numero 
              uno, ahead of safety that came in second place!</p>
              <p>Pet hates Chinese pet hates include smelly drivers with 55% of the 
              vote, while smoking at the wheel is frowned upon across the globe with 
              33% of Brits and 52% of the French naming it as a pet hate.</p>
              <p>Cut the chat Koreans are the least appreciative of the famous London 
              cabbie, with 37% admit to hating ‘chatty drivers.’ Germany also weren’t 
              keen on making small talk, with 30% labelling chatty drivers as one of 
              their biggest dislikes!</p>

              <p>“We want to go to somewhere….,” when I spoke in English or Mandarin 
                  to an mid-aged old driver last week, he couldn’t understand at all and 
                  asked me to get off the car. By living in Hong Kong for nearly one 
                  month, it seems that not all Hong Kong cab drivers use another language 
                  rather than Cantonese, and a common of drivers I found out when I take a
                   cab in Hong Kong, a fast-paced society, they drive really fast.</p>
              <p><strong>Today, there are more than  18,000 registered taxis in Hong Kong with
                   more than 50 taxi cab groups  and associations</strong>. About 100 taxis have 
                  opted into a system that allows  customers to pay with a credit card, as
                   part of an effort to get the  city’s cabs outfitted with cash-free 
                  systems – but it’s unclear whether  the companies offering the system 
                  can persuade drivers to swallow the  extra costs. One example is 
                  Autotoll. The company operates the electronic toll systems in  Hong 
                  Kong, in partnership with Dah Sing Bank, is rolling out a voluntary  
                  program to equip Hong Kong’s taxis with GPS navigation systems, video  
                  surveillance, traffic broadcasts, a supposedly more-efficient dispatch  
                  system and credit-card payment machines. They hope its new  dispatch 
                  system, which uses GPS to connect a driver with a customer,  will entice
                   drivers to eventually pay about 100 Hong Kong dollars  (US$12.84) a 
                  month to use the system.</p>
              <p>So far, many  drivers are afraid the  credit-card transactions will 
                  take up too much time and will eliminate  tips and the rounding up of a 
                  fare to a whole dollar. Just five of his  drivers have installed the 
                  system.</p>
              <p>On top of the expected HK$100 monthly usage fee, taxi drivers will  
                  also likely have to pay a maintenance fee, to Dah Sing Bank, as is 
                  typical of most credit-card transactions.  Visa, the sole credit-card 
                  company offered with this system, also takes a  portion of each 
                  transaction. These fees have been waived until at least  the end of the 
                  year, but maintenance fees for having a credit-card  machine generally 
                  run around HK$165 a month. “The monthly fee and percentage the bank  
                  takes varies industry to industry and will be determined at a later  
                  date,”said John Lam, executive  director of Dah Sing Bank.</p>
              <p><strong>“The government is remaining neutral on the issue of credit card  
                  payment, and there are no plans to make them compulsory for drivers,” 
                  said Eric Tam, a transport officer in Hong Kong’s Transport Department.</strong></p>
              <p>The AutoTAXI system includes a television  screen on the seatback 
                  facing the passengers, which will feature short  entertainment programs.
                   <strong>Autotoll plans to sell advertising on the  screens and give 20% of ad 
                  returns to the drivers, keeping the other  80%. This will generate “more
                   than enough profit to cover the drivers’  fees,” for the AutoTAXI 
                  system says Owen Leung, senior business  development manager of 
                  Autotoll. He expects the new system to be more popular among younger  
                  drivers and that many of the older drivers may be reluctant to adopt the
                    new technology. “It’s not easy to change their habits,” he says.</strong></p>
              <p>There are currently about 240 taxis using Autotoll’s navigation and  
                  communication system on the roads, but only about 100 of them have the  
                  payment system installed. <strong>To advertise which taxis have the Visa option,
                    the cabs have been given illuminated wings to place on their rooftops.
                   However, the wings cause drivers to  lose about five cents per 
                  kilometer in fuel efficiency, HK$20 a month.</strong></p>
              <p>Not only Autotoll and Dah Sing, Octopus Cards Limited is trying to 
                  update the  taxi payment systems in Hong Kong as well.  The company  
                  running the ubiquitous electronic payment cards used in Hong Kong’s  
                  public transportation system has been trying implement its own system.  
                  In March, the company quietly started installing card readers in a few  
                  taxis. Currently, 30 cabs accept Octopus, and a spokesman said the  
                  company is working to expand.</p>
