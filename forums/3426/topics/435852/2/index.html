                      oic....I also one of the last few batches of the semi online batches...which need to attend 2weeks of night lessons at STA before the self e-learning. Already cannot tahan the 2weeks of lesson as even if you miss one lesson you are not allowed to take e e-test....heard after my batch all that register need to attend 1mth of night lesson...cannot imagine 30days of night class and cannot miss even 1 lesson or late.....quite inflexible, should at least something like a 90% attendance thingy to take the test mah.....but luckily it's already over for me...
                  
                 
               As for going over to talk to them...I am still trying to have a chance to meet and talk to them...as of now either they are not ard or the car are park in the carpark alrdy...

              I only knw that they have a 2 files in their office table. One is Hirer looking for Relief and the other is relief looking for Hirer. So depend with you want, you just fill in the right book or just browse thru the hirer list. As for hirer database, I am not so sure.

                  I think most of my area TD doing day and need night relief. Wanted to do night but my body cannot tahan as I get heaty very easily. Everytime stayed too late will get sore throat no matter how much water I drank or how much I sleep the next day. Maybe getting older liao...moreover I thought at least do day I can pick up both my kids to and fro school. So like my area, I think same like you, to get night driving is easier compared to day...
