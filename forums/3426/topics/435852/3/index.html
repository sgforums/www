              <p><br>Not really, Merc takes less diesel, and the flag down price is higher, people on the street are getting use to merc, and if your hirer got limo or those walkie group, you compensate him abit or if he is good, let you take those good calls, you also can get lots of business.</p>
              <p>By and large as super relief for some merc drivers, I find it is the same earning or even more higher, but then, you get more comfort and less car problem. Knn, you know those sonatas gives alots of problem, from booth to engine overheating to tyre to brakes to battery, to front and rear lights, and for those silver mag..lots of aircon problem. These usually start after 2 to 3 years, this is where private car parts warranty period is over, although crown had lost it power and shake alot, but it is a good vehicle, not much problem if you take care of it. Wish make in thailand also got dashboard vibrating problem, me once kenna brake drum leaking problem. For merc, so far, no problem, just that as usual, older merc make more noises and take more diesels.</p>

              sometimes need to pause and listen to god.
              ever a few times, i tried doing something but always get blocked here stuck there. so i become more and more insistent and try even harder.
              but when i finally get what i want, end up brought me more upset or distress, then i realise maybe not insisting in the first place might have been better for me.
              i think theres a few such stories out there like this also, but i am saying just for reference only.

              Tks for the advise...me still no luck....so most likely taking up the uncle offer staying opp my hse. Will try to do the night for 2 weeks and see how. At least can get a feel being a TD....at the meantime will still try my luck to look for a DAY shift...
              
              Mostlikely if comfirm, I will be driving tomorow or 1 day later...any senior want to advise? By the way, does transcab like income/premier need/provide training for equipment usage?
