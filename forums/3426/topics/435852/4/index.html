              Sorry for MIA so long...tried to post my experience on the first day...suddenly what I type are gone after I press "post"...sian sia....
                  
                      
              1st day - 17 Aug 2011
                          
                                  
              1645H - Took over Taxi. Then try to figure out the controls like meter, MDT, credit card ...etc... Very nice of Khoon to call and wish me luck and offer help if I need any...was caught abit off guard as I never thought someone would be so helpful.
                           
                                 
              1700H - Move off....went rounding and rounding like a lost soul...never pick up anyone on the street.
                           
                                 
              1730H - Decided this cannot go on, so went to Gombak MRT Taxi stand. Short queue and in no time pick up my first pax to CCK central.
                           
                                 
              1745H - Kids called so went to fetch my 2 kids and went dinner.
                           
                                 
              1845H - Went out and Gombak MRT taxi stand. The rest few jobs all ard CCK, Bt Panjang, Bt Batok. earning very slow.
                           
                                 
              2122H - Very stress alrdy as rental haven't cover, after 8 Gombak MRT quite a few taxi but no passenger. So don't want to queue and went for rounding and thought to myself maybe try my luck at nearby private condo. Heng heng kanna my first furtherest trip from Gombak. Boonlay market....
                           
                                 
              2145H - After dropping at Boonlay Market, dunno what to do again. So went to IMM try my luck. Upon reaching there, Lots of ppl but no Taxi queue. Happily took 3 NS boys to Pasir Labar.
                           
                                 
              2200H - After Pasir Labar, went Jurong Point taxi stand pick up 2 Ang Mo to a very nearby condo only. $4... after which proceed to JP again...yipeee to Duxton. At this point I realise the importantance of the peak hr charge. Should have had the dinner later...after 8pm
                           
                                 
              2220H - Rental covered, only abit more for CNG.Immediately after drop off, another guy came up to Punggol. Seems like this timing alot of drivers resting.
                          
                                  
              2250H - After drop off, dunno where to go as not familiar in punggol. CNG covered...Rounding again.
                           
                                 
              2300H - Was considering whether issit feasible to go airport. So went for light kopi/toilet break while checking with khoon and wait for his reply. Ordered my tea without drinking more than 3 sip...suddenly heard..."summon lai liao..."....knn sian have to abandon my unfinish tea and go drive off...to AP as advise by khoon.
                          
                                  
              2330H -  Reach AP, seems like long queue...but first timecan't really guage the how long issit so juz queue loh.
                           
                                 
              2345H - Already within the zig-zag rd in the queue. notice alot of taxis juz zoom pass the queue infront. Was thinking are they going toilet or cut queue? I tot to myself, knn queue for do long...if I know earlier, I also wayang wayang go toilet then straight away cut queue will be faster... 
                          
                                  
              2350H - Wah can see that alot of taxi bro/uncles parking inside the queue for kopi...damn smart, must be waiting for the midnight charge...not like me newbie "gong gong" still queuing...later sure no luck for mid-night charge.
                          
                                  
              0000H - Heng heng by the time my turn is alrdy midnight...heng ar...somemore to Ulu pandan.
                          
                                  
              0022H - After drop off, dunno where to go so try my luck in Holland-V...wah many taxi....so slowly go town bah...zouk...duno where the queue...messy...so left....Tian Ann men...also so many taxi parking at roadside...dunno the drivers are here for passenger or going in to enjoy???....boat quay...etc.
                          
                                  
              0110H - After zooming for so long and no luck. I guess cannot go on alrdy so went to clark quay to queue...very long queue...but fast. I also get to cut queue thanks to our toyota wish....in the middle of the queue, 2 passenger pick me as I am the only wish ard. The rest infront and back of me is either sonata or crown...So the next few pickup I went to clark quay...
                          
                                  
              0200H - Was advise by my hirer to be more relax first day so with my little earning decided to go back pump and sleep.
                           
                                 
              Lesson learn:
                                  
              1) At times go taxi stand queue better than waste my CNG rounding for very long.
                                  
              2) Peak hr charge much work...really make a diff wvwn short distance.
                                  
              3) Neighbourhood pickups are mostly ppl going hm after a tired day, so after MRT they will take taxi to relax.Especially those at Gombak Mrt going to CCK or Bt panjang as they are lazy to change e LRT...(subjective)
                                  
              4) Not easy being a new taxi driver without knw trade trick...
              
              5) Cannot drive too fast as I am not too used to seeing street pickup...miss so many of them on the road...so sayang

              2010H - Today done better with better planning. rental and CNG alrdy covered. Not so stress liao. didn't go back to eat as planned cos last drop off in yishun.
                  
              2030H - Bro called to meet and eat dinner with him at coffeeshop. but spend too much time talking to him.
                  
              2200H - Start picking up all the yishun, woodland and sembawang passengers as no one going out of town. All short and fast trips.
                  
              2330H - Got a passenger going to CCK happy, cos go hm for awhile and can go pump CNG again before chionging....left 2 light CNG.
                  
              0000H - Went home for a while to top up my water and to release my water within 10mins and ready to chiong for another 2 hrs before RTB. By the I reach CNG kiosk, the attendant give sign language...10min...i was like wah sian...have to wait n waste time.
                  
              0012H - CNG full...off to city via dunearn road. But no luck for roadside pick up....cos too many taxi enrouting there...
                  
              0030H - Again at my favourite fast queue at clark quay...so the rest of my trip was done there.
                  
              0200H - RTB to CNG station, wash sleep. Did slightly better this time...earn ard 30% more than 1st day.
