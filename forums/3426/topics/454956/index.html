              <p>Not sure where is better for the medical examinations as I've only done it at one place...can't compare...but you can first check with any medical facilities like clinics, hospitals and polyclinics near you. Go to the enquiry counter and show them the <strong>LTA medical examination form</strong>. Ask if they are able to do the required examinations at their facility. Most places, even small clinics can do the examinations, except the x-ray part. I did mine at Khoo Teck Phuat hospital, one stop settled everything, no need to run here run there.</p>
              <p>You can't register for the TDVL course yet because you'll need the completed medical examinations form to enrol for the course.</p>
              <p>Deciding through which company to enrol for the TDVL course depends on your own preferences. Availability(earliest available course date) and the types of courses are more important. Some may have a higher enrolment rate than the other hence a longer waiting time from enrolment till course commencement.</p>
              <p>However, which company you sign up with for the course somewhat matters if you are seriously thinking of becoming their hirer as soon as you get your TDVL because there are $$$ incentives involved. Examples can be found here: <a href="http://203.142.23.14/Taxis/JoinSMRTTaxis/TaxiDriversVocationalLicence.aspx">SMRT</a>, <a href="http://www.cdgtaxi.com.sg/cabbies_drivewithus_hirer.mvn?cid=642542">CDG</a></p>
              <p>I suggest you first check with all the companys to compare their earliest available course dates. There are also full time and part time courses to choose from. Example, full-time course takes, say, 8hrs/day for 4 weeks whereas part-time course takes 4hrs/day for 8 weeks.</p>
              <p>Note: Whichever company you chose to enrol for the TDVL course doesn't bind you to that company. With a valid TDVL you can go to any other taxi operators.</p>

              Yesssâ€¦ SATA $32.10 for TDVL all incl GST
              
              Howâ€¦Mmmâ€¦. a bit confused and updateâ€¦
              Call ktp hospital, they do not seems to have this medication exam w x-ray available for TDVL, also do not take walk in.
              Call STA; F/time fees $335, start on 6/8- no obligations, can get 50% of course fee funding from NTUC if their member.
              Call SMRT; F/time fees $362.50, start on 5/7 â€“ no obligations for course registration, got 2k incentives if sign after pass as hirer.
              Call CDG; F/time fees $345, start on 23/7 â€“ to register for course, got to 1st sign some document to be bond for incentives after pass 1 year be hirer for manual Crown (4 yo) then 1k deposit they pay for hirer.

              My little journey to get what I wan â€“TDVLâ€¦
              
              Begin
              1.	1st time sent appln (14/6/12) to LTA (26/6/12 reply) for TDVL approval - Price: $40
              Download online form to apply, fill it up, get copy of IC and Dvr Lic, wrote chq $40, put env, put stamp â€“ sent!  Then wait and wait for replyâ€¦ So happy when receive pre ok from LTA!
              2.	4/7/12 - 10.30am to 1pm about 2.5 hours - Went to SATA AMK get X-ray and medi on Express basis - Price:  $30 + 18 + gst = $51.35
              Make a number of calls to the 3 trainings ctrs and clinics and ask around, chose SMRT for course becoz got earliest date start course.  Go SATA AMK becoz its an one stop check and x-ray, very fast!  Good and helpful forumers advised de, very good recommendation â€“ Thank you!
              3.	Go MOE (North B Vista Dr) get replace cert over the counter (about 10mins) - Price:  $10
              Never tot tt need english cert to get TDVL â€“ shock and respect â€“ respect - respect â€¦.
              4.	Go SMRT at Novena MRT Station to register for TDVL course (about 20mins) - Price: $362.50
              
              This one quite interesting, the SMRT course register desk is OMO.  Next to the whole row of ATM, open space with 1 desk, 1 printer, 1 laptop and 2 banners plus 1 flyer plastic holder.  Funny impression created in my mind â€“ more like a promotion corner for some good looking taxis!
