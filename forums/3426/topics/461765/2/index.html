              No they are not crazy, 
              
              we get get more newbie driving taxi not because of this forum 
              
              we are getting more newbie driving taxi because of the curent policy implement by papaya
              
              don't you notice more and more young driving are driving taxi at early 30s?
              
              they drive not because of the collection reported, just like me who have to switch to taxi
              
              too, 
              
              they join this trade because of the FT policy over the past years
              
              driving taxi don't expect every day/week/month/year to be the same, that's why maybe 
              
              me and many other tds have the same, is the last job that came into our mind
              
              Maybe what you should do is ask those pax to stop complaining to the authority and
              
              media that they always cannot get a taxi when they need one ( so where were you when they need taxi)
              
              the pax are the main reason that cause of more taxi increase on the road
              
              remember the LTA for taxi popuplation  up to 2% yearly increase is also a result of it
              
              one day maybe we will be all fight on the road to find pax

              drive not because of the collection reported, just like me who have
              to switch to taxi too, they join this trade because of the FT
              policy over the past years driving taxi don't expect every
              day/week/month/year to be the same, that's why maybe me and many
              other tds have the same, is the last job that came into our mind
              Maybe what you should do is ask those pax to stop complaining to
              the authority and media that they always cannot get a taxi when
              they need one ( so where were you when they need taxi) the pax are
              the main reason that cause of more taxi increase on the road
              remember the LTA for taxi popuplation up to 2% yearly increase is
              also a result of it one day maybe we will be all fight on the road
              to find pax</p>

              <p>To be honest if one will to compare between Taxi driving and "society" work, "society" work will still be the prefered choice. If u read this forum long enough, you should no why and some of them ha also successfully switch from TD back to society.</p>
              <p>All driving as TD will be the last alternatve that we will think of but of course there are minority that will prefer TD as a start. Really minority as those ppl that don't need CPF cos TD had to contribute you own CPF( Medisave) whereas the "society" work will contribute your CPF together with you.</p>
              <p>Thus, with the FT policy (that our papaya want ) really pushed the our own ppl to TD driving more faster and thus you can see more and more younger generation. So unless CPF is not an issue to your daily need, then "society" work will still be ther prefered one. So, please be understanding for more and more TD on the road....</p>

              <p><br>Not all TD driving Taxis are due to last option, if you move around serangoon garden, bukit timah king and queen's road, you can see those red, blue and white taxis park at their private house, you also can see london cabs.</p>
              <p>You see, one thing we forget to see is the aging population, we singaporean are aging fast with so less youngs coming in, and as we aged, gain some fortune thru investment, earlier hardwork or simply buy and sell properties, or that CPF and saving is more than enuf to last 2 to 3 generations, the option left to make one still vibrant and able can be taxis driving to keep one going before dementia, schizophrenia or brain dead set in.</p>
              <p>And that is also why LTA is asking Taxis companies to ensure that their taxis are on the road with the new regulation</p>
