              <p>Saturday night.picked up 2 men, one local and one Chinaman from night club in Peace Centre. Just as the local about to alight along Bt Merah Central, he asked me a question who do I vote. I said  "opposition with my heart and strength" He left with a cold smile.</p>
              <p>Next, with the lone China man sitting in front towards Ang Mo Kio, he asked me what I am not happy with PAP. I said "I am not happy with too many foreigners taking away our jobs and too many scholarships given to them in schools and universities."</p>
              <p>He intelligently asked me how many of my passengers are foreigners like him. I said, " about 35% foreigners, some are just tourists on short stay." "You trying to tell me if you all are not here, I'll have less 35% income ?"</p>
              <p>He went on to say Singapore welcome him and he loves Singapore ( As a country, and not its lower class citizens , I guess).Taxi drivers should be thankful to foreigners like him for the trips.</p>
              <p>What irritated me was he said I was like him, also an immigrant.That I don't have dark coloured skin.etc.......and his voice got louder and louder after I remain quiet to listen to his points. Each time I tried to reply him, he cut in with his loud voice.</p>
              <p>I was on the CTE when I got damn crazy. yelled at him with all my vocal strength."I was born here long before the independence of Singapore." I was among one who created Singapore and not Singapore created me ! You got it, many people don't welcome you.If I were you I go home, don't be a shame here......bro...ther."</p>
              <p>It worked...his voice softens, "just send me to Blk 320 safely, mister." "Actually I am now PR,from Beijing,I am very rich in China and now I trying to buy coffeshops in Singapore." "Just now my Singapore friend got down in Bt Merah is running for MP in Singapore."</p>
              <p>"Huh...who is he ?, as I tried to figure who is he? Not possible, at this time so busy also can going drinking with you in nightclub?</p>
              <p>Reached Amk 320, $15. Gave $12 notes, said not enough, how ? I said, "You said you very rich, take taxi everyday, you meet so many hundreds taxi drivers, today this one here is special one, the one in one thousand taxi driver in Singapore."" You no need to pay me, just go home to Beijing and enjoy spending your money there." " I give you receipt, I yelled at you, you not happy with me, go tell your MP friend,or complain to the authority.........make me retire earlier lah.......xia xia</p>
