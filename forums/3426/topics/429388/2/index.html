              <p>Those are FTs that take away jobs from taxi drivers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are certain industries where transport fees are paid by company or clients. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I did not say FTs don't take taxis, but seldom, you should see the MRT, there are even more pax. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now taxi drivers are ferrying FTs that stole their jobs, what irony. Serving the FTs that stole your job. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I took taxi and heard that some of our taxi drivers used to be managers, but got retrench by company because of low balling FTs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

I was wondering what the fuck he is telling me all these, just keep quiet and use PIE, then he asked, hello, got surcharge or not? I told him yes, now is peak period, then he shouted, why you never tell me?? KNN, Indian accent very strong, can hardly understand him, I asked him, are you a PR here, he said, yes, I am a professional here, why you never tell me got surcharge, that is no good, your govt never teach you to respect customer is it!!! I WILL NOT BE PAYING THE SURCHARGE. Chao CB, me stop at shoulder before Paya lebar exit, ask him to get off, no need any fare, just fuck off. Then he looks scare and ask me, how to get a taxi here, I told him I dunno, my govt never teach me too. After that, he smile and said, he is in a hurry, it ok with the surcharge. Haha, now my turn to fuck him, all the way to budget airport, I fucked him and also tell him better he dun come back, indian is flourishing, i also bought indian shares, why are you so stupid and come singapore to suffer, yet hv to take a budget airline, I went all way to terminal 2, turn back then go into budget airport instead of turning at the police station viaduct, want to play with me, ni lao bu. KNN. Give me $20, I said no change, lan lan take his language and walk in..With this type of people coming in, Singapore jialat liao..I dun mind begging on the street, I dun mind getting poor, I dun mind feeling hungry, but I cannot stand get humilated by some stupid peoples out of this land. And if the stupid govt keep sending this type of peoples instead of the true talents from Jap or Europe or US, you can rest guarantee, I vote for Opposition, even if they are primary 6 educated like me </p>

              <p>Those are FTs that take away jobs from taxi drivers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are certain industries where transport fees are paid by company or clients. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I did not say FTs don't take taxis, but seldom, you should see the MRT, there are even more pax. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now taxi drivers are ferrying FTs that stole their jobs, what irony. Serving the FTs that stole your job. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I took taxi and heard that some of our taxi drivers used to be managers, but got retrench by company because of low balling FTs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
