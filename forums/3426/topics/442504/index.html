              <p>There are 2 types of diabetes :</p>
              <p>type 1 : need daily insulin injections</p>
              <p>type 2 : usually occurs in adulthood because of obesity and usually on oral medications</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A diabetes has a higher risk of getting hypertension (high blood pressure) as well.</p>
              <p>If a person is both diabetic and hypertension, the risk of getting kidney disease is also higher.</p>
              <p>Then there is also a higher risk of getting heart disease and stroke.</p>
              <p>Symptoms of a diabetic person :</p>
              <p>Blur vision</p>
              <p>Excessive thirst for sweet or gassy drinks</p>
              <p>Fatigue or get tired easily</p>

              <p>My grandma and my mum both passed away with diabetes as the main cause. Grandma even had to have one leg amputated after gangrene set in.</p>
              <p>My brother- a routine pre-surgery checkup for torn ligament revealed a 50-60% blockage of his blood vessels. The torn ligament surgery was abandoned and bypass perform almost immdiately. Had it not been for the torn ligament, he would have been a goner.</p>
              <p>As diabetes is hereditary, my chances of getting diabetes is higher. i have been watching my sugar and carbo intake since i turned 40. Thankfully, my last full medical checkup revealed a clean bill of health. It is not expensive at about $150 at NTUC healthcare. It includes all sorts of tests (except stools) like tumour markings (for cancer), diabetes, kidney function, liver function etc. It also includes a scaled down ECG test for blockages.</p>
              <p>So to all bros here, please do go for a full checkup. It can save you from more future medical problems. If u dun take care of urself, nobody can. in SG, one can afford to die but cannot afford to fall ill.</p>

              <p>Bro pool the followings are my answers to your questions</p>
              <p>1) 36 years . I got this illness for 4 years.</p>
              <p>2) My grandparents have it. My parents dun. So it skip one generation. Lifestyle plays a part . It trigger the diabetes which is inside me all along.</p>
              <p>3) Well I am overwight. By 30 kg. So far I have lost 12 kg. So plenty of kilos to shed.</p>
              <p>4) Please see No 2.</p>
              <p>5) Now my motto of living is to eat to live and not live to eat . I have to eat moderately in small amount. I have to eat less carbo and drink plenty of water . I get dehydrate easily. After that I need to go to loo frequently too.  Vice versa its difficult to control the situation.</p>
              <p>6) Now my drink is always kosong . I have not been drinking coke for 4 years liao. No prata, chicken rice or briyani.</p>
              <p>7) About saltish that is related to HBP. Nothing concern to diabetes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hoped the above will answer to your questions bro Pool.</p>

              <p>There are 2 types of diabetes :</p>
              <p>type 1 : need daily insulin injections</p>
              <p>type 2 : usually occurs in adulthood because of obesity and
                  usually on oral medications</p>

              <p>A diabetes has a higher risk of getting hypertension (high blood
                  pressure) as well.</p>
              <p>If a person is both diabetic and hypertension, the risk of
                  getting kidney disease is also higher.</p>
              <p>Then there is also a higher risk of getting heart disease and
                  stroke.</p>
