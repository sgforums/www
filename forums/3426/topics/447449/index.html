              <p>Got 2 points.</p>
              <p>1) I always like to read and be amused by hirers who like to think very highly of themselves. Saw this gem in the CDG portal for matching enquiries:</p>
              <p>Hirer in AMK look for night relief. His terms -  a) Only Chinese (I'm not offended by this, because some prefer own race for better communications or whatever, anyway it's hirer's chocie after all) b)  Only 7 days driver need apply!!!!!</p>
              <p>Wah piang, the way he phrase it. His cab is very super one and it's privilege to drive it. You must have certain standard, qualifications or ability to drive his cab. AMK some more got very very few hirers looking for relief, lucky got his one on offer.</p>
              <p>I wonder how many will take on his offer. I'm sure his hp has been ringing non-stop. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>Some hirers, haiz dunno how to say. Even my new hirer. I drive only 3 nights weekdays, now he got 1 guy drive Sat/Sun night for him. He want the guy to drive an extra day, to include Friday night or Sun full day. The guy say cannot, my hirer terminate him!</p>
              <p>He say he's doing the guy a favour by letting him become relief, if he cannot meet his expectations then too bad, the relief will lose out!!!</p>
              <p>Then he ask me whether I can do extra night, logical thought he would offer Fri night. Nope, he offer Mon! I say very sorry, when I ask for relief I already state I only want to drive total of 5 days every week, 3 for you and 2 for my other hirer.</p>
              <p>Now to more serious matters:</p>
              <p>2) CDG policy on vomit.</p>
              <p>Happen to be at the counter to register as new relief for Azera (3 nights a week). SO I saw 1 file titled vomit, so I ask the counter staff, how to claim this vomit thingy and how much.</p>
              <p>The rule: Must get receipt from cash wash stating vomit cleaning. The max pay out is $20. Forgot to ask whether this is a standard fee for all vomit cases or it depends how much is stated on the receipt, if eg: receipt state $16, collect only 16 or 20.</p>

              <p>My only opinion is the race part and wording it in such a way would not be allow in CATS ads for racist reason. But it's nice that u understand the same race can communicate better but to me, not really very true as most ppl here are bilingual and most can comunicate with our other race colleagues and neighbouts.</p>
              <p>I really dun see anything wrong with the other phrase, maybe it gets you on the wrong mood.</p>
              <p>Speaking from my point as a hirer, I dun want "too many cooks to spoil the soup". Just have one partner better right? heard of one cab got 5 people driving and in the end, very complicated la, thing get lost, cab kanna knock by who also dunno and everybody claim it's not him.</p>
              <p>So, it's better for the hirer to look for just one, stated there loud and clear instead of a need to entertain ppl on a ala carte basis.</p>
              <p>For my case, I too state there as 7 days. I got one who ask for 6 days, if can 5 days even better. Then I first time try to be good hirer, agreed let him drive 5 days. Then I got the hassle of looking for a weekend driver and got a real blur king who mesh up the whole thing on the first day that after the first weekend, I got to say bye bye to him. Now I got to look again and same time, throwing hints to my current relief hoping he take at last one more day, but this guy also act blur.</p>
              <p>So I think it's better to make it real clear at the start, no calls is better than all other calls that dun fit it your plans right? after all, you only need one call from the right partner right? Unless u want to "ride on a donkey first while looking for a horse." but not very good for the first guy right?</p>
              <p>Even if u state it "dam bloody clear" like what I did, asking for DAY drivers, people can still call you and ask you if u need night driver. Or are they simply trying their luck?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Bingjames,imho if the relief driver is willing to drive 7 days or 6 days at least, he would rather be a hirer.Thats the reason they choose to be a relief driver instead.To my surprise,many hirer also drive 5 days a week or lesser these days.Its good to give the new relief driver a orientation especially he is a new bird.I dun know what your part time relief do to your vehicle, but he might not do it with any bad intention. Cheers &amp; hope u find a new driver  relief soon.</div>

              <p>just as relief put in driver portal wanting to drive only 1 or 2 or 3 days , some want to drive only 1 3 5 , some only want to drive fri sat sun, many patterns, only contact him if suit his pattern</p>
              <p>hirer also can chose to look for ppl wanting only to drive  full 7 days</p>
