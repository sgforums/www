              <p>I supported yr action. Imagine we have a drunk bus driver, a half drunk MRT train driver, a not so drunk SIA pilot.... what may happen huh?</p>
              <p>One simple thing "Drink Drinking" can implicate to words like: intoxicated, influence, excess alcohol level, judgement, physical control, abuse, ability impaired, jurisdictions, etc....scary right? Laywers love these words!</p>
              <p>The worse of the lot is the word: "Endanger"..</p>

The population here is getting bigger and bigger, if each one of us here don't obeys the law, it will becomes a rojak city. The richer will do what ever they can to break the law, the poorer may commit crimes in order to overcome their problems. This is the things we hope might not happen in future.

                  eh hello, i am talking about giving others the chance an opportunity to repent, if they willing, we should forgive them... you talking like drink/drink=100% kill people, but we know majority don't even get into accidents, much less injure someone, even tinier percentage managed to kill anyone. come on lah, even some sober drivers get into accidents. if someone's car accidently brush against me in the car park, then he come out and i know he abit drunk, i will let him off if he really apologetic and won't commit such stupidity again...i won't let him off if he kill someone (obviously duh!). but you're talking like you will call police and jail them no matter what happens, even if he parking car safely. maybe we're different, i believe in giving others the opportunity to change for the better especially if the problem is minor... you don't give chance even if no accidents happen, different thinking.

              call the police and that is almost exactly what he said! " Call

              <p>I think the benefit of the doubt is better. You had a confrontation with him and that may have triggered you to call the police.</p>
              <p>Everyone has their own troubles, he may be facing some serious domestic issues which you don't know of. Wife ran away, parents seriously ill, a loved one just died, god knows. Everyone has done something stupid in their life before and what if you had paid for your folly back then? Would you have been the same person today without a second or third chance? And who's to know he will or will not repent based on the first instance of meeting this chap?</p>
              <p>My 2 cents worth since you asked for opinions on a public forum.</p>

              certainly i am not condoning drink diving, but the above example was merely to explain to you what i meant by "majority"... because you guys talk like drink 100% drive kill people... blowing it out of proportion...
