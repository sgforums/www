              <p>I think the crucial part is... did you warn him about his behavior and that you'll call police/TP if he continue such behavior?</p>
              <p>If you never warn him then you never give him chance, then you're not just punishing him, but his family also. I don't want to judge you because what's done cannot be undone, but in the future, it's always nice to forgive and forget.</p>
              <p>If you did warn him and his attitude is like, "go ahead call police lah i scared ah..."... then this kind of people deserves to be reported and go jail...</p>
              <p>I believe in giving people chances and for them to repent but if their attitude doesn't seems like the type to repent, then it make sense for them to repent through the hard way...</p>

              <p>It is alright to be smelling of alcohol, provided you are not in control of a vehicle.</p>
              <p>Being in control need not be driving, sitting in the vehicle, even on the passenger side, maybe also the backseat, not sure, is sufficient. Intoxicated and incharge of a vehicle is an offence. This include intoxicated and pushing, or sitting on a bike. Drink driving offence not easy to escape when kena caught.</p>
              <p>Was the TD outside or inside the vehicle when the police arrive?</p>
              <p>Anyway the TD knows the rules. If he infringed them. He is clearly at fault.</p>
              <p>On your part, you gave the true facts. BUT the consequences pull your heart strings. What to do, you did no wrong.</p>
              <p>Hope he just kena a warning.</p>

              <p>If he is driving and plying the road for business, then it is absolutely wrong. The limit  for off duty only, a pint of beer, anything above that, is dangerous.</p>
              <p>I understand your concern, a wise man will never argue with a drinker, cause they talk no sense. It is sad that he will get revoked, and if got young childrens, his family is going to suffer, but then, everyman must answer for his own deed.</p>
              <p>For me, I would not say  yes or no, it depend also on your friendship with him, how much you know him, what is the arguement about, is there a way to teach him instead of calling for police? These are all the question you have to answer yourself. At the end of the day, he may hv to go home and tell his kids and wife that he lost his taxi licence and job and it could be, like you said,  a blessing in disguise that he is no more driving and the public is safe.</p>

              <p>wah...this kind of topic can almost ask in the religious section sia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I think you should have talk to the driver first and see how they respond. Maybe they already sit there want-to-go/don't-want-to-go and if u talk, then pursuade them to relack for awhile. Or maybe they spill whisky on shirt and ba-wu srong stong. Dunno....many possibilities. Asking/talking first no harm right?</p>
              <p>Anyway, what u did is not totally wrong either so no need to sianz over it now it's done. It's the intention that u had that counts.   </p>

              TS you said long story short. I think this case is serious enough you should tell the whole long story.
              
              for me, if the other party gets physical with me, my pax or my car, then i will go all the way, he deserve it.
              
              but if its just argument and you went this far, then yes, you seems a bit too much. you practically destroyed his last rice bowl. 
              
              but at least you could have save his and others lifes. this thing is like the old army war story. would you saw off a man's legs to save his life?

              <p>I wondering if this TD is off duties or going to change shift and so hv a few drink, and I agree with Atake, actually there are lots of drinking drivers, you can see the 7th month celebration full of cars, all these drivers drink alot, but not to totally drunk like CQ type, then drive home.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the TD can be having some problem or getting depressed by personal problem, and you might be just there to add on further problem for him.</p>

              <p>I think you are damn asshole. You just have to warn him.
              Smelling of alcohol does not mean drunk. You have to go all the way
              to call the police. There are many more criminal acts in Singapore
              for you to enforce. You know how many dangerous drivers there are
              on the road today? Why don't you go hunt them down and report
              police.The police don't even care nowadays, what makes you an
              authority now? There are so many small crimes here and everybody
              don't care but you suddenly hero?</p>

              <p>Actually the confrontation got nothing to do with him drunk driving. Just that during confrontation I know he is drunk. From his behaviour and action. He is clearly unable to control his vehicle. Even if he off duty I doubt he will be able to drive home.</p>

              <p>I think the crucial part is... did you warn him about his
              behavior and that you'll call police/TP if he continue such
              behavior?</p>
              <p>If you never warn him then you never give him chance, then
              you're not just punishing him, but his family also. I don't
              want to judge you because what's done cannot be undone, but in the
              future, it's always nice to forgive and forget.</p>
              <p>If you did warn him and his attitude is like, "go ahead call
              police lah i scared ah..."... then this kind of people deserves to
              be reported and go jail...</p>
              <p>I believe in giving people chances and for them to repent but if
              their attitude doesn't seems like the type to repent, then it make
              sense for them to repent through the hard way...</p>

              <p>Ya that is exactly what happen. I ask him to park his taxi one side and go home in another cab. He dun listen then I tell him I call the police and that is almost exactly what he said! " Call police lah I not scared!" So I call loh.</p>
