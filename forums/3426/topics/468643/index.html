              <p><br>Ya lor, nowaday, mods anyhow luan luan lock, if not he got too many locks no use..how? place it on great wall of china?</p>
              <p>Taxi driving is a very individual one man job, and as human, we tends to have blaming culture within us, if it is team of 10 or 20 in a company dept, it become so called office politics, he blame her, they blame him, end with with tribes and clans from shaolin and wu tang...so on.</p>
              <p>As taxi driver stand alone, and the only person to put word is his partner, it is a natural sense of human that even relief clean up the whole vehicle, hirer will in silence or open said that why this is not clean and that is not thrown, or that even fuel is top up as per instruction, one of them will alway feel the other is cheating him. It might, or it might not, but in TD partner relationship, there lies the line of boundary that both will tend to cross at times.</p>
              <p>And it is right to say that to get a good relief or good hirer is much difficult then finding a good wife, however, some do partner each other for 20 years and above, some just one day only..give up liao. </p>

              <p>This one saw at company diesel kiosk today..a lot of tds there see leow also shake head.</p>
              <p>Not sure if it is a hirer / relief thingy but what I felt is, some disagreeable over topping up of fuel with his hirer or whatsoever hence he does what he did.</p>
              <p>This guy took more than 20mins to fill up. He manual pump then use torch light shine and see, then drip drip drip without pressing anything..then press a little bit, shine and see then drip drip..keep doing that..when you think he is done..he go shake his vehicle...and do the same thing again..somemore never off vehicle.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if this guy, who don't look very healthy is OMO...think better for him not to drive anymore.</p>
              <p>And if got partner, have to do until like this..also better not to drive..</p>
              <p>I tell my relief..just auto pump..twat leow can already..</p>
