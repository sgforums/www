              <p>On 24 Sept 11, I picked up a taxi booking call from MBS hotel Tower. Along the way at Marina Boulevard, I saw a lot of zombies walking and flagging but no taxis in sight. At 512am, a male in his twenties with his female companion boarded my cab at MBS. I dropped the lady first at Elizabeth towers condo near Mt Elizabeth hospital. The guy going to lavender, I started to go towards Orchard then via Serrangoon to Lavender, when the guy reminded me to go by CTE and exit via Moulmein, I said not very sure leh but make a U-turn to CTE anyway.</p>
              <p>On the way, he started to question me why I do not know the way and did my company send me to go for any course before started to drive a cab. I said I have recommended a route to Lavender via Serangoon road and just that not all taxi drivers know the best routes to take at a given location. He went on to give sarcastic remarks like if you do not know the way, how are you going to fetch customers to their destination. I said I've already recommended a <br>different route.<br><br>He also said something like: What happens if you have customers like me who don't bother to tell you which way to go to their destination, I said: Oh, I've never met such a person like you before". From here, he started to give problems. He kept giving sarcastic remarks but I kept quiet until he said:" I pay you money and expected you to know all the routes well and bring me to my destination". Then I blurted out: Your money is big fucxx is it? After that he accused me on using vulgar <br>language on him and then started to call my taxi company a few times, accusing me of threatening him, abusing and using vulgar language on him, and also he feel threatened, and demand a explanation from them latest by the next day. He also called the polce and repeated the same blown up issues to the police and call the police to come when I stopped at the exit at Moulenmein.</p>
              <p>I also said that "the police will not entertain you". Who will have thought that this<br>idiot blown the issues out of proportion by exaggerating that his life is threatened, and he felt threatened, when I have not even touch him or use any threatening words. A small argument can become a life threatening issues blown up by that idiot so that the police will come to help him to save face. What a moron can think of to waste police resources. He even mentioned that he is a professional and "I know the Law, ok".<br><br><br>I then asked him : "Did I ever point a knife at you".  When he says he feel threatened. I aslo asked him to F.O. from my cab, after which later he asked me what is F.O. and I said Fucxx off. He repeatley said that he wanted to ask his lawyer to sue me or file a civil suit. While waiting, I have asked him that I just wanted to apologise and move on, thinking that its not because I was wrong but to let him win, and close the issues fast, but he insisted a written apology and attached it to be sent to comfort also. I was thinking this guy is really asking too much.While waiting for the police to arrive, I kept saying that "you are really wasting my time."<br><br>I also said that I will countersue him from my lawyers.I refused to accept his fare I said that is was unfair to do so as the meter was running while stationary and waiting for a very long time, and also I did not bring him to his destination. He insisted to pay me as he said money is not the issue here and even boasted that he will gladly pay up even if the fare is a few hundred dollars. (telling me you are rich?). I still refused his fare and also refused to print a receipt for him ($36+), as I did not collect any fare from him.</p>

              It seems that you are the aggressor here, you started the war.
              My advise to you, either you change your attitude or please give up driving and find other job, cause you will even get more frustrated as time goes by. You may face a much worse pax next time and what you are going to do? challenge him for a one-on-one?
              
              Please reconsider.

              <p>I would take the CTE to Lavender from Mt E.</p>
              <p>I am puzzled with your choice of route. Why Orchard down to Serangoon with so many traffic lights</p>
              <p>Your pax also reminded you to take CTE and exit Moulmein. So you are at fault here.</p>
              <p>So what if the pax pass sarcastic remarks? You are not sure about taking CTE and instead use a different route against the pax instruction. Then your EGO is so big that I think you dare not ask your pax how to go from Moulmein.</p>
              <p>If you are not sure, be humble and ask the pax.</p>
              <p>The whole incident started with yourself if you reflected back.</p>

              <p>Actually i am TS side coz frankly i hate pax to say this 'I pay you money
              and expected you to know all the routes well and bring me to my
              destination'.</p>
              <p>TD must know ALL routes? I went to take the TDVL , i never once hear the instructor tell us that we must know every corner , block , road , lane in Sinkapore leh. Now everyone sit down can say why go lavender through orchard , sometimes on the spot when u are tired or blanked out , u do things the opposite .</p>
              <p>Seriously if u guys are in his shoes , u will feel agitated too. If its HammerHammer , he would have chased the fella down liao.</p>
              <p>But try to refrain from using vulgar language on pax , once u use that , u are at the losing end. read somewhere in the lta handbook that u can get fined for it,</p>

              <p>I would take the CTE to Lavender from Mt E.</p>
              <p>I am puzzled with your choice of route. Why Orchard down to
                          Serangoon with so many traffic lights</p>
              <p>Your pax also reminded you to take CTE and exit Moulmein. So you
                          are at fault here.</p>
              <p>So what if the pax pass sarcastic remarks? You are not sure
                          about taking CTE and instead use a different route against the pax
                          instruction. Then your EGO is so big that I think you dare not ask
                          your pax how to go from Moulmein.</p>
              <p>If you are not sure, be humble and ask the pax.</p>
              <p>The whole incident started with yourself if you reflected
                          back.</p>
              <p>Good luck..</p>

              <p>Cool and Calm is the name of the game, once you are cool, steady and calm, people tends to be more worry about you then wanting to find problem with you. Hold still to your dignity and principle of TD.</p>
              <p>TD must be able to differentiate between professionalism and personal issue, do not get personal with pax, use your profession communication skill. when bro pool talks about skill, this is part of the skill that hopefully TD can achieve. Pax will try to induce TD into a personal conversation, in a heated arugement, they tends to pick up your words for words, so becareful, they will lure you to say the F words, the more you say, the merrier for them. So, dun fall into their trap. Be steady, very simple, just apologise and ask pax for option, or alternatively, ask if he wants to drop now, no further comments.</p>
              <p>That is why communication is very important, knowing or not knowing the route is better to ask first, for nobody knows the best road to their house than a person who lives there. Greet pax, as for any preferred road, press meter, move off, if got routes, best, just relax and listen to their direction, if not, drive on with what you know, if tourist, just drive.</p>

              <p>Hi just to share my experience, I had been driving during weekends for the past 4 months... So I guess my knowledge of the routes in Singapore is still quite green.</p>
              <p>So far I have met paxes who also post remarks to me like "Are you Singaporean ??", "Oh,my GOD ..u do not know where the building is "and the worst case I have met so far is a lady Ang Moh telling me " I know the route, but I do not want to lead you the way bcos I dun wan to be a tour guide and also I am very tired and need to rest" (cannot remember the whole comments but it really hurts me that time)</p>
              <p>For the first case, even though the pax says that, he still took my cab bcos I ask him if he dun mind I use my GPS and that end the case.</p>
              <p>For the 2nd case, the pax lead me all the way and I thank him for his patience.</p>
              <p>For the last case, the lady pax offered to get out of my cab and take another one.</p>
              <p>There are also pax who ask me how am I going to fetch customer to their destination if I dunno the route. I see this question in a positive response by thinking that they are in fact care for me on how I can survive with limited knowledge of the routes.</p>
              <p>I admit sometimes in these moment, I do get a bit "hot" liao but my head tell me 2 things... treat it as a learning curve and the next thing is "this PAX will be dissapear in my cab less than 15 - 30 mins later".  It is not like in office if you dun like your colleagues or bosses...u have to see them for a "certain time" before either you resigns or he/she resigns....</p>
