              <p>Fetched a Ft today near bus stop outside budget terminal.</p>
              <p>Thought of waiving the surcharge since so near the boundary and also his pay probably not much.</p>
              <p>On reaching destination, he asked for receipt. So I no hesitation liao, hit the $3.</p>
              <p>The chap (nice and mild-mannered) complained that he was never charged and offered to show me all his receipts. Said wait he kena from his boss. I said ask yr boss check with cdg or lta if he wants.</p>
              <p>Finally I said, no surcharge, can, no receipt, want receipt must pay surcharge. End up he still grumbling when paying the fare.</p>
              <p>So the point is, fellas, if pax can claim from boss, why the discount??</p>
              <p>Wanna drive cab, where/when can collect extras must fingertips. Dunno must find out!</p>
              <p>If waiving surcharge as goodwill, must let pax know else will create more confusion. </p>

              <p>From the TDVL course instructor told me as long within boudary can charge. From the looks of it, you should charge.. But during course they also say not to pick up pax from that bus stop cos a lot of camera recording and by law we not suppose to stop within 9m of bus stop.</p>
              <p>For the question about claim, different company different style. My last job, boss close eye. I can't claim from home to job site, but i always put from office to job site when in fact i take cab from home. All my other colleague do same, i think my boss also know but he don't care, reason we put from office is for finance department.</p>
              <p>But another company i work for very strict, if let's say i take from point A to point B everyday, if fare differs slightly ok. If differ a lot without justification, ie traffic jam etc.. The company only will reimburse me the usual amount. If let's say go in additional ERP gantry finance will question why.</p>
              <p>Sometimes the company finance department go as far as checking the fare online to see correct or not.</p>
              <p>If one colleague take from point A to Point B @$20 and my fare same point also comes to $25, they will only allow me claim $20.</p>
              <p>So thats why most people can claim one prefer going same route everyday, even if suddenly got shorter cheaper route along the way. If not claim delay a lot of explaining to do to finance dept, etc..</p>
              <p>I guess most of the time that pax take from there without airport surcharge, cos TD thought only at AP taxi stand can charge extra. So if he were to submit claim again with xtra, sometimes the finance department won;t pay him for that xtra $3</p>
              <p>Reason he unhappy cos that $3 will come out from his pocket, if everyday take taxi 5 days week then 1 month extra $60 from his pocket</p>

              <p>He said he took cab from same place regularly. I think he can only claim once a week or month.</p>
              <p>Two things came into my mind at that time...he either wanna save for his boss to look good or being a FT, always kena left/right/centre from his bosses.</p>

              <p>FT especially Indian, die die must charge. Cannot give chance.</p>
              <p>They everything also pay by card la, $5 also pay by card. Not their money what - company reimburse.</p>
              <p>You think they would agree to even pay the NETS 30cts fee if their own cash? Hah, even that they will try to save, if pay by their own cash.</p>
              <p>This $3 airport thing is depends la, sometimes you get some airport workers rushing to go home after a tiring day, or miss the bus, these are locals you can tell not earning the big bucks type at the airport. This one can forgo la since they are paying their own cash, plus you're actually leaving the airport empty handed because the queue super long.</p>
              <p>But yaya papaya one cannot give face, I really don't like when pax say other drivers say can, why you cannot? Like this surely must charge, but if they explain that company don't allow claim for surcharges or cab fare has certain limit - anything over their own, this one if say nicely can entertain.</p>
              <p>Or sometimes I meet them half-way, I say ok I won't charge you full $3, maybe charge $1.50 to $2.00, minus this amount from the final fare (included the $3 already).</p>
