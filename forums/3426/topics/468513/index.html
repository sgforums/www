              <p><br>You look at NSHW enough liao, once accident, it will be a serious one, because clear road encourage speeding, and now most cars with cruise control, aiyo..brake also brake buay hu..bang into trailer, head also gone.</p>
              <p>City driving, tho messi, traffic light here and there, but drivers are more cautious, not sleeping, fark here and there,...adrenaline charging, even hit also minor accident, but with a clear road, like the ferrari case..alamak, nasi lemak liao.</p>
              <p>We TD sometime focus too much on city road, then once hit expressway, speed all the way, as you get tired and also much energy lost in the city, you may fall asleep, so becareful, focus hor</p>

              <p>Dangerous/reckless driving involving death - you can look at 18 months to 3 years, maybe more.</p>
              <p>Inconsiderate driving involving death - starting around the 1 year mark</p>
              <p>This case  careless driving resulting in death - 8 weeks to 1 year. Here 8 months is a very appropriate sentence</p>

              <p>Your fellow Mod says 10 months lenient blah blah.</p>
              <p>I remember not long ago he mention that 1 of his TD friends involved in fatal accident involving 2 deaths. He was asking for views/advise about how to help his friend.</p>
              <p>So now this cabby kena 10 months he say lenient, will he now also be asking that his friend get at least 2 years or more, when his turn comes up?</p>
              <p>Will he be the super cyber warrior demanding justice and punishment or will he act blur because it's his friend and hope he gets a 'lenient' sentence like this?</p>

              <p><br>Yes, this guy is good, last week, I took one nice indian lady pax from ah wood to changi Prison, she told me, her son was sentence to life for killing a girl..can be gf, but I did not probe further as it was a sad thing.</p>
              <p>Then she said, by right, he was sentence to death, she and her husband then decided to all way to save their son, I heard already also sympathise her, they engaged Subhas Anandan, but to appeal to high court, need alot of money on the case, she sold her 4 rooms flat, rent one room to stay, ask her daugher to stay in hostel, fight all the way and finally, high court judge reverse the sentence to life prison.</p>
              <p>On the way, she feel very happy, smiling and can also talk jokes, I sense a strong will lady who knows no barrier in getting her way.</p>
              <p>End journey, fares was $25, give $30 and ask me to keep the change, I denied, but she already drop off with her foods for her son. For a moment, I think, nothing beat mother love, and smiled myself. Then a malay chio bu flagged me once out of the gate, once on board, she said, Uncle, you abit siao leh, machiam gila uncle,..keep smiling???</p>
