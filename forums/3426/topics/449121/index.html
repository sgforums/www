              AVOID AT ALL "COSTS" (HAHA) !
              
              Too many details from everywhere, but this the Summary.
              
              They take every opportunity to claim money from drivers, starting with:
              
              a. forfeiting security deposit and advance payment, not a bit, not some, not partial but most of the time its the ENTIRE AMOUNT, either WITHOUT valid reason or with INVALID reason. NON-NEGOTIABLE.
              
              b. charging 100% accident excess for even 50/50 or even clear cut NOT AT FAULT CASES but refusing to provide ANY case info, update case status to driver or refunding a cent even AFTER case is clearly closed. especially for those resigning or returning. Refund or cases can be prolong as much as 4 years and still "not yet settle, dont ask me"!
              
              c. STILL add charge at least ANOTHER 50% accident excess for "un-informed" VERY MINOR (read: VERY MINOR) repairs or touchup from the GOODWILL of the driver ON TOP OF WHAT HE ALREADY PAID FOR THE REPAIRS! Cheek to call it "penalty for illegal modifications"!
              
              d. NO ONE TO DISCUSS ANY MATTER AT ANY GIVEN TIME, either NO ONE IS AVAILBLE TO TALK or ANYONE AVAILABLE TO TALK IS NOT AUTHORISED TO MAKE ANY DECISION AT ALL, EXCEPT THAT ONE WHO IS UNAVAILABLE TO TALK. Its rare to even meet up with person in charge once things go downhill, by the time driver sense something wrong means he is gone case already, conclusion is already decided for him and set in stone and in motion, just waiting for driver to either pay up or receive laywer letter warning.

              even if you are not taxi driver, its easily UNDERSTOOD-ED. 
              sorry I dont want to receive lawyer letter warning from nowhere.
              
              careful current drivers of RED GANG. they may be on the verge of something dramatic like suddenly closing operations or even declaring bankrupt. now they are like a giant vacuum cleaner without conscience or logic or system, sucking up money from anywhere anyone they touch, then whacking those not willing to pay up.

              Now i post on behalf for a wish member , a relief .
              
              He got hit n run . Head light broke and bumper dented .
              
              Cannot find driver involved , but he did swee swee for hirer , repair all damages , he bear all cost , swee bo?
              
              But hirer said procedure must inform taxi coy.
              
              He followed up .
              
              But nightmares from transcab started .
              
              Transcab slapped an accident access on him . amount $1070 for â€œinforming themâ€� that he was hit n run and will settle all damages with his hirer , thats all he did . Inform . As procedure . Inform and got hit by accident access .
              
              Transcab so hungry now ?
              
              They will be doomed from as far as poolman is concern . They had certainly tookover from.Smrt as Spore No.1 accident access claims from drivers .
              
              Transcab even threatened to issue writ of summons on him if he did not settle all claims.
              
              This access is ridiculous as far as i am concern .
              
              Their such despicable actions deserve nothing but condemnation from us.
              
              They are no longer a taxi company famous for be fair .
              
              U want to rent taxis from.such company ?

              what i said earlier is completely spot on. everything is dictated by one goondu Dowager (PUI!). everyone is just another chamber maid playing along.
              
              i also finally know the reason behind this sudden fleecing on taxi drivers.
              
              The RED GANG is clamped from 3 sides. All becos of overprojections that went wrong, they need immediate cash from somewhere someone to plug holes left right centre. investors pay? board of directors pay? staff pay? more bank loans? but will the banks approve them if there are still outstanding loans? next best target?..
              
              of course powerless TAXI DRIVERS pay la! so convenient and easy scrapgoats! scare them they will quietly pay, becos their agreements they started with is already unfair to them when they first sign inside! many things are left out, especially grey areas like decision channel, appeal channel and information channel. things that are clear cut advantage to company, the taxi drivers stupidly sign over. its like jackpot machine out of 10 times, 7 lose 3 win...MAXIMUM.
              
              the RED GANG Is clamped from 3 sides mostly becos of:
              
              a. those so many WISHs returning straight and in whole lot after contracts, they have to refund the security deposit. from there, to them, they lost a whole chunk of operating capital. then whats that operating capital for?..
              
              b. most of the operating capital was ALREADY burnt off on vehicle maintenance and daily operations, like staff and expenses and bills. costs went out of hand, way beyond projections. whoever did the projections and presented to the board or investors was either lying or neglient. so whats happening now, like blindly forfeiting deposit, happy shoot accident excess, demanding payment else laywer, all these is just simply a major coverup for that cockup!
              
              c. finally remember those whole bunch of CROWNs for scrap? still got some $XXXX final incentive have to be paid out to all those hirers rubbing their hands, some started beginning this year then all the way into next year, one by one lining up to convert metal into cash..where to find THAT GIANT POT OF MONEY!?
              
              
              
              "ACCIDENT CABBIES" :)
